00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:09,040
warm greetings everyone welcome and today's topic is

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,080
action it'll be action in relationship to com act compassion compassionate

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,720
action but for the beginning of this meditation I want to emphasize that the

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:27,880
action is a very important part of the Buddha teachings sometimes uh he was called

5
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:37,840
a a kada a uh that is he was uh a teacher of

6
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,280
action um

7
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:50,840
a and he has this wonderful statement that uh beings

8
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:56,120
are uh owners of their own Karma of the owners of their

9
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:01,760
action they are inheritors of their action

10
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:08,960
they the uh actions are their Source they or they originate in their

11
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,360
actions actions are are are they

12
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:20,759
relatives and actions are our refuge so they say that actions are our

13
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,320
refuge actions are our relatives it's like part of our family it's that intimate it's

14
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,439
close that actions are the source from which our life flows and

15
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:38,159
develops actions we inherit our actions uh we inherit the consequence of our

16
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:45,399
actions and uh we have to we own our actions where the consequences the

17
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:53,320
they're really our own to work with it's a powerful statement and uh and can be a

18
00:01:53,320 --> 00:02:00,520
little bit frightening to think that we are the owners of our actions and we inherit the consequence of our actions

19
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:06,640
because we know are we careful with what we do but that actions can be our

20
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,800
relatives our cherished Family action can be our refuge and our

21
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,040
protection and um and meditation in the there a long history in Buddhism of

22
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,200
meditation being considered a form of action since often meditation is

23
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:31,560
associated with sitting still laying still being still and there's a kind of sometimes a paiv in the instructions or

24
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:37,599
how people do it where we just sit and be available and open and present and

25
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:45,360
nonreactive just be rather than do um sometimes it lends itself to

26
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:52,440
reinforce an idea that we are the consumers of spirituality rather than

27
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,640
the producers of it that we are the victims of our life not the Agents of

28
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:03,239
our life and the teachings in the Buddha is that we are the agents we are the

29
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:10,440
initiators we are in our actions our life begins each time each day we wake up

30
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:17,840
each moment that we walk into um it's kind of a fresh beginning and then how

31
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:25,120
do we meet it what actions what activity do we contribute to it and so meditation

32
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,239
is an action where life begins to only see meditation as a place

33
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:37,879
to recover from the past recover and respond and deal with and with the past

34
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:44,120
if that's all we do we're missing an opportunity of kind of stepping into

35
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:51,319
this moment um with a particular kind of action

36
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:59,799
of care respect of an action of aware awareness

37
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:06,879
of Attunement of appreciation of aspiration that we step into it with a

38
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,200
certain fullness like that we count that we're important this is valuable what we're

39
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:19,639
doing here and so when we sit down to have a posture of

40
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:26,479
meditation whatever a posture that is sitting lying down standing walking

41
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:35,639
whatever works to adjust the posture in such a way that it's a posture of agency

42
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:44,440
a posture of kind of a certain kind of action and not a posture of only

43
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:52,600
relaxing not a posture of there isn't some kind of some kind of Engagement and

44
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:59,680
it could be a simple as um you know where we put our hands to put the hands

45
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,240
and maybe so they're together or so the hands

46
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:11,919
themselves are in a posture that expresses some

47
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:18,840
intentionality some here I am I'm going to do

48
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,520
this and to then gently close the

49
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,039
eyes and

50
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:47,639
to there's a way of stepping into this moment this time

51
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:53,840
here with a certain degree of agency certain degree of taking our place in

52
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:01,479
this world taking our place here and now showing up

53
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:11,800
that what we do and how we are is important to take a few long slow deep

54
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,680
breaths to assume your place here and

55
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:27,560
now and as you exhale to relax relaxing is a

56
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,880
doing and the balance between

57
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:39,960
the engagement of breathing in and the relaxing of breathing

58
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,560
out hopefully begins to blend

59
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:50,479
together so that the

60
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:04,479
breathing in and breathing out is an activity within which we

61
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:19,000
rest an activity in which there's a peacefulness and a

62
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,400
ease and letting your breathing return to

63
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
normal

64
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,720
and gently maybe

65
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:46,599
lovingly enter into the world of

66
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:55,280
breathing so the attention the action of in

67
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:06,479
aention is something we're producing not consuming we're offering

68
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:15,479
attention the action of attention in which we look for our

69
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:24,120
ease look for a way to do so peacefully gently

70
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
lovingly

71
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,039
remembering our

72
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,120
agency without any

73
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
urgency

74
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:20,920
calmly offering to yourself the action the

75
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:27,000
activity of being present and aware here and

76
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:35,240
now to breathing the body your feelings your

77
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:52,839
thoughts and discovering how to do so so that awareness is a

78
00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:02,680
refuge that the action of [Music] awareness is like a loving family

79
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,839
member that you

80

learn to let go of all unnecessary

93
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:10,800
actions all the extra things that we're involved involved with

94

and then as we come to the end of the sitting

118
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:41,640
to turn our attention outwards into the

119
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:50,559
world and engage in the action the mental action the heart

120
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:59,518
action of caring loving valuing respecting

121
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:06,080
this world that we share with other beings other

122
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:17,320
people the beings and life and people for whom our life would be not

123
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,919
possible without their

124
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:29,440
efforts their lives

125
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:40,000
and to engage in the action of thinking how wonderful it would be if all beings

126
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:47,919
could be happy and peaceful if all beings could be free of

127
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:56,399
Affliction hatred and anger and greed delusion

128
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:03,720
anxiety and and we can be the Agents of

129
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:08,960
change to expect that other people will change the

130
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:18,399
world is to give away our individual

131
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:23,039
capacity for making this world a better

132
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:32,360
place and rather than giving that away instead give the world your generosity

133
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:37,360
your care beginning with

134
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,960
your intention your wish for all people to be

135
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:49,399
well may all beings be

136
00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:54,559
happy may all beings be

137
00:29:54,559 --> 00:30:01,480
safe may all beings be peaceful may all

138
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:08,760
beings be free and may I may each of

139
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:13,720
us find ways to contribute to this

140
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:20,559
possibility may we act for the welfare and happiness of all beings

141
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,158
including our

142
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:38,029
own [Music]

143
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:44,480
[Music] thank

144
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,240
you

145
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:51,360
so hello and welcome to this fifth talk on the joy of

146
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:57,760
compassion and today is the fifth aspect element that we contribute to

147
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:03,159
create a healthy beneficial compassion for this for ourselves and the world and

148
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:08,960
that that is action and usually compassion is very closely associated

149
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:16,200
with action the action of care the action of doing something to alleviate the difficulties the challenges the

150
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:23,760
suffering of others or ourselves but to have the joy of it to

151
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:29,399
enjoy the activity of compassion is so it's sometimes in short

152
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:36,760
supply sometimes um uh we don't consider that that activity of compassion this

153
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:42,760
whether it's a simple activity of being a listener for someone or

154
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:48,200
offering well-wishing for someone or whether it's a big thing that we do and

155
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:54,120
maybe it takes a long time to really care and tend to someone who's sick or

156
00:32:54,120 --> 00:33:02,840
something that we don't often think about looking at looking at the activity that we're doing is a source of joy as

157
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:11,919
something that will generate a sense of wellbeing or a likeness or that somehow we feel kind of more at ease in doing

158
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:17,279
it sometimes the reason for that is that the the need for compassion that what

159
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:24,840
stimulates it Catalyst for it is so the suffering is so great it's so

160
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:31,159
challenging that it's so there's so much Injustice there's so much um oppression

161
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:37,480
there's so much poverty there's so much suffering there's so much unfairness that we're trying to care for and

162
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:43,600
support people who are experiencing these things and we could feel our own despair

163
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:51,919
our own anger our own sense of urgency our own sense of of overwhelm all kinds of things come along and so they get

164
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:57,519
swept those feelings kind of uh uh influence the way in which we do

165
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:05,960
the action the action these those feelings come along with the action but to trust the action like

166
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:12,520
think of it almost stepping into a new uh phase a new dimension almost

167
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:18,280
where yes we can have these feelings for sure but the action we step into is like

168
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:27,440
stepping into a um new activity a new room a new world in doing the action not

169
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:34,800
to deny what we're feeling but to not be held in check by it not be unduly caught

170
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:42,599
in it and and feel like okay now that I'm prepared to offer my care my

171
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:48,878
Compassionate Care for some situation this is what's important this

172
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:55,440
is what's valuable I've prepared myself well I've been I've I've brought a lot

173
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:03,119
of awareness to myself into the situation studied it got to know it I've become attuned to it I'm in harmony with

174
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:08,760
it I'm not stressed around it or not uh aversive to it or

175
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:14,800
not um you know indifferent to it or not really connected to it I'm connected and

176
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:21,839
I'm at ease I'm in Harmony in a certain kind of way with this I'm attuned to what's happening I understand the others

177
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:27,960
really well enough it's not just my projection and my my um my

178
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:34,920
preoccupations which are driving me and um there's an

179
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:41,640
appreciation of the people I'm going to support it's not only the horror or the

180
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:47,119
distress that I feel around how terrible it is that's taken the time to really

181
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:52,960
respect these people and what is respect what is appreciation here uh what is

182
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:59,920
valuing this people whatever being that there at least we're equal we're we're

183
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:06,760
I'm not there to help or to fix I'm there to serve their welfare to

184
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:14,319
support and then there is an aspiration which is a beautiful part of a human being so those are the foundations and

185
00:36:14,319 --> 00:36:20,440
then when we get ready to act to enter into the action as if the quality the

186
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:26,960
the way in which we Act is part of the message that uh we act in such a way way

187
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:33,160
that people appreciate the activity the ease the calm the generosity the love

188
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:38,640
the well-being uh when they don't we don't they don't feel our actions as being

189
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:45,520
like we're it's a heavy burden we're carrying or we're stressed we're pushing

190
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:51,920
or but they feel something very different and people can be nourished by

191
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:57,079
the ease the well-being by which we do things and they can be troubled when

192
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:04,680
we're troubled so to engage in the action not to look for the joy in the

193
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:11,839
action whereas you can look for the joy and awareness or Attunement or appreciation or an aspiration but with

194
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:18,079
action not to look for it but rather to generate it to step into the action and

195
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:23,480
try to find a way you do it with Grace with ease with peace with a nice way of

196
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:30,119
doing it don't don't have a sense of urgency unless there's a uh you know

197
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:35,400
sometimes we have to act quickly but we don't have to hurry

198
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:42,680
there's a difference between quickness and hurrying I think of hurrying we're losing ourselves to do things fast we

199
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:50,680
don't have to lose ourselves we can stay present to uh do do it in a way that uh

200
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:59,599
it's a enjoyable way of doing it we enjoy doing this we like it and uh and

201
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:04,720
uh is it okay to do this do we have permission to do it the proposal is that

202
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:12,119
it actually makes the compassion richer more valuable for the world and for ourselves it helps make the compassion

203
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:17,319
sustainable over time it helps us to appreciate it's really good to be

204
00:38:17,319 --> 00:38:23,200
compassionate I enjoy it I want to do it there's more value in it than just how

205
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:34,200
what we're how we're helping people it's also value for me I feel better I feel lighter from doing it and so when we act

206
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:41,599
compassionately to as I said not just just to be the um don't look for the

207
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:48,720
joy act in a way that brings Joy or brings enjoyment brings lightness brings

208
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:56,760
ease and um and then as I've said it's sustainable over time and so much better

209
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:02,440
more comes out of it one of the things that comes out of it is that the if

210
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:09,480
you're doing something that in contact with someone so you're in touch with them uh I think that the relationship

211
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:14,599
becomes Richer there there's a spark there's a love there's a joy there's a

212
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:20,560
sense of Rapport between you know that's really nice some sometimes done I've

213
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:25,640
done compassionate actions for something and I was so dutiful in how I did it and

214
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:31,560
a matter of fact that did it that I didn't actually take the time to have a

215
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:37,839
rapport with the person I was doing with and I've done at times where I done things in a different way not out of

216
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:42,880
Duty not out of an urgency but took my time to do it in a respectful kind

217
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:49,560
enjoyable way and I could feel that the report then uh grew or developed or uh

218
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:54,760
became more wonderful with the people that I was

219
00:39:54,760 --> 00:40:00,760
supporting so to to um so

220
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:07,880
to um care for those that we love care for those who suffer in a way

221
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:13,480
that they don't feel that we're doing working so hard that they're not

222
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:21,040
obligated to repay us or that they feel kind of um indebted because it was so

223
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:26,400
hard for us and heavy and difficult to offer ourselves with ease and fre

224
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:32,760
freedom and joy and to offer ourselves in that kind of way even with our love

225
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:40,160
for people who are going through some of the most difficult times this world is a challenging place

226
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:46,640
to live human beings are challenged life is difficult and one of the things that can

227
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:54,680
support it is that we care for each other care for each other to with respect with kindness with ability to

228
00:40:54,680 --> 00:41:01,560
listen with with um appreciation um it's a beautiful thing

229
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:07,560
it's important thing to do and may this practice that we do be a support for

230
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:13,240
us to um bring our compassion and our care

231
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:21,000
into the world I think it's a natural outgrowth of mindfulness

232
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:27,440
practice because as we let go of all the re all the blocks all the the barriers

233
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:33,440
all the defensiveness all the preoccupations we're left with a

234
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:41,000
sensitive Caring Heart and what else would we do but care for this

235
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,800
world so thank you very much and um so

236
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:53,000
probably now completed this series on compassion and I'll start a new series

237
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,520

238
