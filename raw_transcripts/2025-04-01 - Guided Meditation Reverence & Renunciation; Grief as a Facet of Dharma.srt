1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:12,759
okay so uh so welcome folks nice to uh see uh see your

2
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:23,400
names and um yeah let's uh let's practice together

3
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,879
so finding your

4
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:15,960
posture whatever posture it is a sense of um

5
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,798
Your uh heart being open to the

6
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:41,799
world sense of uh sanctity and uh relaxation

7
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,680
we know we're doing something maybe we say

8
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:20,280
sacred and ordinary and we can relax amidst it

9
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,480
just breathing into your

10
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,879
belly maybe a slightly fuller

11
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:36,360
Slower breath than you've taken today

12
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:57,120
meditation can feel old hat or familiar especially if you've practiced for years

13
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:05,919
or decades but we ought not forget that we're

14
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,400
uh stepping into something

15
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:21,759
sacred that we're connected by our breath and our

16
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,840
sincerity to a 2600 year [Music]

17
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,360
lineage wisdom

18
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:59,320
compassion and so the thought uh just little old me meditating in my

19
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,320
home

20
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,198
online now that's not the end of the

21
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,360
story we uh take our seat and remember

22
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:28,720
the lineage all the shoulders we stand

23
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:40,000
upon all that we owe to those who will come after

24
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:48,120
us and we breathe with that

25
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,480
it's a practice of uh reverence also

26
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:12,959
renunciation in other words what is u skillful to put

27
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:30,399
down renunciation is not animated sponsored by

28
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:36,560
uh a version

29
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:45,920
moralism not sponsored by the egoic processes but uh a simple

30
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:53,160
recognition this can be put down

31
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,440
perhaps we renounce

32
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:30,200
the multitasking of our mind

33
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:40,040
or we renounce uh some measure of worry

34
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,040
other grasping

35
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,320
we renounce

36
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:01,519
the false promises that clinging

37
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:21,360
makes we renounce the urge to make story

38
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,079
out of this moment

39
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,720
we have sense contact and the

40
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,199
proliferation largely a function of the lack of

41
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:09,600
equinimity feels like I must tell some story maybe just a sentence about

42
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,480
this sense

43
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:28,240
contact in amidst the sanctity of our practice we renounce not forever but for right

44
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,240
now

45
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:49,399
we renounce knowing that uh may

46
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:53,200
rearise just moments

47
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:12,839
later we renounce uh not uh like

48
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:19,959
holding 50 pingpong balls underwater at the same time

49
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,639
but opening the fist and putting something down on the

50
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:50,079
ground in this way we become more intimate with uh our breathing

51
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:02,320
it always feels like we're preparing for the rest of our

52
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:09,200
life but our life never arrives

53
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,400
yes and so

54
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:35,919
we practice um putting all of our hope into this

55
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,559
moment

56
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,399
clinging uh complicates

57
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:29,039
everything turns me into a spy and a crook conniving

58
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,360
scheming letting go

59
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:13,240
simplifies and samadei is the momentary

60
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,360
Resolution of all ambivalence

61
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,299
[Music]

62
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,600
okay good to uh sit with

63
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:34,000
you so every

64
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:43,320
um excuse me every uh every dharma

65
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:49,720
teaching is a kind of footnote on some other dharma

66
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:56,240
teaching uh in other words no no teaching is the last word

67
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:04,399
one teaching is never enough and the more I practice the more I find

68
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:15,278
that the path is found in kind of dynamic tension between two

69
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:23,600
teachings and uh so yesterday humor

70
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:30,200
playfulness just indispensable

71
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:36,360
actually uh and today

72
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:40,240
grief also

73
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:49,720
indispensable and so the the gap between

74
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:55,960
uh the freedom we know is possible and the the

75
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:03,200
unimaginable vastness of suffering that gap is filled

76
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:12,279
with uh with grief and for all the ways in which

77
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:19,840
um [Music] no consolation exists for the agony of

78
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:25,840
this realm grief

79
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:35,440
exists the dharma is said to meet the second arrow but what meets the

80
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:45,279
first i would say there's some measure of grief in the first

81
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:51,159
arrow that's not exactly a consolation for

82
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:56,720
it but it means there's something left over

83
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,960
even when the dharma is practiced exquisitly

84
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:09,320
and so I I feel like grief is a kind of irreducible element of dharma

85
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:15,519
life uh in other words there there is no cure for

86
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:22,480
love lar Cohen uh said uh I don't consider myself a

87
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:31,840
pessimist i think of a pessimist as someone who's waiting for it to rain and I feel soaked to the skin

88
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:38,080
if you're awake you're soaked to the

89
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:46,799
skin the the Buddha witnessed aging sickness death

90
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:53,720
and this anticipatory grief launched his spiritual

91
00:33:53,720 --> 00:34:03,679
quest and the inevitability of loss for many many of us is um a profound engine

92
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:09,679
for dharma motivation it's said to be one of the thoughts that turns the mind

93
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:18,638
to the dumb dharma and the story of the the the Buddha as I

94
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:24,638
understand it is that his mother died around the time of his birth you know

95
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:31,679
the most primal primal form of longing and

96
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:38,800
grief and generally the the the Buddha wanted to be free from grief beyond

97
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:48,240
grief sorrow and lamentation it's the the refrain um but then again when Sar put uh and uh

98
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:55,679
Mgalana died the Buddha's in this hall with 500 monastics and said uh you know

99
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,320
without them here feels this hall feels

100
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:06,000
empty and then to my mind kind of

101
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,440
unfortunately the suta goes on to say but the Buddha did not un did not

102
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:17,720
suffer you know and it's

103
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:24,119
not maybe controversial and don't know about you but um

104
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:29,839
uh yeah I want I want my Buddha to uh to

105
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:36,119
grieve And the notion like if we only

106
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:42,599
understood impermanence anicha more completely we wouldn't

107
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:51,240
suffer i don't know you know understanding a niche does

108
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:57,839
not even understanding it very deeply I do not feel like implies the absence of

109
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:07,040
grief and this kind of explaining away of

110
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:15,440
grief may be um a a a kind of example of uh what um

111
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:24,280
the primatologist France the wall called um anthropod denial the implicit denial that we

112
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:34,320
humans are animals false and so I I don't um place grief in

113
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,359
the cluster of afflictive emotions there are many painful emotions I could

114
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:44,320
imagine being free

115
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:50,640
from one of them and yeah we can get stuck in it

116
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:56,440
grief can become a kind of placeholder for more

117
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:03,119
amorphous pain you know it's like grief becomes the explanatory mechanism for

118
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:10,240
everything wrong in our mind in our heart in our life that's not the species of grief I'm

119
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:18,800
talking about sometimes it's true where we must act in disobedience to the

120
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:26,960
grief but um generally speaking I I feel like it's it's onward leaving leading uh

121
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:32,760
in the sense of grieving consciously

122
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:37,440
sensitively receptively

123
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:45,480
listening it's hard to look at the world even for

124
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:51,000
all the progress our species has made over

125
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:57,320
centuries it's hard to look at the world and see the carnival of greed and

126
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:03,200
delusion and not feel some measure of grief

127
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:09,560
sense of powerlessness in the kind of face of the

128
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:18,000
the you know and so I I associate grief with

129
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:26,040
some of our our best qualities of sensitivity and love and

130
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:32,560
morality and I I don't I it's hard to imagine what our sila ethical conduct

131
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:39,320
what our sila would look like without grief without being informed by grief

132
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:46,078
loss is part of what makes the sanctity of life

133
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:56,520
intelligible and grief is a trope in our practice even when we haven't lost

134
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:03,119
something for many not for all but for many you know just as children have

135
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:08,480
growing pains or something maybe say like "Oh my you know an 8-year-old says

136
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:15,880
their leg hurts at night or something like that." Growing pains dharma

137
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:24,079
practice it's growing pains too and the growing pains of dharma

138
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:31,599
often taste like grief how does it actually feel to change in

139
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:39,119
the trenches of change how does it feel to grow to deepen our compassion to to

140
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:45,520
release to let go right release feels great right once we've put

141
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:50,640
something down but the process of opening the clenched

142
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,800
fist of grasping that process of letting go

143
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:01,280
often is inflected with a sense of

144
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:09,320
grieving how does it feel to mature ethically to have our heart expand to

145
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:16,359
include more beings to expand over space and over

146
00:40:16,359 --> 00:40:22,640
time to beings not yet born how does this feel often it entails

147
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:28,280
a measure of grief the Buddha said

148
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:35,760
"Comprehend duka comprehend suffering." Sometimes that will hurt that process of

149
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:43,760
comprehending of really really opening one's heart to the first noble

150
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:52,960
truth but that truth uh enobles us even as we grieve

151
00:40:53,480 --> 00:41:01,440
it and that enobling quality of grieving the first noble truth that goes on for a

152
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:07,400
long time i don't even know if I understand duka

153
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:18,480
some research on um uh from Shelley Taylor and some of her

154
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:25,040
her colleagues and on positive illusions you know and she she writes like self a

155
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:30,079
grandizing self-perceptions an illusion of control

156
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:36,000
and unrealistic optimism are widespread in normal human thought these ill quote

157
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,079
illusions foster the criteria normally associated with mental health called it

158
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:49,480
positive illusions right it said that these illusions bolster and

159
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:58,680
stabilize our sense of self and um I do get the comfort of those kind of

160
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:04,960
illusions um and certainly I'm not commending that we live every moment in

161
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:11,480
death contemplation but there's a subtle agitation in that

162
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:17,359
selfdeception in the grandiosity in the fantasies of control the sense that

163
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:23,760
everything goes on and when some part of us knows we're

164
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:30,200
fooling ourselves we can't settle and so the dharma is longing

165
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:38,520
for truth the chickens come home to roost and if we've not grieved the

166
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:44,880
homelessness of ego the ungovernability of existence the

167
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:52,560
end of all things we've not grieved that we will be shattered when we

168
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,079
discover that Buddha was not

169
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:06,560
joking and the expansion of our heart is the circle of empathy grows and we

170
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:14,079
evolve as moral creatures our sila evolves that that growth you know the

171
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:21,760
growth of waking up to more to wake up is to wake up to more to moralize more

172
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:30,240
in the sense of more and more things matter morally that did not

173
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:36,319
matter that entails a measure of

174
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:48,400
grieving and um this is not the grief of stagnation

175
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:55,119
james Ball once said um people can cry much easier than they can

176
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:00,960
change not wallowing in stagnant tears

177
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:08,680
this is a process by which uh something else becomes

178
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:13,760
love grief is completely pregnant with

179
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:22,040
bodhicitta pemma children said awakened

180
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:29,440
heart completely pregnant this is the path of purification where

181
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:36,200
we're transmuting that which is not wisdom and not love into wisdom and

182
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:43,280
