1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:06,160
so good day to everyone

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:13,519
here we are together and from all over and

3
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:20,960
uh gathering ourselves for this period of meditation

4
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:30,000
and this topic they one of the subjects is practicing with

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,600
mental activity which has been my most common

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:42,480
translation for sankara sometimes translates mental

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,120
formations and

8
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,680
so say this about it is that these mental activities that we have

9
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:06,000
as we practice as we settle in meditation as we begin to let go of attachments and

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,680
clinging the direction the mind is going is to becoming beautiful

11
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:18,080
to have a beautiful mind and that the feeling that not just a feeling the

12
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,799
experience or the quality of physical calmness that happens when the body relaxes

13
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:31,920
and the quality of mental relaxation tranquility that comes as the mental activities calm down

14
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,840
it's referred to in the buddhist tradition as beautiful as beautiful qualities of

15
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:46,640
mind and that many of these uh factors of mine that start coming into play

16
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:54,079
that of faith and and engagement with the practice attention

17
00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:00,399
wisdom mindfulness samadhi all these things they're they're

18
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:07,200
considered uh beautiful qualities of the mind and so

19
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,760
we are we one of the orientations for meditation one of the

20
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:20,959
things to kind of kind of be considering is how do you practice how do you do the

21
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:28,080
activity of meditation so it itself has some quality of beauty

22
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:35,280
or maybe another word is harmony i love the hopi indian the indigenous

23
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,519
people of new mexico the i love their expression of walking

24
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,959
in beauty so what would it mean to engage the mind

25
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,239
in beauty and sometimes there's such a strong orientation towards

26
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:58,000
avoiding which what is not beautiful or it's difficult or painful or

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,920
there can be a lot of criticism in the mind self-criticism and a lot of judgments that whatever the

28
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,599
mind is doing wondering often thought is somehow wrong or

29
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:16,400
worse and maybe so but but what we do how we

30
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,319
show up to be mindful to be present to be engaged with the breathing how

31
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:29,440
would you do it if you did it in a beautiful way or in a harmonious way

32
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,599
because that's the direction that this practice is going and especially with this calming of

33
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:41,680
mental formations calming of the mental activities we're feeling our way into a place of

34
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:48,640
harmony or beauty of peace of clarity of lightness

35
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:56,000
of uh sometimes the ancient tradition talks about a kind of a clean mind a cleansed

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,080
mind so for this sitting today maybe you can um

37
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:12,640
you can um orient yourself a little bit with um

38
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:18,479
what would it be like to sit here in beauty not because you're looking for it it

39
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,759
might be there it might be here but also because you engage

40
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,880
in the practice that way that the very way in which you are present

41
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:36,000
the way very way in which you are mindful is in harmony or is in beauty what would

42
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,880
that look like and i know it might be a stretch or it might be you might not have an easy reference for

43
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,000
this but i would suggest that you imagine you do

44
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,440
imagine yourself in this way and if so

45
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,120
to assume a meditation posture and even here as we get into as we take

46
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,000
the posture how would you do it

47
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:14,160
as if the activity of assuming your posture meditation posture was itself a movement

48
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,720
in beauty maybe in gracefulness

49
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:28,639
and maybe gracefully kind of rocking forward and back maybe slowly

50
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:37,600
maybe not sideways and then slowing down and finding

51
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,720
a balanced posture most balanced for what's available to

52
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:53,520
you with all the different challenges you might have and so your your posture itself

53
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,199
begins to feel like a small stepping stone to beauty

54
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,000
to harmony

55
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,840
and then

56
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:20,000
softly peacefully closing your eyes

57
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,960
and then what would it be like if you approached your breathing with

58
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:34,800
trust with care

59
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,319
with relaxation with some quality or feeling of

60
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,680
approaching your breathing

61
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,120
in a harmonious way or in a beautiful way

62
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,840
what was your attention what would attending to your breathing

63
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:08,400
be if you were attending in a beautiful harmonious way

64
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:22,800
and perhaps it could be that you invite your body

65
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,160
to gently breathe more fully

66
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:35,520
expanding the chest expanding the belly as you breathe in

67
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,599
maybe three quarters full so you're not straining

68
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,800
and perhaps allowing for a longer

69
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:59,840
peaceful exhale as far as it's useful to exhale

70
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:17,280
so and then to as you exhale

71
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:26,720
to relax the body to calm the bodily activity of tension

72
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:41,839
holding contraction in the body releasing it

73
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,160
and letting your breathing return to

74
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:41,440
normal and then as you exhale

75
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:48,160
to also relax and soften the thinking mind

76
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,200
if the if you can recognize any tension or holding

77
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,120
contraction or hardness

78
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:07,680
agitation or forcefulness associated with breathing

79
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:19,839
as you exhale relax the mind

80
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,320
and if you can't relax it that's okay

81
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:36,399
perhaps you can recognize that awareness attention to the tense

82
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:43,279
mind is larger distinct and different than

83
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:49,120
the mind itself the activity and then hold

84
00:10:49,120 --> 00:11:01,839
the tense mind in the beauty of open awareness

85
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:38,959
and then entering into the body breathing breathing naturally and easily

86
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,200
with a very light touch not trying too much

87
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:53,200
seeing if you can attend to breathing in a way that feels harmonious even

88
00:11:53,200 --> 00:12:00,480
beautiful with its care its tenderness its openness

89
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,759
its willingness

90
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,040
perhaps with its feeling of respect for breathing

91
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,079
a reverence

92
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:25,839
for being here

93
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:34,240
and perhaps there's something in the breathing itself

94
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:40,720
which feels harmonious or beautiful pleasant

95
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,839
and to sit here

96
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:04,320
present for your breathing while attuned to

97
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:12,480
that which is harmonious or beautiful here and now no matter how small it

98
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:21,839
might be

99
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:30,720
if possible relaxing the mental activity of anxiety

100
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:41,240
mental activity of

101
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:48,560
discouragement or resentment

102
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,839
letting those settle and recede to the background

103
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,399
and in the foreground as you're sitting here

104
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,920
sitting meditating in beauty

105
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:20,720
some of them which might be whatever feeling of pleasure

106
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:27,279
well-being joy or happiness

107
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:37,839
that might be here right now breathing with it breathing through it

108
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:57,840
as you breathe is there any little place inside of

109
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:05,039
tranquility calmness peacefulness

110
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:17,440
a calmness of body calmness of mind

111
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,158
breathe with that breathe through it

112
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:33,600
gently allowing that calmness tranquility to spread and grow

113
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:44,159
so that its influence perhaps a beautiful influence

114
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:50,400
can begin to move through you breathing in and

115
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:59,840
breathing out

116
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,840
so

117
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,080
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

118
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:52,720
looking inside of yourself to see if there's any

119
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:03,120
shift inside in the course this meditation

120
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:12,000
are you a little more settled if not more settled are you more

121
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,840
aware a heightened awareness of how you are

122
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:31,840
both the subtleness and the heightened awareness can both be seen as something beautiful

123
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:41,200
or are you more open more peaceful more

124
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:49,679
more sense of well-being have you learned something about your

125
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:59,840
own capacity to attend beautifully harmoniously

126
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:08,640
in whatever sense you have of an inner beauty or harmony or well-being

127
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:17,120
bring to mind some people that you know and imagine that they too have the same

128
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:22,000
capacity they have the potential for this

129
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,080
and that more than worldly success

130
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:39,360
that to experience this inner harmony this inner peace or beauty is one of the great potentials

131
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:45,760
they have a potential which is not dependent so

132
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,360
much on what happens in the world

133
00:29:53,120 --> 00:30:00,799
and perhaps you can very gently lovingly harmoniously

134
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:08,080
have the wish that in fact they could feel this inner

135
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,520
well-being and harmony

136
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,519
that they might know their beauty

137
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:26,640
and beyond the people you know even the people you don't know and the

138
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,799
people who are a challenge for you

139
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:38,480
how wonderful would be if they could stay closely attuned aligned with their own inner

140
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:46,480
harmony and beauty their own potential for an inner

141
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:55,679
well-being that is so ethical in nature because it doesn't depend on

142
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:05,840
getting anything or making anything happen in the world

143
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,640
may it be that all beings

144
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:20,320
touch into their capacity for happiness may all beings

145
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,440
experience safety within

146
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:33,840
peacefulness within

147
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:44,320
a full inner freedom the heart set free at ease

148
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:52,480
this beautiful heart that we all share may all beings

149
00:31:53,039 --> 00:32:01,840
be happy

150
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:23,919
so the topic for this week is uh what

151
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:35,039
in pali is called um chitta sankara c-i-t-t-a

152
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:41,940
s-a-n-k-h-a-r-a and uh it's often translated as mental

153
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:46,960
[Music] formations sometimes mental dispositions

154
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,559
sometimes mental constructs for this week i kind of been using the

155
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:58,240
expression mental activities and uh it's those activities of the mind

156
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:05,360
which are planning creating uh uh imagining actively thinking about

157
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:13,279
things so a simple perception of uh something uh seeing a wall across the

158
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:21,039
hall the room here that wouldn't necessarily be called an activity that's just it is an activity but it's

159
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:29,120
not a one of the formations or constructions that we make and what's fascinating the number

160
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:34,799
of things that are fascinating about this idea of mental formations mental constructions

161
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:41,039
sankaras and um is that um one is that

162
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:46,799
um many things that we take to be kind of inherent or just the way things

163
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:53,600
are turn out to be an activity of the mind and so to give you one example boredom

164
00:33:53,600 --> 00:34:01,120
when we're bored it can feel like just the thing that we're doing is boring just this event the situation is boring it is

165
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:08,320
boring but in fact it's the mind's activity that creates the feeling the sense of boredom

166
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:14,320
it's a kind of maybe even a subliminal judgment evaluation

167
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:20,638
it's holding oneself apart from experience it's uh it can be a resistance

168
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:27,118
it can be a loss of intimacy with experience uh and so there's all these things going

169
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:32,158
on in the mind that construct that activate this

170
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:37,679
feeling the idea of boredom and the idea that we're constructing it where it's an where

171
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:44,240
we're kind of forming it making it in the mind uh gives us a very different orientation

172
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:50,398
to boredom than if the situation is boredom because the situation is boring the situation is

173
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:57,440
to blame and so we better just get away or change it but if we're responsible because it's an

174
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,720
activity of the mind then we can practice with it and that's one of the things we learn through

175
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:09,280
meditation is how to practice with these mental formations these mental activities so that we're not caught in

176
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:15,599
them and not pulled around by the nose by them but we learn how to settle them or

177
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:20,640
become more expensive of them or freer of them free of them even when they're there

178
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:27,119
so with boredom one would turn around the attention 180 degrees from the

179
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:32,800
situation that's boring whatever it might be it's internal external and have the attention

180
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:40,320
really look at the boredom itself and look it right in the eye and say boredom i see you and feel it

181
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:46,880
and be with it and experience it and to learn how to kind of uh dissipate

182
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:52,640
the boredom because we really see it clearly is very empowering

183
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:58,720
because it shows us that we don't have to be the victim of our own mental activities and that's

184
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:04,720
one of the great good news of this buddhist teaching is that so much of our suffering

185
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:11,040
has a relationship to the activity of our mind and and whereas we can't necessarily

186
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:17,440
change always the situation in the world we can we have some care and attention to

187
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:24,839
shifting how the mind is constructing these ideas and concepts and even constructing ideas of self that we

188
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:30,480
have so it's a phenomenally good news if we have the mindfulness and attention

189
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,839
stability to really see how this works and um

190
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:43,599
and so mental activities to really see it that way and learning to tranquilize it calm them relax them

191
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:48,640
and uh now this tranquil mind is considered in the buddhist tradition

192
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:54,320
to be a beautiful quality so tranquilizing the mind is not just becoming numb

193
00:36:54,320 --> 00:37:01,359
not just it's not becoming numb at all it's not becoming kind of less than it actually begins tapping into

194
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:09,440
something that's really wondrous amazing about what's available inside that can

195
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:18,880
arise with this idea of a mind that's very tranquil clean transparent smooth easy

196
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,000
and and this points to uh one of the problems one of the in the

197
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,680
english language translating the word sankara as formations or even

198
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:36,320
other activities because uh some of those are just uninspired mental formations it's like what is that

199
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:42,160
and it's kind of uninspired translation mental activities maybe means a little bit more but i don't think it has too

200
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:48,240
much inspiration value in it i believe that in the in the indian context ancient indian

201
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:56,800
context the word sankara that we're translating as formations had very positive associations

202
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:02,560
and and one of the early indian associations was it's a word that was used in the

203
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:08,000
pre-buddhist brahmanical traditions to describe sacred rituals

204
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:14,800
and in fact sankhara sometimes is it means to make something sacred

205
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:22,640
and at least that's what the dictionary definition sometimes has and and so this idea of

206
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:27,920
of something sacred uh a ritual which is uh maybe for some people

207
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:35,680
very heartwarming and a deep connection has a very different idea than um than just you know mental

208
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:41,520
activities because this inner this mental activities of the mind

209
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:46,720
it um it's also it's it's a it's the quality of the mind that makes things

210
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:52,320
and prepares things or constructs kind of our sense of self and universe and ideas and

211
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:58,560
all that but as that gets quieter that movement of activity mental activities

212
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:05,119
can have a quality of sacredness reverence wonder but also my favorite

213
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:10,160
word is beauty which is a translation of a word in pali

214
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:16,720
kaliana that is often translated as good and one of the places where it's

215
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,920
translated as good is in discussions about karma karma

216
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:28,320
means action and the primary action that we're dealing with in meditation is the mental action so

217
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,920
the mental karma and um and sometimes it's translated

218
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:39,040
that there's three kinds of there's two kinds of karma there's good karma and

219
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:46,960
bad karma and but the word for good is kaliana which its primary meaning

220
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:53,359
is beautiful and you get a very different feeling about actions if you refer to them as being

221
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:59,359
either beautiful or not beautiful and and so this idea that

222
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:04,400
we can have the potential in the mind or having the mental activity become

223
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:10,960
beautiful has is much more inspiring than simply calming the mental formations or being

224
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:17,359
are experiencing the mental formations so the mental formations the the seventh

225
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:25,119
step of anapanasati breathing in experiencing the mental formations mental activity

226
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:31,359
breathing out experiencing mental activity happens after

227
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:36,960
experiencing some modicum of joy well-being and happiness and meditation

228
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:43,520
and that's important to remember that all these things are situationals contextual these steps of meditation

229
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,720
and we're not we're not supposed to be in a hurry to get past it and if you hear instructions that you're

230
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:54,480
not there yet just take it in and and file it away for the future

231
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:59,680
no need to feel bad that you're not there we're all going to be cycling through

232
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:05,680
these 8 16 steps and be at different stages of different days different minutes different weeks

233
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:11,280
because of what's happening in our life and all kinds of situations so the 16 steps are always

234
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,560
um you know we're some it's kind of good to think that we're always beginning in step one

235
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:22,720
and not be in a hurry not feel like you have to always be following this these steps that i'm

236
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:28,880
going through i'm going through it linearly but the trap of that is assumed that you're

237
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:35,440
supposed to be right coming along and i'm trying my best to kind of make it come alive for you but

238
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:42,000
i've got to trust where you are and that trusting where you are is part of the beauty that we're

239
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,200
developing in this practice that trust and trust appreciation

240
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:52,560
reverence care love for oneself that i can just be where i am

241
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:57,599
and practice there and trust that this process will unfold this anapanasati

242
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:02,960
process is a natural process in its own way will unfold for you

243
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:10,880
no need to be in a rush or hurry through it and so this trust is part of the beauty of the mind and so

244
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:18,880
rather than seeing mental activity mental formations as neutral uninspired kind of you know

245
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:24,560
just stuff in the mind we're touching into a capacity of the mind

246
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:32,160
to be beautiful to be wondrous to be something that maybe borders on or

247
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:38,480
feels sacred and this is the great value of this practice is to really

248
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:45,839
discover a rich wondrous beautiful inner life that really can

249
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:51,920
inform how we live in the world i'd like to think that as we discover

250
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:57,680
this wondrous inner life we we get turned inside out and what was

251
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:05,599
inside is no longer inside but something that that we share with the world around us

252
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:12,960
so mental formations so as we continue next week maybe you'll keep

253
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:20,880
this in mind that uh we're working with a capacity we have for inner beauty

254
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:27,839
and inner something that's wondrous that lives in us for sure uh even though

255
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:33,040
some of your mental activities that you're living by and that kind of are you're caught in

256
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:41,599
the grip of and you don't even know you're in the grip of some of these mental activities um might be standing in the way for now

257
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:47,599
of seeing how wondrous it is on the inside for you the beauty that you have

258
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:55,838
so thank you for today and i look forward to continuing next week
