1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:07,259
okay so why don't we go ahead and start

2
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:15,179
folks can continue to join us as they do and to settle in for meditation finding

3
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:22,619
your posture finding your place kind of orienting toward

4
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:29,820
doing this together so gently closing the eyes

5
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,980
[Music] feeling into the body and the

6
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,160
sitting posture or whatever posture you're in

7
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:49,200
some of these preliminary things sound very simple and you know

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:57,239
like maybe we could skip them after we've done them a few times but I find it so helpful to just begin with

9
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:03,539
feeling the body sensing into the touch points where

10
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:11,040
you're sitting feeling the stability the groundedness

11
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,020
in the place where you're sitting

12
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,880
and finding some balance in the body so it takes very little effort

13
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:29,939
to be sitting upright or lying in the position you're in

14
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,820
we don't want to be using a lot of muscles to do that

15
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:41,880
see if the bones can just be aligned

16
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,798
so that they are supporting you

17
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:01,280
sensing the straightness of the spine not in a rigid way

18
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:09,060
naturally has a few curves but there's a sense of uprightness

19
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:15,500
alignment and then the rest of the body can relax

20
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,819
around that uprightness so the shoulders soften

21
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:29,099
drop head floats on the spine

22
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:34,500
in the arms and legs can just feel like they're floating

23
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,319
the way the fronds of a sea plant float

24
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:54,739
softening the eyes and the eye sockets

25
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,360
the jaw

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,319
and softening whatever it's possible to soften in the heart area in the belly

27
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:16,519
in the back

28
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,420
just inviting some ease

29
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,840
letting the arms and legs be natural

30
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,620
soft

31
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:50,659
and bringing up the quality of mindfulness

32
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,659
mindfulness as the sense of being right in the present

33
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:03,420
moment connected to what's here

34
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:10,459
in a simple way in a non-judgmental way

35
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:19,739
just knowing this so sensing how that feels in the mind

36
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:23,060
to have mindfulness

37
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,600
and connecting that mindfulness in particular to the sensations of the

38
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,180
bread and we can start with the physical

39
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:58,400
breath the actual sense of air coming in going out

40
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,919
maybe we can actually feel the air as it enters the nostrils

41
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:08,780
or touches the upper lip

42
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:16,160
and there's an expansion of the chest or the belly

43
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:26,759
maybe we only feel that through the shift of the clothing on the skin but there's some indication of expansion

44
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:32,479
it's a whole series of emotions throughout the Torso

45
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,860
we don't need to make it do anything we just feel how it actually is right

46
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,038
now

47
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,100
I can also sense the breath as more of an energetic phenomenon

48
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:27,300
a more subtle flow that can extend well outside of the lung

49
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,419
area you know maybe we can feel breath energy

50
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:37,039
blowing into the legs and the arms

51
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:45,439
throughout the whole of the back or even up into the head

52
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:58,620
as you breathe is this is there this more subtle verb

53
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,400
energy

54
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:16,940
so this is one aspect of the air element s the breath energy

55
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:23,940
and it's also the quality of motion in the body

56
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:30,620
movement and flow are part of our experience of the material world

57
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:39,259
the air element is this experiential quality it's not a literal substance

58
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:46,740
so resting with this breath

59
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:53,720
flowing for a few minutes energetic error element

60
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:06,360
there is the most subtle of the four main material elements

61
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:13,560
so we may find that tuning into it naturally draws the line

62
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,500
down to a more tranquil state

63
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:31,560
can actually be used to quiet the mind a bit

64
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:37,880
tuning into the subtle energetic experience of the body

65
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:38,040
as the morning gets a bit quieter even a little bit

66
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:43,440
we can also sense or tune into our

67
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:50,640
awareness of the breath so there's the breath and there's the knowing of the breath

68
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:59,000
it's just a little turn of awareness to see the other side

69
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,540
and you sense the aspect of the mind that knows

70
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,700
the simple knowing of an object such as the breath energy

71
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,959
is consciousness

72
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,339
to know that we know

73
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:46,399
it's quite wonderful this capacity to know

74
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:55,940
also a bit mysterious how is it that we can have an experience

75
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:05,399
if you look at how it's happening look carefully

76
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:12,920
you can see that the knowing of an object Co arises with the object

77
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:20,240
we can't know a sensation before it occurs

78
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,540
we can't know it after it is gone

79
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:35,600
but when it's there there's the knowing of it

80
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,120
and there could only be knowing if there were something to know

81
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:55,019
it's amazing there can be some wonder and amazement

82
00:12:55,019 --> 00:13:01,579
that our mind is knowing all of these experiences

83
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,680
so see if you can rest in this knowing

84
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:12,980
just appreciating this aliveness of knowing

85
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:33,360
to find that the Mind needs a place to rest tuning into that subtle

86
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:40,320
breath energy coming in going out we're still connected to the physical

87
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:49,460
world the breathing and there's the knowing of experience

88
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:58,580
breathing in and breathing out

89
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:05,039
foreign

90
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:39,179
s of this meditation we may notice how

91
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:43,220
the elements are interconnected

92
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:50,120
the air element and the breath that we've been tuning into

93
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:57,480
occurs because we have a body because there is

94
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,820
Earth the substance of this body draws in the

95
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:07,340
air through the working of the muscles

96
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:14,039
beer has a temperature often it's cool on the way in warm on

97
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,519
the way out

98
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:26,880
and it has a quality of connecting together the the body has the cohesion quality that's

99
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,460
associated with the water element the elements are not really

100
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:41,240
separate they have different aspects of material life

101
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:49,919
and all of them are known by consciousness

102
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:55,760
which Rises with them

103
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:06,960
it's almost a tautology how could we know the Earth Elemental even what it is

104
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:13,440
without knowing and how could there be knowing if there weren't something to know

105
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:22,200
so these are completely integrated also when we tune into the Consciousness side

106
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:30,059
you may have a sense of Marvel Wonder where's that coming from

107
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:35,220
what would it be like to go through the world marveling at what's appearing

108
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:41,340
might be pleasant it might be painful or neither one

109
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:46,500
all the fullness of life it's quite marvelous that it all comes

110
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:52,278
into this mind into this life

111
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,940
how would it be to live with a sense of Wonder

112
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:06,620
being here of seeing all of this of experiencing this

113
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:16,919
and how would we have to be to stay in touch with that sense of

114
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:23,820
Marvel even if it's painful what qualities of mind would we have to

115
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:31,460
have to still welcome experience as wonderful even when it's painful

116
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:41,220
and what a gift for the world it is to see life

117
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:46,500
as a wondrous opportunity an amazing thing

118
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:51,779
even in all of its complexity and challenge

119
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:57,059
as well as its ease and peace

120
00:28:57,059 --> 00:29:02,700
truly that would be to know the fullness of life people like that are gifts to

121
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:08,340
the world able to have a bigger perspective

122
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:14,700
they will always Define somewhere to be easy with what's

123
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:20,779
happening why does the air able to move

124
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:34,820
so we'll see how it is to consider the Wonder

125
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,360
in life today

126
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:22,559
so the flavors of the week continue we are going through some of the classical

127
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:28,740
Indian rasa or Savers or flavors that teachings

128
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:35,760
can have and I want to bring in one more Dimension today as we've gotten pretty

129
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:41,039
far into this week which is noticing if there are certain

130
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:46,500
flavors that we're talking about that you rarely experience

131
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:54,120
or that you have a sense like oh that's not that important or I don't

132
00:30:54,120 --> 00:31:00,840
know about that one something like that um or what is that I I never even

133
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:06,419
thought about that one then maybe it would be interesting to um

134
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:13,380
open to some of these other flavors the way we might try a different food

135
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:18,480
spice up our practice with an unusual flavor

136
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:24,779
because all of these are present in mesutas if we look for them we may just not have noticed if we're not really

137
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:32,039
attuned to that flavor so today we are looking at wonder and

138
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:37,679
amazement we could also say ah it's interesting that these are

139
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,840
recognized in the classical Indian cultural understanding as being

140
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:49,440
important flavors to have in art and also in spiritual teachings

141
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:55,980
I think it's an ingredient that is sometimes missing here in the West

142
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:02,340
I know not everyone listening is from the West but at least I'm aware of much of that

143
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:08,340
culture and Buddhism and you know we tend to have kind of prefer rationality

144
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:14,940
um wondering amazement um but the Buddha was very clear that

145
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:22,679
the Dharma the Deep Dharma is beyond the thinking mind he said that Liberation is unattainable

146
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:28,440
by mere reasoning so let's draw out

147
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:34,980
some meaning of that from the discourses of the Buddha

148
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:40,500
there is a story of a time that the Buddha was living with an intendant

149
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:45,659
named magia and you may know that Ananda was often

150
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:51,419
the Buddha's attendant and that's true but he actually came a little bit later the Buddha had some other attendance

151
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:57,299
before Ananda and at this time he was just living with

152
00:32:57,299 --> 00:33:04,559
his attendant Makia just the two of them and magia asks permission to go meditate

153
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:11,279
alone in a lovely mango Grove and the the Buddha tries to dissuade him

154
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:16,980
from doing that alone but magia is very insistent and he asks

155
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:22,200
three times which usually means that the Buddha has to comply and eventually the

156
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:30,600
Buddha gives in because you know McGee is so eager to practice how can he you object to that so he sends him off

157
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:38,700
but mcgear did not have an easy time his mind was taken over by sensual thoughts

158
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:46,320
and thoughts of ill will and thoughts of harming his mind kind of went crazy and what's of Interest here is that is

159
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:53,820
his response um the suta says that in his mind he said this is truly astounding and

160
00:33:53,820 --> 00:34:02,159
amazing I have gone forth out of Faith from the household life into homelessness yet I am still stalked by

161
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:09,780
these three kinds of bad unwholesome thoughts sensual thoughts thoughts of ill will and thoughts of harming

162
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:17,040
so how about that response he says it is astounding and amazing that his mind is

163
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:24,000
doing all of this I don't hear that very often from meditators here usually it's more like

164
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:31,260
Oh I'm a terrible meditator my mind is out of control or even goes farther to

165
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:37,260
I'm a terrible person to have thoughts like this or to be so bad at my

166
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:43,740
meditation how awful so maybe we could try reading experience

167
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:49,679
more like magia um when the mind is wild you can be amazed

168
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:56,339
and truly this mind has a mind of its own doesn't it can reduce all kinds of stuff

169
00:34:56,339 --> 00:35:03,359
we touched a little bit into this yesterday the unpredictable quality of the mind when we talked about humor you

170
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:11,400
know like kill thinking I wonder if there's a body under that tarp so amazement is kind of related can also

171
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:17,820
be a helpful response when our mind is doing whatever it's doing wow how

172
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:24,180
amazing um so that's one side of amazement and wonder one that I think is pretty

173
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:32,520
accessible but in the sutas of course there is there are also instances where Advanced

174
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:38,000
meditators display what are called supernormal Powers you know the ability

175
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:45,240
for the mind to manipulate the physical world in unusual ways you know there are

176
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:52,560
discussions of levitation walking through walls kinds of things or the ability to see

177
00:35:52,560 --> 00:36:00,359
very deeply with the mind you know beyond the way we normally are able to experience things like being able to

178
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:06,420
see sometimes what other people are thinking or being able to see our past

179
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:12,060
lives these kinds of powers come about

180
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:17,099
are said to come about let's say from developing strong concentration

181
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:22,880
and we don't emphasize them here in the west and the Buddha absolutely forbade

182
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:28,560
casual use of them for his followers so you know they're not really

183
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:33,619
emphasized as AIMS in the Buddhist teachings

184
00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:41,579
but if we read the sutas honestly again they are sometimes strategically used to

185
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:46,740
shock people into presence or to evoke inspiration

186
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:52,619
there's a case where the Buddha uses his power to prevent someone from being able

187
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:59,040
to catch up with him even though the person is running as fast as they can and the Buddha is just walking at normal

188
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:04,440
speed and um this causes the person to stop stop

189
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:09,920
short that they you know that obviously something different is going on there

190
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,940
and because of you know the Buddha showing his power that way the person

191
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:20,160
stops and actually listens to the Buddha and give him a teaching which turned out

192
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:26,579
to be crucial for him so you know the Buddha was strategic in in

193
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:34,320
using that ability there are also cases where the um quite a few where the Buddha is asked

194
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:40,020
or even sometimes spontaneously tells the rebirth destination of someone who

195
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:46,380
is just tied and he even explains why he's doing that you know he doesn't just

196
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:53,460
do it so that people will be amazed or so that people will you know whatever but he he's very clear about why he's

197
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:59,940
doing that he says there are people who are inspired by things that are lofty

198
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:05,160
and when he unpacks that it's a bit of it it's that you know if people know

199
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:11,820
that someone has attained a certain stage of Liberation with their death and is reborn in a good destination they

200
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:17,579
might be inspired to practice while they're still alive here or just

201
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:23,000
um you know we can even see simpler versions of this maybe in

202
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,140
everyday life here you know there are people who are inspired that people go

203
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:34,560
on Long retreats you know just knowing that somebody is going on a three-month retreat

204
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:41,099
I've known people who were really inspired to know that they weren't going to do it necessarily but yeah we I mean

205
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:47,700
we offer that in our tradition at IMs every year there's a three-month Retreat it's always full

206
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:52,980
um that can be really inspiring so you know talking about kind of the

207
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:59,300
elevated mind states that are possible has a place on the path

208
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:04,940
there's also a discussion a discourse that's called wonderful and marvelous

209
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:10,200
and in this discourse Ananda is

210
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:15,839
um recounting a number of the wonderful and marvelous things about the Buddha's

211
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:21,420
past life in the 2C to Heaven before he was born here and then also coming into

212
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:26,520
his mother's womb to be born here and the birth itself you know there's kind

213
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:31,859
of a mythology around all of this and but what's interesting in this suto

214
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:37,140
wonderful and marvelous is that the Ananda explains all of these things in

215
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:44,400
the Buddha's presence saying that he heard all of these things from the Blessed one's own lips and the Buddha

216
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:50,820
doesn't object so I think we're to take them as true you know he says things like

217
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:58,680
um you know when the Buddha was born there were flowers blooming out of season and uh streams of water rained

218
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:05,520
down from heaven things like that so you know we can maybe take this metaphorically or

219
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:11,640
um or who knows we weren't there um but an interesting thing so all of

220
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:17,220
this is kind of there in the Sutton and we're you know the Buddhists acid we at

221
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:24,480
least agreeing with it and then the Buddha listens to this long recitation of you know Miracles without

222
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:31,980
comment and then he says to Ananda that being so Ananda remember this too as a

223
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:37,680
wonderful and marvelous quality of the tatagata meaning the Buddha here for the

224
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:43,079
tatagata feelings are known as they arise as they are present and as they

225
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:49,200
disappear perceptions are known as they arise as they are present and as they disappear

226
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:55,560
and thoughts are known as they arise as they are present and as they disappear

227
00:40:55,560 --> 00:41:00,839
so it seems that after all these Miracles which apparently are true

228
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:06,960
the Buddha also really values the simple knowing of one's mind that is the

229
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,119
genuine miracle if you will

230
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,980
and he meant it actually even for himself there's a there's a pseudo from just after the Buddha's Awakening where

231
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:25,140
the Buddha realizes that it's um in his words it's painful to dwell without

232
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:30,960
reverence and deference and he's just been awakened right so

233
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:39,119
you'd think he would need that kind of thing but he looks around for something to be awed by some some person and he

234
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:44,220
doesn't see any being who's Superior in knowing than himself

235
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:49,380
so he decides to Revere the Dharma how about that and so even the Buddha

236
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:55,619
wanted to Revere something so he decides to Revere the natural laws of how things work

237
00:41:55,619 --> 00:42:01,140
it's amazing this is a simple a natural element of the universe

238
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:06,839
that could evoke wonder and awe for us how amazing that this is there's this

239
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:13,140
mind there's all these things we can know about the body and the mind and there's Consciousness knowing it

240
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:17,660
that we didn't create wow

241
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:26,940
I originally studied science in my earlier life and I was drawn to it largely because of the feelings of awe

242
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:33,300
and wonder that I had as a child Imagining the universe and my place in

243
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:40,260
it nature is quite wonderful and marvelous and I hope we don't lose that in our

244
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:49,400
practice and in the little minutia of trying to get our life right and figure out our past and our relationships

245
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:55,020
nature so wonderful the mind is amazing

246
00:42:55,020 --> 00:43:00,780
so we need this in our practice we need to bring in Inspiration faith

247
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:10,140
juice of some kind Wonder can evoke Joy can enliven and lift the heart

248
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:16,200
can enable us to move forward when we have no idea how you know we can get into situations

249
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:22,920
where we don't know how to go forward life can be like that it can bring

250
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:29,220
something large and then we we might really need something bigger than us

251
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:36,720
our small self so worried about getting everything together open the mind to

252
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:43,200
the Wonder the larger picture the sense of

253
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:49,260
the wholeness not as a philosophy but as a labor as an

254
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:54,359
emotional tone that's useful for us we don't have to make it into a big thing

255
00:43:54,359 --> 00:44:00,359
and then we're gripping onto it just be with it feel it use it so that

256
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:05,760
the mind can become unstuck so

257
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:11,819
this is my suggestion for today the flavor of the day I hope you're getting a sense as we go

258
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:17,579
through these flavors of the breath that's offered in the teachings

259
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:23,460
breath that's possible in our heart and mind so

260
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:27,619
be well see you tomorrow
