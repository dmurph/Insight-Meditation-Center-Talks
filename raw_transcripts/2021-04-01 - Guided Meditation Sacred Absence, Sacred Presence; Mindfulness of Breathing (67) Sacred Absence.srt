1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:09,360
so warm greetings for our meditation time

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:17,680
together and um

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:25,519
as i sit down to be here with you all and i'm thinking about

4
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:33,840
two things that uh and that is sacred presence

5
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,559
that which is present that feels deeply respect worthy inspiring

6
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:47,039
meaningful and sacred absence the absence which is

7
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:54,640
special respect worthy inspiring

8
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:03,760
and in this practice uh there's a very important role of absence what i call today's sacred

9
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:10,400
absence and to recognize the absence of

10
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,520
clinging attachment hate preoccupation

11
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:25,360
and to recognize that absence is special respect worthy inspiring

12
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:33,520
it really helps open up this path of meditation and then with that sacred absence

13
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:40,799
the way that we are aware of what is present can have a sacred quality

14
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:47,840
maybe not exactly because what we're attending to is maybe sacred in

15
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:56,000
some way but the way that we're present for it our sacred presence our presence our attention

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,880
has qualities that are sacred and special and not to be overlooked

17
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:11,440
and there's always something here as we meditate which is absent

18
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,760
and uh if you go back even you know over your recent life there have probably been things that

19
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:25,040
you've been caught up in reacting to consumed with driven by

20
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:31,840
troubled by that those troubles and those preoccupations maybe they've faded away and they're not

21
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,280
here anymore and it's possible to somehow be aware of

22
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:44,640
their absence and in that absence

23
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:53,440
to have more room for awareness for attention in that absence to receive

24
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:01,120
more fully the experience of breathing in that absence to connect more fully to

25
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,560
breathing and even in the much short term

26
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,920
if you're thinking about something in meditation and you're able to let go of it

27
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:18,879
there's the absence of that thinking there might be the absence of the drive

28
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:27,920
to think or the desire or the resentment or the whatever it was inspiring the thinking

29
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:36,000
to start recognizing the absence is a very important part of the deeper

30
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,239
dimensions of this anapanasati

31
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:50,319
and then not just to recognize the absence but recognize it as an opportunity to

32
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:56,560
bring have a sacred awareness a greater awareness and for the purpose

33
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:04,319
of this meditation for our breathing simply aware and

34
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:11,120
kind of committed to breathing in and breathing out

35
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,560
with awareness awaringly

36
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:28,000
wearingly so to take a assume a meditation posture

37
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,080
and close your eyes

38
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:40,840
and and here we are there's a lot of things

39
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,680
absent just being used to meditate

40
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:54,000
for the time being the absence of maybe the busyness of the day or the

41
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,120
concerns that we have to things we have to do during the day

42
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:11,840
physically those things are not here now in our body working them

43
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:20,639
maybe some other concerns that you have for the day you can put up on a shelf and put aside for now

44
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,720
and let them be absent because they'll be picked up later

45
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:39,840
to help let go of things to be here to take a few long slow deep breaths

46
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,400
maybe three quarters full as you breathe in

47
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,840
and four fifths emptying the lungs as you exhale

48
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:21,840
and as you exhale to relax the body the whole frame

49
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:39,600
letting your breathing return to normal and relaxing

50
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:46,800
some more on the exhale and not only feeling the release of tension and holding

51
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,759
but to appreciate the absence of that holding

52
00:06:52,479 --> 00:07:03,840
so to soften the belly

53
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:17,840
perhaps you can soften your chest

54
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:45,840
yeah relaxing and softening your shoulders

55
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:59,840
and calming the muscles of your face

56
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,840
and cooling down the

57
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,120
agitation associated with thinking

58
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,840
calming the thinking mind

59
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,320
and then appreciating absence not so much that you have to think about

60
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:01,200
what is absent but maybe there's some way you could intuit

61
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:12,480
the absence space the absence the freed up time the freedom thinking

62
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:19,600
the freedom attention that's not preoccupied with

63
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,839
the things that you have been preoccupied with

64
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:32,320
and here to allow this absence to become fuller

65
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,240
letting go of thoughts ideas

66
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,839
an absence which is related to the simplicity of this moment

67
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,800
just here now in

68
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:05,440
the sacred absence in which you

69
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,399
make room for your body's

70
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,560
breathing allowing in a sense the experience of breathing

71
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:33,839
to fill the space of awareness

72
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:45,120
a sacred absence that allows for sacred presence

73
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,120
a sacred attention

74
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:04,320
and when you find yourself thinking and you let go of it appreciate

75
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,880
whatever absence of thinking that then follows

76
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,839
and allow the breathing into that absence

77
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,800
so breathing begins to fill more and more

78
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:35,920
your field of awareness as if awareness fills the universe just

79
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,839
breathing

80
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:36,399
keep filling the absence with your breathing your experience body's experience of

81
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:42,079
breathing so that this sacred absence is not filled with

82
00:13:42,079 --> 00:14:03,839
something else filled with thinking and wanting fantasy

83
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,839
so

84
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:24,240
whatever you're caught up in and thinking about beyond the edges of it is also

85
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,440
sacred absence

86
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:39,440
let go of your thoughts and preoccupations your tensions your holdings

87
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:48,240
let go into the great absence and

88
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,279
fill that absence with the experience of breathing

89
00:20:54,159 --> 00:21:03,840
allowing yourself to become very simple and quiet just breathing

90
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,240
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

91
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,799
one form of sacred absence

92
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:44,320
is to make the heart as wide as the world

93
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:51,919
make lots of space in your heart in your care and your love and your

94
00:27:51,919 --> 00:28:00,720
good will so there's a place inside of you

95
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,240
for all beings

96
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,960
and so to clear the space within

97
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:19,840
so that there's room for you to consider relate to

98
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:27,520
hold in your care others

99
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,200
and for them to fill the space of your heart

100
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:41,200
means to be very simple allowing them to be as they are

101
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:46,880
maybe a sacred presence

102
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:58,159
that everyone is respect worthy everyone in some way may be

103
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:05,279
independent or even how they're behaving some way deep inside something beautiful

104
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:13,840
and inspiring even if it's just a seed that's waiting to germinate

105
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:25,279
in sacred absence within you that allows you to receive

106
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:32,880
and be present in a fuller caring way for others

107
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:44,320
and you don't have to say these words but maybe a care and a good will

108
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:51,600
that these words express or touch on

109
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:58,880
may all beings be happy

110
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:08,720
may all beings be safe

111
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:15,679
may all beings be peaceful

112
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,840
may all beings be free

113
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:33,919
and may we live caring for the welfare and happiness

114
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,840
of those around us

115
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:50,480
may this meditation practice

116
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,158
provide inspiration and ability

117
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:05,840
to walk through the world with care and good will may all beings be

118
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,840
well

119
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:34,399
so we're continuing now with the last steps of last of the sixteen steps of mindfulness

120
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:39,440
of breathing and we're coming now to the the

121
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:45,120
fifteenth step and uh which is uh the the poly word

122
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,320
that it represents that that's been being used is niroda

123
00:31:50,320 --> 00:32:01,840
and um in the 14th step the pali word is v raga niroda spelled n-i-r-o-d-h-a

124
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:08,880
and and it's sometimes it's nice to just use the pali words because

125
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:17,360
in the original context and in india these words have really rich connotations in fact the

126
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:24,240
these the iraga and eurota are sometimes listed almost as as synonyms or almost

127
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:31,600
as synonyms for liberation itself and so they have a very kind of almost sacred or special

128
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:38,799
quality that the english word for viraga which i've said sometimes translated as

129
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:45,279
fading away and sometimes as dispassion it doesn't really capture the richness of the

130
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:53,440
the disassociations or the the way it feels in pali to the raga

131
00:32:53,440 --> 00:33:00,640
and then same thing with niroda such a rich world word that in the original context

132
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:07,360
i think that really felt like a heartwarming idea that you don't get from the english

133
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:12,720
translations the most common translation for niurota is

134
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:19,039
cessation and cessation just end you know ending doesn't really

135
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:26,559
bring for most of us doesn't bring much heartfelt feeling inspiration delight joy just cessation is like just seems

136
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:34,320
like okay it's not the ending of something the word niroda comes from the

137
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:40,000
prefix knee which means without not

138
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,760
free from and rhoda which means obstruction so it's being without

139
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:53,440
obstruction so cessation is a very different feeling than free of obstruction and maybe the

140
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:59,200
cessation of obstructions cessation of blockages or clinging or

141
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:05,840
contraction or what gets in the way of freedom and so

142
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:13,358
the 13 the 14th step the fading away the dispassion is the involves the fading away in the

143
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:21,440
ceasing the ending of attachments of cravings of conceits of

144
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:28,079
the driveness compulsive ways of being that have an uh definitely a feeling of

145
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:35,520
stress and maybe even pain associated with their drive with their presence and that the the

146
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:41,280
the pain of those the stress of those becomes more and more apparent

147
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,839
the more wonderfully and beautifully quiet and still the mind becomes a

148
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:53,599
meditation the more calm we are the more they stand out and highlight as being oh this is kind of

149
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:59,440
uncomfortable to feel this way that in ordinary street consciousness we might not feel and so i can even say what's

150
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,960
the big deal it's okay to have a little bit of irritation but in deep meditation a

151
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:12,000
little bit irritation it doesn't feel like a little bit it feels like a real disruption and more importantly an obstruction

152
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:21,359
to a deeper peace deeper freedom so the 15th step is one trains

153
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:38,480
observing cessation one will breathe in observing

154
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:45,280
cessation won't breathe out observing non-obstruction when we'll breathe in observing

155
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:52,240
non-obstruction one will breathe out and and so

156
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:57,760
uh as we get deeper and deeper at some point we observe

157
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:05,040
sacred absence we observe the absence of something and the absence that was really

158
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:10,720
strong is really noteworthy it's like

159
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:17,119
deeply inspiring so with watching in constancy in constancy

160
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:24,839
we're watching things come and go they arise and they pass and this and being in the river the flow of

161
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:32,400
transiency but as we do that we begin to the attachment to reaching into that river of change

162
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:39,280
begins to give up can still relax and with that something ceases something

163
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:47,839
stops something is no longer there to obstruct the freedom and that uh and that absence is not just

164
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:54,720
a temporary absence like it fades and then comes back a second later or fades away and comes back a minute

165
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:04,160
later or something but it there's a way in which the cessation the ending of it the absence of it is really

166
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:10,960
impactful for the mind and the heart wow it's possible

167
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,320
to really be free of cynicism wow this is right you know i've been sin

168
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:24,240
cynical for decades wow this is possible or i've been always you know

169
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:30,320
preoccupied and self-preoccupied with self wow this preoccupation with me myself

170
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:36,720
and mine has fallen away and it's not here i can look around where is it it's not there wow

171
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:43,839
it's it's absent it's ceased it there's a non-obstruction now that i realize that self-preoccupation was a

172
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:49,359
kind of a obstruction or wind drag or something

173
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:58,078
um jealousy doubt hatred resentment

174
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,920
all kinds of desires that sometimes are there kind of in the structure of how

175
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:09,760
our mind works so embedded fear

176
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:16,640
and wow this has ceased for now it might come back the next day it might come back at the end of the meditation

177
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:21,680
but there's something about the thoroughness of that absence which makes an

178
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:29,839
impression and then this i know is possible i had no idea this was possible and

179
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:35,280
of course this is like coming home or this is health or this is my birthright

180
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:42,880
or this is worthwhile this you know it's worth this is is fantastic

181
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:49,440
and any movement away from it any way of picking up the compulsion that's a diminishment that's not really

182
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:55,839
worth it anymore and that's not the direction to go that's not the way i want to live

183
00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:01,440
this is how i want to live without this obstructions this kind of stress of

184
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,720
these kinds of things and when this sense of absence is really

185
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:12,880
impactful and strong enough when it's really a very very deep thorough absence then

186
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:21,119
a person will never be the same again it's almost as if that absence is a living memory or presence

187
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:27,280
or something that as a guide oh this is where freedom is this is where peace says this is

188
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:37,200
where truth is not truth propositional truth but just the true way of being a certain way and

189
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:43,839
and and then it becomes an orientation for how to live our life or to say it in

190
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:51,920
different way the tradition what the tradition says when then has entered into the current

191
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:58,560
the good current the current that takes us to full freedom so we're in the river of change the

192
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,680
river of in transiency but we've now discovered that there's an

193
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:10,240
uh a place that's not in the eddies that's not in the in the brambles that are growing

194
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:16,560
into the side of the river but where notice maybe in the center of the river there's a beautiful current

195
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:23,359
that if we stay in that current it'll carry us to the tradition talks use uses this

196
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:30,160
analogy to the ocean of liberation and freedom and so this so i call this the sacred

197
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:37,040
absence the absence of uh and to recognize the value of absence

198
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:43,359
and this is a hard thing for many people to appreciate that absence has importance

199
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:48,480
the uh in a sense you can watch the mind and see as soon as there's a quiet

200
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:55,920
moment in the mind sometimes it seems like a mind just reaches out for the next thing to think about or we have certain problems and as soon

201
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:03,680
as that problem is solved the mind just goes on to the next thing and the next thing and the next things the mind is filling itself all the time

202
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:11,760
but but to appreciate absence cessation this deep sacred pause or

203
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,880
stopping um and let it impact us wow

204
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:23,680
it's true so that it's possible to be free so it's a little disappointing for

205
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:28,880
people who always want to have something that's be reassuring

206
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:34,720
something that's a confirmation that they're important they're valuable that they're on the right track that

207
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:41,440
they can have the badge to tell their friends look i have this beautiful thing the spiritual quality or something and

208
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:50,400
but and an absence is not a badge you can put on absence is not the presence of something

209
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:56,319
there might be our ability to be present for things of the world become stronger

210
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:02,720
but freedom is not something tangible it's not something that in a sense that

211
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:08,720
the mind can focus on as an object of attention in a usual way that things we can

212
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:13,839
see and touch and feel and so it's very easy to overlook

213
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:19,839
absences or to diminish their importance in fact in in history of buddhism in the ancient

214
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:26,560
world there were debates and big concerns about some people some great buddhist teachers

215
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:32,000
couldn't understand how in absence could be

216
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,200
that the ultimate goal the ultimate freedom of buddhism was somehow represented by an absence

217
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:44,319
it had to be a thing it had to be some something and they posited a variety of different kinds of transcen transcendent kind of

218
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:49,599
states and experiences because it had to be a thing so whether

219
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:57,599
that's true or not is besides the point what i'm trying to say now in the 15 steps of mindfulness of breathing it

220
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:02,800
becomes it's at observing absence observing cessation

221
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:09,680
observing a space of non-obstruction uh observing how with the fading away of

222
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:18,000
of these you know passion for this lust for clinging for craving

223
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:26,720
at some point the stopping the cessation is so full and sometimes it happens like like

224
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:33,440
a like a quantum shift wow and sometimes it happens slowly or fading away

225
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:40,400
but um something and um and it might be just one thing it might be cynicism or it might be

226
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:47,520
doubt but something has been plaguing us for a long time boom wow we notice

227
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:55,520
this is possible and it is possible and the buddha made this great statement

228
00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:03,040
if it was not possible if it's not possible to kind of paraphrasing him if it's not

229
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:09,359
possible to bring an end to our unwholesome mental qualities

230
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:16,480
i wouldn't teach you to bring them to an end but it is possible to bring unwholesome

231
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:22,400
mental qualities to an end to cessation

232
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:27,279
and so i teach you that this is possible

233
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:34,240
so this 15th step is an encouragement to appreciate

234
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:41,119
absence to appreciate the sacred absence take time recognizing when a

235
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:49,280
preoccupation when greed when anger when desire when lust when anything like all these things that

236
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:56,319
the mind involved mind contracting the heart contracting and notice uh know it appreciate when

237
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:01,440
it's not there and that appreciation will allow to grow or

238
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:07,760
allow you to feel some confidence about this and keep making space in sacred space sacred openness of

239
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:14,079
attention to be more present and more here that supports this whole process of of

240
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:20,160
furthering along onward leading aspect of this path of practice

241
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:27,760
so breathing in observing cessation

242
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:36,240
breathing out observing cessation so um thank you all and

243
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:42,160

244

247
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:12,000
