00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:08,320
thank you all for your greetings in the chat those of you putting the greetings there

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:15,759
and i take it they take them as representative of many of you who

3
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,880
don't have access to the chat then so thank you all very much for being

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,400
here so um

5
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:35,120
the topic of this week is mindfulness of emotions

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:42,239
and one of the ways of thinking about mindfulness and emotions

7
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,680
is that mindfulness is giving breathing room to our emotions

8
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,120
it's making more space for them to be there and one of the remarkable things that

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:01:00,160
can happen with meditation practice is the mind becomes more

10
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:08,400
calm or steady or open is that it can feel like there's actually a lot of space in the mind

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,520
in the heart in the body for uh everything

12
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,680
for the inner processing that goes on so including for our emotions

13
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,680
and so rather than thinking that we have to solve an emotion or fix an emotion or do

14
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,200
something with an emotion the um

15
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,680
one of the options in mindfulness practice is uh to make more room for the emotions

16
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,439
increase the space in which it's held space of awareness space of the mind

17
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,680
and doing so allows us to more kind of clarity

18
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,719
to see what's there when we're crowded with the emotion or identified with it strongly it's hard to

19
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:02,079
see what's there and sometimes what's there is something deeper

20
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:08,479
some emotions are just uh you know something knocking on

21
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,680
on the door saying here come here take a deeper look

22
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,120
so relaxing

23
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:26,319
is part of this path to making more room learning the art of simple recognition

24
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:34,959
is part of this path so assuming a meditation posture

25
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,040
and kind of a little bit wiggling around a little bit in your

26
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,280
posture and maybe to loosen things up a little bit when i first was taught meditation in

27
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,640
zen they i got the instructions to flap the elbows around a little bit

28
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,159
uh to uh kind of maybe loosen up the ways in which holding happens in the arms and the

29
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:05,680
hands it's kind of like a chicken and uh

30
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:12,640
and then kind of find a aligned posture in whatever way your posture

31
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:19,120
you're in is it aligned is it somehow allow

32
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:26,640
the maximum feeling of of the body being

33
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,959
in position

34
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:39,519
so there could be a flow or deeper relaxation

35
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:48,319
lowering your gaze softening your gaze

36
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,040
cooling your eyes

37
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,239
and then gently closing your eyes

38
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:10,159
and with your eyes closed might there be a deeper sensitivity now

39
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,439
for your body and its posture

40
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:25,280
maybe gently having the attention travel up the spine from the base of the spine

41
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,840
are there any small adjustments that you would like to make

42
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,199
partly so that the spine itself feels more alert

43
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,680
more here

44
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,639
so

45
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:03,759
and then to take a few long slow deep breaths

46
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:12,638
as if you have all the time in the world to savor the inhale

47
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,280
to ride the exhale

48
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,800
and on that exhale to relax the body more

49
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,680
maybe a global relaxation

50
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,440
and letting the breathing return to normal

51
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:11,520
and on the inhale let your attention roam around your body

52
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:17,440
going to pick up or to feel any place where there's holding in the body

53
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,479
and on the exhale relax that part of your body

54
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:30,759
so it's kind of a random whatever shows itself to you relax as you exhale

55
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,360
relaxing deep in your belly

56
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,639
softening the belly

57
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,280
and then for about three or four breaths

58
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,440
settle into your breathing give yourself over to the inhales and exhales for just

59
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,160
three or four breaths

60
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:27,479
and then now notice how you're feeling

61
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,758
it might feel like an emotional state it might be a mood

62
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,919
mental state you might not think of it particularly

63
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:46,159
as an emotion but more that you're calm or

64
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:53,720
agitated it might feel more like a physical state

65
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:04,680
whatever it might be recognize it

66
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,440
and as you exhale is there any relaxation you can do

67
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,279
around it in the middle of it

68
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:33,480
or any relaxation you do you can do in the mind's relationship to it

69
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:02,079
and as if you can have more space around how you feel

70
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:08,079
feel your way into that space surround how you feel

71
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:16,160
maybe you can feel or imagine a sense of openness spaciousness

72
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:25,640
expansiveness around whatever way you're feeling

73
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,680
relax into that spaciousness

74
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:16,480
and then as if there's lots of space for breathing let the breathing

75
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:24,560
come and go in the space of the mind

76
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,279
with breathing at the center not to push away how you're feeling or

77
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:38,480
deny it but not to be involved with how you feel

78
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,880
letting us be there in the spaciousness of the mind

79
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,639
and you gently settling in

80
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,320
on breathing in and breathing out

81
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:29,120
if you are involved in your thinking chances are there's no space for how you

82
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,840
feel

83
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:45,200
if you're reacting to what's happening chances are there's not much space

84
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:54,280
for how you feel not much so much space for breathing

85
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:08,399
release your thinking

86
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,840
release your reactivity

87
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,279
release any contraction or narrowness

88
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:26,679
and relax into the space of awareness space

89
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:37,640
so you can better breathe with what is with lots of breathing room

90
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:05,440
and then as we come to the end of the sitting as you exhale

91
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,679
breathe relax again

92
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:16,080
what are you able to relax release

93
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:25,760
at the end of the sitting in the face and the shoulders the belly

94
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,840
in the heart in the mind

95
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:52,399
and the ability to relax can be seen as a gift that we bring into

96
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:57,600
the world if you're with small children and you're

97
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:05,200
tense and anxious by osmosis you're teaching the children

98
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:11,600
that there are things to be afraid of things to be

99
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:18,640
tense about but if you know how to relax

100
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:26,559
and be with the small children in a relaxed open non-anxious way

101
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:32,240
you teach those children that the world is a

102
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:42,398
comfortable enough place to be happy and playful and at ease

103
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:52,840
if you go into the world and people around you are in

104
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:59,200
challenge challenged by their health or by work or by

105
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:05,919
the world around them perhaps it's a gift that you come into

106
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:10,480
the world in a calm way relaxed way

107
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:19,278
just relaxed inappropriate way so by osmosis

108
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:26,000
we are spreading non-anxiousness

109
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:33,279
non-agitation making room for others

110
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:37,240
to relax as well

111
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:46,000
may it be that as we do this practice that we support the world we

112
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:54,720
help the world around us to be less anxious less agitated and tense

113
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:07,120
not by making them or teaching them how to do it but by our own

114
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:13,720
relaxation ease calm non-agitation

115
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:23,440
may we not stay keep the benefits of meditation for ourselves

116
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,799
let us share it with others maybe without them knowing that we're

117
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:33,840
meditators just by our presence

118
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:40,720
may it be that this practice we do is for the welfare and happiness of all

119
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:47,840
beings may all beings be happy

120
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:53,760
may all beings be safe

121
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:05,159
may all beings be peaceful and may all beings everywhere be free

122
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:14,869
[Music]

123
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:20,079
[Music]

124
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:19,760
so in discussing mindfulness of emotion the

125
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,840
theme for today is respect

126
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:32,799
we started with relaxation and recognition and now respect as we recognize as we relax it's easier

127
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:40,559
to recognize as we recognize it's either easier to recognize

128
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:47,919
how we are relating to our emotional life are we are we

129
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:53,840
relating do we have an attitude towards it which is um

130
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:59,919
making it more difficult than it needs to be do we identify with it strongly defining

131
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:05,760
ourselves by it do we have hostility towards it do we not like

132
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,960
it and push it away or we do we have shame or embarrassment about it

133
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:16,398
do we have ideas that should be different are we trying to get rid of things

134
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:22,000
are we trying to have certain emotions certain feelings certain attitudes to the world and

135
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,040
are we kind of forcing kind of maybe even sugar coating

136
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:32,560
experience by trying too hard or are we holding on to things

137
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:38,878
maybe we were happy yesterday and so we're holding on to that idea that we should be

138
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:45,839
and um the um so they as we as we started recognizing the

139
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:52,800
component parts of emotions we see the extra reactivity we might have to it

140
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,720
and seeing that reactivity is the beginning of respect

141
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:04,320
and i really like this word respect because from the latin it means to see again

142
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:11,599
to uh to like spectacle to look again and um

143
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:17,040
and so to to start taking a deeper look at what's here

144
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:24,960
and if we can see our reactivity maybe we can put it aside enough that we can bring a respectful attention

145
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:31,119
to the emotion itself and and uh as if

146
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:36,560
as if it's allowed to be there because the disrespectful ways are often

147
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:42,400
trying to change something or hold on to something and not allowing it to be itself

148
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,839
so the second look the vipassana look that really taking a deeper look making

149
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:54,800
space for it allowing it for it to be there i like the idea that we're giving

150
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:01,040
permission for our emotions to be present and uh it's a little different than

151
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:06,800
allowing it's a little more active it's like a choice it's a decision i'm going to give i'm going to offer it's like a

152
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,640
generosity i'm going to offer permission for myself to be the way i am sophia and

153
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:17,839
as i said yesterday i think um sitting in meditation is a wonderful

154
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:23,599
place to do this because um you're kind of committed to sitting still

155
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:29,040
and not acting on whatever the feelings might be so

156
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:34,240
you know there might be some anger that seems very undesirable very strong

157
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:39,520
but in meditation we give it permission to be there

158
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:47,839
and then um and then um or if there's sadness or grief

159
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:55,520
or if there's joy and happiness we give permission for it to be there as we give permission for it to be

160
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,800
there and just allow it to be there without our reactivity or judgments or with those put aside enough we can so we

161
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,079
can really respect it what's there then i i

162
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:12,079
find it useful to think of emotions as either a message

163
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:19,440
or a messenger as a message emotions are here are they're not random

164
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:25,040
they're not incidental accidental phenomena just to kind of come through

165
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:30,560
they have some kind of message in them and maybe the message is that

166
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:35,680
asking for respect maybe the message is to

167
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:42,800
to saying to you here's an opportunity for you to discover how to be non-attached

168
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,320
how to not cling or resist and be more make more space

169
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:54,800
but it might be a deeper message you know so um and then anger might be a message

170
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:01,520
that we feel hurt or we feel threatened um sadness might be a message message

171
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:06,960
that we might feel um the um

172
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:14,000
um you know that uh we feel really impacted we really care we love something

173
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,760
and that love now feels you know feels sad or but the love is

174
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:25,920
underneath it and so it's a message of love and so rather than to think of grief and

175
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:32,880
sadness as a problem it's a it's a manifestation it's a movement it's a process that that love

176
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:39,839
needs to go through to be whole again or to find its way again

177
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:44,960
but sometimes emotions are messengers and

178
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:50,240
especially i think of this way when the emotions are afflictive

179
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:55,760
when the emotions are bringing suffering along to us

180
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:02,480
that and then you don't want to kill the messenger you want to really see what is the message here

181
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:08,160
so so so the ability to respect and get

182
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:14,960
permission and make breathing room allow for emotions to be there that's such a big part of mindfulness

183
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:20,320
uh then we start kind of seeing more deeply into the cracks of it

184
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:25,440
what else shows itself so it's not digging it's not analyzing

185
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:32,880
but feeling our way deeply into the emotion what else is there and so if it's with anger perhaps

186
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:39,839
what's there with it is hurt what's there with it is is fear and that is what needs our attention

187
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:44,960
that's probably that's more primary and so the messenger is pointing to these

188
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:51,520
deeper underlying kind of feelings that are there if there is grief

189
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:57,280
sometimes the messenger is that there is love and it's like hey have you really taken

190
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:02,160
into account how much their love there's been about what you've lost

191
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:07,359
sometimes the message of of

192
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:12,880
of despair is a message of healing fear

193
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:20,079
or feeling inadequate in some way sometimes the message of the messenger

194
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:26,400
is that it's time to take a deep honest look at the self-identity issues the way we

195
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:32,640
define ourselves the way that we um insert ourselves me myself and mine

196
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:39,359
into our life and some emotions have to do with that either the self the self-identity

197
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:45,359
self-definition we have has been threatened and now so boredom for example sometimes

198
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:53,359
is a symptom of whatever is happening around has no bearing on my self-concept how i

199
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:58,800
like to define myself or assert myself in the world no one's praising me

200
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:04,640
i'm not getting any real kind of praise and no one's criticizing me both

201
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:11,839
of those which are very riveting for some people and without either one of those the situation has no bearing i don't i'm not

202
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:19,440
building up myself in it or it's not threatened with it and so it's boring situation so boredom sometimes the whole

203
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:27,760
you know has to do sometimes with the complex of self-identity sometimes hostility sometimes

204
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,800
fear sometimes all the emotions

205
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:38,480
are closely connected to how threatened or how supported

206
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:45,760
our idea of who we should be is and so by really respecting emotions

207
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:50,880
taking our time making room for it and allowing it then

208
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:56,800
we can start seeing the underlying kind of processes that are going on that are deeper

209
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:03,119
so sometimes you can ask you know what is the message here in this emotion

210
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:09,359
and um and that way also it's very respectful of emotions it's kind of like they they

211
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:15,839
all have something to say they all they're not accidental incidental they're all represent some

212
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:23,359
deeper thing that's going on it doesn't require analysis when you do vipassana practice but what it involves

213
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:28,640
is this kind of more sensitive looking this more sensitive being present breathing with

214
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:33,760
it taking making room for it allowing it to be there so that

215
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:41,280
we can hear the subtler messages that are going on with it we can see the subtler process that goes on

216
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:47,280
and part of this permission for emotions to be there part of this respect for emotions

217
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:52,800
is that the emotions themselves

218
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,800
have the wisdom to process themselves to find their way to

219
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:04,960
peace if we make room for it if we really make space for it if we don't interfere with

220
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:11,920
them or or grab a hold of them or repress them or um if we don't you know acting on

221
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:16,960
emotions especially when you're in meditation interferes with that deeper process

222
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:22,240
towards healing towards peace to resolution that it's kind of inherent in the

223
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:27,760
emotions themselves so to respect emotions

224
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:33,599
and uh if you are challenged with an emotion um

225
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:39,119
and you know it's really caught you in some powerful way

226
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:45,119
and you would like to try this respect thing you might

227
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:50,960
put your hands together in the anjali and bow to your emotions

228
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:56,480
and just bow and if you want to you know really do something powerful

229
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:03,760
you about you bow and say thank you thank you for what you're trying to

230
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:09,920
do for me or the message you're bringing or how this is the best i can do at the moment to try to work with this

231
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:16,079
difficult world but it's going to bow to the emotions and um

232
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:21,520
and as a way of of um

233
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:28,319
as an alternative to being entangled reactive judgmental for there

234
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:34,960
and uh you might try it it's possible that one of the greatest goods you can do for

235
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:42,480
your emotional life is to offer a deep respect to it and maybe even a kind of reverence for

236
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:48,160
it that gets you out of the way of it but in meditation

237
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:55,359
protects you from acting on it in ways that may or may not be healthy

238
00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:02,359
so um thank you and

239
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:10,640
and then we'll continue tomorrow on this topic so for today for the next 24 hours

240
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:16,319
um you might if you this idea of bowing to your emotions is at all interesting for

241
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:22,400
you you might either do it or physically or you might actually do it in your imagination

242
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:27,520
try bowing to your emotions and see what happens but

243
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:33,119
but give room for your emotions that's the most important thing and if you have enough ability to take a

244
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:38,240
break if you're in the middle of something work or family life or something and you have a strong

245
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:43,760
emotional response and you don't usually do this see if you can go take a walk around the

246
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:49,359
block with it take the emotions with you yeah just like you could take them take the

247
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:56,160
emotions for a walk and and use that maybe as a time to make room for it to respect respect

248
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:02,000
it listen to it more deeply and see what happens if you if that's an alternative to how you

249
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,760
usually are with emotions um try this alternative try the respect

250
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:15,838
thing for and see what happens over the next time so thank you
