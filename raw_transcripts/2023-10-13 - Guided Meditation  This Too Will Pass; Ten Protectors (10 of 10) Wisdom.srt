1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:07,759
so hello everyone and welcome

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,359
and we're coming now to the end of this two week series on the 10

3
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:24,160
protectors and to begin the meditation and and to that leads into the talk in

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:32,920
the last protection I'll tell a Sufi story there was once a a person who went

5
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:40,840
to a Sufi master and uh with a ring and said can you inscribe on the ring uh

6
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,000
some piece of wisdom that will be always be useful for me to carry everywhere where I

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,640
go and so the Sufi Master said okay and took the ring and said come back in a

8
00:00:52,640 --> 00:01:00,800
week and uh after a week the person returned and the Sufi Master handed

9
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:07,240
the person the ring and inscribed on the outside of the Ring were the words this

10
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,720
too will pass this too will

11
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:21,040
pass the zen teacher Suzuki roshi summarized uh

12
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,920
Buddhism um in two in three words kind of phenomenal that this is three words

13
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:34,600
that he he thinks encapsulate all of Buddhism not always

14
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:42,320
so not always so this too will pass not always

15
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,798
so it won't always be the way it

16
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,759
is and um so in this meditation you might want

17
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:58,000
to consider this too will pass and if

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,200
something doesn't pass if you have IDE a that something is not changing at all

19
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:12,840
chances are that it's a memory or an idea maybe an idea that compares to

20
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:20,239
what's happening now with something else and in a in a way the memory might

21
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:27,440
not be a changing thing it might represent something that will never happen again maybe an

22
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,200
idea might be especially in comparison to something else might have some truth

23
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:40,200
to it but in the moment the time we're meditating those are ideas

24
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,440
memories and they too will pass even in the course of the meditation you won't

25
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:52,159
forget them but they these as thoughts as ideas as memories they too come and

26
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:57,200
go this too will pass and so as we sit

27
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:04,239
today uh you might sit with um orientation

28
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,519
perspective of how everything that's occurring also

29
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:15,360
passes every inhale comes to its end every exhale

30
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,680
comes to an end maybe most sounds unless it's a

31
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:29,799
drone constant drone most sounds will come and go some return immediately but still

32
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:36,760
they pass and maybe remember to also see that

33
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:43,080
thoughts pass ideas pass in the momentto moment flow of what the mind is

34
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:49,280
concerned with and thinking memories are part of this passing constant

35
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,360
passing and there's something profound about just allowing things to pass to be

36
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:02,599
in the place of attention where we just sub seede things arise and pass kind of

37
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:08,280
like we're sitting at the edge of a river and just watch the river go by and

38
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:14,159
anything floating on the top of the river comes and goes comes and goes

39
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,840
everything flows and when we're fully in that

40
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:26,240
perspective we discover that we become part of the river too we're just flowing

41
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:33,360
coming and going so this too will pass so to assume

42
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,360
a meditation posture and one of the paradoxes is that

43
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,520
the more stable and still you can be in your posture and

44
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:50,080
with your mind the easier is to see

45
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:56,720
that all things are passing there's just a constant flow a

46
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,520
river of experience just flowing through through and flowing

47
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:09,320
by occasionally with little Eddies big Eddies where we get swirl around and

48
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:15,479
around and no longer in the current but eventually everything

49
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:23,280
returns to the river of change flowing on this to will

50
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:31,039
pass for this these minutes here this two will pass

51
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:38,039
gently closing your eyes and notice that as you take some

52
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:43,759
deep breaths and relax some of the tension in your body the holding might

53
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,440
soften a

54
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:02,280
bit relaxing on the exhale might also soften something in the

55
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:22,759
mind letting the breathing return to normal and continue for a few

56
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:28,039
breaths to relax so some of the tension

57
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:32,160
passes so degree of

58
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:54,759
it Relax The Thinking mind soften in the

59
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
mind

60
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,319
and then settling into the body breathing

61
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:42,639
with the perspective that each breath each inhale and exhale comes and passes

62
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,039
arises appears and

63
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:58,039
disappears sitting with a perspective that

64
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:05,120
sees the passing of all

65
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:12,440
things that are occurring in the present

66
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:19,918
moment and if they're not occurring in your direct

67
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:27,280
experience they are thoughts ideas images

68
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:35,880
memories that those two will not always be present they'll

69
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,959
come and go maybe [Music]

70
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:46,160
return settle back and allow all things

71
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:53,000
in their own way to pass away don't hold on to

72
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,920
anything don't pick up

73
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,160
anything sitting

74
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,600
quietly watching the river of

75
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
change

76
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120

86
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:29,680
if you're not mindful we can be operating as if things

87
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,199
have some

88
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,240
permanence if we're aware directly now here and

89
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:50,040
now then all things are constantly

90
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:56,480
changing in the way that we experience

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:05,360

can settle in can settle with a pull of

gravity relaxing to

107
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:23,158
observe the river of change Here and

108
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
Now

114
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,000
here in our body and

115
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,679
mind to see the river of change to

116
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:35,559
see all that comes and goes and

117
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:46,039
passes is to be in a cleansing River a river that

118
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:49,039
refreshes

119
00:23:52,440 --> 00:24:00,320
cleanses so we can be fresh and clean in how we return to the

120
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,840
world Let the River of CH

121
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:16,080
change dissolve whatever is tight and tense whatever holding there

122
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
is

e

126
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,720
and then as we come to the end of this

127
00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:29,600
sitting to appreciate any benefits that have come from sitting quietly

128
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:36,039
any ways in which we might be calmer more

129
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:39,519
mindful more

130
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:48,640
patient any ways in which we have been cleansed of some of

131
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:55,840
our attachments and holdings and resentments

132
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:04,679
fears any ways in which we appreciate being

133
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:12,240
present with Clarity attention capacity

134
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:20,600
to offer attention and may we offer our

135
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:29,520
attention may we offer our kindness may we offer our

136
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:40,600
willingness to let go of resentment let go

137
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:49,159
of greed so we can gaze upon the

138
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:54,200
world with care with

139
00:27:54,919 --> 00:28:02,039
kindness with an ability to see all beings in with friendly

140
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,320
eyes to care for their welfare and

141
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:15,120
happiness knowing that when people really know

142
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:23,080
happiness and have real deep welfare they will be

143
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:31,720
kind may all beings be

144
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:39,039
happy may all beings be safe may all

145
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:46,320
beings be peaceful may all beings be

146
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:55,600
free and may this community of ours sits together these mornings there so many of

147
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,760
us may spread for from out out from us into this world this

148
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:09,480
day acts of kindness and compassion care support the people around us

149
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:16,320
strangers people known and not known to us let the goodness of our practice and

150
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:24,159
our community spread out into the world for the happiness and Welfare of

151
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:36,029
all [Music]

152
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,880
thank

153
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,320
you

154
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:29,120
so we come to the end of these 10 talks on the 10

155
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:37,840
protectors and the final one is wisdom and but maybe appreciating that

156
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:43,720
wisdom as a way that protects us maybe it's we can think of pretty obvious ways

157
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,840
in which it does we go through the world wise and with our eyes open and

158
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:56,080
understanding of how to behave and how to be there's many ways that wisdom supports us and helps us protect

159
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:03,200
others and and the in this in this list of 10 protectors the Buddha gives a

160
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:10,240
particular meaning to it and um and so but I want to uh

161
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:18,120
appreciate it it's the last of the list of 10 so there's nine before and the uh assumption here is

162
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:24,519
that uh we have something to protect in ourselves and that's worthy of

163
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:33,320
protection worthy of caring for worthy of support and that uh there wonderful kind of one

164
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:38,960
aspect of these 10 protectors is that these 10 things

165
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:45,120
themselves are so wonderful that it's worth protecting them that somehow we

166
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:52,360
protecting the very things that protect us and uh and which helps us to thrive

167
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:57,679
we protect the very things that help us protect others that let us be someone

168
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:02,799
who serves and cares for the world around us and is safe for other people

169
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:09,440
so it's kind of a wonderful list so and I think of them sometimes these lists in Buddhism as being

170
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,720
Progressive one Builds on the other so the first

171
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:23,480
one is um uh that protects is just basic virtue basic ethical Integrity a basic

172
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:29,919
living by the five precepts we protect ourselves to some degree certainly from

173
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:35,720
ourselves uh putting ourselves in situations that uh are very harmful for

174
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:41,600
ourselves but also we tend to protect ourselves from others the world tends to

175
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:49,480
uh treat people who are ethical better than those who are unethical and um but the uh so the

176
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:55,320
begins with like many things in Buddhism it begins with the foundation of

177
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:03,159
Ethics um one when we have the foundations of Ethics then we're prepared for the next protector which is

178
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:09,320
to study the Dharma to learn the Dharma to take it in in some deep way if we

179
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:17,200
live an unethical life the Dharma can't really penetrate us the teachings can't really come in in some way because the

180
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,360
teaching the teachings kind of undermine the very motivations the very way of

181
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:28,799
being that's unethical but to be ethical kind of cre creates the kind begins creating kind of

182
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:34,600
the ability in the mind and heart to receive and understand the teachings so

183
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:42,559
studying the teachings protect us we understand what the teachings are about and then having good friends so we

184
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:47,960
understand the teachings enough that now we understand that there are good

185
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:53,880
spiritual friends beautiful friends who have are are are maybe more

186
00:33:53,880 --> 00:34:00,360
practiced than we are and more rooted in the dharm than we are and uh and to love

187
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:06,039
them to care for them to have them these good friends in our lives so that they

188
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:13,358
can Inspire us they can guide us they can um help us understand the Dharma more and not just understand the Dharma

189
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:18,440
as teachings but understand how they get integrated into how we live our

190
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:25,560
lives so ethics then studying the Dharma then having friends who live the Dharma

191
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:33,200
good friends spiritual friends and then um uh being someone who's easy to

192
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:38,800
correct someone's easy to speak to if we have good arm our friends then if we

193
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:46,000
want to benefit from our teachers from our more experienced practitioners around us be someone who's easy to talk

194
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,440
to you're willing to hear what they have to say we don't protest and this is particularly important when we have the

195
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:58,640
benefits the wonderful Treasure of having people who willing to point out

196
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:05,800
uh our faults point out where we're off where we're causing harm in the world and stuff like that and this is since

197
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:12,240
time of the Buddha is considered to be a treasure to have people like that in our lives and so to have people somehow who

198
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:17,520
lovingly caringly care for us very much but they're willing to kind of help us

199
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:24,400
understand where we need to kind of focus on more to to not uh you know just

200
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:31,280
to really clarify and grow and develop and um so it'd be easy to speak

201
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:37,000
to and not be defensive so be virtuous so you can

202
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:43,440
study the Dharma study the Dharma so you can appreciate the people who live by the Dharma and have good friends uh have

203
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,640
good good spiritual friends so that and then be easy to speak to so they can

204
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:54,880
really help you and support you and then uh care for the sa care for your

205
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:00,880
practice community care for the community of of people who are supporting you and and um and so it's a

206
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:08,560
mutual relationship you're able to kind of practice generosity you're able to take your uh ethical qualities and what

207
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:15,760
you're learning and applying that applying it in a community that uh values it and that supports it and is

208
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:23,040
helping you you develop so then um uh you know caring

209
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:29,720
for your Dharma community and engaging in this process of integrating all this into your life maybe then it's easier at

210
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:35,119
some point to love the Dharma because loving the Dharma is not the Dharma

211
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:41,079
outside of you and this is the the sixth quality loving the Dharma uh but the

212
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:46,720
Dharma is really you and the Heart of it is non-harming to love non-harming so

213
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:54,079
much so that you love it that you love your capacity for non-harming for living a a peaceful life a non-harming life a

214
00:36:54,079 --> 00:37:00,960
Dharma life and so so then uh we're protected by that by non-harming and important

215
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:08,640
ways it's a deeper way than just living by the the precepts and as we learn to live this

216
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,960
life the loving the Dharma we understand that if we love the Dharma we don't want

217
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:20,480
to do anything that harms ourselves we want to do the things that support ourselves we benefit so learning to

218
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:27,200
abandon what is unskillful unhelpful and then pick up and support and develop

219
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:33,560
what is skillful what is beneficial and helpful for us and that's one of the key areas of practice guidelines for

220
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:40,839
practice in Buddhism is to abandon what is unhelpful and and support what is helpful and this is also a protector to

221
00:37:40,839 --> 00:37:45,880
live that way we're protected from causing harm to

222
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:52,880
ourselves and um and then to uh be content with what we

223
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,319
have uh it doesn't mean that you know 100% content contentment with living in

224
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:04,640
poverty or living in in uh in areas of abuse it means that when the basic

225
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:11,319
necessities of our life are are available to us uh don't be greedy for

226
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:16,640
more don't be discontented wanting more and more looking outside of yourself for

227
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:22,760
how to make yourself happy be content with some degree of the basic necessities and the way that it works

228
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:29,280
for you in your life so that you have more time to practice you're more more wherewithal to be present for your

229
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:37,599
experience as you live it rather than looking externally for more validation more pleasure more

230
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:44,000
something and then um uh we're protected by the ninth Factor we talked about

231
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,400
yesterday mindfulness and um and so this is a mindfulness and now really the ability

232
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:58,880
to be present really here with our experience that builds on all the others and then we come to to wisdom so

233
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:05,040
all that process all that if this is a path to practice that we understand of M

234
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,560
maturation then at some point we become ready for wisdom and the reason why this

235
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:16,119
is important to think of it as a end end result of all these steps rather than

236
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:21,640
offering you wisdom first is this particular wisdom that Buddha emphasizes

237
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:28,920
is maybe hard to appreciate it's a lot easy to protest and say it's not good enough it's actually dismissive it's

238
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:34,720
actually U maybe kind of uh indifferent to the world or doesn't understand how

239
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:41,240
the world really is for me so it really takes some deeper uh

240
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:46,480
capacity for attention and and finding a refuge inside

241
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:52,960
oneself not looking externally and so the wisdom particular wisdom that Buddha says that will

242
00:39:52,960 --> 00:40:00,240
protect you is the there one of the protectors is to see I really see the river of

243
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:07,440
change see the river which things arise and pass away come and go and

244
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:16,000
um and if we're really kind of in that stream that is cleansing that's freeing

245
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,839
that kind of um uh protects us from the ways in which we cing and hold on the

246
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:27,200
ways in which we resist unnecessarily and painfully the ways in which we

247
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:33,359
um our attachments then spill out of ourselves into how we uh relate to

248
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:40,680
others and um and this idea of uh that Buddhism has of entering the stream is

249
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:46,440
partly entering the stream of this change constant change constant movement

250
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:51,920
constant coming and going that um is I think is playing off

251
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,960
with an idea that's a metaphor of an idea in Ancient India and maybe still

252
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:02,880
some areas of of India that you can go into uh a river

253
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,319
like the river Ganges to be purified and the Buddha wasn't uh so

254
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:14,480
interested didn't believe in this idea that a river physical River can purify you of your

255
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:21,720
inner challenges your inner ways that you're stuck um uh the inner faults we

256
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:26,800
have that uh for him it we are the river

257
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:32,079
that can purify we become our own protector our own purifier we become our

258
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:39,319
own Liberator when we can kind of allow that River of change inside of us to really

259
00:41:39,319 --> 00:41:44,920
wash through US wash through US wash away our attachments dissolve the way

260
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:52,880
we're stuck dissolve the uh evaporate the ways in which we are afraid and

261
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:58,760
anxious and and tight and restricted there's something about beginning to

262
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:04,359
appreciate and sense and feel the way that all things are constantly flowing

263
00:42:04,359 --> 00:42:09,839
through and the challenge in this is the is that um we have all kinds of things

264
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:15,839
that we recognize this is never going to change we have a loss and how can these Buddhists say that everything is

265
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:22,800
changing when this loss is permanent and um or we compare ourselves

266
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:28,240
to someone else uh you know I'm always going to be X where other people have

267
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:34,800
the advantage they are Y and so we're comparing ourselves to others and um but

268
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,960
these things when we close our eyes and sit quietly in meditation we come to

269
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,240
appreciate that these are all in the meditation the they have some truth in

270
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:52,040
the world outside of ourselves that we don't want to deny and be wise about but in

271
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:57,280
meditation we see that sitting quietly at home in our ourselves

272
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:04,599
here where we're kind of in a certain kind of way uh allowed to be ourselves

273
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:10,079
fully and completely like we're perfect just the way we are

274
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:16,240
that uh we see that loss in this moment is a

275
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:23,079
memory the loss is real but in the momentto moment experience of change it

276
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:30,160
comes to us as a memory in the how we compare ourselves to someone else I'm X and their y in the

277
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:35,640
momentum experience that's an idea a thought of the mind that makes a

278
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:43,559
comparison those memories those thoughts those ideas um they themselves come and go

279
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:48,839
they're part of the stream of change and if we understand that and

280
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:54,119
allow ourselves to see that see it then we're not going to have those weigh us

281
00:43:54,119 --> 00:44:00,960
down they're not going to grate us us they're not going to um uh uh add salt

282
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:06,160
to our wounds we're going to see them just flowing and moving through and it's

283
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:13,760
hard to are willing to do that because it can seem like a betrayal to our ideas betrayal to our memories but this is a

284
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:22,000
cleansing a deeply cleansing process that um from time to time it's

285
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,200
good to go take a shower you know to we clean when we go back into the world

286
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:33,079
just like it's good to bathe it once in a while uh physically it's good to do

287
00:44:33,079 --> 00:44:40,119
this inner bathing this inner uh cleansing that comes when the

288
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:47,200
mindfulness is stable enough strong enough that we can really be here in the present moment and just allow ourselves

289
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:55,640
to rest in the changing streaming flowing uh uh flow of experience moment

290
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:02,559
to moment moment where we see this too will pass this too will

291
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:11,960
go this to comes and goes flows and streams and here is what's this is the

292
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:17,720
experience that liberates us from our attachments liberates us from holding on

293
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:24,400
liberating us from freezing and holding what is there liberates us from having

294
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:31,319
to dip the pale a bucket into the stream of our life and then go car go around

295
00:45:31,319 --> 00:45:38,599
carrying the bucket maybe for the rest of our lives and some of us have carried are carrying

296
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:44,800
many many buckets but the buckets is not the stream of

297
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:49,920
life we protect ourselves through wisdom through wisdom of change and

298
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:55,079
impermanence and inconstancy and if we cleanse ourselves

299
00:45:55,079 --> 00:46:01,040
from that then we can go into the world and be a

300
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:06,800
better protector for the world and all these 10 protections maybe we can be

301
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:13,359
that way and how we care for this world that desperately needs more protectors

302
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:22,040
desperately needs people coming from this deep experience of love and kindness and support and wisdom may it

303
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:29,558
be that as we protect ourselves we protect the world thank

304
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,040
you
