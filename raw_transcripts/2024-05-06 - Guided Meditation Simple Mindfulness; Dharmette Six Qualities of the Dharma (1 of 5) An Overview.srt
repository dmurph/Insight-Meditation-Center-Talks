8

9
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,600
live in Santa Barbara and I teach in aanga here um as well as uh for IMC and

10
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:05,079
IRC are are Retreat Center in uh in Santa

11
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:16,320
Cruz so let's uh let's begin as we as we do with the with the

12
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,840
meditation and uh I always like to mention posture at

13
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,040
the beginning of a sit I think it's uh it's really important and uh after we've

14
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:33,960
been practicing for a while we can tend to ignore it you know and uh and the way

15
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:40,320
our body is held has a really uh a strong effect on our minds as well as uh

16
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:48,600
our bodies and our on our whole systems and so if our posture can stay uh um uh

17
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,920
in a an orientation that supports being present in meditation then our

18
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:01,280
meditation is definitely going to benefit so take a little time right now

19
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:08,759
with your posture just finding a way of sitting that uh encourages this balance of

20
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:17,560
alertness and ease that is so supportive of of staying present as we as we

21
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:28,760
said just letting all the muscles that aren't necessary to keep you upright let

22
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:35,599
them soften and if you're sitting or standing let your spine be upright but

23
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,879
not

24
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,640
rigid and take some some time to notice where there's more

25
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:57,519
attention in the body maybe in the face the forehead or

26
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:05,000
the the jaw the neck and the the shoulders the upper

27
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:12,840
shoulders a special attention to those areas or any any areas where you

28
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:21,239
habitually hold tension often tension in those upper

29
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:28,360
areas around the the head and neck and upper shoulders uh is related to mental

30
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:35,280
tension so easing easing the muscles there it can

31
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,560
sometimes lead to some easing in the mind as well

32
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:12,519
let your chest be open so the breath can flow

33
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:17,000
easily in and out

34
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:44,720
let your belly be soft just uh touch into the way it moves

35
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,560
as you breathe now if the belly is relaxed it

36
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,600
will move with a

37
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:03,000
breath and softening softening the belly can often soften

38
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,199
tension in the mind just as the the upper parts of the

39
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,759
body softening and soften the

40
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:27,840
Mind breathing in this being present too the whole body

41
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:41,280
I'm breathing out and letting the whole

42
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:51,440
body be in as much ease as possible as soft as open as possible

43
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:32,599
let the breathing be at the at the center of your awareness and and know it clearly know it

44
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:48,680
directly don't don't exclude what else is going on within

45
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:57,800
you just let uh let all the sensations be known as they arise

46
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:07,720
their thoughts just know them and let them

47
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:14,160
go just a very simple practice of

48
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
awareness

49
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
e

50
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
e

51
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
e

52
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
e

53
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
e

54
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

55
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
e

56
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
e

57
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,200
e e

58
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:47,120
and periodically as we sit here it can be useful to just um give a little

59
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,600
attention to your posture again to to notice if there are areas of tension

60
00:12:52,600 --> 00:13:00,959
that have crept back in since the the beginning of the set

61
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:07,880
might notice if those are associated with particular kinds of thinking

62
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:15,079
emotion that are arising and just see if you can let

63
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:22,800
those relax as the body

64
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,920
eases if the mind eases as

65
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
well

66
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,079
e e

67
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

68
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

69
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

70
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

71
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

72
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

73
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

74
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

75
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

76
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

77
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,640
e e

78
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:10,720
there can be such Simplicity in just uh just attending to what's arising in our

79
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:24,000
experience not moving into past or future and speculating about the

80
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,640
present just knowing what's happening

81
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:35,679
it's really it's a real gift that we give ourselves when we do

82
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:43,520
this there like a bomb with the

83
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:53,240
spirit it's uh it's so simple and yet it's very

84
00:21:54,679 --> 00:22:00,520
profound it's a kindness

85
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

86
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
for

87
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

88
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

89
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

90
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

91
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

92
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

93
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

94
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

95
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
e

96
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,120
e

97
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,120
e

98
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,039
e

99
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,080
e e

100
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:08,559
and uh if you've felt any uh any sense of ease as you practiced this morning

101
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:14,240
and uh felt a sense of support from from your

102
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:20,880
practice I invite you I really encourage you to to stay connected to that sense

103
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:28,880
of ease and and support and to carry it into into the world with you

104
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:36,960
into uh all the things that uh you do and the people you meet

105
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,880
today let it

106
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:00,960
spread for

107
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:07,159
so uh as I said uh before the meditation it's really a pleasure uh to be here

108
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:14,279
with you um and if you weren't here at the very beginning um maybe you aren't aware that Gil's teaching a retreat for

109
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:19,480
two weeks uh uh the next two weeks and then he'll be away for the following

110
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:25,240
week as well so uh I'll be uh sitting in this week and next week will be May

111
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:32,240
Elliott and we're not quite sure who the third week will be and uh and I also mentioned that I've

112
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:39,639
participated in this 7 a.m. sit you know along with many hundreds of you uh many

113
00:32:39,639 --> 00:32:46,880
hundreds of times over the last four years it's amazing to me that it's been four years and I'm really happy to be

114
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,120
here in a in a different role this week being the one who speaks and I hope it

115
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:56,639
will be useful to you

116
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:04,159
so uh of course there are a lot of different ways uh to approach Buddhist

117
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:11,960
practice Buddhist thought Buddhist religion if you if you think of it in that way um some people treat Buddhism

118
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:17,080
as a kind of an Orthodoxy with things to believe in that uh can make us feel

119
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:22,519
secure in a difficult world something outside ourselves you know a support but

120
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:28,639
an external support a belief system

121
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:37,880
and some people um treat the path more uh more often as a um did I turn off

122
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:43,360
original sound I hope I did yes no I

123
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:48,440
did okay that was something I forgot to do

124
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:55,480
um excuse me if there's been an echo there was a something going on so I said

125
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:00,880
some people treat the the Buddhist path as an Orthodoxy um a support from

126
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:06,240
outside ourselves a belief system that that makes us feel safe perhaps in a in

127
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,320
this world and some people treat the path more as a a self-help program you

128
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:17,960
know a toolkit that helps us to be more effective more kind uh happier in our

129
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:24,398
lives and some uh some some people focus for the most part um on having Pleasant

130
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:30,960
and peaceful and deep meditations you using the practice perhaps as a a respit

131
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:38,398
from pain in in their lives and then some people engage with the Dharma as a

132
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:45,158
a lifelong uh path to Freedom a path to Liberation from

133
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:50,919
clinging to any any kind of inclination in the mind any movement in the mind

134
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:58,599
towards uh greed hatred and delusion and you know all all of those

135
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:05,359
ways of uh of approaching the Dharma are legitimate but of course I'm here to

136
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:11,200
advocate for seeing it as a path to Freedom it's uh the idea that it's

137
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:16,400
possible to come to a complete uh sense of freedom of heart and mind in this

138
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:24,040
lifetime that that's really inspiring to me and whatever our motivation for

139
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:32,480
practice uh when we encounter Buddhist teachings when we listen to talks when we read ancient texts or uh or modern

140
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,920
books or magazine articles about Buddhism we all relate in different ways

141
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:44,200
to the teachings that we come in contact with some of us will uh take what we

142
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:52,040
hear or read on faith not questioning it at all um and some of us might trust the

143
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:58,480
interpretation of uh one particular teacher might have a favorite um

144
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:04,880
and when that person presents the teachings we really we really connect and some of us might consider that what

145
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,920
we hear or read that it makes sense we might just be looking at it more

146
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:15,280
intellectually or intuitively know oh this makes sense to me this fits and

147
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:20,480
some of us are kind of more skeptical only accepting teachings that uh

148
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,960
resonate with what we already believe about about

149
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:31,680
life so the boo Buddha the Buddha described three General ways that people

150
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:37,680
connect with spiritual teachings uh some people the Buddha called traditionalists

151
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:44,119
those who base their beliefs on scripture or on oral tradition those who pretty much take things on

152
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:51,960
faith and uh another group he called reasoners and investigators who rely on Logic on

153
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:59,280
analytical reasoning to make their assessments of what they're hearing what they're reading

154
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:07,079
in the third group he called experientialist those who base their belief on their own direct knowledge

155
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:12,640
that is their approach is empirical and the Buddha counted himself among this

156
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:18,000
third group what he understood and taught he said was based on his own

157
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,119
experience what he had come to know directly as a result of practice not

158
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:29,480
dependent on an external Authority

159
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:38,040
and I I think it's useful for us to be conscious of the ways that we personally tend to approach uh any system of

160
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:46,119
knowledge whether it's religious or political or social just in general in our lives do we unconsciously hold views

161
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:54,079
or attitudes that come from our families from our culture from what we learned in school you know for I'm sure that's

162
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:59,680
that's true for many of us for for most of us maybe for all of us do we take

163
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:06,319
those things on faith you know or do we question them or are we more likely to look at ideas intellectually just

164
00:38:06,319 --> 00:38:14,760
judging them to be well thought out rational aligned with reality or do we tend to try ideas out

165
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:24,560
and see if they actually make a difference in our lives leading to more of what we'd like to see in ourselves

166
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:34,000
I think recognizing the ways that we tend to develop views around any subject

167
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,079
that we're interested in is really useful to look at and we're probably

168
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:45,119
using the same strategies to arrive at the way we relate to the

169
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:50,480
Dharma so it's good to be a aware you know and maybe we're taking things on

170
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:56,920
faith that could be investigated with h with more fruitful result maybe we're

171
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:04,079
depending on our intellectual understanding without testing to see whether our beliefs are really congruent

172
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:10,119
with our lived experience we're encouraged in our

173
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:16,920
Dharma practice to investigate to see if the Dharma teachings actually reflect

174
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:22,920
our own experience we're encouraged to do that we inquire into the teachings we come in

175
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:27,960
contact with and as our mindfulness uh of

176
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:35,760
strengthens our Sati our awareness as it strengthens we're able to pay closer attention to our own experience than we

177
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:42,640
probably ever have before in our lives and we learn from

178
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:48,440
that when I make a claim about Dharma practice I want to be really clear what

179
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:53,480
I'm basing that claim on for example you know I can tell you that as I was

180
00:39:53,480 --> 00:40:00,920
getting dressed this morning I was kind of hurrying and uh and I can claim that

181
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:07,880
if I'm really present to uh and mindful of this the felt sense of of hurrying in

182
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:13,200
the body as I do it that I'll see the stress in it and I'll be able to let go

183
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:18,800
of it like I'll be able to let it dissipate so you know what am I basing

184
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:26,160
that claim on Did a teacher tell me that this is how practice works you know mindfulness can lead us to seeing stress

185
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:32,319
that we might be ignoring and then allows it to dissipate to let

186
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:40,079
go is it maybe something I just think makes sense it does make sense for sure it makes sense to me hopefully it's

187
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:45,480
actually been my experience often enough that I can feel confident suggesting

188
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:51,119
that uh you know that it works and that's true when I feel a need to hurry

189
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:59,160
I can I can sense the stress in it right away and I can let that stress soften I can ease up I have empirical knowledge

190
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:04,240
about that so that's a really simple kind of

191
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:12,480
um example of course the Buddha considered himself an experientialist one who bases belief on

192
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:19,680
Direct knowledge not simply on faith or inference or reasonableness so during the me the

193
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:27,880
mornings this week I I want to talk about six qualities of the Dharma that are related to its empirical nature that

194
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:33,880
can be uh uh experienced directly in our lives and in our

195
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:39,599
practice and I think the list will be uh familiar to many of you maybe all of you

196
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:47,119
but I'm planning also to bring in a list of capacities it comes from a completely different area from the study of

197
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:52,760
literacy and my sense is that the capacities that I'll talk about can

198
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:58,160
really support us in seeing and experiencing these these qualities of

199
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:05,280
the Dharma in in our practice in our lives maybe we could say that one way of

200
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:12,359
looking at our practice is that we're developing more and more skillful literacy about the nature of our

201
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:17,800
experience of life we're learning to read our experience really deeply to

202
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:23,599
make sense of it to make to understand it in deeper and deeper

203
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:31,800
ways I appreciate when I come across something from social science that kind of uh you know really sheds light on on

204
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:37,760
Dharma teachings so these six qualities of the Dharma I'll go through them quite

205
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:43,319
quickly and we'll go through them during the week the rest of the week the the

206
00:42:43,319 --> 00:42:49,079
Dharma first the Dharma is said to be well exp expounded swato

207
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:54,800
swato U the implication is that the way the Buddha taught the Dharma was

208
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:01,960
skillful and what's often mentioned when referencing this statement is that the Dharma is good in the beginning good in

209
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:07,200
the middle and good in the end it's useful All Along The

210
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:12,359
Path the second uh the second quality um

211
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:19,200
in this list is that the Dharma is visible here and now stico it can be

212
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:27,240
examined right here in our own experience it's not something that needs to be taken on face

213
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:35,720
the third quality is that it's immediately effective or Timeless sometimes is as a the translation a

214
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:42,200
Calico we don't have to wait until we're dead or until our next lifetime if we if

215
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:47,480
we um um subscribe to that uh to rebirth

216
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:52,680
to experience it it's always available it's here in our experience and we can

217
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:58,520
see its workings in our minds and hearts as it happens

218
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:05,119
the fourth uh quality is this famous exhortation of The Bu Buddha aaso come

219
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:10,480
and see for yourself so it's often it's translated as in inviting

220
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:17,480
inspection so again this points to the Dharma not being taken simply on faith

221
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:25,280
so we can apply this ourselves we can keep investigating we can keep inspecting keep looking all through the

222
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:29,040
path beginning middle and end

223
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:36,640
and the fifth quality is onward leading fit for being used relevant and uh this

224
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:43,599
is actually my favorite word in the in all the Dharma opo onward leading the

225
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:48,760
practice of the Dharma leads one on towards Freedom towards

226
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:56,599
Awakening and uh and this aspect it points to the fact that our practice over unfolds over time it it naturally

227
00:44:56,599 --> 00:45:02,000
moves moves Us in the direction of more freedom of less clinging less craving

228
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,359
there's a a natural unfolding that takes place if we're practicing sincerely

229
00:45:08,359 --> 00:45:14,640
we're gradually coming to understand what leads to more stress in our lives and what leads to more

230
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:21,240
ease gradually inclining our minds more and more towards what's skillful what's

231
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:26,319
beneficial and after a while our minds and hearts they just incline in that

232
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:31,599
direction naturally organically the Dharma leads us

233
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:38,720
on the six uh the sixth quality is uh that the Dharma is to be experienced by

234
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:44,130
the wise or to be realized by the wise

235
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:51,480
[Music] P it's up to us to walk the path

236
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:56,599
ourselves the goal of practice isn't given by Grace it's not given by Good

237
00:45:56,599 --> 00:46:03,720
Deeds are bestowed by some all powerful god um an analogy that gill often uses

238
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:10,200
is only you can pee for yourself we have to walk the path for

239
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:15,760
ourselves it's the only only way that it can be uh

240
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,960
realized so all six of these point to the path's empirical quality you know

241
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:26,680
there are different aspects of actually experiencing the Dharma playing out in

242
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:31,760
our our lives and uh since there are six of them

243
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:36,920
you know I'll talk about two of them tomorrow so we cover them all in in the

244
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:44,960
in the five days and uh I'll be trying to uh show how capacities that are are

245
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:51,200
useful for developing literacy about reading texts are really very very

246
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:57,680
helpful in becoming skilled at reading our own experience so that the dark

247
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:04,760
can fully unfold in our in our minds in our hearts in our

248
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:11,839
lives so uh so tomorrow I'll begin with these first two qualities of the Dharma

249
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:18,880
that it is uh well proclaimed and uh visible here and now and uh I'll

250
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:24,160
introduce one of the competencies that uh that supports seeing the qualities of

251
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:30,440
the Dharma really expressed in our our practice and uh I look forward to being

252
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:36,319
with you then tomorrow so thank you very much for your attention this morning and

253
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:45,520
uh and uh have a really lovely day or evening whatever time it is for you
