1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:08,200
so uh so good morning folks happy birthday Mary uh 75th birthday one of

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:13,440
our uh sa friends here

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:22,199
um so uh yeah please uh settle in and

4
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:28,920
uh um let's see what

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,960
happens

6
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,120
just

7
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,079
uh settling into posture you can uh say

8
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,960
yes to making whatever ever adjustments you

9
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,840
need

10
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,840
be some uh

11
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,680
gratitude just for for being alive here together

12
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,760
conscious

13
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:54,040
incredible number of things have to go

14
00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:01,680
right for us to be aware

15
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,040
of course it won't always be like this and

16
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:22,280
so we kind of uh

17
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:28,600
rejoice in Awareness as we begin here

18
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,600
together

19
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,920
there's effort in uh

20
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:34,880
practice kind of subtle effort of of uh directing

21
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:41,800
attention preferentially to

22
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:47,760
uh the breath the body feeling the

23
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,320
mind the of

24
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:11,360
uh letting things be amidst

25
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:26,279
imperfection choosing not to fiddle with uh some

26
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
s

27
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:52,279
but we also want to attune to uh what is effortless what requires

28
00:10:52,600 --> 00:11:01,040
nothing of uh of us doesn't create a sense of uh burden

29
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,879
on the meditating

30
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
self

31
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,800
so there's uh an aspect of awareness that

32
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:54,160
uh doesn't depend on

33
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
you

34
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:17,279
can't be initiated by an act of

35
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,160
will nor can it be

36
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:37,000
stopped but when we are in fact

37
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:49,639
aware can appreciate the uh effortlessness of it that this doesn't

38
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:55,600
actually burn any attentional

39
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
calories

40
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:12,480
just

41
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:34,920
awake because it doesn't uh depend on you

42
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,880
whatever you think you

43
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,040
is you can

44
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:57,320
uh completely take your hands off all the levers and

45
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
knobs

46
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:18,760
because this uh dimension of awareness doesn't depend on you you whatever you

47
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:25,679
is can uh completely

48
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
relax

49
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,559
it's a little like the the awareness blooms and

50
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:12,280
collapses collapses into an object into a

51
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:33,760
thought and then uh come to appreciate mindfulness as a certain kind of

52
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
Grace

53
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:33,720
we come to witness a a process that

54
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:41,520
uh does not involve our

55
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:55,200
willfulness sense the limitations of our willfulness is a way of

56
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
practicing

57
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:12,400
and of course there's a time for

58
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:29,960
effort and this uh dimension of effortlessness

59
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,440
whatever you can't

60
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:45,399
stop rest

61
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:54,398
there the awareness that you can't

62
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:03,399
stop it's

63
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,520
rest

64
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:59,279
so excuse me um the theme um has been uh the more assertive

65
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:08,240
the more and more receptive qualities of mind and uh today wanted to um say

66
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:17,799
something about uh action and being passive activity and

67
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:25,559
passivity the um is a common question maybe the most most common

68
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:31,000
misunderstanding of uh of equinity is that it's tantamount

69
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,559
to um uh to

70
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:44,559
passivity um but uh shinzen young uh nice language around this that

71
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:50,799
e equinity is a relationship with sensory experience not

72
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:58,080
apathy uh about the objective conditions of the world a relationship to sensory

73
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:03,519
experience not apathy about the world so

74
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:12,720
equinity now does not equal passivity in the next moment or tomorrow or

75
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:19,440
whenever we are uh soft animals and who

76
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:25,200
are compulsively trying to optimize experience

77
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:31,799
and consequently d teachers emphasize the the the passive receptive dimensions

78
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:40,240
of practice often but a lot of that passivity is actually

79
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:47,159
in service of action and a Dharma life requires a lot of

80
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:56,720
action we practice being passive uh so that we can discern what

81
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,880
action buys us and what it costs

82
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:10,519
us Retreat Retreat practice which many of you have done Retreat practice is a

83
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:18,000
kind of experiment in passivity we relinquish almost all

84
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:25,799
choices there's a schedule almost every minute we're told where to be what to

85
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:32,440
do and so we relinquish almost all decision making we we sort of take our

86
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:41,279
hands off all all the knobs right and we we practice a kind of

87
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:47,480
radical form of of passivity experimenting a kind of

88
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:52,679
experiment that exactly what this moment

89
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,039
offers is enough or maybe we say is right

90
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:07,279
and we're no longer kind of in in Retreat for example we're no longer

91
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:13,720
using this moment to predict the trajectory of our day our

92
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:23,000
week our life this moment this moment has really no meaning outside of this

93
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:30,720
moment I don't know whether it's right but but it me is like maybe we're practicing a kind of

94
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:37,440
momentary nihilism we're momentary nihilist just

95
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:44,679
right now but in doing

96
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:51,240
that uh we begin to understand where our

97
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:58,360
habitual actions come from what they accomplish the agitation

98
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:04,799
they cost the relief that they buy us the relief that actions buy us and the

99
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:09,480
relief that never never

100
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:21,158
comes and so uh this is a kind of this is a cultivation of our own heart and it

101
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:27,679
um makes life whatever it brings richer more poignant Freer

102
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:34,280
we could just say better makes life better to cultivate

103
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:42,240
this and uh these kind of experiments in passivity also help

104
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:48,040
us become more effective in our

105
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:57,760
action is maybe not emphasize so much but practice it it shapes our mind

106
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:06,280
but then our mind shapes our life and it's a kind of virtuous um

107
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:14,000
cycle so part of Dharma practice is about making our actions

108
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,800
more effective and

109
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:28,079
efficient yeah is it not just the the receptivity it's about making our actions more effective and efficient and

110
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,039
part of how we excuse

111
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:44,000
me part of how we uh we do this is uh through developing our

112
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:51,640
understanding like if we do not understand this foundational Noble Truth

113
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:58,680
that there is Dua there is uh incompletion the moment

114
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:06,280
is incomplete um if we do not understand that if we do not understand a nich that

115
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:11,839
that the world trembles in all directions as the Buddha said if we do

116
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:17,160
not understand these things our actions are actually less effective if they're

117
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:23,760
made on the Assumption of permanence and utopian

118
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,920
fantasy they're less effective if we do not understand the kind of

119
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:36,640
um un quench ability of the craving

120
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:43,839
mind we waste so much energy and time and

121
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,280
money if our actions emerge out of the kind

122
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:58,440
of fever dream of craving rather than the sobriety balance bance of

123
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:05,200
Desire we're less effective because desire desire doesn't

124
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:10,200
forget the first Noble Truth craving always

125
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:19,359
does so many of our calculations in our in our life go something like well if I

126
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:28,599
do this I get that and if I get that I will feel like this whatever this is

127
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:35,920
uh but the basis of of wise action is really understanding that action only

128
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:42,240
changes some karmic streams and not

129
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:54,119
others so we have to know ourselves really well we have to understand pleasure really well in order to be well

130
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:02,319
calibrated we talk um all about the present moment but we're

131
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:09,720
actually getting better at the future at prediction at forecasting our

132
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:15,800
own reactions and predicting the chances of success

133
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:22,280
and predicting forecasting the kind of responses of others

134
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:32,200
too understanding others was reading um uh Allison gnik a

135
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:39,000
developmental psychologist researcher um she's studied how how

136
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:46,280
children's Minds develop you know and uh she writes um love love

137
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:54,480
itself depends on knowledge and Imagination from the time they're very small babies are figuring out theories

138
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:00,880
of love based on what they see the caregivers around them do and say for

139
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:09,400
babies who are so utterly helpless and dependent no theory is as important as a

140
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:14,640
theory of love that's so so beautiful somehow you

141
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:25,440
know it's like no theory is as important as a theory of Love helpless dependent baby yeah

142
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:34,960
and maybe as um adults we we of course keep refining

143
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:41,560
our theory of love and those refinements those

144
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:49,720
calibrations of our theory of love this helps us live and make

145
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:55,680
choices and so we we develop uh we

146
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:02,200
develop a theory of love we develop a theory of of our self self

147
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:08,319
knowledge and uh come to be very aware of our of our strengths and goodness and

148
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:13,839
also our our limitations you know we come to

149
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:20,119
appreciate our limitations in a in an utterly non-m moralistic

150
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:27,240
way uh no there's no ground whatsoever for shame it's just

151
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:34,200
H these are the limits of my equinity and to know the limits of our

152
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:39,800
equinity and respect those limits is important in

153
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:45,359
actually uh acting wisely right we talk

154
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:53,040
about like believing in ourselves and trust and all this yeah that's right but we also got to know what our nightmares

155
00:40:53,040 --> 00:41:00,839
are and the places where we just have to honor the kind of depth of our own

156
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:06,640
clinging I you know I I don't mean that in pejorative way it's just like oh yeah

157
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:11,960
I can't I know I can't let go when conditions are like this I can't

158
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:17,240
let go and so then we need to choose a kind of another strategy for dealing

159
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:23,960
that with that in some way and maybe like I I need to do what I can not to

160
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:30,359
put myself in that condition and so we we cultivate a kind of respect

161
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:36,400
for the power of our own habit energies right and yeah we want to work with them

162
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:43,880
we want to expand the capacity of our heart but in determining a kind of we do it subconsciously but in determining a

163
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:52,280
wise course of action the limitations of our equinity has to be a premise in that

164
00:41:53,280 --> 00:42:00,599
argument our actions are uh uh made more effective by understanding others

165
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:09,800
empathy a theory of love we know their goodness are moved by it inspired by it

166
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:16,960
reminded of our own goodness by others uh we bow down to

167
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:25,160
it and we also understand the egoic fragility of

168
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:31,880
others the the kind of uh pressure points in their egoic structure if you

169
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:43,240
do not understand the egoic fragility of others you wind up uh uh often

170
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:53,359
trespassing on sacred terrain and this is not good

171
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:59,839
for relations right we have to kind of in a sense

172
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:05,760
respect the zones of clinging of each other and treat those with a certain

173
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,640
kind of uh uh

174
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:20,520
care and so uh we we develop uh in the kind of

175
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:26,880
receptivity passivity we develop certain heart qualities goodness uh

176
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:32,880
and goodwi and Goodwill dissipates a lot of

177
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:39,839
problems um I'm not I'm not uh I don't even

178
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:46,240
really know what the secret is or the law of attraction but everything I do know I

179
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:54,920
don't like it just always struck me as kind of like uh the self- congratulatory

180
00:43:54,920 --> 00:44:00,920
grandiosity of the privileged right did you Manifest this

181
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:06,440
misogyny all this racism

182
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:13,119
no and when love begins

183
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:22,359
to uh seep from your pores uh generally people would become

184
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:28,000
less afraid of you and less defensive

185
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:36,280
and with that a lot of good things start

186
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:41,319
happening so we shape our mind our mind shapes our

187
00:44:41,319 --> 00:44:47,559
life we practice Dharma shapes shapes our inner life and

188
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:55,559
our inner life shapes our our world and uh this is the

189
00:44:55,559 --> 00:45:00,720
virtual a cycle so passivity

190
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:05,880
