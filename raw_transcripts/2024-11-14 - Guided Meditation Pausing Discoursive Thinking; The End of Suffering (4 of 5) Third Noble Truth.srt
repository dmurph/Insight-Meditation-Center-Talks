00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:08,280
hello everyone and welcome to this meditation and what I've been doing this

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,960
week is uh offering some meditation some guided

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:19,960
meditation uh around some of the very basic topics of

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:26,560
um uh inside meditation the way we teach it here at IMC breath body emotions

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:34,320
today on thinking but doing so in a way that um then uh creates a reference

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,800
point or a support for understanding the four noble

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,559
truths so mindfulness of the body is a powerful support for understanding Dua

8
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:53,920
the first Noble Truth of suffering and um mindfulness

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,719
of of uh emotions is a useful reference point for understanding the cause of

10
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:08,479
suffering and today I'm going to do a mindfulness of thinking as a reference point to the cessation of

11
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:14,960
suffering so one of the powerful things in meditation is to understand the

12
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:22,159
difference between discursive thinking and a quieter more deeper more softer

13
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,799
gentler way of thinking which does not involve conversations

14
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:35,040
stories um um projections of imaginary Futures uh doesn't involve movies in the

15
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,560
head or great visions of things to come or things past living in memories

16
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:48,399
there's a simpler thinking that uh has to do with just here and now recognizing

17
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:54,240
what's happening uh little bit giving ourselves very

18
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,000
simple meditation instructions with what is happening so we're thinking a lot

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,880
about the past memories to very gently and quietly have use those thoughts that

20
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:14,920
bring you into the Present Moment by recognizing oh these are memory thoughts

21
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:20,959
and I'm very interested them I'm fascinated by them or I'm getting angry because of

22
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:28,000
them so without any more elaboration just very quietly almost as if you're uh

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,519
your own best friend who's sitting and just listening to you and um kind of

24
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,800
reporting back what's happening naming what's going on for you so you can see for yourself

25
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:47,200
better you're the kindest person you know that's kind of sitting with you and just there knowing seeing directly

26
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:54,000
what's happening now and so thinking about the future all these thoughts of

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,400
conversations we have to have quietly say oh now I'm I'm having a conversation

28
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,200
now I'm uh planning what I'm going to say and and that's what's happening in

29
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:12,000
the present moment and that feels like a lot of tension in my forehead or in my

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,120
brain and with that there'll come a time when you can see that discursive

31
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,879
thoughts thinking stops it doesn't have to stop for long

32
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:31,560
uh we have maybe there's a long runon sentence of what we're telling ourselves something and then there's a period And

33
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,280
there's a pause there's a cessation an ending before there's a new

34
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:44,239
beginning and to start seeing the ending the stopping the

35
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:50,879
pausing in between these discursive thinking conversational thinking uh that

36
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:57,560
we can have in the mind the story-making mind and to feel and sense the end of

37
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:04,079
the story The End end of the conversation not because the partner has

38
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:12,760
ended because it's all in our own mind and so to uh to see it's possible for a few

39
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:20,519
moments to dwell to abide Here and Now breathing

40
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:26,520
attentive from attending from some deeper place inside attending with

41
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:33,120
gentle thoughts that keep you in the present that are about the the present the kind of gentle thoughts about what's

42
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:40,280
happening now that encourages calming down that have a calming effect that

43
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:49,680
slows the discursive thinking down and so that you see that the continual there's the

44
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:56,639
continu the continuity the continuation ongoing stream of story

45
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,680
making that we can live in doesn't have to be

46
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,360
continuous and therefore the impact the influence the

47
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:14,320
conditioning the emotional quality of that thinking doesn't have to keep

48
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,400
churning our hearts there can be a pause there can be a

49
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:26,639
stopping and to begin appreciating valuing that stopping that pause that

50
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:32,520
sensation however brief it might be we often Overlook it because we're so

51
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:38,840
interested in what we're thinking about we're so racing ahead the like a like

52
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:45,680
the classic ancient uh metaphor of a monkey that swings from Branch to branch

53
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:52,199
that as soon as it's grab one branch it's already reaching for the

54
00:05:52,199 --> 00:06:01,639
next and before letting go we're already reaching for the next branch and so there's no pause no stop

55
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:08,120
so taking a meditation posture

56
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,360
and gently closing the

57
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:30,360
eyes and take a few moments to be here and now in a definitive way so there's

58
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,599
no question that you're here and now and

59
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:41,840
maybe that can be done with the support of your body taking some long deep

60
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,800
breaths really feeling your body from the inside out as you breathe

61
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,479
in and then settling relaxing letting

62
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:56,880
go as you

63
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,560
exhale for

64
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:39,199
taking some more deep breaths and maybe pausing and [Music]

65
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,319
holding the at the very top of the inhale or the end of the

66
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:51,919
exhale just very briefly to see if they're in the holding

67
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:57,039
the breath not breathing that there actually can be some

68
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:04,199
deeper connection to the body stepping out of the stories of the

69
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:12,080
Mind a deeper relaxation and then allowing the exhale

70
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,800
allowing the inhale and that pause might be just two

71
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,800
seconds

72
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:54,360
letting breathing return to normal and for three or four

73
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:02,440
breaths relax the body as you exhale e

74
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:41,959
for three or four breaths on the exhale relax the heart the heart

75
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:47,079
center softening in the heart

76
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:18,279
and for three or four breaths relaxing softening

77
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:23,000
calming the thinking mind

78
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:01,120
and then if it's comfortable for you to Center

79
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:09,760
yourself on the body breathing wherever it's easiest or most

80
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:16,600
enjoyable to feel the body breathing in the belly the chest or the

81
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,600
nose

82
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,120
as you feel the body breathing

83
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,040
gently lightly feel that transition from

84
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:12,079
breathing in to breathing out that moment or

85
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,760
two as breathing shifts

86
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:41,079
let the thinking mind become quieter so you can sense and feel the

87
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:47,000
end of the inhale and beginning of the

88
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:03,760
exhale and then do the same for the between the exhale and the inhale

89
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:09,639
feeling the end of the exhale how there's a switch

90
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,880
over to the beginning of the inhale

91
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:53,800
and as you continue breathing when you get to the top of the

92
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,440
inhale notice if your mind has been getting has

93
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,079
gotten involved in discursive

94
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:14,320
thinking and if it has relax soften let go as you exhale

95
00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:02,880
with the exhale let there be a pause in this story making

96
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:13,160
mind the mind that has conversations or lives in memories or Futures fantasy

97
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,959
e

98
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:51,680
at the end of the exhale let there be a pause in thinking

99
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:08,079
and for the moment or two that it pauses appreciate the

100
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,678
quiet appreciate what has become

101
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
still

102
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

103
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

104
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

105
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,720
e e

106
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,799
feel just beyond the edges of your thinking

107
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:34,240
whatever you're thinking doesn't fill the

108
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:41,280
universe there's a before those thoughts there's an after those

109
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:48,200
thoughts and there's all the space in the universe beyond the edges of your

110
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,279
thoughts and realizing

111
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,600
that maybe you can have the pause

112
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,158
cuse of your discursive

113
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:14,960
thinking and appreciate how that part of the mind has become

114
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
quiet

115
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,559
for e

116
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:45,840
we can have a invaluable life

117
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:55,720
without the dominance of discursive

118
00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:05,200
thinking there can be quieter softer gentler ways of thinking about

119
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,440
the

120
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,480
present that reassures the

121
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:26,080
mind so the mind the thinking mind the discursive

122
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:32,320
mind can become quieter

123
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,880
and from time to

124
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:14,360
time we can be aware of the end of

125
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:19,880
Stories the end of discursive thinking

126
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
for

127
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,278
e e

128
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,720
and as we come to the end of this

129
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,840
sitting to appreciate

130
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:07,600
how the ending of story making ending of the continuity

131
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:14,120
of conversations commentary judgments about

132
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:23,320
things creates more space for calm for

133
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:32,120
peace for us to be able to hear a quieter voice

134
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:42,440
within the quiet voice of

135
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:50,720
kindness of care of

136
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:58,880
love that's drown out if we keep living in stories and commentary and

137
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,440
anxious

138
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:18,279
Futures the end of Storytelling can be the

139
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,440
beginning of deeper

140
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:34,720
wisdom may it be that as as we go into our life on this

141
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:45,880
day that we can listen to others more deeply attend and care for others more

142
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:53,120
fully if we don't see the world and see others through the filter of our story

143
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:59,799
making mind the filter of living still living

144
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:04,679
in the memories and or the

145
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:17,080
projections where the quieting of the discursive mind let us be present for the world in

146
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:24,120
a way that brings kindness and friendliness to all

147
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:29,919
beings may all beings be happy

148
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,759
may all

149
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:42,320
beings be peaceful may all

150
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:52,039
beings be safe and may all beings be free

151
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:08,169
[Music]

152
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:16,200
[Music] thank

153
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,960
you e

154
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:35,000
hello and welcome to this this fourth talk on the four noble truths and the general

155
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:42,760
title of this Aries is um the end of suffering and that's the purpose of the

156
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:50,480
for Noble Truth teachings is that the optional emotional pain that we feel the

157
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,639
emotional pain that arises because somehow there's a

158
00:31:55,639 --> 00:32:01,320
reactivity inside of us somehow there's craving there's a

159
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:09,799
compulsion attachment that we engage in and the Very attachment itself is

160
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:15,559
painful and it uh leads to a Cascade of other pains that come when we're holding

161
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:20,679
on tight to something and leads to disappointment and fear

162
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:30,760
and um anger and and uh it contributes to the creation of of um an edifice of

163
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:37,080
abstract ideas of who we are and who we think we should be it's part of our

164
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:43,880
identity is uh the result of our stories we tell about ourselves and stories that

165
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:49,799
our society tells about what it means to be a human being or it says who we

166
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:58,440
are so the first Noble Truth has a lot to do with the accumulation the Gathering Together of all the different

167
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,278
attachments and

168
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:35,360
conceivable we could be something else than than someone who you know than being the suffering that we

169
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:42,760
have but in fact the second Noble Truth says that the the Tangled ball of thread

170
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:49,320
is uh is Tangled is been become Tangled by the force of of

171
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:54,639
craving other place the Buddha talks about clinging and craving being the

172
00:33:54,639 --> 00:34:00,519
seamstress that sews together this edifice this tapestry of attachments

173
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:08,398
that uh often is the we're a walking manifestation of and so to begin getting our handle on

174
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:15,560
this idea of of uh attachment craving clinging compulsion and one of the place to see

175
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:22,320
it is in the story making mind the discursive mind there uh it can be quite

176
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:28,560
phenomenal the spinning of the Mind the the Jing the moving on and on on and on

177
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:34,200
thinking about something and um even if you're successful at letting go and

178
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:40,760
stopping it just comes right back just there to spin out stories and some people have no trouble

179
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:47,040
with the thinking mind and the discursive mind because it's they they just believe it they invested in it they

180
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,398
think that that's who they are and so even though a thinking mind

181
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:59,800
might be the discursive mind might be painful they just go along with it because it has Authority if if we think

182
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:06,200
it we should believe it and um if we think it then it says something about me

183
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:11,680
that who I am whatever there's a way strong attachment to discursive thoughts

184
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:19,760
strong attachment to stories strong identification and sense of self that gets built on uh the domain of

185
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:26,400
discursive conversational uh thoughts that we have commentary that we have uh

186
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,680
the world of judgments and judgments and and about the world around us and of

187
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:36,920
ourselves can all too easily belong to that discursive mind that's spinning and

188
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:43,119
churning and jumping from one branch to the other and uh never letting up and so

189
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:50,680
the continuity of thinking can just give a sense that we're always supposed to be doing this is what life

190
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:56,480
is and um but as we get a handle on craving and clinging and attachment and

191
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:05,160
they begin to soften as we meditate and relax more deeply there are uh Wellsprings inside of

192
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:11,920
deeper sources of understanding even of ways of thinking that are not discursive

193
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:19,760
thinking it's not uh running along telling stories or rehearsing stories or

194
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:25,839
repeating stories of the past and um and one of the remarkable

195
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:33,079
things that can happen is is that um is a uh the discursive mind becomes quiet

196
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:41,400
and still and it can be such a relief it can be such a let it a relief and to have

197
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:48,800
that release and that's why some people distract themselves from their discursive thinking Mind by doing

198
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:57,000
something that's very distracting uh you know uh reading a book or watching a movie or going for a

199
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,920
walk in a park or uh doing some kind of exercise that kind of uh or going to

200
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:08,240
sleep because it stops this endless turning of the mind that is not

201
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:13,640
emotional free it carries a lot of emotional baggage and uh it's almost

202
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:21,119
like we're creating an atmosphere through uh discursive thinking that then that atmosphere comes back and has a

203
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:26,359
profound effect on us it can be a create a conditioning for

204
00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:33,920
ourselves and and so to have that become quiet can be such a relief and it's very important not to

205
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,960
think that meditation is about quieting every thinking there is very subtle

206
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:44,880
quieter thinking uh more like thoughts rather than continuous thinking there's

207
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,480
very quiet quiet thoughts about the present moment that can be come out of

208
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:57,560
wisdom can come out out of kindness can come out of a gentleness or sensitivity to what's happening that's very simp

209
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:03,839
simple and doesn't carry the veilance of attachment doesn't carry the the weight

210
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:11,040
of attachment of clinging of compulsion it just there softly

211
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,319
lightly and we can see that the discursive thoughts and the emotions

212
00:38:16,319 --> 00:38:24,880
that go along with them maybe have stopped for a well have paused and so the second noal Truth uh is the is the

213
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:32,720
sensation of suffering uh which can happen on many different levels but uh maybe for today the

214
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:38,480
accessible level I wanted to emphasize is the cessation of discursive thoughts

215
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:44,800
the ending of it the pause the between one paragraph of thinking we do and then before the next

216
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:51,839
paragraph begins when there's a s put a sentence and end of a s of a sentence in the mind

217
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:58,960
um uh take a break with a movie you're looking at in the mind and cause and

218
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:04,720
appreciate the think the Quiet Mind the more peaceful mind and appreciate the

219
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:10,760
softer quieter ways of thinking that maybe arise out of wisdom out of

220
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:16,440
kindness that are drowned out by the loudness of discursive thoughts and uh

221
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:24,520
that go on and on and so to have that stop the discursive thinking a sensation of it so

222
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:31,880
we can appreciate something much more deeper and more intimate and more integral to what's happening here um

223
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:36,920
deeper reservoirs of of Peace deeper reservoirs of a quiet still Place

224
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:44,920
reservoirs of kindness and love generosity and uh and then we start

225
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:49,960
seeing at some point that the suffering that came with discursive thinking

226
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:55,960
begins to Abate as well and various kinds of suffering and stress distress

227
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:02,920
that we experience we notice that they stop and anytime we notice some kind

228
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:09,720
of uh distress anguish uh

229
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:16,040
stress emotional pain emotional discomfort that has stopped that's an

230
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:22,440
invaluable thing to notice and then the bumper sticker today would be I stop for

231
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:27,920
stopping I stop for the stop so when you when you've noticed

232
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:34,359
that something that was troubling you some mental state was troubling you is no longer there for whatever reason

233
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:42,319
don't just go on to the next thing to do stop yourself and register that take it in

234
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:49,200
feel the sensation of suffering because it's teaching a very important lesson and eventually the

235
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:55,440
lesson is that's uh that the uh that that there is optional emotional

236
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,599
pain that we contribute to and that that can

237
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:06,319
stop that can cease that can come to an end that's the good news so Buddhism it

238
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:13,599
is possible the emotional pain that might remain then is not so difficult there's

239
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:20,319
a whole different relationship to it it's part of the richness of life it's part of where compassion might arise or

240
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:26,960
knowledge and wisdom might arise um and uh when there's no conceit no identity

241
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:34,280
that that uh no tangle of of a ball of thread in which it gets

242
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:40,760
Tangled Up in uh s it's very simple emotional pain that we might still

243
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:46,800
experience the Heartbreak in the world uh becomes very very simple and

244
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:52,920
does not become a burden rather it becomes a source of

245
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:59,640
meaning providing meaning meaning of being of have compassion of care of

246
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:04,960
kindness of living a different way in this world that uh where we're here to

247
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:11,400
support each other and to care for ourselves so the this third Noble Truth

248
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:17,240
the sensation of suffering is a truth that it is

249
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:22,440
possible and and it's not an All or Nothing kind

250
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:30,680
of thing that we can expect to happen today or tomorrow but it's a step by step gradual beginning to appreciate the

251
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:39,800
small Sensations and I want to emphasize today is the the quieting the stopping of

252
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:45,960
discursive thinking which is such a troublemaker for us be

253
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:51,720
careful that you don't invest too much important in the story making

254
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:58,280
mind that you don't give it too much authority over you because the optional

255
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:04,960
suffering that we can experience around our stories has a lot to do by the amount of

256
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:10,720
authority we give those tho we Grant those stories how much we invest

257
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:17,280
ourselves in those stories and how much we identify or our sense of identity

258
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:24,280
gets tangled up in those stories be careful with those and one way to be

259
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:31,920
careful is to begin noticing and seeing all the little places in the day where

260
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:38,040
the story making mind stops for whatever reason and if they stop pause for a

261
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:44,319
little bit even for a few seconds remember the bumper sticker I stop for

262
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:52,480
stopping and uh then there pause even more to take it in feel the goodness of that and see if

263
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:58,680
that pausing of stories can connect you something deeper inside a deeper wisdom

264
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:06,240
deeper love deeper Peace So the cessation

265
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:11,720
of suffering the third Noble Truth and the way

266
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:18,200
to develop that sensation and enrich it and expand it into our life so it be can

267
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:23,520
become fully realized is from what the Buddha call

268
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:29,280
what the Buddha calls the fourth Noble Truth which will be the topic for

269
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:34,319
tomorrow so thank you very much and um

270
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:38,839
may you enjoy Sensations
