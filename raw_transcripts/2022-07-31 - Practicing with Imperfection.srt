1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,960
so hello so today i want to talk about

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,840
perfection and imperfection in relationship to this practice that we do

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:21,760
and um one of the little take-homes i hope to take with you because little slogan

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,880
is the idea that it's better to be righted than it is to be right

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,399
and this is a nautical reference sailboats maybe maybe most of you know that all of

6
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:40,399
you know it may be but sailboats that have a keel

7
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,480
a strong tempest a wind can come and push this elbow over towards the side tip it or tip it

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:52,719
quite far but because the keel is quite heavy the more it gets tipped the more the

9
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,920
keel kind of is heavy in a sense and counters um

10
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:04,720
the the force of the wind or the waves and then the boat and the keel rights the boat

11
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:12,159
uh and both comes to standing a righted boat who understands more or less the mast is vertical again

12
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:19,840
and uh and boats are being tossed around in the sea sailboats and they're constantly being you know righted

13
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,439
and uh and therefore they don't capsize usually and

14
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:32,799
so this wonderful expression to be righted is to come back into balance to come back and to be upright

15
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,640
so the this little slogan is it's better to be righted than to be right

16
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,799
where being right means that you know that you you are right with your opinions you're right with what you

17
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:51,200
do you kind of justified you defend yourself you have an opinion that you feel is the

18
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,399
true opinion and everyone else should know it or you're going to defend it at all costs

19
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,560
and so one has to do with a the second one has to do with a kind of a some idea

20
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:10,479
and ideas come and go and the for the first has to do with your your disposition how you actually

21
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:17,200
are as opposed to what you believe and what you think so it's better to be righted

22
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,400
than to be right and so the practice is to help write us

23
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,160
practice provides a keel a ballast that can help keeps us come back up

24
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:35,360
and we'll get tossed around by the waves of life all the time and but if we have a keel

25
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,440
something like that we'll get will become righted and that's part of the function of mindfulness

26
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,879
is that it's partly functions as a keel just to know the clarity of knowing what's happening

27
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:53,840
begins that movement to be righted to be come back up straight straight upright or something

28
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:00,000
so that's kind of a little bit the one of the takeaways i'm hoping you'll understand by this talk

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,360
so but the theme perfection and imperfection is that

30
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,959
the buddhist tradition if you listen to teachers and read about it and the ancient texts

31
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,840
is that it lends itself or has a kind of a shadow side or lends itself to this idea of

32
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,159
perfection and that there's some you're trying to attain something perfectly

33
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:28,239
and i think it's most represented by the by the

34
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,920
idea that someone is fully enlightened here we have the word fully enlightened

35
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,360
there's partially on there's a fully enlightened or perfectly enlightened the buddha was said to be perfectly

36
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,040
enlightened that if someone gets fully enlightened they have

37
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,080
overcome all suffering they freed themselves from all suffering

38
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,840
you know there's no room for suffering then that's perfect perfectly free of suffering

39
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,280
they've someone has perfectly freed themselves from all their defilements

40
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,519
all their attachments and then well short of this kind of idea of perfection

41
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:14,480
is the idea that there's like perfect meditation experiences for mindfulness practitioners you can be

42
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,759
completely in the present moment without the mind wavering whatsoever perfectly

43
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,199
present or people who do concentration practice you can enter into a deep state of

44
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,479
concentration where the mind does not waver does not get distracted into any

45
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,280
kind of distraction and you can be perfectly there

46
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,800
all these things i believe are true it's possible to attain all these things

47
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,440
but it sets up a big shadow side or downside where people then are measuring

48
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:53,840
themselves against the perfect standard and you know i'm supposed to be perfect

49
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,919
i'm supposed to manage just you know not have to any problems here and i'm not supposed to waver i'm not supposed to be

50
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:07,759
distracted i'm not supposed to have any attachment and heaven forbid that i come to buddhist center and show anger

51
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:14,400
because anger is like one of our you know like that's not being kind and so the shadow side of buddhist

52
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,160
organizations like ours is that people sometimes are kind of hold and check their anger because

53
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,240
you're not you're supposed to be kind here and so people don't you know like admit that they're

54
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,440
angry or they hold it back or they do something and so the shadow side is we have this

55
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,600
imperfect side that then we deny we hide we push away

56
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:44,240
and we're trying to hold it up perfectly when i was a zen student there was this idea that that

57
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,639
there was something to some way of being there was an it that was never defined

58
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:57,840
but if you knew it then everything was good and some people knew it

59
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:03,680
and some people did you know but you know i never knew it so and so there was this there was this

60
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:10,240
kind of strange kind of mythic thing going on that was kind of being held in the

61
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,560
community that i don't know how many people even the teachers understood how much this mythic idea which was

62
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,160
undefined was kind of people are measuring themselves again and hope against and

63
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:30,240
holding themselves but this is supposed to attain some people have felt the same thing with the pasta tradition that we're in

64
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,800
that there's this mythic idea of nirvana this great attainment and um but they don't never quite understand what is

65
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:43,360
this what do they keep talking about but you know i don't have it and so i'm not you know really up to snuff

66
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:51,599
you know somehow i'm kind of lesser than and then there's the projection when there's perf ideal of perfection

67
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:57,759
then there's a projection of perfection on others there's certainly that person that

68
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:03,440
teacher that practitioner must have it all together and you know that's the perfect example of

69
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,720
how it's supposed to be and or maybe close to perfect or something

70
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:15,280
and uh so yeah that teacher picks his nose but you know mostly it's like you know

71
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:21,680
pretty good and and so this whole perfection thing can be a

72
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:28,880
headache can be a problem it can also be inspiring and people some people are motivated

73
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,639
as a kind of north star or this is possible and this is the direction i'm going

74
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,080
the um so it's part of a part and parcel of this buddhist tradition that we're part

75
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:46,800
of this ideal of perfection we can't get around it and the buddha was

76
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,080
in the centuries after he lived his perfection kept growing

77
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:59,280
and if you watch the growth uh you know the historical literature that was produced in ancient india

78
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:05,199
relating to describing the buddha you see how he began more or less as a human being

79
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:13,199
and he slowly became more and more something was closer to a deified being a perfect being and with greater and

80
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:20,800
greater powers and abilities and part of my interpretation of it of this is that

81
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,800
in that culture of ancient india where he was at it was kind of required that a spiritual

82
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,159
leader spiritual founder that no one could be he couldn't be it

83
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:38,399
was usually he right uh he couldn't be no one could be second best to him

84
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:45,040
so if there was another teacher who had some ability that was greater than the buddha then the buddha wasn't so great

85
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,720
and so whenever there was some new person in town who had some ability the buddhist texts would always describe how

86
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:57,200
the buddha was even better and so it just grew and grew this grandiosity of the buddha you know like

87
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,240
until you know he would visit heavens and fly through the air and you know all

88
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:09,120
kinds of the one my favorite little story that from a thousand years after the buddha

89
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,160
is written in a famous text called the path of purification

90
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:21,519
is there are ancient ancient texts that talk about the buddha

91
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,640
going into the river debate well this is a big problem

92
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,399
because a buddha by the nature of being a buddha never gets dirty

93
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:38,560
it's always clean it's impossible for a buddha to be dirty so why is the buddha going into the bathing that explain it

94
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,399
now and um and so they're explaining well it's just for the sake of other people

95
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,440
to understand that it's useful to bathe something like that

96
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:56,320
and uh so you know the buddha wasn't even allowed to be human you know dusty india walking around in hot season and getting

97
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,760
dirty because that's that just doesn't happen to someone as perfect as a buddha

98
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:07,440
so so we have that idea also that's at play and going on

99
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,279
and then on the other end of the spectrum i guess or the other we have imperfection

100
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:19,680
which is kind of um us

101
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,800
it's a few of us and i don't want to speak for all of you

102
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:31,519
um but you know there's a little bit of you know you know um oh there's a famous story of suzuki

103
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:38,959
roshi the teacher of the founder of san francisco who said when i he told talked to his students

104
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:47,839
well when i look upon you i see all of you as perfect but there's room for improvement

105
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,760
and so that was you know very generous kind of way of looking at people then there's room for improvement

106
00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:00,720
so um and so we have ways in which we're wounded psychologically in our hearts

107
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,240
the ways in which we have attachments and fears and desires that catch us

108
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:13,440
we're caught in resentments there's ways in which our minds function in many diverse ways

109
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,440
and and now we call people some people neurodiverse rather than calling them

110
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,760
have an illness or some kind of deficiency we now recognize people are neurodiverse they have all these

111
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:31,120
different ways of operating which is a much more generous than how it used to be when people are seen as

112
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:37,519
being somehow deficient because of their ways their brain was constructed and

113
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:43,040
and i really saw this wonderfully in my kids elementary school classes and

114
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,720
so i got to see all these diverse kids in a way i'd never seen human beings before they kind of stood out in their

115
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:55,200
differences and their sensitivities and their uniquenesses and and how luckily in that school they all

116
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:01,519
had a place and we were kind of well cared for when i was growing up they would have

117
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:07,120
been sent to detention or i don't know been expelled from the school or something because people had

118
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,720
no idea what what was going on 40 50 years ago

119
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:19,279
so so rather than seeing so that you know we used to be things where people were imperfect now we see there's more

120
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,480
perfection is more different ways of being a human being which is kind of wonderful

121
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,240
and maybe you're more perfect than you realize maybe you're kind of unique in your ways

122
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,639
and how things operate for you and what are the ways of rather than thinking of yourself as being imperfect

123
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:42,000
against an external standard you get to just be yourself

124
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
and um and isn't wouldn't that be nice the um

125
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,320
so the practice we have these but we have still we have shortcomings

126
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:01,200
and that was my favorite word when i was a new practitioner you know i have these shortcomings

127
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:07,519
and and one of the challenges when i was a zen student for me personally

128
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:14,480
was that the practice was being presented as a practice of just being present in

129
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,800
the moment radical acceptance of this moment without um

130
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:28,079
trying to attain anything or any goal or anything you're trying to do except be here

131
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:36,160
and in some ways it was a wonderful practice i loved it at the same time i saw i had these shortcomings

132
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,399
and at some point i became the gardener of the monastery and i would welcome i would as a

133
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:48,720
gardener i would pull out weeds so that's other things could grow and i looked at i thought wait a minute

134
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,240
if i do this for the garden isn't it natural to do that from my mind as well

135
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,399
don't i have weeds in my mind and isn't it a normal natural thing to take those weeds out

136
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,920
and and so i struggled with that because of the zen teaching seemed to not make room for that

137
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:15,279
until i came to kind of the understanding that um it uh removing weeds was not really

138
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:21,920
uh wasn't a natural thing to do it wasn't like be i was so focused on goals or

139
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:28,079
attainments which is like if it's a weed you take it out kind of more if you have a weed in the mind it's fine to take it

140
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:34,560
out and for me the primary one that was a big issue was anger and so i would have to be no work with

141
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:40,880
you know i saw there's that anger and do i just let it simmer and be there or do i find a way to work with it and

142
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:48,639
practice with it and um and so what i came to was to appreciate

143
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:54,720
that i had actually a lot of shortcomings and i got to see that all every time my

144
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:01,199
eyes noticed a shortcoming i would be happy not because i had it

145
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:08,079
but because i had a practice to meet it this was just part of this was the the

146
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:14,000
compost this was the fertilizer for doing the practice

147
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,880
if i had been perfect with no shortcomings i wouldn't have had any fertilizer for

148
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:27,279
the practice and so i started i learned to be happy kind of to recognize

149
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:32,320
i wasn't content it wasn't happiness okay now i'm just gonna have a shortcoming it's gonna

150
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,839
the world has to deal with it now because you know i'm just gonna accept myself and

151
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:43,040
you know go out into the world and do my funny things my mind wants to do

152
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:49,040
it wasn't it it was rather this emphasis on practice and this idea that i take a refuge in

153
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:55,360
the practice sometimes my shortcomings were difficult my attachments my fears whatever it was

154
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,720
but i had i knew i had this practice and i took refuge from the practice okay

155
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:07,519
i don't know how to do it i know how i'm going to get through this but i have a practice i trust this practice

156
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:14,320
and so this idea of of appreciating shortcomings

157
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:20,880
rather than being embarrassed by them or shamed by them and many people are shamed many people

158
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:27,519
are embarrassed many people hide them even from themselves because somehow you're not perfect you're not

159
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:33,279
like living up to some ideal the ideal that i would like us to live

160
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:39,040
in which maybe is dangerous to say because maybe there shouldn't be ideals like this

161
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,560
but the idea is that it's okay to have a shortcoming

162
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,920
if you practice with it and it's okay to admit you have a

163
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,959
shortcoming if you practice with it and now that was one of the wonderful

164
00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:01,199
experiences i had in this outer hall here many years ago we had a meeting here of the most senior

165
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:08,640
zen teachers here in the san francisco area some of them have been practicing for 40 years or something

166
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:15,520
and it was just kind of a personal time together i don't know how many were 15 of them or so sitting in a circle

167
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,720
and and so they went around at some point the question was um what are your

168
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:27,760
challenges these days and they went around and they had all these ordinary challenges that

169
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,280
beginner beginning meditators would have like you know you can probably guess what they were you know some of them had

170
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,960
fear they talked about being nervous and afraid or anxious about certain things and they just went they you know had all

171
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:46,320
they all had their thing but what was remarkable that i'd never seen in such a collection of people they

172
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:53,120
were completely at ease and relaxed about having their shortcoming it was it was clear that they were

173
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:59,120
practicing with it and being sincere with it and trying to do their best but they were so at ease at least with you

174
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,559
know oh you know when i give dharma talks i'm so anxious

175
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:11,120
you know you know like they were smiling no you know whatever so

176
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:17,520
so the buddha partly the inspiration for this talk was that i read recently a suta discourse ancient discord of the

177
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:24,240
buddha where he has this teaching he distinguishes two kinds of people

178
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:30,320
the awful people and uh excellent people

179
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:38,640
and exactly how these two poly words supposed to be translated is um is controversial but um one translator

180
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:45,039
does uh inferior and superior people but that doesn't work very well for

181
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:50,880
me or much of the modern audience i think but the word kind of means more awful

182
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:57,360
and excellent that's more closer to the literal meaning so um

183
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:03,919
and then it is it's going to describe how that works who are the awful people who are the excellent people

184
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:09,440
and um it has to do with whether or not they have a blemish a shortcoming

185
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:17,200
a fault of some kind so you might think that it would be that the people who have the fault

186
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,840
the blemish they're the awful people and the people have no blemish they're the excellent

187
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:29,520
people but that's not what the buddha says instead he says

188
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:35,840
it's the people who have a blemish and don't know it

189
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:42,480
they're the awful people the people who have a blemish and know they have it

190
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,679
are the excellent people and he goes on to say and the people who

191
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:54,000
don't have a blemish and don't know it are awful

192
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:01,919
and the people who don't have a blemish and know it they're wonderful they're excellent

193
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
so probably each of you should re-translate those two words into words that work better for you than awful at

194
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,200
excellence so don't take them too serious but there's a distinction here

195
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:19,280
and clearly the ideal is not to be free of blemish

196
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:25,360
but rather to know how it is how you are that's what's excellent

197
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,720
and so here you're allowed to have a blemish by the buddha if you know it

198
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,559
and because if you know it then you can practice

199
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:44,320
if you don't have a blemish and don't know it then you can easily slip off into delusion into attachments

200
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:50,720
again but if you know you don't have a blemish then you can little bit appreciate that

201
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:56,960
state and practice with that and grow in it and develop it

202
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:04,240
so i was i'm just delighted by this idea of knowing that you have blemishes knowing that you're imperfect

203
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:10,559
knowing perhaps in some ways that you failed and now we come to one of the

204
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:16,720
central pieces of the culture of the united states that

205
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:23,039
some of you maybe can appreciate and that's baseball

206
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:28,080
at the center of american culture is a sport

207
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,840
that mostly involves failure

208
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:40,240
someone who who fails only two-thirds of the time when they're at bat

209
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:47,520
is an excellent player and they're mostly failing

210
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,559
and they just come up to bat again and again and again so

211
00:21:52,559 --> 00:22:00,559
failure blemishes maybe we don't have to take them so seriously maybe it's okay to have

212
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:07,039
shortcomings and faults and if we practice with it

213
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:13,600
if we engage in it and one of the ways to practice with it is to know

214
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,399
that it's present to know our shortcomings

215
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,679
and the knowing is mindfulness and the knowing is how we right the ship

216
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:29,360
how the ship writes itself whether you think about a sailboat is that

217
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:35,200
the sailor doesn't do usually doesn't do the riding it's a you know a big sailboat can tip

218
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,960
over but then say you know everyone holds on and then the boat writes itself

219
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:47,039
usually and and so the so the knowing

220
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:52,880
so what is it about knowing that helps right our ship and one of the things is that the

221
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:58,559
clarity of knowing means that in the clear time of knowing

222
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:04,320
we're not participating in the shortcoming we have it but we're not engaged in it

223
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:11,679
we're not identified with it we're not barreling ahead with it so if we're angry and say oh wow i am

224
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:18,559
angry right now there's anger here right now that's very different than continuing

225
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:24,559
ruminating about all the reasons you're angry with some situation and planning revenge

226
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:31,520
then you're really kind of even if you kind of know that you're angry but you're really kind of sunk into it

227
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:37,440
versus kind of stepping back and say oh this is anger

228
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,799
it's kind of like now you're making space for something else to operate

229
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:49,600
that rights the ship you're making space that there's more more of you there there's breathing room

230
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:56,159
there's there's you know space to expand into to relax into

231
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:02,960
oh it's like this for me as soon as you then say well

232
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:09,520
i guess i'm imperfect and i gotta get perfect quickly this is wrong i'm a bad person because i'm angry

233
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:15,120
then we're adding piling uh winds upon winds upon the sails keep

234
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:22,240
we keep pushing it over we're adding second arrows or third arrows as we say in buddhism

235
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:29,440
we are just adding more suffering the way to not add suffering

236
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:36,559
is to appreciate and learn the simplicity of knowing just be mindful clear

237
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:41,919
oh this is how it is and then to have a practice that works

238
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:47,039
with it it could be as simply as now that i know it's there let me know

239
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:54,240
it again let me feel it let me really see how it's like let me kind of name it and

240
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:00,799
and so that there's an honesty self-honesty oh it's like this

241
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:07,200
it's a lot of people are not honest with themselves about what's going on and we're trying buddhism we're trying

242
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:13,520
to be honest oh that's how it is maybe we practice relaxation maybe it's

243
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:20,000
time to practice breath meditation so we're not so caught in the grip of something but it's not with the idea that we're

244
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,120
doing something wrong exactly that we're bad

245
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:33,278
there's no bad people there might be bad thoughts bad impulses you know they're harmful

246
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,679
but we don't have to bury ourselves in shame or regrets or

247
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:46,960
upset criticism of ourselves we because we have a practice oh i see

248
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:54,480
it this is how it is let me practice with this now let me find my way with it

249
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:01,120
let me see if there's another way of holding this then holding it with resentment

250
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:07,440
or shame can i hold it with kindness can i kind of a generous attitude

251
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:13,520
towards this challenge that i have can i

252
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:19,279
just see it as this is this is part of me but it's not who i am

253
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:25,200
it's a part of me that i certainly i'd like to address and work with and find some freedom from

254
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,559
but i'm not going to give it the

255
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:38,240
i'm not going to be held hostage by it i'm not going to be trapped by it

256
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:44,240
but i'm going to be untrapped myself through the my practice of mindfulness

257
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:50,960
some of these shortcomings we have might remain but with time they don't hinder us they

258
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:57,520
don't grab us they don't take over they don't possess us

259
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:05,039
so there might be fear there might be strong desires there might be anger that kind of accompanies us

260
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:11,200
oh there's very there you are of anger i know you're there that but you're not gonna

261
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:18,000
i'm not gonna say anything i'm not gonna do anything based on it i'm free enough to not live my life

262
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,120
unhindered by it but i know it's there

263
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:30,799
the attitude that immediately sees a shortcoming a fault that we have as being terrible wrong to identify i'm

264
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:36,159
that terrible person because i'm angry means that we've kind of put that

265
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,679
anger center stage and become beset possessed by it

266
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:49,120
the mindfulness practice can put it in its right place which is just piece of the whole picture

267
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:55,279
and just a piece of it means that it we don't have to be maybe caught by it or limited by it

268
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:02,480
so the very fact that we have a shortcoming doesn't have to be a big deal

269
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:10,799
it becomes oftentimes a bigger deal than it actually is because we're reacting to it or judging ourselves because of it

270
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:18,399
instead of judging ourselves or defining ourselves by the shortcoming just smile and say hey

271
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:23,919
today i have a shortcoming isn't that great

272
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:31,840
[Laughter] someone asked you why are you happy you're smiling a lot today

273
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:38,880
oh because i'm so anxious [Laughter]

274
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:45,120
what you're anxious and you're smiling oh yes because i know i'm anxious and i have

275
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:51,520
this practice it's not easy to be with anxiety but i'm so glad i have this practice

276
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:57,880
isn't this crazy yeah somebody nodding

277
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:05,600
it's a kind of a a shift of perspective how we hold ourselves and see ourselves

278
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:13,039
so the last thing i'll say is that this practice that we do the practice of mindfulness

279
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:19,679
is so valuable it's even valuable

280
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:25,200
when we just do it partially it's so valuable

281
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:32,399
it's even valuable when we do it imperfectly and i suspect that a few of us

282
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:38,480
occasionally will do it imperfectly

283
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:45,840
the i mean i had this this is a family joke that i had saying that it's kind of like an ancient family we used to go skiing

284
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:51,200
when i was a kid and some point my father used to joke and he said um

285
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,880
like well i almost felt today on the ski slopes of course he fell but

286
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:03,360
he was like oh my you you know so you know you almost had a shortcoming

287
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:09,679
but um so to practice with it to admit it to see it to not be weighed down by all

288
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:15,840
these uniqueness and the foibles that we have

289
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:21,960
so you might consider if you if you understand what i'm saying here you might consider

290
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:28,399
what nice word you have for your own oddities

291
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:34,559
for me when i was younger i called it my shortcomings you might call it foibles

292
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:41,039
you might call it um oddities

293
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:46,240
you might call it your friends what do you want to call it that

294
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:53,039
that is a little bit kinder and more supportive for you then call it a fault or a

295
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:58,480
problem you have a word i do mistake

296
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:06,158
mistakes mistakes okay so call it a mistake rather than calling it wrong

297
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:13,519
idiosyncrasies you have some of those many

298
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:20,640
what other good words are there illusion or delusion

299
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:27,278
delusion some people like that great just delusion yeah

300
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,679
my way

301
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:39,518
yes habits my habits

302
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:49,039
[Laughter] [Music]

303
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,039
wabi-sabi

304
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:15,640
eccentricities all of the above

305
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:22,799
life and this is life the full catastrophe

306
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:29,120
so um it's a wonderful thing to have a practice

307
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:36,159
and it allows us to have a whole different perspective on the challenges of our life

308
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:43,440
and there are other challenges in life besides our foibles or shortcomings

309
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:51,120
life itself is a challenge the tragedies of life those the losses of life that we all live with

310
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,399
life is not perfect some of you some of us are aging some of

311
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:04,480
you aren't haven't gotten around to it yet but at least to recognize it

312
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:11,399
but aging is not an accident

313
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:17,519
you know it's just this is how we're we're built to age that's what's how human beings are created

314
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:23,120
it's not a mistake so we have these tragedies we have these challenges we have all kinds of things

315
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:29,200
that come besides our shortcomings and we have our practice

316
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:35,840
and we meet everything with practice and take refuge in the practice is to find your freedom

317
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:41,279
in the midst of everything it's a fantastic thing to have

318
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:48,080
and if you have a refuge you have that kind of refuge there's no need to complain about

319
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:54,960
anything because you can just practice with it

320
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,480
instead so may you

321
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:06,799
take refuge in the practice if that's too high a bar

322
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:14,240
maybe for some of you is to take refuge in your sincerity your sincere your

323
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:19,599
sincere effort to practice because maybe your practice can't be perfect

324
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:26,878
but maybe your sincerity can be sincere do your best

325
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:34,158
