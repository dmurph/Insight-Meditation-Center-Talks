1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:09,599
so a formal hello and welcome to all of you to this rendition of happy hour

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:16,149
so for today's practice he wanted to invite us

3
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:22,640
[Music] exploring meta and gratitude

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:29,679
there was a question last time that came up how does metta feel how does gratitude

5
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:36,000
feel in the body and i thought we would spend some time today

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,160
again meta there's meta for oneself there's meta for others it's a big field metta but we're going

7
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,920
to tap into meta practice of love and kindness and then

8
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:58,160
at some point we'll turn to the practice of gratitude and we will be will serve as scientists

9
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,680
of our own mind and heart and say oh how do these feel differently

10
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,640
for for us in our bodies the embodiment

11
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:16,400
and how do they feel in our minds what's what brings up knowing observing having sati

12
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:23,840
having mindfulness becoming mindfully aware of how these practices

13
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,960
move through us of course it's both a practice of cultivation

14
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:35,680
both cultivating meta and loving-kindness as well as gratitude tonight as well as

15
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:44,240
awareness of how these cultivations impact us so it's a twofold cultivation

16
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,280
one is the cultivation itself turning our hearts our minds

17
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,920
so that meta and gratitude become the automatic response

18
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:03,200
of our hearts and minds to situations instead of gosh you name it instead of so many

19
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,640
challenging ways that the mind and heart can respond to situations why me

20
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:15,440
this is terrible or ill-will but there's so many ways the mind and heart can respond

21
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:23,520
isn't it wouldn't it be nice if the natural re reflexive if the reflexive response

22
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:30,319
is one of kindness towards ourselves towards others and one of gratitude even if things are

23
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,760
difficult even if things are difficult so one aspect is the cultivation

24
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:43,280
and the other aspect that i'm inviting us to turn to is aware of the impact of the

25
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,480
cultivation so knowing how we're shifting and changing

26
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:55,760
because it turns out that the more you are aware of what it is that's happening the more

27
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,040
it takes hold in your mind and your heart and your neurons whatever perspective

28
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:08,080
you take however you cut the cake so awareness of the thing supports

29
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,640
the things cultivation so so with that as

30
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:21,360
our setup um let's begin as always

31
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:29,040
we begin with settling in the body with the breath with some

32
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:36,560

33
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:47,840

this being here and together

37
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:29,360
all of us practicing together quite beautiful

38
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,960

39
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,840

awareness to the meta i noticed actually it did intensify the feeling of metta

168
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:41,760
and the feeling of gratitude for me and also that each

169
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:47,599
practice felt very different for me maybe i'll i'll pause until i hear from you what you

170
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:54,160
discovered anthony says grateful for the dukkha thank you anthony that is beautiful that's a

171
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:59,359
beautiful insight to be grateful for the dukkha yeah

172
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:06,000
nancy says aware of how tender my heart is today yeah thank you nancy

173
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,720
bill says felt more emotional when doing gratitude metta was quieter ah thank you for that

174
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:18,560
observation and violet please

175
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:27,119
so when i did meta for myself the body experience was like

176
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:32,160
tingling everywhere in my body except for my heart center so my heart center

177
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:37,440
felt like this like bubble of novocaine and then when i was doing

178
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:43,760
gratitude i decided to keep it very literal i'm holding like a very fuzzy pillow

179
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:51,040
and i love fuzzy things i was like wow so grateful for this like fuzzy pillow that i can feel on my lap

180
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:57,520
and it was so clean so that felt like like a hand was like coming out of my

181
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:04,079
heart center and like literally grabbing onto this pillow like i'm only grateful for this pillow because it's on my lap right now but the

182
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:10,160
second it's gone i'm not going to be grateful for it anymore because i won't have it anymore

183
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:17,440
but then and then i was like wow this is so self-centered like i am grateful for

184
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:24,400
what i have i have this pillow so but then i thought about when we were doing

185
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:30,319
mudita you talked about how like mudita like for yourself can be a form of gratitude

186
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:36,400
so then i zoomed out to like i'm happy for this being who is violet who has a

187
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:42,560
fuzzy pillow in her lap right now and then the tingles went back to my whole body so it went from just being in

188
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:50,720
my heart to being in the rest of my body when i did that beautiful my whole body tingles as as i

189
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:58,000
hear violet as to how yay beautiful how with

190
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,800
wisdom like oh yeah oh with observation oh yeah this is what this feels oh that's interesting oh how about that

191
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:11,119
shifting perspective medita for this being who is me beautiful violet i am so touched that's

192
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:18,240
lovely yay may your modita practice for yourself continue to flourish

193

194
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,860
and a few other reflections here let's see um

195
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:36,560
[Music] melanie so grateful for nicki's voice and guidance and for everyone here today

196
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:42,480
as always ah thank you melanie for your gratitude for for being here and

197
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:48,000
practicing in sangha and i'm so grateful that we're all showing up together

198
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,400
and i'm so grateful for you that's one thing that came up when i was doing this practice i'm so grateful for this sangha

199
00:43:54,400 --> 00:44:02,800
that i can support you and it supports me and it's just a beautiful thing and um another reflection

200
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:09,200
more selfing with meta gratitude was more spacious great wonderful to observe these

201
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:16,720
differences and and and the ways that we can uh find our ways through these practices

202
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:21,760
lovely and tara on youtube says

203
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:28,880
how it was easier to generate meta for dear being plus all beings okay great and that it's

204
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:34,720
interesting to notice that and uh maybe that can be a stepping stone for

205
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:39,920
generating meta for oneself and thank you patricia from ireland joining us on youtube

206
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:48,640
beautiful practice thank you and thank you for your practice patricia yeah lovely so um

207
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:55,280
any other reflections um maybe as i wait i'll tell you a few things that i noticed and again for each

208
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:00,960
person they could feel differently any given day any given time these

209
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:08,880
practices could feel different so for me what i noticed was meta for my dear being felt

210
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,920
felt um like beaming beaming generosity and

211
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:20,480
care and love that's what it felt like in my body just and then for me it was meta from myself

212
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:28,160
was really soothing healing just calming as if it was a salve of oh

213
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:33,760
care and and gratitude felt there was a lot of joy a lot of

214
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:43,119
abundance of ingratitude in my heart it was just kind of bubbly like wow so much goodness here

215
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:48,240
yay let's turn to it so those are some of my practice notes from today of course

216
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:54,720
every time could be different so so dear ones we can save some time on

217
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:03,119
the other end and you come out of the small practice groups because a lot of times

218
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:09,680
being in small groups really brings up more reflections you hadn't considered before like oh yes

219
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:14,800
that is true for me too when you hear other people and also when you're held witness

220
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:22,560
can be so supportive for one's practice so let's start with 15 seconds of silent

221
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:28,400
uh practice silent meta for one another when we get into

222
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:34,560
groups and um then share as much or as little as you wish

223
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:39,599
about your practice with one another taking care of yourself taking care of

224
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:45,680
each other and um here we go i'm opening the rooms

225
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:52,319
now the rooms are are closed and everyone is back welcome

226
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:58,560
back everyone and we have a few minutes for any reflections that might have come up

227
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:04,400
discussing together practicing together in sangha peter

228
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:13,920
please okay they're unmuted um so we were talking about gratitude a

229
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:19,520
little bit terrence and i and we both had the observation that

230
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:25,520
sometimes meta is difficult to get into but for both of us gratitude is somewhat

231
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:30,800
easy and there's some similarity of the feeling

232
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:37,440
and so it occurred that maybe we could if we're having trouble with murder maybe to use gratitude as a leading

233
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:44,880
a prelude to the meta yeah beautiful observation yes peter

234
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:51,200
um and absolutely actually starting with gratitude it can prime the

235
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:57,920
heart for meta and this is also something that i observed tonight at the very end when

236
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:03,520
i invited you hey after having done gratitude now you can go through and do the meta again and see

237
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:09,200
what it feels like and when i turned back to doing the other practices even though they were really

238
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:16,880
short there was a sense of wow there's so much abundance in the heart now feeling grateful that it's easier to

239
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:22,800
give it's easier to give to others so absolutely peter and terence

240
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:28,559
fantastic observation so next time it feels a little difficult to get into meta start with gratitude

241
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:33,680
beautiful beautiful thank you for bringing that in

242
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:38,800
you're welcome yeah that's some something new to practice with that has a lot of problems

243
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:46,800
yeah great yeah wonderful yeah and gratitude tends to be easier and for some again never ever

244
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:52,640
i've learned teaching the dharma to never ever generalize anything to everyone for each

245
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:58,079
person is different and i so appreciate actually before we went into groups when people were

246
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:04,319
sharing their reflections in chat you know for for one person gratitude was more emotional method was quieter

247
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:09,680
and this you know this was easier that was easier it was just like everybody's different so

248
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:15,200
really appreciating and honoring all the differences that each of us brings to this practice

249
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:22,160
and finding our way to practice with uh with these practices so no yeah thanks

250
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:31,200
thanks peter any other reflections please

251
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:36,319
a quick one before we close an end

252
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:41,680
well maybe this has been plenty already come to think of it this has been quite rich it feels like

253
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:47,599
to me also hearing you all the reflections has been a very rich

254
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:52,880
exploration tonight and gratitude and and and meta for

255
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:59,200
dear being for ourselves and also be bringing awareness which is yet another

256
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:05,119
aspect bringing awareness to how these things feel so so thank you all for showing up

257
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:12,400
for cultivating your heart to your minds for your own sake in the sake of all beings whose lives you touch and

258
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:17,440
