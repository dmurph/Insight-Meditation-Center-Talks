1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:08,840
okay well good morning good afternoon good evening everyone for those just

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:15,040
tuning in for the first time my name is May Elliot and today is the last day of

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,640
our exploration of the Buddha's five daily Recollections and today we'll be

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,359
focusing on the final phrase um uh sometimes translated in different ways

5
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:34,719
so I'm going to read you two two versions uh the first is is I am the owner of my deeds and heir to my Deeds

6
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,840
Deeds are my womb my relative and my refuge I will be heir of whatever Deeds

7
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,760
I do whether good or bad and uh secondly I am the owner of my

8
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,199
actions heir of my actions actions are my womb from which I have sprung actions

9
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:59,000
are My Relations actions are my protection whatever actions I do good or

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,478
bad of these I shall become the air so

11
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:09,960
uh you'll notice that this phrase these phrases have a very different flavor than the last four and we talk about

12
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,119
that today and the Buddha What's Happening Here is he's guiding us into what seems like totally different

13
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:23,240
territory with this um and I'll also share later on why um

14
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:30,720
the the word being translated as deed or action is Kama or karma in Sanskrit

15
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,320
um and uh what the Buddha saying with this phrase is to reflect on how our

16
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:44,280
actions yield results how they yield consequences positive or otherwise um so

17
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,200
uh more on that later more on that to come um uh but let's let's move into our

18
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:57,759
meditation here as with the other phrases we uh we'll practice with the phrase in two ways I'll say the phrase

19
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,159
halfway through the meditation we'll start by sitting in silence and about halfway through I'll say the phrase and

20
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:11,000
you'll just drop it into the meditation to let it Ripple through the system kind of like a pebble being dropped in a pond

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,959
just seeing what happens and then after that I'll offer some questions for you to uh actively

22
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:25,959
contemplate for you think about a bit and reflect on okay so go ahead and find your

23
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:33,280
meditation posture sitting standing lying down whatever works for your

24
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,160
body you might start with a few deep

25
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:05,959
breaths in in to put aside any discursive thought about the past or the

26
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,360
future coming into the

27
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:23,830
now and taking a little time to relax the body softening the forehead and the

28
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:30,840
[Music] temples releasing the jaw

29
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,778
relaxing the neck and [Music]

30
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:46,280
shoulders allowing the belly to soften maybe hanging forward and down you're in

31
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,680
sitting

32
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,879
posture if there's anything that won't relax andh tension let's see if you can

33
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:06,360
relax around that making room for that without being in conflict with

34
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,639
it and connecting now with your

35
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,960
anchor what grounds you during the meditation if you get lost maybe the breath where where you

36
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,560
feel it most predominantly where it's easiest to [Music]

37
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,880
feel maybe you're touch points with the floor the

38
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:48,759
cushion a chair a global sense of the body sitting or the

39
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:56,360
soundscape traditionally the breath that do what works for

40
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:03,720
you and take some time now to l and collect the

41
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,639
mind

42
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,639
e

43
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
e

44
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
e

45
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
e

46
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
e

47
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
e

48
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
e

49
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
e

50
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
e

51
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

52
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
e

53
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,279
e e

54
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:23,600
if the body has become tight or tense again taking a moment to tune

55
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:31,160
in to sense the body and intentionally calm and relax

56
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:39,880
release any extra tension and then return to the

57
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
anchor

58
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,079
e e

59
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,040
now shift to our

60
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:39,519
recollection and as a reminder this is about karma in other words my actions

61
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:47,720
bear consequences if I act on a loving or generous intention that bears one result

62
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,839
if I act on hatred that bears a different result with wholesome

63
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:59,800
intentions and actions bearing happiness and wholesome

64
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,959
harmful actions uh bearing

65
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:12,000
unhappiness so I'll offer this phrase now and again just allowing it to Ripple

66
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,279
through the system without intentionally thinking anything through just seeing what naturally

67
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:26,079
arises maybe a thought comes into the mind or words or a picture in the

68
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:32,289
mind maybe an emotion or body sensation [Music]

69
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:44,240
I am the owner of my actions heir of my

70
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,319
actions actions are the womb from which I have

71
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:55,319
sprung actions are My Relations actions are my

72
00:15:55,319 --> 00:16:04,680
protection whatever actions I do good or bad of these I shall become the air

73
00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:00,560
for Simplicity we might try dropping this phrase in

74
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,678
my happiness and or unhappiness depend on

75
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:14,520
my actions my happiness or unhappiness

76
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,558
depends on my actions

77
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:43,919
my happiness or unhappiness depends on my

78
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:54,799
actions I will receive the benefits or Consequences of what I have done

79
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:26,240
noticing what arises and it may be that nothing arises or confusion arises if this idea is new

80
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:32,520
for you if you're uncertain

81
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,000
of why it's

82
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:44,039
included being mindful of any response

83
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:09,360
setting that phrase down now coming back to your anchor and allowing the mind to again

84
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
settle

85
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

86
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,640
e e

87
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:27,600
we'll shift now to our engaged contemplation so I'll offer the phrase

88
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:33,720
again and then uh a few questions you can

89
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:41,520
actively think about these questions making sure to keep a short leash on the thinking so the mind doesn't get too

90
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,640
lost we wanting to gravitate around the question staying close to the heart of

91
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:52,919
the matter so again the phrase another

92
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:59,200
translations time I am the owner of my deeds and heir

93
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:06,080
to my Deeds Deeds are my womb my relative and my refuge I shall be the

94
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,799
heir of whatever Deeds I do whether good or

95
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:24,480
bad so your actions follow from your intentions how much attention you pay to

96
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,600
your intentions makes a difference

97
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,039
so the first question are you aware when your

98
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:42,480
intentions are based in kindness Compassion or

99
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:48,880
generosity are you aware when you're acting and the intention behind the

100
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,320
action is a wholesome intention like kindness Compassion or

101
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,480
generosity are you aware of this

102
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:16,799
perhaps you're so engaged in the action you might not notice the intention

103
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:26,400
intention are you aware when you're acting if the intention is coming from

104
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:33,559
greed craving desire or hatred

105
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,080
aversion or

106
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:44,880
delusion are you are you aware when you're acting from intentions of greed

107
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:51,320
hatred or delusion do you notice this these could

108
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:59,400
be actions of speech actions of body things you do

109
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:05,279
could even be thoughts you notice when you're your thinking is coming from

110
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:09,400
greed hatred or delusion

111
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:38,960
do you consider whether your actions will cause

112
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:51,000
harm before you speak before you act do you consider whether it will cause

113
00:24:53,039 --> 00:25:01,360
harm and that could be harm to others or to yourself e

114
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:39,679
knowing that your happiness or unhappiness depends on your actions and the intentions that precede

115
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:46,158
them are there any new actions that you want to engage

116
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,440
in or any present actions present habits

117
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,879
that you might want to let go of

118
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:15,440
knowing that our happiness or unhappiness depends on our actions are there any activities you

119
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:24,480
want to put down or pick up want to let go of or start engaging

120
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,278
in e

121
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:20,960
when you're ready coming back to the breath or other anchor and taking some time to

122
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
settle

123
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,120
e

124
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,080
e e

125
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:22,200
the benefits of our wholesome actions of

126
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:28,120
body speech and mind benefit all beings so they may be

127
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:35,480
joyful and [Music] happy strong and healthy safe and

128
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:42,320
protected and so they may live peaceful and at ease

129
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:27,320
welcome back today we are talking about the

130
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:34,559
fifth daily recollection I the owner of my actions

131
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:40,159
heir of my actions actions are the womb from which I have sprung actions are My

132
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:46,600
Relations actions are my protection whatever actions I do good or bad of

133
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:53,279
these I shall become the air so as I mentioned before the guided

134
00:30:53,279 --> 00:31:01,159
meditation uh the word action is the translation of the word Kama in P or

135
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:07,120
karma in Sanskrit and we typically hear karma in the west so I'll use I'll use

136
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:13,639
the Sanskrit um and so this last phrase It's about Karma I saw a quote on a greeting

137
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:21,840
card a while ago that I thought summarized karma in more familiar language it said well well well if it

138
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:30,000
isn't the consequences of my own actions so this this gave me a chuckle

139
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:36,519
um and uh the lot the part of this of of this recollection that says I am the air

140
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:43,960
to my actions um we might just say this what goes around comes around kind of the

141
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:51,360
colloquial version I am the heir to my actions as I will I will um receive the

142
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:57,240
the consequences of my my previous actions so today we'll be talking about

143
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:03,000
Karma um but first I want to acknowledge that we've spent the last four days

144
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:10,240
contemplating aging sickness deaths death and uh the loss of what's loved so

145
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:18,880
wait a second hold everything you may be wondering uh what on Earth is karma doing here this is a little different so

146
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:24,880
this recollection is a Counterpoint to the first FL so having recognized the

147
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:30,720
immediacy the urgency of our situation where can we find safety you know where

148
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:37,320
we can can we possibly find a refuge amongst aging sickness death and loss so

149
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:44,679
this the phrase says actions are my protection actions are my protection so

150
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:50,760
our actions are our refuge they are our protection our happiness depends on our

151
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:57,159
actions so this phrase is saying if you want to be happy amidst these circumstances these kind of dire

152
00:32:57,159 --> 00:33:04,320
circumstances take great care with your actions and this this is actually great

153
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:12,240
news the Buddha says that happiness is possible and he was known as the happy one it's possible to be free of

154
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,919
suffering in this life even with aging sickness death and

155
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:24,240
loss so how do we choose our actions wisely such that the fruits of of our

156
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:30,840
actions are happiness and not suffering to start uh we need to understand that

157
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:38,760
when the Buddha talked about Karma or action he was specifically talking about intentional action so intentional action

158
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:44,519
so it's actually the intention behind the action that determines our future

159
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:49,840
happiness and uh maybe just a few words to Define intention before we put this

160
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:57,120
all together so put simply uh intentions are are simply our motivation so our

161
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,679
reasons for saying uh saying something or doing something now we can think of

162
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:11,398
them as the the about to moment it's the urge that we have before we act so we

163
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:17,118
have motives or intentions behind every thought every word we speak uh and every

164
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:22,358
action of the body this is all fueled by

165
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:29,398
intentions so how does how does intention actually function to bring forth happiness

166
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:34,960
well if I speak from a place of kindness or generosity uh this will create one

167
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:43,040
habit pattern of mind uh if I speak from selfishness this will create a different habit pattern of Mind put another way we

168
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:49,118
can think of our life as a garden and our intentions are the seeds that we

169
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:55,638
plant so if we want to be happy uh plant seeds of kindness compassion

170
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:02,440
renunciation non-grasping uh these will grow a beautiful garden this will yield a mind that is resilient

171
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:07,920
and flexible and joyful if we're planting seeds of greed

172
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:14,880
of Desire of hatred aversion rejection of delusion uh then that will

173
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,480
grow a very different Garden um so are you planting the seed of fear of self

174
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:28,000
agiz of self-aggrandisement uh seeds of bitterness insecurity of craving so

175
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,040
these will generate a mind with more suffering you can't you can't plant a

176
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:38,839
poison ivy seed and expect to get a mango tree uh if we're trying to be

177
00:35:38,839 --> 00:35:45,720
happy and free we don't want to plant poison ivy seeds so we examine our intentions and we act from wholesome

178
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:50,839
intentions because this conditions our future happiness if we want mangoes we

179
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:57,200
need to plant mango seeds so this is karma intentional action of body

180
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:03,079
speeching [Music] so um Good Karma results in happiness in

181
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:10,319
other words an action based on a wholesome motivation results in happiness and this is why the Dal Lama

182
00:36:10,319 --> 00:36:19,280
says my sincere motivation is my protection my sincere motivation is my

183
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:26,680
protection but another way my good intentions are my protection so we can't control our

184
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:33,319
circumstances but our wholesome intentions can allow a safe Passage through life and this is

185
00:36:33,319 --> 00:36:40,440
how um we can have safety um some sense of resiliency and ease and cultivate

186
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:45,400
happiness amongst sickness aging death and

187
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:51,160
loss and here's an example about how these um intentional actions yield

188
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:58,319
different fruit so this might seem like an odd question um but does stabbing

189
00:36:58,319 --> 00:37:03,760
another person lead to happiness or suffering apologies for these somewhat

190
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:09,880
violent analogy um so uh does does uh stabbing

191
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:15,520
another person lead to happiness or suffering well it depends on whether the

192
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,640
person with the knife is a surgeon or an as salant so each might use a knife to

193
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:27,880
cut someone but one has the intention to help someone heal while the other has the intention to harm the Ser the is

194
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:33,160
going to have a very different um different life than the violent

195
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:39,480
criminal so here uh my sincere motivation is my

196
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:47,680
protection uh Rob bbaa who is a Dharma teacher and author heed to say my real

197
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:54,280
Investment Portfolio are beautiful intentions my real Investment Portfolio

198
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:58,240
are my beautiful intentions

199
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:05,280
so we begin to see the way that uh paying attention to our intentions is

200
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:11,240
really important it lays the path for where we're headed in our life uh so in

201
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:18,280
a way we could think of it uh of attending to our intentions we could think of it a little bit like a compass

202
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:23,839
guiding us towards happiness and I want to speak now uh

203
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:29,680
just for a few moments about sama sanapa or right intention um sometimes

204
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,760
translated as complete intention and some of you might be familiar with this

205
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:42,760
uh from the Eightfold Path the path to freedom and so one of the path factors in the eight-fold path is s sanapa right

206
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:49,119
intentional complete intention so there's three facets of right

207
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:55,200
intention renunciation is the first second is kindness or non-ill

208
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,599
will and the third is compassion or nonharming so we can think of this as

209
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:07,440
our North Star if you can align your thoughts your speech and your action to

210
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:14,680
be based around these intentions uh kindness compassion and renunciation you can align your actions

211
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:20,040
around those you begin to be able to walk North this is how you calibrate

212
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:26,280
your compass point for where to walk for happiness ah okay North this way

213
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:34,720
renunciation kind compassion uh whereas uh if we find that

214
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:41,280
we're acting on Greed hatred and delusion that's going to take us in a different

215
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:47,040
direction okay so now I want to acknowledge a few facets of

216
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:52,359
karma first we can't understand the details of the working of K the workings

217
00:39:52,359 --> 00:39:58,200
of karma for example if you engage in a wholesome action with good intentions

218
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:03,440
we don't know when that good karma will fruit if you plant that karmic seed we

219
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:08,560
can't know when it will Sprout or how it will Sprout or what that plant will look

220
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:13,800
like so the Buddha considered the workings of the law of karma as one of the four

221
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:20,440
imponderables um so don't try to figure it out you can't figure it out so it's

222
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:28,160
you can't equate one action a particular result and go okay that's there it is

223
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:34,880
secondly uh not everything is based on Karma so in the commentaries it says that there are

224
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:41,560
several things that aren't based on Karma weather heredity accidents Etc the

225
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:48,640
Buddha did not say that everything that happens to us is based on our past actions other things uh can lead to our

226
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:56,520
experiences besides Karma okay third um often when we act

227
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:03,400
intentions are mixed that's normal if that's the case focus on the positive on

228
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:08,880
the wholesome aspect of the intention uh when when I was in college

229
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:15,440
I made a lot of pottery I loved Ceramics and making art um and at one point I

230
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:21,560
gave a friend a vase that I had made and when I noticed the intention

231
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:26,920
for doing so I realized that it really was mainly out of generosity but I also

232
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:32,359
realiz ized uh that there was little sub intention that I I also wanted this

233
00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:38,920
friend to think that I was a creative and talented artist uh so so in this

234
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:46,440
case it was say 90% generosity and 10% based in craving and

235
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:52,200
self- viw so in this case uh uh I still

236
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:57,760
focused on the wholesome and I still gave the gift one wouldn't want to refrain from giving it a gift because

237
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:05,318
there's a little sprinkling of selfing in there there's a little sprinkling of less wholesome um

238
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:12,359
intention okay and lastly as guy Armstrong says don't use Karma as a rear

239
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:18,520
view mirror meaning uh it's not useful to consider our life situation and then

240
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:24,920
think what did I do in the past that CA this this is kind of goes along with the first thing I've

241
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:31,280
said don't bother trying to figure out Karma but specifically don't don't use it as a rear viiew mirror so we can't

242
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:39,160
see or know um we can't see or know what in the past CA our present circumstance

243
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:46,960
it's just speculation so instead use Karma as a compass for where you're going in the future or as guy puts it um

244
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:53,680
the best way to use karma is as a future GPS system it's the science of

245
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,079
Happiness uh so by reflecting on this phrase about Karma daily it be it can

246
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:05,640
become a reminder of the importance of our intentions the importance of how our

247
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:11,520
actions of body speech and mind bear results what we uh the intentions behind

248
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:20,359
what we do what we say and what we think uh through so uh as you practice

249
00:43:20,359 --> 00:43:25,480
with this throughout the day you might consider as you do things what intention

250
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:30,800
is behind the action so today um maybe try it with food practice this going to

251
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:38,200
be a really interesting and fascinating exploration am I eating for entertainment or am I eating for

252
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:44,839
nourishment what's the intention behind what you get out of the fridge uh try it with conversation or

253
00:43:44,839 --> 00:43:51,200
speech practice are you speaking out of care for others or is there a little

254
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:57,839
Barb in what you're saying maybe a tiny intention to make someone know they're wrong or that they screwed up in some

255
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:05,319
way are you complimenting your supervisor because you want her to know that you value her and appreciate her

256
00:44:05,319 --> 00:44:12,920
doing it as an act of generosity and authenticity uh or is it because you're hoping to flatter her into giving you a

257
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:21,800
raise um so see what you discover uh and be kind to yourself uh this work is

258
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:27,480
humbling so I I hope uh through today's teaching that I've helped help to

259
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:34,160
calibrate your inner Compass to support you in navigating the path to

260
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:41,200
happiness so thank you so much for your attention this week it's been so wonderful to have the week with you and

261

262
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:54,800

263
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:00,559
learn where happiness lies and we can um align our actions with the way we really

264
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:08,160
want to be in the world we can set our priorities straight uh and we can live in a way that's conducive to happiness
