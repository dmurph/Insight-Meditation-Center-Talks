1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:12,799
so I welcome you on this second day of our exploration of

2
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:20,160
thinking and in a way it could be very helpful if you also

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,519
welcome yourself that meditation is

4
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:31,279
a welcoming well your welcome here

5
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:37,680
to yourself and one of the themes for today

6
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,840
is that the mind is not just a mind the body is not just a

7
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:52,440
body that these are deeply connected to each other and one of the analogies the

8
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:59,280
Buddha uses for this connection is uh that the mind the

9
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,478
thinking mind mind is a puppeteer and it has all these strings

10
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:11,880
in the body and pulling on the muscles pulling on the

11
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:20,320
limbs and this is a way of speaking to how the connection between

12
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,880
thinking and Sensations in the body tensions in

13
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:31,159
the body movements in the body that um

14
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:36,520
uh we can think one kind of thought and it tugs on the belly in certain kind of

15
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:42,119
way or activates it if it's fear maybe there's a

16
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:51,360
hollow uh kind of tension in the in the belly if there is a sense of uh warmth

17
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,880
and love it might be a suffusing feeling maybe feeling of

18
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,479
warmth or vibration in the chest what we think of course is very

19
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:09,160
connected to how we what the emotions we feel but for this uh day I'd like to

20
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:17,319
emphasize the physicality the physical activation the physical expression the physical in

21
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:27,640
Impact that thinking has and uh and the physical Source from

22
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:35,680
which thinking arises and so sometimes it just feels that

23
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:42,519
thinking is disembodied or pervasive or just uh coterminous with the

24
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:48,120
universe but um as we settle down the meditation often we can feel or sense

25
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:54,920
that there's a location for where thinking is occurring and uh it might be a

26
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:00,480
difference different location if we think in words or if we think in IM

27
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,480
Imes uh where's where's the projector projecting the

28
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:14,799
images where's The Voice or the speaker system that's coming up with the

29
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:20,519
words some people kind of think more somatically so there it's already deeply

30
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:26,400
connected to the body and um so we'll guide you through

31
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,400
this little bit and and um hopefully you

32
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,560
can develop a see and value the Deep

33
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,439
connection between thinking and the body and discover that through that

34
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:52,720
connection you can you can have an influence on the thinking Mind by relaxing the body quieting gentling the

35
00:03:52,720 --> 00:04:01,000
different parts of your body that are activated settling holding

36
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,680
and being able to be in relationship to thinking some aspect of thinking that is

37
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:15,159
not the content of the thoughts the ideas the stories the images but rather

38
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:20,519
the physicality of that process so

39
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,240
to assume a

40
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:36,720
align posture that allows you to be in some way or

41
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,199
other even even if lying down to be a bit

42
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:49,919
alert and create the conditions in the body that you feel and sense your body

43
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:57,599
more fully more globally in an aligned

44
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:06,120
way gently closing your eyes and taking a few long slow deep

45
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,479
breaths

46
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,080
relaxing as you

47
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:55,680
exhale and then to breathe normally and continue on the exhale to

48
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,479
relax maybe relaxing some of the common places is maybe not for you but

49
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:09,758
generally for people where the Puppeteer creates tension in the body as it

50
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:18,360
thinks activation maybe around the eyes and the

51
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,960
forehead on the exhale softening relaxing

52
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
there

53
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,800
and the

54
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:06,280
Jaws a very common area that thinking

55
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:12,879
influences is the shoulders if you can feel your shoulders

56
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:19,000
and it's easy enough to relax them please

57
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,360
do but if you just feel the tension and they don't relax see if you can soften

58
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,319
around the tension

59
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:49,599
some thoughts reach down into the chest the heart

60
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:55,800
area maybe a pulling maybe a contraction

61
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:04,560
tightening relaxing the

62
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:22,639
chest sometimes the whole arms are ever so slightly tensing

63
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,560
up relaxing the

64
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
arms

65
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:49,120
and then the

66
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
belly

67
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:14,000
and then if it's easy enough can you find the place in your body that from which

68
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,040
thinking occurs the projector the [Music]

69
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,600
speaker it might be a wide area but maybe it doesn't include your feet and

70
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,000
your fingers maybe it's above the waist

71
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:38,839
maybe it's generally above the neck maybe it's behind your forehead

72
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:46,160
or wherever the thinking mind the thinking activity seems to be

73
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,079
centered on the exhale

74
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
relax

75
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:31,040
and then centering yourself on your breathing

76
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:40,720
maybe remembering to relax by relaxing with every

77
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,399
exhale feeling every

78
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,880
inhale and if you find yourself pulled into to the world of

79
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:07,839
thinking so you lose touch with your breathing or if thinking seems quite

80
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:15,000
strong even if you're aware of breathing find where there might be some

81
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,320
tension in the body connected to those

82
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,240
thoughts in the thinking mind

83
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:33,440
elsewhere and in a sense take the three breath

84
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:41,040
Journey every exhale for three breaths relax that part where the tension

85
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,440
is and then Begin Again with your

86
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
breathing

87
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880

if you find yourself thinking relax

108
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:37,240
relax the whole

109
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:48,279
body if you find yourself thinking but can't find but cannot find someplace in

110
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:55,600
the body to relax see if you can soften

111
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:02,679
or open up beyond the edges of your

112
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
thoughts

113
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880

00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,679
for

118
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,720
and as we come to the end of this

119
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:30,760
sitting take three breaths with the exhale

120
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:36,200
relaxing as widely in your body as is

121
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,720
easy relax

122
00:26:55,159 --> 00:27:05,240
soften and then take three more breaths relaxing the mind the thinking

123
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:10,360
mind and perhaps Imagining the thinking mind

124
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:17,440
is spreading out beyond the edges of

125
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:25,240
thought beyond the edges of your body a softening and

126
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:29,520
opening emptying

127
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:59,519
for

128
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:11,440
and then feeling or Awakening inside of you in your mind your thoughts your

129
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:18,080
heart your body the kind

130
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:24,720
of openness kind of softness through

131
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:31,399
which kindness travels Good

132
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:39,840
Will through which simple care ordinary care of

133
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:47,000
others caring about them caring for them doing them a

134
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:54,080
simple Act of care like putting on a bandage

135
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,360
or offering them some tea

136
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:07,360
at a time when they're maybe a bit

137
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:19,880
stressed and imagining that that form of kindness or

138
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:26,320
care can spread out in all directions from you to the people Close to You

bandage do something so something doubles here

152
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:15,480
today out of this community goodness out into the

153
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:32,049
world [Music]

154
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,159
for

155
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,080
e

156
00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:49,960
so hello and welcome to this second day on instructions of

157
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:58,200
mindfulness of thinking and one of the

158
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:03,240
invaluable ways of getting a handle on thinking so that it doesn't pull us we

159
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:12,279
not get swept away in the currents of thought and the river of thoughts the the Train the train cars of

160
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:18,440
thoughts the image that's sometimes given of thinking is that we standing at

161
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:24,480
um a train crossing watching a whole bunch of trains go by and and at some

162
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,760
point we find ourselves on the train and we've been on it for a long time and didn't know

163
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:35,039
it so these thoughts will come and the idea is just let them go let them come

164
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:42,639
and go don't get on the train don't get involved in the train and one of the ways that can

165
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:48,679
support this uh while still clearly knowing that the trains are coming and

166
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:56,159
going without getting on is to feel the body to be well connected to your body

167
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:03,840
the body is all always in the present moment and uh and the body is

168
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:10,118
itself um not exactly a thought however the body is influenced

169
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:15,878
by the thoughts that we have if the thoughts are very mild and soft and

170
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:21,679
wispy maybe we don't feel any connection to the body too much or at all but at

171
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:27,560
that point we don't really need to because it's easy to let go of the thoughts it's easy to stay with

172
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:35,638
um with the breathing as we breathe stay in the present moment but if it's hard to stay with in the present if it's hard

173
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:43,118
to stay riding in breath and out breath over time because we get swept away in

174
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:49,638
the trains of thought then we need some help in

175
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:56,240
practice and one of the principles of mindfulness practice is everything is

176
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:04,320
food for mindfulness everything is something that we use can turn to and be aware of and um so we want to learn how

177
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:10,520
to be mindful of thinking so that we're kind of standing on the on the ground

178
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:17,040
watching the train go by and clearly know we're in the ground field the stability the strength of that and just

179
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:24,079
kind of know that's the train okay we don't have to get involved we can just let it be the train and

180
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:30,359
um and one of the ways to be present for thinking is to be aware that thinking is

181
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:36,520
more than just the thoughts we have the images we have those are often what help

182
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:45,800
us get what we get entangled with is to um is to uh feel the connection the

183
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:54,640
thinking has with the body and then you're part of the Ecology of thoughts and so uh some thoughts clearly

184
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:02,720
trigger tension in the body tightening in in the body and I find it fascinating to sit in meditation quietly and feel

185
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:10,960
some modum of a relaxed body and present and then to some kind of really exciting

186
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:17,319
troubling thought arises in the mind and immediately the body Trigg it triggers

187
00:36:17,319 --> 00:36:22,520
something in the body it tightens it the belly tightens or there's a place that

188
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:27,599
gets all hot or or the the the activated

189
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:35,400
part of the body gets moves up into the head so to to start feeling what is

190
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:40,880
activated whether it's tension or some people call it energy some people say

191
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:47,000
it's where the uh FOC focus of attention really wants to go and be

192
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,040
centered um you want to uh notice what's the physical

193
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:58,119
coraly with breathing with thinking and um and if there's tension

194
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:04,800
that's connected uh you could do one of two things you could relax just soften if

195
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:10,119
possible a more kind of uh kind of

196
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:15,480
developed form of mindfulness is not to relax but to bring your attention into

197
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:21,240
the place of tension into the place of activation and feel your way to what

198
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:28,480
wants to happen there you can ask a question what are these what does this tension want or if it's like an

199
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:35,160
activated feeling of heat or agitation what does that

200
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:42,599
want and uh you might feel with tension you say oh it wants to relax Sometimes some like an activated

201
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:48,119
Place uh sometimes the feeling can be oh it wants space it wants space to spread

202
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:54,240
out into and um and if you feel that physical Sensations and what they want

203
00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:00,800
or the direction they're going or the sense of how they're if they're left alone in given room what direction

204
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:06,760
they'd go um give them that room relax if they want to relax make room for them

205
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:14,160
to relax if uh if some fear in the heart is more like a vibrating tingling

206
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:20,800
agitation um and you feel that what it most wants to do it wants to become spread out make it wants to have room to

207
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:28,000
be agitated make room for it kind of relax around it and you might discover that

208
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,839
that helps it relax that helps it dissipate it's not so concentrated and eventually it might

209
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:43,280
actually dissipate entirely by just kind of spreading outward and um so to find the Coral in

210
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:50,079
the body and um and occasionally it might feel the whole body is

211
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:56,000
activated if you uh like an interesting way of practicing with this is don't

212
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,280
spend a lot a lot of time uh being mindful of some kind of thinking that's

213
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:08,880
captivated you find where there's some tension in your body find where the activation in the body is relax it or

214
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:16,040
make room for it or just feel it for a while but do it experiment with doing for just three breaths kind of like the

215
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:21,119
three breath journey and you might even uh Fe you

216
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:27,960
know kind of count as you go along and there's something about the limited span of three breaths knowing that's as long

217
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:34,440
you're going to do it it's not open-ended so it's easier for the mind to get focused this is what I'm doing if

218
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:41,240
it's open-ended the mind kind of is not quite committed maybe and it might be long enough to do

219
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:46,920
three breaths because uh with the you know being mindful of the thinking that

220
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:53,839
way and it might be long enough because anything more has the danger of actually

221
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:59,359
work somehow interested fascinated somehow engaged

222
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:06,160
reactive to the thinking and like we're trying to get rid of it and the odd thing about

223
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:12,079
thoughts is that uh even being bothered by it even wanting to get rid of it is

224
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:18,119
fueling it gives it more energy uh being bothered by thoughts is the food for

225
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:24,920
more thinking so just do three breaths and then settle yourself back on the

226
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:31,560
breathing again like you've done your you've done your task to be mindful of thinking what's going on and maybe

227
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:38,480
that's enough to acknowledge it with three breaths relaxing for three breaths and then Begin Again with your

228
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:46,680
breathing if the same kind of thinking arises again or seems to be predominant again then do the same process but maybe

229
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:53,920
don't spend more than three breaths with it um if you can really stable mindfulness then maybe you can just stay

230
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:59,960
with the experience longer but uh see if this three breaths is long enough to

231
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:05,760
acknowledge it well enough that it takes away some of the fuel for that kind of

232
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:12,880
thinking some of the fascination with it or interest in it and part of this um physical

233
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:19,520
mindfulness of thinking is to feel the location where thinking is

234
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:24,760
arising and it might be somewhere behind the eyes or somewhere in the middle of

235
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:31,079
the head I've had different places at different times but often it's the upper half of the head for me if I'm caught up

236
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:37,920
in thoughts and um sometimes in the back of the head sometimes in the middle sometimes near the front between the

237
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:43,960
ears someplace sometimes it's not exactly so clear exactly where it is but

238
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:51,079
it's kind of a vague kind of generalized area someplace in the head some people might feel it in their

239
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:57,119
heart and their chest some people might feel it someplace else if it's uh uh

240
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:06,920
images we have where's the projector where's the energy of the that's fueling the the um the images appear and um and

241
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:13,920
uh and so find the location and if it's not easy to find that don't you know you don't have to keep trying but U maybe

242
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:19,240
you have to wait to really you know first class high-powered anxious

243
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:25,720
thoughts or angry thoughts that you can really you might really feel oh that's where the center of gravity is that's

244
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:31,280
where I'm constricted or tight and that seems to be projecting the

245
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:36,800
thoughts and um and find the location of thinking and then do the three breath

246
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:43,800
relaxation there as well or three breath opening sometimes just making lots of

247
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:49,839
space for for thoughts um room around it makes it kind of dissipate and spread

248
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:57,359
out and good quiet sometimes I'm emphasizing relaxing today but sometimes relaxing in if we do

249
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:02,920
it with a version or as an engineering feat like we have to do it right all

250
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:09,040
there's all kinds of ways in which we actually are uh feeding the thoughts and giving it more

251
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:16,400
energy sometimes just kind of like just making space for the thinking and and feel the physicality of the location and

252
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:23,040
maybe what it feels like it wants to do is just kind of spread and out and so

253
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:30,200
what happens with thinking it doesn't disappear but slowly it dissolves it

254
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:35,760
softens and um and that's uh and as we settle and get more and more

255
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:43,240
quiet uh the uh the thinking becomes more wispy and more softer and um

256
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:50,559
there's a classic uh teaching that I first heard in Zen but I think it's often in a lot of places in Buddhism um

257
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:56,480
where they refers to clouds like a cloud in an endless Sky drifting Cloud that

258
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:01,839
just drive it is no more substance than a cloud it's very light and

259
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:07,920
floating and um and then it might be easy just kind of in that softness to

260
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:12,960
softly kind of rest the attention on the breathing and get absorbed in sensations

261
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:19,559
of breathing so um so the task for today if

262
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:27,200
you're interested is um through the day see how your body is AC AC at by the

263
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:34,760
kind of thinking you have and there might be as you go through the day something occurs that uh evokes a

264
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:39,920
particular way of thinking you're driving and someone cuts you off and now

265
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:49,359
you're activated by that and you have all these angry thoughts how could they and and uh and uh and oh I'm now

266
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:56,599
thinking furiously about that rather than you know continuing uh you know you

267
00:44:56,599 --> 00:45:02,640
know without paying attention notice what's happened to your body with those

268
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:08,280
thoughts um you know you get an email and there's new thoughts and notice

269
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:14,800
what's happening to your body with those thinking and where your tense uh make it a kind of a

270
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:20,599
specialty what is the connection between thinking and your

271
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:26,680
body so thank you um very much and I look for to

272
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:31,318
continuing talking about thinking

273
00:45:32,359 --> 00:45:35,359
tomorrow
