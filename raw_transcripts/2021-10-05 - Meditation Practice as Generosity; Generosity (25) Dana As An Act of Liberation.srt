00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,120
which are said to be liberative part of the path of liberation and

8
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,160
actually part of the practice of liberation itself

9

10

thank you for your practice

118
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:30,960
greetings greetings sangha

119
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:38,399
so today is the second day of our exploration with the theme of generosity

120
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:42,480
donna in pali

121
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:50,559
and to follow up from yesterday the um

122
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:00,120
the word donna d-a-n-a many of you are already familiar with this word

123
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:06,240
refers both to the act of giving don giving and also

124
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,840
refers to what is given and

125
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:17,200
there is a similar word that i briefly mentioned yesterday which is one of my

126
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:24,159
favorite words actually in pali and the word is chaga chaga and it's

127
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,960
spelled c-a-g-a

128
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:40,320
which refers to a quality of mind heart mind heart being the chitta

129
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:47,200
the quality of mind heart so it's the quality of feeling generous

130
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,960
um there's a sense of generosity of spirit chaga is also

131
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,080
um translated as as relinquishing as

132
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:06,240
letting go because it is the same movement of the heart when the hand opens up to

133
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:13,120
to give something to someone else it is letting go of it it is letting go

134
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,880
of it for the benefit of someone else so that

135
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:25,760
that motion of the heart that motion of the the the body

136
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:33,600
is the same is the same as the movement of liberation it's the same

137
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:40,640
movement of awakening of letting go of of liberation

138
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:46,159
which is why donna generosity is such an important practice

139
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:52,720
such an important practice as i mentioned the buddha taught

140
00:33:52,720 --> 00:34:00,799
donna as a primary practice especially for for lay practitioners and it shows up

141
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:06,960
in the triad an important triad of dhana sila

142
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,599
ethical conduct bhavana meditation practice cultivation of the

143
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:21,040
mind and heart so dana comes first and then ethical conduct and then meditation

144
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:26,720
so that's one important triad and it's it's you might have been

145
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:33,839
familiar with another triad of practice which is sila samadi panya

146
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:41,919
again ethical conduct samadhi concentration or calming the mind and pioneer wisdom so that's a

147
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:46,960
related triad here a different way to enter

148
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:53,919
and hold practice just as an important one just they're both as important

149
00:34:54,079 --> 00:35:00,400
so so donna this this inner and outer

150
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:06,880
um dimension of of generosity

151
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:14,320
being paralleled with the same movement of the heart

152
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:19,599
for the same movement of the heart that we cultivate

153
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:25,599
towards liberation freedom letting go

154
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:32,559
so let's consider some of the similarities

155
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:40,760
so with liberation with letting go with non-attachment

156
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:48,880
which actually sometimes we think of letting go like oh i have to let go i have to let go this

157
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:54,160
buddhist path thing tells me not to be attached i'm supposed to be unattached

158
00:35:54,160 --> 00:36:01,200
and it sounds so um dire sounds so heavy like oh be

159
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:07,520
unattached don't sound so grim be unattached let go of everything

160
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:13,760
right however if you think of that the way to think of that is the same way we think

161
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:19,119
of generosity it's the same spirit it's the same idea that's why

162
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:26,160
letting go liberation and and donna generosity are so related and one really

163
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:32,240
supports the other donna supports liberation because it's the same movement of the heart

164
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:37,680
donna generosity is not a dire well it's not supposed to be a heavy thing like oh

165
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:44,000
i have to be generous i have to give if that's not the spirit

166
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,720
for um generosity and you know from your own generosity which it's it's really a

167
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:57,520
movement of the heart when you feel moved when your heart feels bright it wants to offer it wants to offer

168
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:02,560
something that that you have your time

169
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:09,359
your skills your resources maybe a smile maybe a compliment

170
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:15,680
letting go of something that some some resource for the benefit of someone else

171
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:22,400
and there's a joy there is a delight there is a happiness in that giving

172
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:28,880
and the receiver in this case in the case of donna often there's a receiver

173
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:35,359
um the heart is uplifted and joyous and we'll talk more about the joy of

174
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:40,560
generosity tomorrow and i'll share some research studies also

175
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:47,839
so with donna there is this sense of ah this delight of yes i want you to have

176
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:53,280
this i want you to have this please have this yay there's there's the sense of

177
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:59,680
celebration of letting go there is this brightness of letting go it's okay that i don't

178
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,599
have this thing anymore yay it's giving me more joy my heart is freer that

179
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:11,599
this thing somebody else has it now so consider this this practice or this

180
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:19,119
sense this feeling of generosity now for liberation it's the same

181
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:24,640
movement of the heart yes i'm going to give give away this this tightening

182
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:31,119
attachment this wanting this thing because it's yay for the benefit of all beings for

183
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:39,119
the benefit of myself for the benefit of ah in ways i can't even fathom

184
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:44,160
for the ben for for liberation for nibana i

185
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:51,040
grant this i i give it away i release it so you see the two movements

186
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:56,079
of the heart of donna and liberation letting go for the

187
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:04,079
benefit of of liberation are the same they both have or should have well i don't want to

188
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:09,280
use the worship but they need to have they they're inspired from the same

189
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:15,920
movement of the heart the same brightness the same letting go that's

190
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:21,599
and it's it's not a tight letting go otherwise it doesn't quite work that well

191
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:27,200
but it's a bright it's a bright yay for the benefit of myself for the

192
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:33,200
benefit of in the case of liberation for the benefit of myself for the benefit of all beings

193
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:41,599
um for these other dimensions of freedom ease i let go i let go of greed hatred

194
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:48,880
delusion i let go i let go and i offer myself i offer my heart

195
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,920
my purity my goodness trusting there is goodness and purity

196
00:39:53,920 --> 00:40:01,680
to to the world and here again donna as a practice that supports liberation

197
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:08,319
i offer this i offer something that i have i offer some um thing that

198
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:14,560
i quote unquote possess and again we are only custodians of of everything we

199
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,599
don't own stuff in this world we're just passing

200
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:24,640
through so this thing that i'm a custodian of for a limited time

201
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:31,520
i i give it away i give it away it just generates a practice

202
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:39,280
so so it is said that the practice of uh

203
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,319
generosity so practicing generosity practicing on

204
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:52,640
practicing practicing actually giving making it a habit to give things away to offer to make offerings

205
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:58,800
can help this inner dimension of generosity to be cultivated this inner

206
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:04,640
dimension of not a non-attachment to be cultivated

207
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:12,400
and of course it's a virtual cycle when you have when we have this inner dimension of

208
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:21,599
cultivation when we have the inner dimension of generosity when our hearts um don't hold tightly and are aware of

209
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:27,280
opportunities to help and support oh yes then the outer act of

210
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:32,079
donna generosity comes a lot easier

211
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:39,359
another um the way that it is said and bhikkhupuri

212
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:44,880
puts it this way generosity

213
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:50,880
donna um connects with the path connects with

214
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:56,720
the goal of the path which is liberation as i briefly mentioned with the destruction

215
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:02,480
of greed hatred and delusion because when we're cultivating

216
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:07,520
generosity of our generosity of spirit um

217
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:12,560
of course generosity is the the anti-thesis

218
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:20,480
of greed greed is holding on is grabbing grasping and ah the opposite

219
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:26,960
movement of the heart movement of the mind is is releasing letting go so

220
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:32,000
the practice of generosity is the antonym

221
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,839
to to greed so okay so that's one of the poisonous roots okay how about hate

222
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:45,040
hate is is this sense of ill will not liking people

223
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:50,480
again generosity it it brings up this sense of um

224
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:56,960
it's synonymous it's it also brings up a sense of meta in fact this is an amazing

225
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:02,400
practice i learned years ago studying visudi maga

226
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:10,319
the path of purification book where there are 10 practices listed

227
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:17,280
if you're angry at someone where there is ill will with someone how to work with the ill will there are ten things

228
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:23,680
mentioned the last one the last one if nothing else was the last one was to give them a gift

229
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:30,079
and when i saw that i was astounded what give someone a gift and it makes sense

230
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:37,280
it actually makes sense try it and it's for the liberation of your own heart if you're angry at someone give

231
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:42,319
them a gift because it opens it shifts something in your heart

232
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:47,920
when you give someone a gift i've tried that actually and yes

233
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,960
it's for the liberation of my own heart not to have ill will towards anyone

234
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:59,200
giving a gift open shifts something this act of generosity donna it dispels

235
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:04,560
hatred so greed hatred and confusion and again

236
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:11,760
there are outer there are other dimensions of generosity

237
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:17,680
there are visible dimensions of yes transferring this item from one person to another

238
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,880
but there are other dimensions that it dispels delusion thinking that it is

239
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:30,000
ours that it that there are boundaries that we're not all connected

240
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:36,720
so in in many ways it dispels delusion in ways we cannot even fathom so the

241
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:41,920
practice of generosity the practice of dhana

242
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:49,359
is synonymous is it supports liberation in ways we cannot imagine which is why

243
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:55,280
the buddha espoused it so much so my invitation for

244
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:01,200
today if you if you would like to take it on you don't have to this is again generous

245
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:07,359
it needs to come from the heart it's not an act of should if you're inspired

246
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:12,480
find an opportunity today to be generous with someone

247
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:18,720
um it could be your time could be maybe pick up the phone and call a friend see how they're doing

248
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:26,000
maybe it's with some your resources maybe it's something you have or your

249
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,920
whatever you decide but see if you can find one opportunity to be generous

250
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,960
today and see and observe observe and we'll discuss more about these

251
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:43,599
observations and and um uh yeah the inner works and workings of

252
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:50,640
donna so thank you for the generosity of your practice and your presence

253
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:58,119
may you all be well safe and free
