1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,000
so

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,960
in this process of anapanasati

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,480
mindfulness of breathing in

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,759
mindfulness of breathing out

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,640
we've come to the core heart of it

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,320
the insight aspect of it

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,920
and and the purpose of insight

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,320
is to liberate us to free us and it

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,920
involves a very clear

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,160
centering ourselves in the core

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,920
dynamism core aspect of how this life is

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,960
and all the

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,039
steps before in a sense are preparing us

14
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,559
and preparing us and i don't want to

15
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,120
i want to emphasize how important this

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,000
preparation

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,399
is certainly preparation for

18
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,840
what we're doing in the last steps

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,720
but what we're doing the last steps is

20
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,200
also

21
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,159
preparing ourselves or willingness to

22
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,479
meet this world as it is

23
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,880
the ability to really be in this

24
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,280
suffering world

25
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,000
and to be prepared for that to have

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,799
really developed the qualities of

27
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,640
attention and concentration

28
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,479
and persistence and and uh

29
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,079
and well-being and purified ourselves

30
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,119
got to work through

31
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,560
some of the hindrances all the

32
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,960
hindrances work through or

33
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,759
are the attitudes and the

34
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,680
places that we're where we

35
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,159
kind of can you need to be healed and

36
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,960
and settled

37
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,960
and this is a beautiful and profound

38
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,040
process and we need this for it to be

39
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,600
available

40
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,439
to be available to care for this

41
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,080
suffering world

42
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,640
and so then we come to this 13th step

43
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,400
where we're experiencing

44
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,879
observing impermanence or in constancy

45
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,000
and this has three different aspects

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,560
that things

47
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,680
are changing and inconstant one is there

48
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,000
is loss

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,680
things disappear but also the very fact

50
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,800
that

51
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,920
things change allows for new beginnings

52
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,800
the fall gives birth to the winter the

53
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,720
winter bring gives birth to the

54
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,840
spring things pass away in the fall die

55
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,959
away and then

56
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,560
get reborn in the spring and now

57
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,920
we need this cycle is what we need

58
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,159
and so we live in a world of tremendous

59
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,080
suffering

60
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,440
and so much that we've experienced in

61
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,200
the news now for so long

62
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,879
and you know the amount of hate that

63
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,120
gets expressed in violence and killing

64
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,360
is astounding and um

65
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,200
and it's been going on since the time of

66
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,120
the buddha

67
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,040
and so how do we address this how do we

68
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,840
meet this and so anapanasati is this

69
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,680
beautiful practice

70
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,239
of profound practice maybe i shouldn't

71
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,920
use beautiful in this context but

72
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,640
profound

73
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,239
helpful and healing practice that

74
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,680
just to stay the stay constant with the

75
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,760
inconstancy of breathing the rhythm of

76
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,280
breathing

77
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,640
frees us from this the

78
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,519
contractions the resistance the fears

79
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,760
the preoccupations the distractions of

80
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,360
the mind

81
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,319
it allows something to be settled and

82
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,200
and to be

83
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,879
come into kind of harmony and ease

84
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,879
that allows for the self-healing

85
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,360
qualities of this human body and heart

86
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,799
to operate it makes room for some of the

87
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,360
most beautiful qualities of who we are

88
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,560
to surface and come forward

89
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,759
and so to really be able to dip into the

90
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,000
inconstancy and the changing nature of

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,800
it

92
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,000
is to have a direct confrontation with

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,560
what's most difficult with human life

94
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,440
but also with what's most wonderful and

95
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,479
healing in this human life as well

96
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,520
and and because things have changed not

97
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,080
only is it until there's loss and

98
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,759
there's also the disappearing of things

99
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,759
which are

100
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,240
not useful or that are that are painful

101
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,280
and difficult

102
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,400
suffering disappears as well and so part

103
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,280
of the

104
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,960
inconstancy and the changing and

105
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,639
permanent nature of all this

106
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,000
is a rich rich world of so many things

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,639
that we enter into sometimes

108
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,639
simultaneously

109
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,120
where there is loss but with loss

110
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,479
there's also a gain

111
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,479
we or in the sense that we also lose our

112
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,400
suffering at times

113
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,639
um and uh with the new arising of things

114
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,479
appearing of things some things that are

115
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,639
pure are not good

116
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,240
but also there's possibility of good

117
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,479
things and then the teachings of the

118
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,039
buddha

119
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,360
to really see and feel and be in this

120
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,360
current of change

121
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,440
gives us some agency

122
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,039
to shape how we experience and how we

123
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,000
are in this world and we certainly can't

124
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,960
change the world dramatically most of us

125
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,680
but we can't change our immediate world

126
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,840
we can't change ourselves

127
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,360
and the practice has a lot to do with uh

128
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,360
with understanding

129
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,400
change and finding a way to harmonize

130
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,360
with it

131
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,720
and work with it so that we cultivate

132
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,280
ourselves we develop ourselves

133
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,919
to become better people so to prepare

134
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,199
ourselves for

135
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,080
this world so that we have resiliency we

136
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,880
have

137
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,919
open heartedness we have non-clinging we

138
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,400
have non-hostility

139
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,600
it's a um it's a powerful thing

140
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,960
to uh you know to work with

141
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,520
the changing nature of this world in the

142
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,039
in vipassana practice

143
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,880
we're working with that changing nature

144
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,880
of the world all the time

145
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,199
but it's not often emphasized but now on

146
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,759
this 13th step of anapanasati

147
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,080
this is the part of the world that we're

148
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,280
really working with this

149
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,680
is the we're entering into this flow and

150
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,080
the change

151
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,120
and it's easy it may be easy to at least

152
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,880
for a teacher to say what i'm about to

153
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,000
say

154
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,720
but maybe much more difficult to do it

155
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,720
and that is that to really enter into

156
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,599
this

157
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:58,960
this part of what the buddha was

158
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,400
emphasizing to really uh to really

159
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:02,960
observe

160
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,800
in constancy means that we're no longer

161
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,160
in the sway or caught in or seeing

162
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,199
the reality through the lens

163
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,319
of our concepts and ideas

164
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,680
our stories and all

165
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,840
those also are part of the inconstant

166
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,080
world changing world

167
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,199
and and stories come and go they arise

168
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,639
and they pass

169
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,120
there's all this change and flow and

170
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,919
movement

171
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,080
in the story making mind and the concept

172
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,240
concept making mind

173
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,960
everything is flowing and changing and

174
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,240
so how do we really

175
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,880
get to really get into that and and

176
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,879
really rest in it

177
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,919
the buddha taught that because it's

178
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,080
liberating that's where freedom is found

179
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,960
and it's a the core insight of the

180
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,120
buddhist teachings

181
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,000
over and over again is to see in

182
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,199
constancy

183
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,360
is to see change is to see

184
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,879
maybe we can say the word impermanence

185
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,160
and and it represented by

186
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,440
a number of things kind of

187
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,919
the first person who was enlightened

188
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,440
after the buddha was

189
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,400
hearing the buddhist teachings exclaimed

190
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:22,879
kind of

191
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,440
proclaimed his awakening with the

192
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,800
statement

193
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,599
everything that has the nature to arise

194
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,800
has the nature to pass away

195
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,240
everything that arises passes away

196
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,360
the buddha explained that everything is

197
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,279
inconstant

198
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,560
everything that is an experience

199
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,080
concepts might not be and the ancient

200
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,880
greeks

201
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,920
you know had a lot of

202
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,399
controversy debates about the nature of

203
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,480
impermanence and change and constancy in

204
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,240
this world it's a common topic for

205
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,839
philosophers

206
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,320
and the famous philosopher plato wasn't

207
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,760
that comfortable with that everything

208
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,040
was changing

209
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,480
and he wanted to have something that was

210
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,160
permanent and i believe

211
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,920
a little bit i know about him that he

212
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,080
settled on this idea's platonic concepts

213
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,560
there is

214
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,120
ideas that are unchanging

215
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,440
but the ideas are not direct experience

216
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,040
and the buddha over and over again was

217
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,000
placing ourselves

218
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,360
in direct experience breathing with it

219
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,680
being mindful of it feeling it and

220
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,720
really

221
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,600
entering into this inconstant world

222
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,959
to know it because that is the way to

223
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,880
freedom so i said

224
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,720
the first person was enlightened said

225
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,160
that everything has

226
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,920
everything that has a nature to arise is

227
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,160
the nature of passing away

228
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,519
there's something about that insight

229
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,839
that was liberating

230
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,200
the when the buddha died the the final

231
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,839
statement

232
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,680
that um the first statement i believe

233
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,040
one of the first statements someone said

234
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,200
when he died it became kind of the

235
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,399
funeral chant for buddhists

236
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,279
it also became it's said to be the the

237
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,279
um

238
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,560
the sayings or the affirm the

239
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,920
saying the the saying of the

240
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,920
arhat saying of the fully enlightened

241
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,200
one

242
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,399
and it goes to chant in pali it's anicia

243
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,519
domino

244
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,519
suko

245
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,240
all things are inconstant they have the

246
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,279
nature of arising and passing away

247
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,360
those who see deeply into this truth

248
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,560
experience happiness

249
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,800
so but the happiness not of

250
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,279
you know being totally delighted and

251
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,040
happy all the time

252
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,160
but a deeper happiness

253
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,000
or contentment or satisfaction or

254
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,360
intimacy or something that we are

255
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,000
in touch with what is real in this real

256
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,760
world of ours

257
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,480
so even if we this world is full of

258
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,360
suffering which it is and

259
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,440
the violence against the asian americans

260
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,560
lately and

261
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,680
the shootings and so many

262
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,600
places in this country but most recently

263
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,240
in boulder

264
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,839
is um

265
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,320
you can't say we're happy in the

266
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,160
relationship to that

267
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,160
but there can be a feeling of rightness

268
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,360
that yes if this happens in the world

269
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,640
we want to be present for it we want to

270
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,240
know it we want to it's right

271
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,880
to be aware of it even if it's painful

272
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,720
even if it's what touches some of the

273
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,279
deepest strings in our hearts

274
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,360
but to have the capacity that's if this

275
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,800
is what's happening

276
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,639
yes let's be present for it let's

277
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,560
breathe with it

278
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,880
and all the steps of anapanasati can be

279
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,560
relevant for this

280
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,519
the feeling that pain but to feel that

281
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,000
pain

282
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,120
is not the same as i feel suffering

283
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,519
and this freedom of this practice the

284
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,680
rightness of this practice to feel this

285
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,760
world be present of this world

286
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,200
without suffering but willingly feeling

287
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,120
the pain of this world

288
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,120
so that we can also have compassion for

289
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,519
it and care

290
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,839
so we prepare ourselves for all that

291
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,639
what this world has to offer

292
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,680
so that we can offer ourselves as

293
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,200
someone who is

294
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,720
loving compassionate caring

295
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,519
and that we live in this world in a way

296
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,079
that

297
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,480
supports the betterment of all beings

298
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,959
out everywhere

299
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,639
may all beings everywhere

300
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:07,839
be free thank you
