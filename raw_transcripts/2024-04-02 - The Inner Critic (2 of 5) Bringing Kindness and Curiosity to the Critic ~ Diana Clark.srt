1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:08,960
thing so today I'm going to continue on this topic of the inner critic and

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,400
there's a number of different ways we can Define the inner critic but uh I'm

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,000
influenced by Roba when he talks about it and he says it's like almost like a

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,160
subpersonality inside of us and I'm saying that not being a psychologist so we don't have to read any psychological

5
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:33,520
meaning into that just a you know Common everyday usage but it's this voice

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:40,719
that's like maybe it's a voice it's a constellation of uh um experiences

7
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:47,760
that's like constantly putting us down belittling us this voice of negativity

8
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,960
that's blaming ourselves and nagging us and maybe it's accompanied with this

9
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,079
sense of Shame Shame for what we are or how we are or who we are and it has this

10
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:05,198
climate of harshness and not only that when part of

11
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:10,759
the way that we might even know that it's there is there's this feeling of

12
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:16,400
inadequacy I'm not enough whatever I'm doing it's not enough or I'm not worthy

13
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,680
or who I am as a living being is inadequate not enough in some kind of

14
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,600
way yeah OA there's so much pain and Dua

15
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,759
that can be wrapped up and this uh structure we'll

16
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:42,240
say so for the guided meditation like I did yesterday I'm going to do one that's not the usual guide meditation that we

17
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,960
find in theas um Retreats or instructions it's

18
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,040
not that General one but um to give myself some credibility I want to say

19
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,240
that I learned this from Sharon salsburg somebody who is you know she's a very

20
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:05,240
influential figure here in the terva Buddhism in the Contemporary West and

21
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:13,000
part of the reason why I'm choosing this type of a guided meditation is because it kind of like usurps power from the

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,519
thinking mind and the inner critic you know kind of co-ops of thinking mind so I want to

23
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:26,120
use a guided meditation that's not the usual and not only does it maybe

24
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:33,959
undermine the thinking mind that likes to protest but it also brings a quality of

25
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:40,080
spaciousness and warmth and that's what's needed so we're

26
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:47,000
going to do this kind of a guided meditation I recognize that many of you you know are regular meditators and if

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,360
not here in the 7 AM for years now which is such a beautiful thing but you know

28
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:58,080
maybe have your own meditation practice but just give it a go see what it's like

29
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,599
to do a meditation practice that's a little bit different than the usual just

30
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:10,159
with the idea of bringing some warmth and spaciousness without a whole amount of

31
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:20,200
you know striving and trying to get there okay so taking a meditation

32
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:26,519
posture a posture that has some

33
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,760
uprightness and some ease

34
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:41,840
this a posture that expresses Our intention to

35
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,000
cultivat meditation cultivate spaciousness and

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,040
warmth for the next little

37
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,519
bit maybe a few longer exhales just at

38
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:05,760
the beginning to promote and support a sense

39
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:12,040
of well-being or relaxation longer

40
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,479
exhales can be a big support for

41
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:28,720
that then we'll do some loving kindness towards the

42
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,199
body in a simple

43
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:40,360
way so you can repeat silently after

44
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:48,120
me and the thinking mind may want to show up and say oh this is different

45
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,919
this is not the way real meditation is done can just bow to the thinking mind

46
00:04:53,919 --> 00:05:01,639
and respect and love it and then continue with the meditation

47
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,639

00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:07,558
kindness some warmth and some

121
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:20,798

00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:16,440
like maybe changing the words to words that more

127
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,240
resonate keeping it very simple very

128
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:30,760

[Music]

150
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,559
so good morning good morning everybody or good afternoon good day whatever time

151
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:58,679
it is uh where you are so I'm continuing on this theme of

152
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:05,159
uh this inner critic this uh Inner Voice or constellation of experiences or

153
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:10,320
structure or dynamic I don't really know exactly which word to use but this thing

154
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:17,519
that's kind of like nagging or belittling us or making us feel like we're inadequate in so many different

155
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:24,279
ways and in so many different situations this voice of negativity of

156
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:29,519
how like blaming ourselves and some kind of way and it

157
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:35,480
might be in an obvious way you like very particular thoughts that we hear like oh

158
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:41,640
you're no good or something terrible like that or maybe it's just a sense

159
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:47,840
that things aren't quite right but it comes with a sense of Shame and shame

160
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:53,399
for how we are or who we are and this

161
00:29:53,399 --> 00:30:00,760
harshness and there's this feeling of inadequacy that comes with this that some how who I am or how I am is not

162
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:06,840
enough and so there's wow so much pain can be like caught up in

163
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,799
this have to cough

164
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:24,120
here excuse me sorry about this I mean to cough there so I want to spend just a

165
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:30,200
little bit this morning talking about how the inner critic works not not the

166
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:35,320
you know complete everything like unpacked but to just point to something

167
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:41,039
that might not be noticed and that can be enormously helpful when it is noticed

168
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:48,440
and that is this the inner critic it finds let's say a fault with a

169
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:55,080
particular thing like one specific thing and then opens that up and

170
00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:01,159
globalizes it into an entire assess of how we are as a person like the

171
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:06,480
entirety of how we are a person it goes from one specific little incident and

172
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,720
says therefore it means that you're no good like for

173
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,799
example there might be a way in which for example you might meditate before

174
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:22,000
hearing this talk and there might be uh instance where you find your mind

175
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,360
wandering off and you know not with the meditation any longer this is what Minds

176
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:35,320
do right this is why meditation is a practice where we kind of have to train the mind to keep on coming back to the

177
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:41,519
anchor and that meditation that I guided us and it was the anchor was of saying

178
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:48,240
phrases directed towards different parts of the body and maybe you found the Mind

179
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:54,039
chattering away things you need to do or thinking like oh this is silly why am I

180
00:31:54,039 --> 00:32:00,639
doing this then realize like oh yeah oh yeah I'm supposed to be meditating and coming back to Anor I don't know maybe

181
00:32:00,639 --> 00:32:08,000
there's a that might have happened once or twice while you were meditating maybe for just a few of you maybe

182
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,120
not but there's this way in which uh

183
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:20,720
this uh having noticed that the mind of wandered turns into she you should be a better

184
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:28,559
meditator by now you're hopeless you're never going to get it or

185
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:36,200
you know something that just has like this Global assessment of how you are as a person just because the mind wandered

186
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:41,360
when you were meditating can turn into just this whole

187
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:50,679
sense of like inadequacy and this sense of being inadequate it might be really slight and

188
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:57,120
subtle or it might be harsh and obvious so there's a way in which we can feel

189
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:02,760
just a little like out of sorts or off-kilter or maybe there's a way we

190
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:09,120
feel a little deflated or unenthusiastic it kind of like you know takes the wind

191
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:17,320
out of our sails kind of a feeling just in general or it can be this uh really

192
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:23,000
harsh and really maybe obvious it might not be obvious either just because it's

193
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,880
so familiar we just feel like oh yeah okay this is the way it should be there's this way we can feel like uh

194
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:36,840
annihilated or like deeply flawed or deeply disappointed in ourselves not

195
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:43,480
only in ourselves but uh in the world in this way in which there's this uh yeah

196
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:49,080
sense of hopelessness or like kind of like this lack of energy now or this

197
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:54,799
want to like just disengage and you know move away from whatever

198
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:59,960
we're doing this way we want to like go distract ourselves to try to make ourselves feel

199
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:06,960
better so this feeling of inadequacy it can be just really slight or it can be

200
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:12,118
really harsh and devastating and it might be obvious or

201
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:20,638
it might be really subtle and it might show up in specific words I'm using words like uh I'm

202
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:27,000
hopeless or this just uh you're no good or you're

203
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,320
not good enough or something like that or it might not be in distinct words it

204
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:41,158
might just be this General sense of I don't know deflation and uh this

205
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:46,878
you know losing um some well maybe losing energy of wanting to go forward

206
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:53,960
or if there is energy the energy is all about okay I have to fix it I have to be better here I'm going to do something

207
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:59,119
about it instead of this sense of kind of some uprightness an ability to just

208
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:05,240
meet whatever is to be showing up next so just this general feeling of

209
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:11,680
inadequacy or not being enough and part of this inadequacy shows up also as a

210
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:17,520
sense of should like okay something should happen maybe it's not even clear

211
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:24,720
what it is but there's a sense of okay whatever is happening whatever I'm experiencing it's not good enough

212
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,000
there's got to be something better like I have to be better I have to be having

213
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,040
a better experience or I have to be a better meditator I have to show up in

214
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:41,800
some kind of way so the impact the consequence of

215
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:48,160
this feeling of inadequacy that this feeling like things need to be better or it's not good

216
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:56,400
enough is that it is uh squashes our ability to see clearly like see clearly

217
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:02,680
what's actually happening there's this way when the inner critic is up again whether it's subtle or it's

218
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:09,040
obvious there can be a wish to either like distract ourselves because it's so uncomfortable or there's this real sense

219
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:16,640
of whatever is happening is not good enough and we have to go seek or create or manufactur manipulate engineer do

220
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:21,920
something to make it better so when this feeling of

221
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:27,040
inadequacy is there we're not able to get a clear sense of what's actually

222
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:32,119
happening we're not we're kind of like disengaged

223
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:38,000
from what's actually here what's the felt experience of this

224
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:44,480
moment we're no longer to be present with that we're no longer able to be present with that like this feeling of

225
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:50,160
inadequacy kind of like hijacks our attention and it feels so uncomfortable

226
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:57,680
that we're distracting or going elsewhere or trying to make this uncomfortable feeling going away so

227
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:04,040
we're not able to see or get a clear sense of what's actually happening in the moment this is often why the inner

228
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:10,200
critic kind of like just feels pervasive and isn't able to be seen but also what

229
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:16,240
we can't see is what's needed to learn from the

230
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:21,680
situation maybe this um for example that I gave like during the meditation maybe

231
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:27,640
you found the mind was wandering a lot and maybe we can learn that oh maybe it

232
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:33,960
it's for example maybe it's helpful to have my morning coffee before I meditate

233
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:40,640
I'm one of those people I have coffee in the morning before I meditate it's just what I do I I I don't know I enjoy it I

234
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:46,400
like it and maybe but maybe that's something that I have learned like okay yeah meditation is a little bit

235
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:52,119
different if I have my coffee or maybe when the inner critic is up and running

236
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:58,640
and we can't see clearly we can't see clearly what is true the mind

237
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:03,920
wanders and then what is extra this feeling of like Oh I'm a terrible

238
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:10,839
meditator or it has to be better or I need to be better or it should be different these are two different things

239
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:16,920
what's true what actually happened and then what gets added on Top This you

240
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:22,319
this inner critic is adding some assessment that um somehow we're

241
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:27,760
inadequate in some kind of way so what are some ways that we can

242
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:35,079
practice with this and this uh is will be kind of what we'll be exploring with this week is

243
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:41,560
first of all we want to relate to this inner critic if we're able to see how

244
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:46,880
it's showing up and belittling us and with a a sense of harshness or

245
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:53,720
inadequacy or shame or whatever way it shows up we want to relate to it with

246
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:59,359
spaciousness and kindness and right it would just be the

247
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:06,520
critic on the critic and then there'd be the critic of the critic of the critic and off we go just this cycle of being

248
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:12,480
critical so the inner critic would love to co-opt our looking at the inner

249
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,839
critic it would love to do that that's partly why I'm doing a different guided

250
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:24,440
meditation because that guided meditation kind of gives the Mind something to do so it's not so readily

251
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:31,800
coopting uh our experience so we want to relate to the inner critic with

252
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:38,720
curiosity spaciousness and warmth like oh okay here it is and to be honest it's

253
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:43,760
not surprising if it's there it's so prevalent and kind of like modern

254
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:49,720
society or the way things are these days and so when we discover that

255
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:55,319
there's this strong feeling of inadequacy part of the way that we can

256
00:39:55,319 --> 00:40:01,119
undermine like usurp of the power or the authority that the inner critic likes to

257
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:08,240
give is to just simply and with some warmth and some spaciousness ask

258
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:15,920
ourselves how am I right now how am I right now what's the

259
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:24,280
experience at this moment and so tune into the mediate felt

260
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:30,880
experience the inner critic is always trying us to feel like something is better and we have to do something else

261
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:37,480
but to kind of just tune in okay no actually what's happening is a way that really can

262
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:44,640
undermine this thinking mind that's trying to convince us that something else has to be better so just ask

263
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:53,839
ourselves how am I right now in the way that we might see uh a child that is a

264
00:40:53,839 --> 00:41:01,319
bit out of sorts but uh we're not sure what's happening and we just ask oh what's going on how are

265
00:41:01,319 --> 00:41:08,200
you with care and warmth not because we have to fix it not because it's wrong to

266
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:17,240
feel that way but because this is how we Express Care this is how we express warmth and

267
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:22,359
uh engagement and connection how am I right

268
00:41:22,359 --> 00:41:29,640
now and then just be open to what's happening we don't have to find the answer don't have to dig for the answer

269
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:36,078
because the inner critic is telling us that the experience should be different and we should be

270
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:42,720
different and so we can add this how am I right now just with some warmth and

271
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:47,839
some care and allow whatever is to be found to be found and maybe we discover

272
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:54,160
that actually we feel terrible and can we bring some care to

273
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:59,680
that maybe we might find that oh no things are fine and can we bring some care to

274
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:05,640
that and so we can add this to yesterday's instructions of I'm doing

275
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:11,599
the best I can right now I'm doing the best I can right now

276
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:17,079
maybe is a way to uh respond to the inner critic or maybe the sense

277
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:24,240
of how am I right now how am I like what's what's going on these are two

278
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:29,760
different ways in which can we can respond to when we feel the inner critic

279
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:37,119
and maybe sometimes one way is more accessible than another way maybe sometimes you can't really like respond

280
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:42,359
or feel into how you are right now and maybe all you can have this idea is I'm

281
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:48,880
doing the best I can right now so whichever is available these are two different ways in which we can respond

282
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:54,280
when we discover that this inner critic is up and running and not only is it up

283
00:42:54,280 --> 00:43:00,200
and running but it seems as believable and authorita which is what the inner critic likes to

284
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:06,520
do right to convince us that it's correct so meeting the inner critic with

285
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:13,000
some curiosity and care we don't have to be critical of the

286
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,839
critic so with that I'm wishing you a wonderful rest of the day however

287
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:27,119
whether it's the end of the day for you or the beginning of the day meeting the critic with curiosity and Care thank you

288
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,279
thank

289
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,920
you
