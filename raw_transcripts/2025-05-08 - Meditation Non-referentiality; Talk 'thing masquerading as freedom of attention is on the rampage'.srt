1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:08,280
okay Uh welcome welcome folks Good to be with

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:16,080
you As for a theme meditation theme I got one

3
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:22,039
comment to make it NBA basketball

4
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:27,519
related which brings to mind a recent event This will not be the theme of the

5
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:33,640
meditation but I was watching the Warriors um against the Rockets

6
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:40,920
uh tense game and uh with my nephew who's

7
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,680
14 and you would say I was not in a well- reggulated

8
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,239
state I was kind of like I I don't even sit when I watch It's like I just I'm

9
00:00:52,239 --> 00:01:00,600
kind of I don't always watch I can't I can't But um sort of like pacing around

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:08,720
and kind of exaggerated grunts and fear and hope and just pirouetting back and

11
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,840
forth from dread to

12
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:20,439
relief and uh and he wasn't doing that well

13
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:25,600
himself but he is 14 and at some point he said he calls me mana cuz when he was

14
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:34,840
a kid he couldn't say Mad or Matthew and um said "Mana you're a meditation

15
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:41,720
teacher." Fair enough Fair enough And it's sort of

16
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:47,680
like I don't know I need some things to care about that don't matter It's a

17
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,759
little how it feels but it feels like it matters but it

18
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:58,479
doesn't Anyway may we send lots of love and

19
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,880
kindness to Steph Curry's hamstring

20
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,599
and we will now meditate

21
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,879
Okay settle in

22
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,200
relaxing everything but the brightness

23
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Just filling out your body with light

24
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:17,919
the center of gravity just dropping

25
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,759
down into your belly

26
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:14,120
There's a lot of gravity here on this part of the universe

27
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:29,120
We just uh appreciate the way in which the earth

28
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,759
holds us fast

29
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,840
and take some uh fuller breaths through your belly

30
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:03,000
Man the softening Softening

31
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:49,880
And just like uh the location of a phone might be pinpointed by

32
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,560
uh how it pings to different cell towers where it

33
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:02,640
is in relation in reference to those towers

34
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:16,920
We ping to certain reference points in experience to locate ourselves

35
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:33,920
the felt outline of our body before it gives way to

36
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,959
space our

37
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:49,080
preferences our so-called life our plans

38
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,040
Ping to the tower of uh

39
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,040
craving aversion

40
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,399
And we locate ourself in this Hey

41
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:18,920
What would it mean to be here without reference points

42
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,440
without referentiality

43
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,519
We're good at uh noticing

44
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:07,360
phenomena Just we tend to hold on too

45
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:17,000
long Like we need to

46
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,160
Make sure all phenomena are

47
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:34,279
safe Not hiding some secret we need to extract for our life

48
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:53,760
How gracefully might we put

49
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:01,720
down sight and sound sensation and thought

50
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:37,960
become uh tolerant of [Music]

51
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,360
endings things

52
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:57,320
dissolving Not needing to pick something new

53
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:04,919
up Not needing to remind ourselves

54
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:14,600
of who what where why we are

55
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:41,320
live in the know where you come from and though you have an address

56
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,720
here Roomie invites

57
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:47,120
even sense of I'm the

58
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,600
meditator or I'm teaching meditation

59
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,158
Just another ping

60
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,660
[Music]

61
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:43,960
Okay Um so attention

62
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:53,559
and love have important connections And if you if you

63
00:30:53,559 --> 00:31:00,120
fragment the attention love gets compromised

64
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:08,480
to And um makes some sense to me that uh the

65
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:14,520
technological uh frenzy the kind of regime of

66
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:22,520
technological frenzy under which we live might be correlated with increases

67
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:27,559
in hate and fragmented

68
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:32,919
love And um this was published in

69
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:39,120
2019 draft form by a group that called themselves friends of attention I I do I

70
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:45,200
did not do much research I just came across this They may be lovely people It

71
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:53,880
may be a cult but this is their manifesto Edit it down a little bit

72
00:31:53,880 --> 00:32:00,080
So in the present and worsening state of things the faculty and the power of

73
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:06,559
human desire suffers from monoculture the overultivation of one or

74
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:14,000
maybe two forms of a desire in addition to one or more primitive spasms of the brain stem that

75
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,519
resemble but are not desire Desire is impoverished and it has

76
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:25,799
fallen and the grammar of desire too both its call and its

77
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:31,880
response Instead there is the continuous circular generation of immediate

78
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:38,480
satisfaction of miserable debased desires a thing that masquerades as

79
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:44,440
freedom of attentions on the rampage It resembles an infinitely

80
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:49,919
scrolling buffet of choice where even the most thrilling of

81
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:55,279
confections made up of the same dye and corn syrup as all the rest

82
00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:04,159
Constant invitations to self-expression are instead solicitations to evacuate the self in

83
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:09,360
which in the end stages one simply arranges a series of

84
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:16,240
attractive objects within the empty bobble bedcked frame of a thing that was

85
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:25,320
once a person True freedom of attention is a burden that uplifts its bearer When it's first

86
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:33,600
assumed it feels like it's opposite like unfreedom But in fact it is what happens

87
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:39,519
when a human in full and conscious possession of her freedom and power of

88
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:46,399
attention forges a path through space matter ideas and time Attention is a

89
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:53,519
form of love Yes love as one expects is the answer But we do not yet know what

90
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:59,000
love is or could be The house of attention has many

91
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,279
mansions Attention transforms mere points of space or points of reference

92
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:12,158
into rooms corridors and labyrinth Attention is a trap door

93
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:20,440
opening down Anything given sufficient attention will open into an

94
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:27,040
abyss of knowledge experience and

95
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:37,679
desire Attention is u the most basic currency

96
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:44,839
of being human most basic currency of our dharma practice

97
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:52,280
And yet we're vulnerable The attention is very

98
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:57,320
vulnerable And because technology has so

99
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:04,320
effectively scaled greed hate delusion you know it's almost like the

100
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:10,240
second noble truth has gotten worse There's a cause of suffering You

101
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:15,680
know craving is the cause So you know it's I don't know Maybe it's

102
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:21,200
ill advised to say something's gotten worse That seems very deeply baked into

103
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:27,119
human nature and kind of impervious to to many influences But it seems like

104
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:35,960
it's worse The ease with which certain desires can be expressed has made the cycle of

105
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:43,720
craving acquisition momentary satisfaction and then heartbreak

106
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:53,599
tighter That loop is tighter and the information economy like

107
00:35:53,599 --> 00:36:00,680
a fresh pain each hour confronting

108
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:07,800
us reminding us of our nearly complete helplessness

109
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:18,440
And we kind of are chasing that helplessness with debaseed desire

110
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:23,599
compulsivity And then maybe the dharma is supposed to provide the perfect

111
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:31,440
consolation to all of that But we know it doesn't it won't

112
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,680
And it's almost like our our

113
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:45,520
power our power is dwarfed by our love Oh that my monk's robe were wide

114
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:53,440
enough to gather up all the suffering people in this floating world So Ria's

115
00:36:54,760 --> 00:37:03,000
lament and then we we sort of acclimatize to frenzy and it feels almost

116
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:11,039
like we owe the world or we owe our helplessness that

117
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:16,920
frenzy and we wrongly assume that in that frenzy we're

118
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,400
suffering effectively

119
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:33,480
Naomi Shabn slowly is not the full poem Slowly

120
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:39,400
slow clean one drawer Arrange words on a

121
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:45,680
page Let them find one another Find you

122
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:51,359
trust they might know something You aren't living the whole

123
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:58,079
thing at once That's what the minute said to an

124
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:04,359
hour without me You're nothing

125
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:18,960
given sufficient attention anything will open into an abyss of

126
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:25,240
desire And we we don't typically link attention and

127
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:31,040
desire Even desire sounds like a bad word in Buddhism Sometimes that's used

128
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:39,839
interchangeably with craving but not here It strikes me that that um patient

129
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:44,520
attention careful attention

130
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:51,359
uh deep attention cultivates a certain kind of desire a certain kind of

131
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:57,640
engagement fidelity It's through that kind of

132
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:06,599
patient attention that dharma becomes a passion project

133
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:12,480
And we recognize maybe at the end of a day maybe right now maybe at the end of

134
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:18,079
a week or on the first day of a retreat that we've been glancing off the

135
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:27,839
surface of life And that makes irritability and agitation much more

136
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:34,320
accessible And so like staying maybe with a piece of

137
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:39,599
art lingering a little longer than we might

138
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:47,000
we stay with experience Just stay We risk

139
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,119
boredom We risk

140
00:39:54,760 --> 00:40:00,560
impulsivity Took a long time to do that painting

141
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,440
Let us see

142
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:13,680
attention they go on to say transforms mere points of reference into rooms

143
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:20,839
corridors labyrinths and that kind

144
00:40:20,839 --> 00:40:25,880
of transformation is important in uh for

145
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:34,200
love Attentional stability kind of staying risking

146
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:44,280
boredom is important for love the kind of gradual opening of a of a point into a

147
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:49,599
space point into rooms corridors

148
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:58,640
labyrinths Simone V we have to uh wrote we have to try to cure our faults by

149
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:04,000
attention and not by will Attention taken to its highest degree is the same

150
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,560
thing as prayer presupposes faith and

151
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:17,000
love Absolutely unmixed attention is prayer If we turn our minds towards the

152
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:25,000
good it's impossible that little by little the whole soul will not be

153
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:30,079
attracted there too in spite of

154
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:40,520
itself Shared that before That's what come back to it now What would it be

155
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:45,839
to cure something through

156
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,318
attention In the dharma we might say that

157
00:41:52,359 --> 00:41:59,040
um wise attention refineses out the forces of

158
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:04,800
grieving delusion Or we might say that faith and love

159
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:11,800
follow in the wake of letting go We

160
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:17,599
cure our faults by attention not by will by offering

161
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:23,079
ourselves up to something not by

162
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:28,440
engineering And little by little the whole soul will be

163
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:35,960
attracted towards the good I think that's right Part of

164
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:44,359
why we don't stay quiet is that we have to give up our hate

165
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:53,720
Hatred just cannot withstand kind of

166
00:42:53,720 --> 00:43:00,680
patient deep tension We might still have to say

167
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:07,839
no But the embraciveness of hatred becomes self evidently

168
00:43:08,359 --> 00:43:14,760
painful and it's not the most effective way of saying no

169
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:20,720
This is the prayer of

170
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:31,480
attention and uh our love depends on it

171
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:41,480
offer this for your uh consideration and

172
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:46,520
um be at retreat next week So won't have class but

173
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:52,520

174
