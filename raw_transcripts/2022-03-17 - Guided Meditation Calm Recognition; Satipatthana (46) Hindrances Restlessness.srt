1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:09,280
so hello everyone yesterday i uh used the analogy of

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:15,120
driving uh and when someone is excited they push the gas more

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,680
maybe even unconsciously and when they're maybe distracted or

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:29,359
the energy level drops they really pull back a little bit from the gas pedal and the car drives slower

5
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,559
another driving analogy is for mindfulness

6
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:41,680
is that uh on the freeway when we drive the idea is to for every 10 mile speed

7
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:49,360
to have 10 feet between you and the car in front of you so at 50 miles an hour 60 miles an hour you have

8
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:56,160
50 60 feet between you and uh and then you're safe

9
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,520
so with mindfulness we're putting space between the speed of our lives

10
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,920
and some of us are going fast and the faster we're going perhaps the more space we should have

11
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,080
so we don't crash into things and um and how to make space

12
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:20,080
with mindfulness is um to view mindfulness as especially as

13
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:26,640
we're getting the hang of mindfulness and developing it to see it as a kind of a stopping

14
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:33,680
to stop and take a good look to stop and and instead of just going along with

15
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,640
the train of thought with whatever we're feeling whatever going and the best of your ability to stop to look at it

16
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,840
and recognize what it is and then

17
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,040
if once it's been seen or recognized

18
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,079
then pause and now what this pause means to

19
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:02,719
um to like register what happens in the wake of recognizing it

20
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:09,360
what what house is is the thing experienced more fully once it's been recognized once it's been

21
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,560
known as it's being seen work fully

22
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,760
and then this relaxed way to stop recognize

23
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:26,080
pause and take in the experience what's happening then and then do it again

24
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:33,280
and um and then we're not uh rushing ahead with whatever thoughts and feelings and

25
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,360
things we're doing and we can live a safer life

26
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:46,080
and this is particularly maybe useful with today's topic which is restlessness

27
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,239
and agitation anxiety to um

28
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,760
to his sense to whatever it means for you to stop

29
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,360
to recognize the restlessness this hyper energy

30
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:10,159
that can happen hyper arouse state stop and recognize it's happening not to

31
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,280
make it a problem but stop recognize and then

32
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,480
pause for a while to just take in the experience don't just go along with it

33
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:27,599
feel it in the body feel it in the mind well this is what it's like and also to see if you can pause long

34
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,360
enough to see what difference the recognition makes

35
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:40,000
the power of recognition is quite something so stop

36
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,120
recognize pause and feel

37
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,720
so um and as meditation gets quieter and more

38
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:58,159
calm then this seeing of restlessness seeing of agitation also becomes quieter more

39
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:06,640
subtle restlessness so taking a meditation posture

40
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:14,080
and maybe rocking back and forth a little

41
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:20,799
bit forward and backwards maybe in a way that feels delightful to

42
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:27,080
begin being in your body in this meditative posture

43
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,960
and then gently closing your eyes

44
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,240
and again perhaps as a with some feeling of satisfaction to be starting your

45
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:55,800
meditation taking some gentle deep breaths

46
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,240
and as you exhale relax

47
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,479
and then letting your breathing return to normal

48
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:28,080
and feel your body kind of a global awareness of your body

49
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:35,039
maybe with your attention roaming around your body and as you

50
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:41,039
exhale relax in your body

51
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,720
soften in your body

52
00:05:53,440 --> 00:06:00,759
relax into your body as if it's a kind of homecoming

53
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:22,560
then to gently

54
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,800
center yourself on your breathing

55
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,039
as if the comings and goings of in-breath and out-breath

56
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:44,160
is something you're pausing

57
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:51,639
everything else so that you can recognize it know it

58
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,440
relaxing on the exhale

59
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,199
receptive to the inhale

60
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:15,280
feeling maybe the penny pleasure that's in the experience of breathing

61
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,960
maybe it's a particular point in the cycle of breathing

62
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,280
or maybe it's in a particular part of your body where the rhythm of breathing is

63
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,280
pleasant

64
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:08,640
relaxing as you exhale and feeling the

65
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:16,880
pleasure of whatever calm or state there is within

66
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:24,240
maybe a kind of global experience that's not focusing on anything in

67
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:32,000
particular a global experience of calm or peace

68
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
warmth

69
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:43,000
as you breathe the middle of all things

70
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,920
as you exhale relaxing the mind

71
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:42,320
exhaling and appreciate whatever pleasant calm or peace

72
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,839
might be in the mind even if it's only hints

73
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,920
and letting there be a gentle calm recognition

74
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:42,320
of what's happening in the present it can be recognizing the inhale

75
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:49,440
the exhale recognizing sensations of the body or

76
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:57,120
sounds feelings or mind states

77
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,600
thoughts

78
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:09,839
calmly recognize and let there be a pause after

79
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:17,920
recognizing to feel and sense what happens

80
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,720
to register

81
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,639
and if there's any way that you're restless or agitated

82
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:20,959
stop for that recognize it

83
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:28,320
pause and feel their restlessness but feel it calmly

84
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:36,720
recognize it calmly so that there's a kind of a meeting

85
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:44,000
meeting between whatever restlessness there is agitation

86
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,320
and the calmness that you bring to it

87
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:57,279
with a calm recognition a comp pausing to feel and sense

88
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,839
the experience

89
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:48,720
whatever way you are your offering

90
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:56,960
is to calmly know it and if you're agitated it's okay

91
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,679
calmly know recognize

92
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:11,840
pause feel sense what that experience is like

93
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,760
so

94
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,279
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

95
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:00,440
to calmly recognize

96
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:12,399
how you are right now where the act of recognition is calm

97
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:19,679
you might not be will you take your time to recognize and

98
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,200
to feel and to sense

99
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:33,440
so you're creating a space

100
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:40,320
so there's the thinking mind the reactive mind

101
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,600
doesn't just go uninterruptedly

102
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:54,320
there's pauses like there would be a pause or a gap

103
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:59,000
with the car in front of you in the freeway

104
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:09,440
and this ability to stop recognize

105
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:18,480
and feel the spirit experience know the experience

106
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:27,840
create space and time for more of our life to emerge and show

107
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:35,440
itself and it creates more of our life

108
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:44,240
more more opportunities for us to take in and recognize and know others

109
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:49,440
either when they're in their presence or when we think about them or

110
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:57,360
we consider them people we don't know that we learn about maybe even in the news

111
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:08,480
and to take in this world of suffering and challenge

112
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,120
that humans live in

113
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:21,440
and to offer that loving pause and recognition

114
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:29,039
that allows us to see this life of ours more clearly even if just for a moment or two

115
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:37,640
calmly gazing upon the world

116
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:44,640
and letting that be an occasion for your care

117
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:51,840
your kindness your good will

118
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:58,720
may you create calm so you can see the world kindly

119
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:05,840
may all beings be happy

120
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:11,200
may all beings be safe

121
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,398
may all beings be peaceful

122
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:22,039
and may all beings be free

123
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,920
[Music]

124
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,780
[Music]

125
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:50,799
so we come to the fourth of the five hindrances

126
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:59,760
and these hindrances are you know when they're strong for us

127
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:06,720
it's kind of like tailgating the car in front of us on the freeway

128
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,200
and we don't have to

129
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:20,559
stop the hindrances but we want to end their hindering

130
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:26,320
quality so for example restlessness

131
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:34,080
agitation can hinder our ability to see to calmly recognize

132
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:40,080
to calmly consider what's going on it hinders our ability to be wise and be

133
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:45,440
clear about what's happening we don't have to stop being

134
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:51,760
restless but the idea is to not have the restlessness interfere anymore

135
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:57,360
and one way to do that is to practice mindfulness and today i'm referring to

136
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:03,679
mindfulness as the practice of stopping in order to recognize what's happening

137
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:09,600
and perhaps if we don't appreciate the stopping the recognition is done kind of quickly

138
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:15,279
automatically kind of part and parcel of the usual ways of the mind working and

139
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:22,000
it's not really stepping out of the stream of restlessness agitation to take a look at it

140
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,200
so something inside stops enough to take a good look

141
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:33,679
and then or a good recognition oh this is what's happening i'm restless i'm agitated

142
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:40,080
and but let the recognition become and learning how you can have

143
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:47,120
agency in one particular area and that is the agency to take the time to recognize

144
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:53,039
what's happening calmly take your time oh restlessness it can be

145
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:59,679
like that in your mind restlessness restlessness is happening

146
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:05,760
the mind might be going at 90 miles an hour but the recognition

147
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:12,800
is kind of like a person maybe who is driving in the slow lane or probably standing on the side of the road and

148
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:19,520
look at that speed a car going by fast and so to recognize calmly the act of

149
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:25,599
recognition is where we take some agency and then in the

150
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:30,960
in the agency in that recognition then to pause afterwards

151
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,000
to register take in that experience and what that can mean is to register

152
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,398
take in the experience of restlessness in a deeper fuller way and make space for it and really feel it

153
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:49,280
in that space that's been created by the recognition it could also be take in the impact the

154
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:55,440
effect that recognition has stopping and recognizing has it might create a little more space a

155
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:01,280
little more calm it might slow down the restlessness and agitation we might

156
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:07,920
have restless and agitation is part of life

157
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:14,640
you know even in deep meditation you can feel sometimes and it doesn't it might be a tremendous amount of calm

158
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,680
but the mind kind of gets a little bit excited i mean sometimes it gets excited about

159
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:26,160
meditation oh look i'm so calm and you can feel the mind getting a little bit agitated or excited

160
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:33,680
and and so to recognize and relax and let it settle down again

161
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:42,400
the two words for restlessness and um you know it's two words so

162
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:48,320
both words imply this hyper arousal this things are a little bit more excited or

163
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,960
wrestle or activated than than

164
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:58,640
and so one of them is just called restlessness often or agitation

165
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:05,040
and the other word is sometimes called worry

166
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:10,800
sometimes it's called regret and i don't know you know it's hard to

167
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:16,160
know exactly what the pali word is supposed to mean but the principle that this is hyper

168
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:22,560
aroused state that can happen it can be worry it can be panic it can be

169
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:29,359
fear that we it can be um regrets

170
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:37,119
regrets can keep us churning away turning away um uh you know with a lot of energy

171
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:42,880
it could be um you know anxiety that keeps us activated

172
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,400
and so to recognize what it is anxiety regrets

173
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:54,720
just kind of ener physical agitation restlessness mental agitation restlessness

174
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:00,800
and and to calmly

175
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:07,520
know it calmly recognize it and get to know what it's like

176
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:12,800
and the more with all these interests the more we learn to be familiar with them

177
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:18,079
and really know what they are physically emotionally mentally

178
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:23,760
behaviorally then the more we're able to see it coming

179
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:29,119
we can recognize oh i'm beginning to go in that direction and when we can

180
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:34,640
if we can catch something as it begins there's often a little bit more ability

181
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:40,079
to back off or to pause more or let go of it

182
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:47,680
so but but in order to do that it takes a lot of familiarity so with restlessness anxiety

183
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,480
remorse agitation

184
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:59,680
look forward to the day when in meditation you can have a nice belt of it

185
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,920
rather than viewing it as unfortunate then a drag and you have to get figure out some way not to be agitated and this

186
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:11,280
is proof that you're you know you should never be meditating

187
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:18,000
take it as an opportunity to study it and get to know it i've had fascinating meditations where i

188
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,760
was a restless and it felt like ping-pong balls kind of bouncing inside my body

189
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,880
and i was just kind of amazed to watch this energy and like where did this come from

190
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:35,359
and and just sit there quietly and feel the ping-pong balls bouncing off the sides of my body from the inside kind of

191
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:40,480
feeling feeling the surging energy in their arms

192
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:46,800
and the legs and or the mind that doesn't seem to want to stop chattering

193
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,320
to be amazed wow as opposed to being

194
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:59,280
horrified or upset and then take the time to the okay this is the time i was been looking for

195
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,400
a time for me to really take in the experience of restlessness

196
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:10,240
agitation let me just kind of sit in the middle of it and like sitting in the middle of the

197
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:17,440
fire sit in the middle of it and just real this is my chance to feel it get to know it become familiar with it let me see if

198
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:23,839
i can understand to see something new about it something i've never known before

199
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:30,480
is it in my little finger is it my toes no where is it do you feel any of it in

200
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:36,320
your along your back um well maybe and maybe not where do you

201
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:42,560
feel it where is it where it's what's activated um and what are your beliefs around it

202
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:49,200
what are your second arrows that you have about restlessness agitation having regrets

203
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:55,599
having um anxiety and um

204
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:01,839
and maybe it's a second arrows maybe it's the reactivity we have with them which is a fuel for the agitation for

205
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:07,359
the fear the anxiety whatever it might be and so this thing about

206
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:14,079
assuming agency assuming that we have some ability

207
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:21,760
to meet a situation we're in we can't necessarily change it or control it but we have some agency over

208
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,040
our ability to show up for it and and so

209
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:32,240
to stop okay i'm agitated okay i'm going to stop for my agitation as opposed to kind of

210
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:38,160
keep doing everything or something i'm going to stop my agitation and if you do that and stop maybe even

211
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:44,160
close your eyes maybe you find your shoulders relax a little bit and that's the beginning of some

212
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:49,680
different way of being with it and then the agency of calmly

213
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:55,440
recognizing so you know if you if you use if you

214
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:02,640
want to recognize verbally in your mind sometimes that's very helpful and just say to yourself in a calm way

215
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:07,838
oh this is restlessness

216
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:13,119
so that you're decoupling the

217
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:18,880
the mind that does the thinking from the restlessness itself

218
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:24,880
the mind might be mostly restless but out of you know it's like if you

219
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:30,560
talk to someone who you know if you talk to someone in the library

220
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:37,920
you might feel agitated but because it's the library you talk quietly

221
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:43,839
and so you talk quietly in your mind oh this is restlessness

222
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:50,000
and then you pause or you take time maybe a luxurious time to feel and know

223
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:58,240
that experience and in this way we're getting wise about

224
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:04,319
restlessness anxiety remorse regrets agitation

225
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:09,839
the whole family of things what happens when we get hyper aroused and

226
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:13,519
we're finding a different way to be with it

227
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:22,800
and uh begin to appreciate when you're familiar with agitation

228
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:30,160
once you're familiar with your agitation also take the time to become equally familiar with the time when you are not

229
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:37,359
agitated when you feel you feel calm or peaceful or settled

230
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:44,480
do the same thing there stop recognize pause and really feel it and

231
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:50,160
here we're being able to recognize calm states or peaceful states

232
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:55,200
we can also see them coming we can see hints of them and allow them to blossom

233
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:01,599
because we recognize them and make space for them and also

234
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:08,960
it makes more room for them to appear to be there and we can somehow let that be a richer part of our

235
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,838
life so restlessness

236
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:21,280
anxiety i hope that you don't have much

237
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:27,440
i hope the practice supports you and not having being caught in it but i also do hope that you look for an

238
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:32,720
opportunity to get to know it better and have a different relationship with it and

239
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:39,280
practice your agency of being a calm recognition and so maybe today i'm sure that there

240
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:44,560
will be some occasion for something in the family of agitation restlessness

241
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:49,920
excitement to occur and and

242
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,799
take a good look at it
