1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,940
sake of Audio Dharma here we go okay great so

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:12,179
hello and welcome everyone to happy hour so for today's practice

3
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:20,039
um I'd like to invite us to consider is

4
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:25,320
um the theme of this interstitial time how

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,220
we fill our interstitial time I love this new word I've just learned

6
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:38,579
interstitial time which is basically a a time that's in between it's in between

7
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,620
other things it's in between other things when you're walking from place to

8
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:49,020
place or when you're waiting for someone and it's it's interstitial time it's

9
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,180
it's the sword essentially means that it it fills a space a space in between

10
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,520
other things so interstitial time what an interesting concept so I've become

11
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,739
tuned tuned to how I feel interstitial

12
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:12,060
time so that's one theme I want to bring in today and really how we how we spend our

13
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:20,939
interstitial time um is you know it the way we Engage The Way

14
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:28,020
We engage in their in the interstitial time do we space out are we agitated

15
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,500
waiting for the next thing to happen are we ruminating about what just happened

16
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,640
are we um pulling out our phone and just

17
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,020
vegging out by letting our Consciousness wedge out on social media

18
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:53,040
wherever it wants to take us like take you know it's as if we we're giving it our the you know as if we're a dog and

19
00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:00,240
we're giving the little leash okay take us anywhere you want to go dear Facebook or our stream you know how do we spend

20
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,180
our interstitial time how do we spend it

21
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:12,860
and and related to this question of how do we spend our interstitial time

22
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:20,700
is um is the the idea of of Engagement because

23
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,800
however we engage however we engage

24
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:32,819
um in our life in these interstitial time that's one example but how how we engage

25
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:38,640
with um during our time say how we engage

26
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:45,060
with our breath how we engage with our body how we engage our awareness how we engage our consciousness

27
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:51,360
it shows up in other places it shows up in other places in our lives

28
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:58,860
I was talking with a practitioner recently and they were saying that they've noticed as they practice they've

29
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,440
leaned more more into their practice they're more engaged with their practice

30
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:10,200
of mindfulness of breathing for example that this is what they were doing it's a

31
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,959
sense of Engagement they've noticed they're more engaged at their work with

32
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:22,140
their life just attitude of Engagement as has really Arisen for them is is

33
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:30,239
fire it up as they engage in other ways in other areas of life

34
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,940
so these are the two themes I want to bring in of course in in the container

35
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:42,120
of meta how do we spend our interstitial time how are we engaging because that

36
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:48,599
engagement during all the time of course but but especially I want to highlight

37
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:54,180
the inter interstitial time because we all have it we all have it maybe you wake up in the morning you're brushing

38
00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:03,840
your teeth okay what's what's happening in all these interstitial times this time is short time is so short really I

39
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:12,180
this weekend I was teaching about mindfulness of mortality um and as we really contemplate how how

40
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:18,120
brief our life is we start to Value these interstitial times again not to

41
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,520
get stressed that's not the idea to stress ourselves I out and feel

42
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:30,720
pressured sometimes it's quite healthy to let our minds wander it's quite healthy it's

43
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,759
quite wise we make a conscious Choice okay I've really been engaging working

44
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:42,660
hard all day okay I'm in going to go for a walk and let my mind wander to make a

45
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,820
wise choice so that's a wise choice to make as well I'm not saying that mind

46
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:53,759
wandering is bad there are there's a value in not trying too hard all the

47
00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:00,540
time and squeezing ourselves and yet to be conscious of how are we engaging how

48
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:06,240
are we engaging in our lives in these precious moments of being alive

49
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:13,560
and with the theme of happy hour being dedicated to meta and all the other

50
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:19,919
Brahma viharas how are we engaging with our hearts how are we engaging

51
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:27,720
heartfully with every moment um in the west when I say the word mind we

52
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:33,900
always think about our head but in the east in the in Pali in the

53
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:40,800
language of the Buddha the word chitta or Consciousness it can

54
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,639
often also be chittag be translated as mind Dash heart mind heart mind heart so

55
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:54,800
how are we engaging with our mind heart our awareness our Consciousness our chitta how is it

56
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:02,220
engaging with every moment was it with heart is it with wisdom so

57
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:08,639
that's the inquiry I'd like to bring in for us and of course we explore that in

58
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:15,120
the guided meditation that I will guide us and let it be a support for all the

59
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:23,360
interstitial times so all right let's let's practice together let's sit so

60
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:31,860
ah so Landing arriving in your seat arriving in this moment

61
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:39,660
and if your body needs adjusting if you're ah you draw your shoulders back

62
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:46,819
sit a little differently more upright to bring more energy

63
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:53,060
or maybe you need to relax and soften the body

64
00:06:54,539 --> 00:07:01,580
maybe both are needed both to sit upright with a sense of integrity

65
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:15,860
and also also let the body relax often

66
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:33,599
relaxing softening the sit bones

67
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:38,840

68
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:46,860

70
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,939
forehead

71
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:06,240
the eyes around the eye socket the eyes resting in their socket let

72
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,120

tightness that you noticed also noticing what happens right before

92

233
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:03,900
waiting so what we did at the beginning of the meditation was to turn well we

234
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:12,780
started with embodiment with the breath and and feeling the body and then we turned to

235
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:19,260
um seeing our own goodness seeing our own goodness maybe through a kind act

236
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:26,640
maybe through not breaking a precept oh I was I almost lied today didn't through

of your intention your intentionality for example to see the goodness and then to let the goodness really let it grow

239
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:46,339
to breathe with it to to feel into that intention with intention for engaging

240
00:37:46,339 --> 00:37:53,339
engaging with uh with kindness with wisdom which relates to what I was saying at the beginning with how do we

241
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:59,760
engage how do we choose to engage not just on the cushion not just uh in daily

242
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:05,339
life but also especially in those interstitial times those spaces that we

243
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:12,740
fill how do we engage is it with love and wisdom Susan I see your hand please

246
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:32,040
spend time dwelling on our kindness and our goodness you know we don't usually

247
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:37,859
measure ourselves that way we measure it all sort of other ways

248
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:45,240
um and it was just so great to go Yes actually there is a lot of kindness and Love in

This Heart and it's just so great to take joy in that

250
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:57,480
instead of just thinking oh well you know I'm retired and I don't really you know and I'm kind of getting older and

00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:25,800
goodness the more it grows the more it grows it's it's just as the Buddha says

256
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:31,380
whatever you reflect and Ponder upon frequently becomes the inclination of

257

different if it doesn't work and

279
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:58,260
well I found myself saying when you were saying engagement I let the word go by

280
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:05,940
but it was like I'm not quite sure what that means engagement what does it mean and what I found myself saying was

281
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:12,240
may I be truthful and may I be kind and may I be wise

282

285
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:37,260
oh yeah this works for me may I be kind may I be truthful beautiful those values that are important to you to bring

286
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:42,780
attention to them to your intention uh to bring attention to your intentions a

287
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:49,140
way of engaging with it right because if you just like oh yeah I'm doing it you

288
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:54,420
know as as Susan was saying I'm getting old and like you know but there's a different

289
00:42:54,420 --> 00:43:00,599
way you can engage oh yeah may I be kind may I be truthful because these are these values are important to me so

290
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:09,060
that's what I meant by engagement so you were doing it great I love it Serena please

291
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:15,060
sir so how am I saying the name right yeah that's yeah that's fine yeah I I

292
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:20,579
wonder I was experiencing a lot of physical

293
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:28,200
um you know um unsettledness and squirmishness

294
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:33,960
and I was just wondering whether you had any um

295
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:39,119
advice on how to deal with that I mean I tried to be with it as

296
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:46,440
as best as I could and be as accepting as I could on on the situation but I was

297
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:53,099
just wondering if there is um yeah there's so many different ways to be with it and for tonight given this

298
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:59,280
particular theme that we're working with so what I would say is if there is discomfort if there's uh say square

299
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,619
missioness and unsettledness and like ah I would be kind with it I would just be

300
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:09,900
really in I would engage as I was saying in the guided meditation may I be kind

301
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:16,560
to myself with my thoughts with my body especially in difficult times so it's engaged with kindness so it's not just

302
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:21,900
being with it but it's being with it with kindness as if there's a puppy

303
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:29,640
that's agitated and it's just like oh and you're just oh here puppy hello sweetheart here you are you're just

304
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:35,940
really holding the puppy and calming the puppy with kindness that bad way of

305
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:42,180
Engagement that's what I would suggest a way of being with it thank you thank you

306
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:47,880

319
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:11,280
to turn your attention to your own goodness or or maybe your your own

320
