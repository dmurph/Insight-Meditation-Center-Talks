1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:07,800
so one of the tasks of as we develop meditation practice Buddhist

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:14,320
practice is to become our own teachers to be able and what that means

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:21,760
partly is to be able to find the path of practice as it opens up in front of

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,640
us a metaphor is that if you're going to cross uh maybe it's

5
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:35,200
a somewhat shallow River wide river and there's lots of rocks and boulders in it

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:42,200
that are Stepping Stones across the river that um the

7
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:49,440
um and the stepping stones are kind of spread little bit different distance from each other and different angles

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:56,039
some rocks are clearly not stable enough to step on so you would have to kind of find

9
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:03,359
your way across the river on these stepping stones and go this way way and that way and a little bit longer steps

10
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:10,479
sometimes and um make sure you stand in the middle of some steps some stones and uh and you have to find your

11
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:16,119
own path across uh by choosing the right stones to walk on and if you don't you

12
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:23,320
might end up in the river and um and maybe it's a shallow River it's easy enough to get back up

13
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:31,280
again so in the same way we're kind of finding their path and um falling into

14
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,799
the river is falling into our thoughts and preoccupations and attachments

15
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:44,399
reactivity falling into um great hate and delusion and

16
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,560
falling into preoccupations With Me Myself and

17
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:56,799
mine and uh and to find the PATH the find the Stepping Stones next moment

18
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:04,159
next moment is to find ourselves in the Simplicity of awareness the simp the

19
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:12,120
simplest kind of awareness of attention of knowing that you can find for

20
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:18,319
yourself and uh so simple that it might even be a nonverbal

21
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:24,959
awareness or so simple that if it's a simple verbal kind of knowing it's no

22
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,720
story connected no judgment connected to it no interpretation just

23
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:37,200
an INB breath out warmth

24
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,920
coldness calm agitation just really really

25
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:51,360
simple and um and you can one of some of the ways we find our way is that uh is

26
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,560
some of these criteria we're talking about this week one is you find your way

27
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,879
by not when aware where awareness has

28
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:13,120
no doesn't harm anything where awareness is there's no sting no stress

29
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:20,319
in being aware we find it where there's no stories and interpretations views

30
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:28,760
beliefs that are somehow clouding the simple awareness that we don't need to have any

31
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:37,040
beliefs to stay on the stepping stones of the simple awareness and we find it

32
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:43,519
where uh we're allowing something deep within to emerge

33
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:50,080
to unfold to heal to settle to calm um there's a sense of

34
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,200
allowing the all the things that we know they're

35
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,959
aware of trusting that as we know them in this simple awareness something

36
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:07,439
that's not us within us the Dharma the natural

37
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,720
processing uh has a chance to unfold we

38
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,799
know that uh we're on the path when that

39
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:24,680
awareness has a very simple [Music]

40
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:32,080
maybe um primordial simple kindness or

41
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,080
care for ourselves for what we're aware

42
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:44,639
of and here we find it finding our steps so rather than looking for a particular

43
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:52,160
experience we're looking for something to happen we find the stepping stones in

44
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,960
the Simplicity of awareness that avoids any sting any

45
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:04,199
stress any holding on that avoids any

46
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:09,400
belief as we're practicing beliefs might have gotten us

47
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,479
to our meditation but then we don't need them

48
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:20,639
anymore we find the Stepping Stones if the awareness is allowing making space

49
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:28,880
for what's here to let go unfold dissolve open up

50
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:35,720
or grow if it's something wholesome and the wholesomeness of a

51
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,960
Simple Kindness this is how we find the PATH

52
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,160
across the river of attachments and

53
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:53,000
clinging so with that uh again like yesterday we sit in

54
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,520
silence and if you're inclined to be your own teacher maybe some of these words will

55
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:06,918
uh will point you to the way thank

56
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560

for

92
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,919
and then as we come to the end of this

93
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:24,760
sitting maybe to point to the

94
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:32,840
possibility of not identifying with the thoughts we have the feelings

95
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:40,039
and emotions we have the impulse impulses we have the

96
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:45,120
experiences of pain

97
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:53,080
and suffering happiness and pleasure not to lean into anything or

98
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:59,600
not to take up residence in any of that

99
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:08,039
that but instead to know it to be aware of it in the most simple

100
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:18,120
way stepping out stepping back from the river of attachment River of

101
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,600
becoming River

102
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:29,960
of being caught in the river of

103
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:38,720
distractions attachments and stepping back onto the

104
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:45,600
stable secure dry Simplicity of just knowing

105
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:54,080
this just this where each thing is allowed to be

106
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:00,240
itself nothing is condemned nothing is made wrong

107
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:09,919
where there's a relief and a kind of sense of

108
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:18,158
well-being and not being in the cot in the river wet in

109
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,960
the flow of

110
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:33,399
distractions and this simplic it of knowing of awareness is how we find our

111
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:41,159
way and how we can be bring a very meaningful attention and

112
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:47,159
care to others to see others without the filter

113
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:54,600
of our attachments our opinions to see others without being

114
00:27:54,600 --> 00:28:04,679
caught in our sufferings and our hurts and our our angers and our desires and

115
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:10,720
envies so see them as they are warts and

116
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:17,960
all with a kind attention open

117
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:25,240
tension an attention that allows something

118
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:29,559
deep to unfold

119
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:38,159
May our ability to listen to others see others know others with

120
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,919
Simplicity support

121
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,759
others to become free of

122
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:54,080
suffering to experience some peace here and

123
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:01,640
now to feel safe safe in our

124
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:08,440
presence and to have the possibility of be being

125
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:17,080
happy may all beings be happy and may how we attend to others

126
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:32,420
support that possibility [Music]

127
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:42,199
thank you [Music]

128
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,480
so good morning everyone and

129
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:38,640
welcome and uh the announcement before I give the talk is

130
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:47,360
that I'll be away then uh three weeks of which are teaching uh retreat in the

131
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,679
wilderness and then a week of camping with my

132
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:59,600
wife and um I think the whole thing will be a bit of a vacation as well

133
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:06,919
and um some wonderful IMC teachers who will be teaching while I'm away and now

134
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:12,639
you'll be in good hands here at this YouTube

135
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:22,240
channel so um so this uh uh week I'm kind

136
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:28,000
of basing the teachings on the uh uh the

137
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,360
UD suta and I'll read it as I have every

138
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:39,720
morning it's not easy Anand to teach the dhma to

139
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:46,279
others the dhama should be taught to others when five qualities are

140
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:52,399
established within oneself which five the dhama should be taught to

141
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:58,880
others thinking I will speak step by step I will teach progress

142
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:05,559
aggressively that dhama should be taught to others thinking I will speak for practical

143
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:12,320
reasons I'll speak providing instructions in how to become free of

144
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:20,240
suffering the dama should be taught to others thinking I will speak grounded in

145
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:29,159
kindness that now much should be taught to others thinking I will I will not speak for material reward

146
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:35,279
the dhama should be taught to others thinking I will speak without wounding myself or

147
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:41,799
others so it's not easy to teach the dhama to others and I suppose that's

148
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:50,120
partly because these things are not easy to do and uh or it's easy to overlook the

149
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:55,159
Simplicity of these ideas for other purposes in

150
00:32:55,159 --> 00:33:01,960
teaching and um and as I been doing this week these uh wonderful qualities are

151
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:09,039
also very useful for those of us who are when we're not teaching but when we're just

152
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:14,600
speaking and uh I will speak step by step is the first one in the suta but

153
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:19,880
the last one for this week and I'm equating it or connecting these things

154
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:26,720
to what I've taught last week on and for for last week on Friday it was um the

155
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:32,840
possibility of liberation and the path to Liberation and so I will speak step by

156
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:39,000
step I will spech Pro progressively I will teach a path the progressive path

157
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:45,399
the gradual path that leads onward to greater and greater

158
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:51,279
freedom and uh the word for step by step um

159
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:56,559
Anup can also mean um kind of uh P can

160
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:03,799
mean uh footstep steps they can be the the uh traces of the steps that are Le

161
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:08,960
behind and so the U uh it could also be

162
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:14,079
uh kind of be used be the idea of tracking I will teach

163
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:19,280
tracking how to track how to find our way um

164
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:29,599
through the our life so we can be our own teachers and so um the uh there and so

165
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:36,440
particularly uh uh pointing out to how we can step by step gradually find our

166
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:45,280
way and um and it's easy to maybe teach the most profound Dharma uh of Buddhism

167
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:50,398
but and leave lots of people behind because they just simply can't understand it's just not relevant for

168
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:56,960
them and so to teach kind of something that's appropriate for each person um is

169
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:03,040
part of the art and so for people who are new to practice to offer beginning instructions

170
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:08,119
people who have particular forms of suffering maybe it needs to be addressed

171
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:15,240
directly and uh and then people are middling in practice they might need something different and then people who

172
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:20,680
are have uh quite experienced in practice maybe are ready for some deeper

173
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:26,520
pointing out that can happen and uh but still it's always uh

174
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:35,680
step by step and giving instructions giving pointing where to find the next step in practice is um is uh not only to

175
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:41,280
point it out to people but then to help people understand it for themselves to

176
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:49,359
give people their own kind of so they can become their own teachers so they don't rely on other teachers all the

177
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:55,000
time and um so this is how it works this is how it goes this is what you can do

178
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,800
this is what you pay attention to there's this is what's helping ful and

179
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:07,800
um and uh and one of the eventually what we learned through this practice is to

180
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:13,560
not be overly concerned with what we're

181
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:19,920
experiencing but rather how we know what we're experiencing and so there's a

182
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:26,200
almost like a paradigm shift from being identified or CAU up with or or or

183
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:34,480
managing managing ing the experience we have trying to change our experience have a better experience to letting the

184
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:40,599
experience be what it is kind of leave it alone but don't

185
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:46,599
leave it alone ignoring it leave it leave it alone in the clarity of the of

186
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:54,240
knowing of mindfulness really know it and uh and uh this is finding your own

187
00:36:54,240 --> 00:37:04,880
path so it's not like find looking for an experience so much as it is looking where that freedom is in knowing in the

188
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:10,119
awareness and um so in um you know when

189
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:18,040
we to switch over to the idea of speaking that this these teachings apply to speaking as well is that when we

190
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:24,839
speak uh don't leap from one thing to another don't leap to conclusions speak

191
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:32,119
in a way that allows people to understand and follow along what's being said uh

192
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:38,440
explain the foundation explain the conditions explain the reasons for why you do something or why you think

193
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:45,960
something uh explain the purpose um step by step provide people with this the

194
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:53,359
Stepping Stones of explanations of teachings so they can follow what you're saying understand what you're saying so

195
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:58,599
that we can find our way together with what's going on to make thear narative

196
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:04,040
statements uh where we just make a statement as as if it's true then um

197
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:12,359
maybe people can't follow along it's too big of a leap so um so to speak in a way that is

198
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:17,480
uh gradual that build builds a case Builds an understanding builds a

199
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:24,920
connection with others um and if if the having a warm deep connection to others

200
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:31,079
is part of the value of being connect being in relationship let that happen

201
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:36,280
step by step care for it and you know ask questions of others learn about them

202
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:43,200
pay attention explain yourself say something about yourself so people get to know you but so the gradual building

203
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:50,319
and building and so this is one of the Hallmarks or one of the characteristics of the Buddhist

204
00:38:50,319 --> 00:38:55,440
teachings is that um it's uh uh it

205
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,800
there's a developmental model of human life meaning things evolve and develop

206
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:06,319
over time and for the Buddha there isn't like like instant Enlightenment per se

207
00:39:06,319 --> 00:39:13,720
exactly there isn't this idea of a quick fix but uh just like a child you don't

208
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:21,599
snap the fingers and suddenly the child is an adult but there's a gradual growth and development of that child um day by

209
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:28,680
day you know meal by meal um experience by experience a child grows and so in

210
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:34,040
the same way um uh even as adults there's still this Evolution this

211
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:41,960
evolving this maturing that goes on and so uh one of the key metaphors

212
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:47,280
for um becoming uh you know uh growing

213
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:58,000
in the darai is the idea of growing it's the idea of maturing like a fruit matures a f a plant grows um so that uh

214
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,040
it's a step by step it's a gradual process it's a building putting together the stepping

215
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:10,720
stones and um and so uh to approach the Dharma approach

216
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:16,440
these teachings in that kind of way so if we're going to be our own teachers

217
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:24,640
then it's really important we understand ourselves well and understand what we need next

218
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:32,560
what helps us to open up what helps us to be more present what helps us to mature in some way and at different

219
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:39,359
stages of practice um there are different things that are needed uh sometimes what's needed is a lot of meta

220
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:45,040
and compassion sometimes what's needed is a friend or a companion to talk to and

221
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:50,280
explore and think about things sometimes what's needed is a therapist sometimes

222
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:56,800
what's needed is a is um to go out into the world and serve and do something for

223
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:02,960
the benefit of others um not for the sake of others but that's what we need

224
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:08,200
that's where our growing and our Evolution development is going to be so

225
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:14,560
this idea of Step by Step Progressive uh that idea of finding the tracks finding

226
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:21,079
the so we're tracking carefully not in the not just big leaps

227
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:27,800
But Here and Now where is the next step now and so to go through a day with that

228
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:33,040
kind of care to end our session here

229
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:38,160
together and then taking time and ask yourself given all this given what's

230
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:44,560
happened now how I am now what what is the next step in my own

231
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:51,760
inner maturation is it to go have breakfast but how do I have breakfast to

232
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:58,240
support this gradual growth of the Dharma in me the mindfulness of attention of

233
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:04,520
kindness is it to go to drive to work great but how does driving to work

234
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:10,800
support this gradual growth always asking where's the where's the Dharma

235
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:19,599
here where's the maturation here where's the path to Freedom here where's the path to to um to kindness where's the

236
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:25,200
path in whatever we're doing and um and if you simply ask that

237
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:32,920
question of yourself you'll start being your own teacher if you don't ask the question then it's all too easy to live

238
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:39,200
a a mind a life that is inattentive where we're caught up in what we're

239
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:47,079
doing that we don't really pay attention to how we're doing what we're doing the Dharma is found in that how

240
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:54,559
and if you want to be your own teacher then gradually step by step as you go through the day

241
00:42:54,559 --> 00:43:02,680
um um find the path find how you can grow in these qualities that we've been

242
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:08,640
talking about so thank you very very much and uh

243
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:15,960

244
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:23,000
