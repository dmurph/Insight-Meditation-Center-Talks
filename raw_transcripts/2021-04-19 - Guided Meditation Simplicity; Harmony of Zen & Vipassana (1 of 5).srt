1
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:33,040
so i'll wait another minute or so before the formal beginning of our time together

2
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:39,520
and i appreciate very much all the chats and

3
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:46,800
the good mornings and it's a very friendly and warm

4
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,000
way to begin our time together on meditation together

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,480
um and thank you for all for being here

6
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:16,799
so to begin i offer my warm greetings to all of you

7
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,520
and especially warm to the people who are new here on uh 7 a.m or this morning sitting who

8
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,400
are participating in the zen center's uh intensive on the harmony of zen

9
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:38,640
and vipassana and just a couple of words for those of you who might be here from there is that

10
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:46,320
the um the way this format works is i usually begin with a few minutes of introductory

11
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,640
comments that are setting the context for the meditation of the morning and then there's some guided meditation

12
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:59,040
that follows that and and then end with a what i call a

13
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:06,240
dedication of merit a variation of that and then a little at 7 30 what we call a dharmet

14
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,360
15 minute talk uh if you have problems with the youtube

15
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,720
that it's frozen or if uh i don't appear on the screen at the beginning at all

16
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:23,360
even though the chats are beginning to roll through the um no if the chats don't roll

17
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,520
through and if nothing's happening and problems like that are usually resolved by refreshing

18
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:36,879
and if you're not sure how to refresh just close the window and open it again in the way you got to it and the most

19
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:42,319
prominent most common problem with not hearing the sound is that there's actually some issue with

20
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:48,400
your computer and and so just check all the settings on your computer including the speaker

21
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:56,080
setting and see and and then like if there's no sound and

22
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,680
you look at the chat and there's lots of people who are saying no sound then the problem's here on my end and

23
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,720
hopefully i'll notice soon enough that there's a problem and that i'm talking just to myself

24
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:18,640
usually i don't push a button so the harmony of zen and vipassanam

25
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:26,080
in my mind and in my heart i begin

26
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:33,040
this idea of the harmony or the commonality even of these two wonderful buddhist

27
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:40,400
meditation traditions with a teaching from

28
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:48,000
one of our teachers our first generation of teachers here in the west study with a man named munindra

29
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,400
ji and indian who studied in burma and became a great vipassana

30
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:04,560
teacher and he had this wonderful teaching that if it is not simple it's not vipassana

31
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:11,200
and that in simplicity maybe is where commonality

32
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,959
harmony can be found that there's something powerful and profound about

33
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,959
simplicity a simple simplicity of being

34
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:31,120
a willingness and allowing valuing of just being alive my zen teacher mel

35
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:37,520
weitzman made this powerful statement to me once we were driving across the

36
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:44,560
bridge here in san francisco the bay bridge and i was driving him and he was asking about my life and i was

37
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,759
telling him about different things that were new for me and at some point listening to me he

38
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:57,120
said just calmly relaxedly it seemed like just the right time he said just to be alive is enough

39
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,400
and that was a powerful moment for me just to be alive is enough

40
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:10,080
just to be simple and breathing and hear and so we make it complicated and uh

41
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:18,720
understanding how we make things unnecessarily complicated can help us return to a very powerful

42
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,400
significant way of being which is to allow this life force allow this

43
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:32,160
breathing being to manifest to express itself in this

44
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,960
fullest possible way that it can be that sometimes is called liberated

45
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,240
but to keep it simple and one of the ways that we make it complicated

46
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,360
is by getting preoccupied or caught up in our thinking

47
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:56,080
and so one of the ways to return to simplicity return from the fixation the caught upness

48
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,440
in thinking is to rely on breathing

49
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,960
the rhythm of breathing the way the inhale appears and disappears the exhale

50
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,080
appears and disappears the rhythm of that if we stay close to it

51
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:18,400
the fluidity the change the cycles of that breathing is an alternative to getting the mind

52
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:24,720
caught in thoughts we come back to the breathing we stay with that rhythm that massage of

53
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,880
breathing and it helps us to notice when we wander off in thought and

54
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:38,160
have lost in preoccupation and fantasy it helps us to know there's an alternative and we come back to the

55
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,199
embodied physical simplicity of just being a human being that's breathing

56
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,280
and in the process of doing so our minds might protest have other ideas

57
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:56,319
and say that other things are more important and maybe so but maybe those can wait

58
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:03,440
for later maybe first to keep returning to the breathing being with the breathing

59
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,680
letting the thinking mind quiet down release itself thaw open

60
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:16,240
up and discover some deeper intimacy with this live life as

61
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,440
it's being lived so breathing the simplicity of just being staying

62
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:29,039
resting with the breathing is one way to discover the simplicity of being

63
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:39,520
no matter what your posture maybe there's some way you can gently um gently kind of

64
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:46,840
put your body a little bit more alert like if so there's a phys embodied

65
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,840
attentiveness

66
00:07:53,440 --> 00:08:01,360
and then gently closing your eyes and to begin this

67
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,520
connection to breathing it can be helpful to take a few long

68
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,960
slow deep breaths

69
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:20,879
and the fuller breaths is it like a ritual reminder of here this is the meditation

70
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:28,639
hall the inner meditation hall the body body's experience of breathing

71
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:41,279
and with a deeper breaths long exhale

72
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:49,839
the long exhale if you can then relax

73
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:55,839
on the exhale

74
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:09,839
relax your body

75
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:23,839
and then letting your breathing return to normal

76
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,680
and then with a normal breath continue this process of

77
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,839
letting go

78
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:51,839
relaxing relaxing your body

79
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:18,240
breathing in and breathing out as you exhale relaxing and softening

80
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,800
your belly

81
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:37,519
as you exhale relaxing your shoulders

82
00:10:45,600 --> 00:11:01,839
as you exhale softening the muscles of your face

83
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,839
and then when we're

84
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:57,839
attuning ourselves to the experience of breathing you might think of it as

85
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:05,600
becoming aware of the way of the body's experience of breathing

86
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:13,600
so it's not so much being in the control tower looking and focusing on the breathing

87
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:22,839
it is it is being inside feeling sensing how the body experiences

88
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,839
breathing

89
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,600
in feeling the rhythm of the body breathing

90
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,600
breathing in and breathing out

91
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:24,639
and feeling that rhythm where it's most pronounced sometimes in the belly sometimes in the

92
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:30,720
chest or perhaps in the nostrils of the air goes in and out

93
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,839
wherever it's easiest nicest

94
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,839
allowing the attention to rest there

95
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:03,839
and if you notice your mind wanders off in thought

96
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,839
as simply and non-conflictually as you

97
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,839
can begin again with your breathing

98
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:31,839
always ready to begin again

99
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:45,839
allowing yourself the simplicity

100
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:52,720
of riding the body's experience of

101
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,839
breathing

102
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,839
um

103
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:32,640
attention can be seen to be a food that wherever attention goes it's

104
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,320
feeding something if you allow your attention to go into thinking

105
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:46,720
and distracted thoughts we feed the thinking mind

106
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:51,279
but if we bring our attention and

107
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:57,360
bring it into awareness of breathing

108
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:05,039
not just focusing on the breath but attention is in the awareness of

109
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:11,360
breathing in the body's experience of breathing

110
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:19,440
then we're feeding awareness we're feeding our ability

111
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:31,840
to be present

112
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,840
so

113
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:50,159
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

114
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:07,360
we can dedicate the merit of our practice together for the welfare of others

115
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:16,799
and the way one way to do this is to do it consciously and explicitly

116
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:22,640
to think of merit as the ways that we have benefited

117
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:29,120
from this meditation today and to spend a few moments at the end of

118
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:35,360
his sitting considering what those benefits might be

119
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,720
maybe we're calmer or less agitated

120
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:48,720
maybe we know ourselves better we know something about our agitation or

121
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,919
even our craziness

122
00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:00,399
and it's good to know it we can be wiser than him

123
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:06,080
or maybe we're more accepting

124
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:13,840
less angry or less afraid

125
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,398
more peaceful

126
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:27,840
more in touch with ourselves

127
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:36,559
more forgiving so the list could be quite long

128
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:44,000
it doesn't have to be a dramatic benefit but to consider the benefits

129
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:49,840
what you can know and recognize maybe there's many you don't know

130
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:57,279
and then to consider how those benefits how you can bring those

131
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:01,360
benefits into the world today

132
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:11,279
how can you extend those benefits or express them for the welfare and

133
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,399
happiness of others

134
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:25,919
if we live with a wall of separation between ourselves and others

135
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:33,760
then we're also separated from ourselves but as the wall comes down

136
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,320
we actually know ourselves more fully

137
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:46,159
and this dedication of merit is part of this crumbling of the walls

138
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:51,840
and allowing our good will

139
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,480
to begin spreading out into the world

140
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:08,240
and not let not just letting this be a wishful thinking

141
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:16,158
but to imagine how the benefits of this meditation

142
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:22,559
might support someone in your conversations

143
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:33,840
today and communications today and your way of being with someone

144
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:42,960
and may it be that the benefits of this meditation

145
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:52,159
somehow or other can be expressed in these well wishing

146
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,840
may all beings be happy

147
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:04,240
may all beings be safe

148
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,398
may all beings be peaceful

149
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:29,840
and may all beings everywhere be free

150
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,699
[Music]

151
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:10,560

152
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:21,839

153
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:35,839

156
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:57,679
periodically i forget to push the buttons and so that's what happened

157
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:03,839

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:36,480
paul haller former abbot of san francisco zen center in the city

163
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:43,520
will give the talks and and so you know i've been involved in

164
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,960
both these wonderful traditions and traditions i have tremendous respect for and i

165
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:55,599
celebrate their great value and and um and i feel very fortunate to have

166
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:00,640
done both i think they in myself have mutually supported each other

167
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:08,240
in all kinds of ways and um and uh so to have a chance to talk about

168
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:15,520
the meeting of these two or the harmony of these two is a wonderful exercise for me

169
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:24,400
the sometimes i think of zen and vipassana as being

170
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:31,520
the kind of like uh with their meeting is kind of like a two like a venn diagram like two circles

171
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:38,640
that overlap some places and um in some teachings some teachers might

172
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,760
both be positioned in their mutual circle in the place where the two circles

173
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:49,760
overlap and so they seem very similar and very similar teachings and and some might be

174
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:57,119
sitting on opposite you know sides of the circle so that they don't overlap or share much and how big that then

175
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:03,839
those then circles are you know i don't you know how much bit big that overlap is i don't know

176
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:09,200
maybe it depends on who's defining it but there's certainly overlap

177
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:16,880
and but where there's not overlap there's uh there can be harmony there can be complementarity there can be ways in

178
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:23,920
which uh understanding one helps to understand the other there's a wonderful for me a wonderful

179
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:29,119
saying that i learned when i was in england that said that if you don't leave

180
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:36,000
england you don't really know england and i think if you if you lived that grew up there i

181
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:43,359
suppose if you leave and they come back you see it in different ways so sometimes having being outside of

182
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:49,599
particular religious tradition for a while that we've been immersed in helps us to see with clear eyes something

183
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:54,720
we've been missing before and one of those things can be to understand even better the value of the

184
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:02,560
tradition and so one of the

185
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:10,720
kind of wonderful maybe coincidences of language

186
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:16,079
is that the word zen comes from the chinese word chan which

187
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:22,480
comes from the sanskrit word gianna and it's just a different language

188
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:28,000
pronouncing the same word and in in pali jaanai is jhana

189
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:37,040
which is states of concentration the practice of concentration vipassana

190
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:43,200
comes from the ancient pali word for insight and this also especially here in the

191
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:50,720
modern west but little bit in india and in modern times the word vipassana no longer simply

192
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:56,480
meant the insights that come from practicing mindfulness but became the

193
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:02,320
name for a technique of meditation practice the mindfulness technique in a

194
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:11,839
sense and then became a word that began to encompass uh kind of the i don't know the full

195
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:18,640
teachings and culture and religion of people practicing vipassana and so we have this

196
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,680
very odd thing or new thing that happened here especially in the united states i think

197
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:30,480
starting i don't know how many decades ago but maybe three decades ago or so that

198
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:36,880
that we started seeing in the west um this expression the vipassana

199
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:44,240
tradition and then there were sometimes meetings or references to the three traditions

200
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:50,480
zen tibetan and vipassana um and as if these were and so a little

201
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:56,800
surprised to see vipassana was now a tradition when it's a relatively new

202
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:03,920
word to refer to a school of meditation but

203
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:11,359
uh the wonderfulness of it is that you know on one hand we have in the in the ancient world the pasta

204
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:17,280
the insights of meditation were supported by

205
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,480
jhana supported by deep concentration and in teachings of the buddha the

206
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:30,000
ancient teachings these two came in harmony they worked together they were partners and and then over

207
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:38,800
time as as buddhism developed in india china japan sri lanka burma thailand

208
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:46,400
kind of in different ways meditation remained a constant in

209
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:53,119
some way one way the others different countries where they practice buddhism and there were people in lineages and

210
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:59,470
schools that really emphasized meditation and and zen and vipassana are

211
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:04,720
[Music] are two of them and once you talk about

212
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:12,880
sitting in meditation practicing in meditation there's a lot of overlap to what human beings experience in meditation

213
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:19,280
most people when they sit down to meditate discover very quickly how out of control their mind is how

214
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:25,839
much they're thinking and all that and how many obstacles there are to being really present and so learning and developing capacity

215
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:31,119
to be present is very much the same no matter what meditation one's doing

216
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:37,280
we're developing our capacity not to be distracted not to be lost from our present moment

217
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,800
experience and and

218
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:48,319
as we do that then we become more settled more calm which is more the

219
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:54,240
concentration factor but as we become more subtle and more calm we start seeing more clearly what

220
00:41:54,240 --> 00:42:00,000
our experience is which is the insight the vipassana side of it

221
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,160
and and these go back and forth as we become calmer maybe we see better as we see better we can become calmer

222
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:11,280
more settled or more present whatever the language we have

223
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:18,480
so uh coincidentally then these two big traditions so called vipassana

224
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:24,000
are named after these two ancient aspects of meditation that the ancient

225
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,599
world were harmonious were connected to each other quite closely

226
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:36,319
and um so the general way uh in the there's two ways of practicing

227
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:41,760
vipassana uh one is directed attention

228
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:48,480
and the other is undirected attention and and

229
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:55,680
be interesting to hear from the zen teachers if the same distinction can be made in in zen when i first started

230
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:01,760
practicing zen meditation i was told to direct my attention on the breathing

231
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:08,720
and to count the breaths and i did that for years and it was a wonderful practice for me

232
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:15,440
and the and when i went to burma uh they seemingly did the same thing and

233
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,480
they went to told me to now focus and then they often had an emphasis on feeling the movements

234
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:27,920
of the belly as you as the breathing happened the hara and in burma they put the attention

235
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:34,240
the same place uh where the hara area and to feel the movements there so this

236
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:39,440
was very familiar to me it's the same directed attention as i did in zen

237
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:45,839
and but what happens with vipassana practice is that the practice begins to be directed and

238
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:50,960
then as it goes along it becomes more undirected and so we'll

239
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:56,960
see that in the course of this five days that i'm be teaching here that the way that we've

240
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:02,319
come to teach vipassana many of us inside practice mindfulness in the west

241
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:08,000
we start with directed practice and then we begin to opening up the attention to include more

242
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,000
and more in the awareness so we begin with the breathing and the breathing is a wonderful place

243
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,440
to calm down to relax to step out of the thinking mind to see

244
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,960
how much we're caught in thought and then come back to come back come back

245
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:32,319
and then and then we'll go to body to emotions to thinking and then friday

246
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:37,680
i'll give you a little taste a real pointer to the undirected

247
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:45,839
attention of vipassana which maybe is similar to what nzen they call just sitting or shikhan taza

248
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:52,480
and and in vipassana there's often kind of a sequential or a step-by-step kind of

249
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:59,440
approach to settling in and arriving to this undirected attention

250
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:05,680
and so we begin with mindfulness of breathing and i'd like to do a little teaching

251
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:10,800
around this briefly and that is if we're practicing

252
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:16,480
attention to breathing a mindfulness of breathing and meditation

253
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:24,800
um it works when it doesn't work in this way that it works

254
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:30,960
if we're able to stay our attention stays stable and connected and continuous with the rhythm

255
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:37,440
and flow of breathing in and breathing out and as we do that sometimes because the attention is long going into thinking

256
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:44,160
that thinking mind gets quieter and stiller and and then things open up in a nice way

257
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:50,000
but plenty of times our ability to stay with the breathing doesn't work

258
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:56,480
and um and then it's like this when many years ago i was up in the mountains here in the santa cruz mountains

259
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:01,839
sitting in the edge of a creek and it seemed like the creek the water was not flowing at all it was

260
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:07,119
completely still and so then i took a stick from the shore

261
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:14,480
and put it into the into the river into the creek vertically and then i could see there

262
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:20,560
was little wake formed on the surface of the water where the stick went into the water

263
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:27,359
and then i could see that the water wasn't still it was there was a current that was flowing

264
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:33,760
so the same way mindfulness of breathing is like the stick we put into the current of our lives

265
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:39,760
and we get to see more clearly how strong that current is especially look at the current of thinking or the

266
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:46,000
currents of feelings that we might have and and so it isn't necessarily we're supposed to stay with the breath

267
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,359
and criticize ourselves we can't but they just keep showing up for their

268
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:57,760
breath then highlights what it is that is really flowing and moving oh look at

269
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:04,160
that my mind is really busy he was busier and more actively involved in thinking than i realized or i'm more

270
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:10,400
interested in food than i ever could have imagined that's all i think about and that's the

271
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:16,720
beginning of mindfulness to see clearly what's going on and the more clearly we can see the more

272
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:22,079
choice we have about where do we really want our attention to be

273
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:28,960
do we want our attention to be hijacked by our neurosis by our preoccupations

274
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:36,160
or do we want our attention to be something that really enlivens us embodies us really kind of

275
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:44,559
brings out a freedom of life that i would like to think of as

276
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:52,480
simplicity the simplicity of just being alive and letting life the lived life flow

277
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:59,119
through us so um so thank you

278
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:05,040
and um and i look forward to having this chance with you tomorrow

279
