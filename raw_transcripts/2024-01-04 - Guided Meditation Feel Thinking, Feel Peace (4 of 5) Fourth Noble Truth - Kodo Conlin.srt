good days Sunshine

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,720
rain it's a pleasure to practice

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:34,000
together today we arrive at the fourth Noble Truth and we'll we'll open up open

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,800
up the fourth Noble Truth by talking about um a number of the

7
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:49,079
factors uh of the eight-fold path talk about it from one perspective today and then um look at the final

8
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,760
three factors from the perspective of meditation

9
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:01,920
tomorrow let's begin with the sitting

10
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,200
and the The Arc of the meditation

11
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:24,479
today begin in a usual way with some

12
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:33,360
settling and then we will look closely at uh the quality or nature

13
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:41,320
of any distracting thoughts that come up identifying their quality and then

14
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:46,680
and then looking at the way looking at the how different kinds of thoughts

15
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,920
influence the body how they show up as

16
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,240
sensation let's begin by

17
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,840
settling

18
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:05,720
sh returning to

19
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:14,239
Stillness returning to our sensed relationship with the

20
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,920
Earth supporting the

21
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,680
body

22
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:44,879
the air around us becoming

23
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,680
breath

24
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,600
for

25
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,280
if it's available to

26
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:41,960
you giving some extra attention to abide in the

27
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:49,600
body in those places in the body it feels particularly

28
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:57,120
still bringing the attention there sensing

29
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,479
Stillness settling in Stillness

30
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
yes

31
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,829
[Music]

32
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
e

33
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:06,680
for for the next part of this

34
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:24,000
meditation a bit like watching Pebbles falling into a

35
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:30,959
lake Rippling the surface

36
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:40,079
you can

37
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:50,760
try ping close attention to the influence of

38
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
thinking

39
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,240
with this Baseline of settledness in the

40
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:17,760
body when a thought arises we allow it to [Music]

41
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:26,279
arise no need to pick it up and run with

42
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:34,240
it but try to recognize what's

43
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:42,920
the quality of this thought is it a thought with a tinge

44
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:50,480
of boredom in it or

45
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:57,040
desire is it a thought with a just a touch of ill will or

46
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
aversion

47
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,120
in one word what's the quality of the

48
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:25,160
thought and then feeling its influence in the

49
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,680
body what's the signature of Sensations that

50
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:48,240
arises as a thought of ill will [Music] arise with a physical

51
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,240
contraction or

52
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
heat

53
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,839
tightening so what's the nature of the

54
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,680
thought is it a thought of kindness or [Music]

55
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
generosity

56
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,519
and then what's its

57
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
influence

58
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,719
[Music]

59
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,319
if there are times when no thought is

60
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,360
arising and no influence to

61
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,959
observe staying here with the body with

62
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,600
Stillness with peace

63
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,309
[Music]

64
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:57,400
[Music]

65
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
I

66
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
yeah

67
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,799
[Music]

68
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:32,839
for [Music]

69
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:53,809
[Music]

70
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:39,530
[Music]

71
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,390
[Music]

72
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,879
and for the last third or so of this

73
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:42,929
meditation beginning in [Music]

74
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:49,720
Stillness and observing the influence of

75
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:59,880
thinking now is there some way

76
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:08,799
that the thoughts whatever they may

77
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:16,039
be can be allowed to arise and

78
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:22,099
accompany a peace and [Music]

79
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:29,799
Stillness can that peace and Stillness

80
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,159
embodied be in the foreground of

81
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:49,420
awareness and thoughts can just come and [Music]

82
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
go

83
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,150
[Music]

84
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,679
for

85
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:30,190
[Music]

86
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:59,519
e

87
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:55,120
feeling peace and feeling the influence of

88
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,399
thinking

89
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,518
may all beings relate

90
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:13,259
wisely the thoughts and [Music]

91
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:22,480
impulses may all beings know in embodied peace and true

92
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,320
freedom

93
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,969
[Music]

94
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:59,320
thank you

95
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:48,480
so before we begin curious how that meditation was for you how that series of exercises was

96
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:54,080
for you uh you feel inspired to write

97
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:59,240
anything in the chat about that I'm happy to know

98
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:09,240
now let's turn turn directly to the fourth Noble Truth the fourth Noble Truth is itself

99
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:15,559
this ancient path it said that the Buddha rediscovered is middle

100
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:21,440
way between uh the Notions of existence and

101
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:29,600
nonexistence and between um a sort of sensual Indulgence and self

102
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,960
mortification I love this phrase not falling into either of these

103
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:43,720
extremes the Buddha teaches the Dharma by the middle the middle

104
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:49,480
way so this week we we've talked about the the first Noble Truth and its task

105
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:55,000
or practice of understanding we've talked about the second Noble

106
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:01,760
Truth um as the arising or origin of

107
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:09,679
suffering and the task of abandoning and then the third Noble Truth the good news the cessation of

108
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:15,440
suffering cessation of Dua and the task of

109
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:21,799
realizing um with some discussion about ways to stay encouraged along this

110
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:28,440
path and now we turn to the remedy fourth Noble Truth

111
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:34,919
fourth Noble Truth as it said is just this Noble eight-fold Path it's the path

112
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:42,760
of practice that leads to the cessation of suffering today we will look at um maybe

113
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:48,399
five of the factors in brief five of the eight factors of the Noble eight-fold Path and then tomorrow we'll look at the

114
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:56,080
final three from the perspective of meditation just to name them uh the

115
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:02,960
factors of the eight-fold path uh right or wise or complete

116
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:12,320
view wise intention wise speech wise action wise

117
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:19,278
livelihood wise effort wise mindfulness wise

118
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:27,679
concentration it covers a lot of ground does it not so one way to organize

119
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:35,559
or think about these uh is inspired by um a paraphrase of AA done by bod um

120
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:43,600
from the connected discourses of the Buddha and biku Bodi paraphrases it this

121
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,799
way one one time when a monk approached the Buddha and asked for the training in

122
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:56,039
brief basically a mon a monk uh approaches the Buddha and asks uh how do I do the practice in brief the Buddha

123
00:33:56,039 --> 00:34:01,840
told him first establish yourself in the starting

124
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:07,119
point of wholesome states that

125
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:13,839
is in purified moral discipline and in Right

126
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:19,878
View then when your moral discipline is purified and your view is straight you

127
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:24,039
should practice the four foundations of

128
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:32,440
mindfulness this is an important pointing putting Right View and uh what babot is translating as moral discipline

129
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:39,679
laali is probably CA um Reflections on wise action wise

130
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:47,158
speech white livelihood having these as the basis because we may know the way that uh a

131
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:54,919
mind a mind that settled in itself through non- regret um contributes to a sense of

132
00:34:54,919 --> 00:35:01,440
Stillness and for liberating insight to arise for us to be freed of this uh

133
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:11,040
first Noble Truth of suffering um some great measure of Stillness very deep very deep is

134
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:18,680
necessary so let's talk a few minutes about right view with a little bit of a

135
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:24,040
smile I offer I offer this uh quote that I think I picked up from guy Armstrong's

136
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:32,000
book emptiness and I believe he's quoting Yogi Bara and if you don't know where you're going you might end up somewhere

137
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:39,440
else so maybe we could say this is the function of Right View wise view bbod

138
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,720
puts it another way he says to attempt to engage on the practice without a

139
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:52,440
foundation of Right View is to risk getting lost in the futility of undirected

140
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:58,560
movement maybe we know some of the ways of practices but we don't know how to orient it

141
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:05,880
it I'd need to do a little bit more research of the word but I I think that the poly word Sama that's uh the right

142
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:12,400
wise or complete and right right view right intention Etc I believe it has a a

143
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:20,000
a connotation of orientation I'll have to double check on that but I I like to think that each of these factors is part

144
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,520
of the noble Eightfold Path because it points Us in the direction of Liberation it's rightly directed we know

145
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,720
where going and we move in that

146
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:38,440
direction so it's said that just as the dawn is

147
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:43,960
the Forerunner of the Rising Sun So Right View precedes all of the other

148
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:50,760
wholesome factors and we know that right view as with the rest of the Buddha Dharma it's

149
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:57,760
not um it's not merely theoretical a Right View has an influence on our on

150
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:03,359
our actions on our values the way we think the way we

151
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:08,839
speak so um how do we understand Right

152
00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:17,200
View few a few points one is that uh in summary Right View is an understanding

153
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:25,440
that our actions have effects and that those those actions can

154
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:31,200
have beneficial effects or they can have harmful consequences and then this final

155
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:37,240
important point that we have a say in choosing an action that is

156
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:44,920
beneficial as best as we can see or choosing an action that's harmful so our actions have effects

157
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:51,800
harmful or beneficial and that we have a say the

158
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:57,200
um the there's a I had I had a memory actually while I was thinking about

159
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:04,079
when I was living at tasahara we're we're 14 miles away from anything

160
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:10,560
in the wilderness and um sometimes it was you know maybe 40

161
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:18,440
monks there for 3 months at a time and it was very easy to see in that

162
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:24,160
cloistered setting very easy to see how an action has a consequence in the

163
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:29,200
community in some ways you you could um you could see you could see your words

164
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:35,319
and deeds Ripple around and have an effect it was so palpable the influence

165
00:38:35,319 --> 00:38:42,240
of our actions on others and on ourselves felt a little bit like being a goldfish goldfish in one of those little

166
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:47,599
goldfish aquariums you can see all the little movements of the fins and the the

167
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:53,880
way that the mouth opens and closes it was so plain to see uh for

168
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:59,800
example um one let's say two seconds of unskillful

169
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:05,200
speech in such a small community that's that's close together like that you

170
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:16,480
could see the effect just Ripple through beings and then it it could it could take just hours of care to um

171
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:22,240
address so this is cause and effect our actions have consequences and we have a

172
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:27,480
say and whether we choose beneficial or harmful consequences

173
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:32,720
on another level elsewhere the Buddha defines Right View as uh an

174
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:39,160
understanding of suffering an understanding of the arising or origin of suffering an understanding of the

175
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:46,040
cessation of suffering and an understanding of the way leading to the sensation of suffering sound

176
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:51,200
familiar do you hear the four noble truths just our our study this week our

177
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:58,560
study of the fornal truths is part of this training in Right View wise View and both of the these modes uh thinking

178
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:06,559
about um actions and consequences and studying the four noble truths both of these contribute to the path of

179
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:14,160
Liberation so the basis in the Su that biku pointed Bodi pointed out wise View

180
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:21,880
and then there's conduct so let's talk let's talk in brief about four of these factors of the Noble eight-fold Path

181
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:29,599
that I'm grouping Under The Heading conduct so wise action wise

182
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:36,280
livelihood right speech right intention here we can apply a principle

183
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:42,760
we talked about uh with the first Noble Truth that is um closely

184
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:50,160
observing our actions and their effects and then making room for new possibilities in our conduct for the

185
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:57,319
purposes of developing the path of practice you can think about think about

186
00:40:57,319 --> 00:41:06,160
um viewing uh wise conduct under all four of these factors as um um observing

187
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:12,040
and practicing from gross the gross level the easy to observe level to a very subtle

188
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:18,800
level on the level of the body we can look at WISE action and wise livelihood this is maybe the easiest to

189
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:24,319
observe um if you do a physical action you can see it you can see it on my

190
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:30,240
camera now whereas a an attention for example is not so not so visible take

191
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:36,680
some greater Stillness the way the training is done in refining our conduct for the purposes

192
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:45,400
of Liberation is twofold there there's this first aspect of refraining from refraining from what

193
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:51,119
is harmful in a sense it's a training and restraint it it certainly sounds like

194
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:58,480
restraint and then uh the other aspect is this this

195
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:04,720
creative open possibility something some sort of new conduct happening uh there's

196
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:09,720
the refraining from aspect and then there's bringing forward the

197
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:17,000
beautiful so we can look a little bit more closely at this if we if we zoom in on uh right

198
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,960
action three of the things that are uh advised to refrain from in practicing with right

199
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:31,000
action one is intentionally harming living beings two is taking what's not given

200
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:37,119
and the third is those those uh ways of engaging in our sexuality that do

201
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:44,599
harm these are the things we we hold we we restrain or we um we uh certainly

202
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:50,359
observe um and then there are positive Associated behaviors and virtues so

203
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:58,240
instead of harming living beings or taking what's not given or harming through sexuality we cultivate actions

204
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:05,558
and virtues based in kindness and compassion honesty and contentment and

205
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:14,240
generosity and then very briefly just something about right

206
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:20,920
speech uh Gil has this uh great saying if you want to learn

207
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:26,800
about about yourself study what it why it is you say what you say

208
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:32,160
can study where your intention and your speech come together and the training as we're

209
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:37,319
talking about it is to refrain from that speech that's harmful that's say

210
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:44,319
dishonest that's harsh that's um divisive that's frivolous or maybe just

211
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:49,480
untimely and then open the possibilities for yourself of speech that's kind

212
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:54,559
speech that's needed or necessary useful honest

213
00:43:55,079 --> 00:44:01,079
Timely can be useful to um en Envision those those two sorts of

214
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:07,400
speech and and sense into our sense for ourselves which ones are conducive to

215
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:13,640
Harmony which ones are conducive to offering our attention in a beautiful

216
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:21,440
way and in right intention underlies all of these right action right

217
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:26,839
speech why is our intentions are so important in the Buddha Dharma because they

218
00:44:26,839 --> 00:44:32,079
influence uh sort of the we'll say maybe the moral weight of an

219
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:38,920
action we observe the effects of our actions and we observe the intentions of our actions

220
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:47,480
both so to close I'll just um offer bobot's paraphrase again that first we

221
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:53,319
establish in starting uh the starting point of wholesome States purified moral

222
00:44:53,319 --> 00:44:58,480
discipline and in Right View and and then when those are established practice

223
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:04,240
the four foundations of mindfulness so we'll turn to the Noble eight-fold Path the last three factors

224
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:13,400
in relationship to the four foundations of mindfulness tomorrow please take care everyone may all beings may all beings

225
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:21,040
be free from suffering and have the causes of Happiness take

226
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,400
care
