1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:08,540
so welcome welcome everybody nice to see you all

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:19,500
so tonight I'd like to continue a little bit on a theme that I've been kind of like exploring these past few weeks

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:26,340
and maybe build on it a little bit or give a different emphasis

4
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:34,200
I know not everybody's been here the preceding weeks and that's perfectly fine you don't need to have been here

5
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,320
but maybe I'll just say some of the other themes that I've been talking about

6
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,739
so last week I talked about how clinging to views

7
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:54,000
underlies conflict like we have this idea we have this belief about something

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,660
and as soon as we hold on to a really tightly we set up uh me versus you US

9
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,360
versus them type of thing and to be clear I'm not saying that we

10
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:13,320
shouldn't have views what I am saying is that we should hold our views lightly

11
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,040
that they this would make sense to us at this time this is our current

12
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:26,280
understanding this is what makes sense to us this is the consistent with our

13
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,500
experience all that kind of stuff but it doesn't mean that we're like holding on

14
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,600
and saying that everybody else is wrong and I'm right of course that leads to

15
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,840
conflict and in fact if we find ourselves in Conflict we can just have this inquiry

16
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,939
what are we holding on to what view are we really holding on to that's

17
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:53,759
underlying this conflict and it might be something like I have this view that

18
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,399
everybody should be treated the same or you know it might be something like this which

19
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:05,219
for many of us it just feels like uh an obvious uh view that there should be

20
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:12,000
some equality but is there a way in which we can hold it

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,379
and say well maybe I keep on going like this with my hands because it feels like this is the way to hold them

22
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:25,440
can we hold those views and say well maybe the other person has

23
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,480
seen something that I'm not seeing or maybe I know something that they don't

24
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,200
know or something like this right so giving them the benefit of the doubt

25
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,620
week before that I talked about um sometimes we cling to views

26
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:49,500
hold on to them tightly as a way to avoid

27
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:55,440
being with what's actually happening I was a way to avoid of being with

28
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,440
difficult emotions or some inner turmoil or maybe we're not even sure what it is

29
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:09,200
we're avoiding we just know whatever it is I don't want to look at it and it's most likely not even a clear

30
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,459
sentence like that instead there's just okay I'm gonna holding on and getting

31
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:22,739
fundamental or dogmatic about some views allows me to not look at other things

32
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:28,860
instead if I have this idea that this particular view is the most important or

33
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:34,379
it's always necessary then I'm up to or I give

34
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:41,720
myself a a a pass to not have to look at what's happening inside

35
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:50,280
and then about a month ago I talked about the importance of making the distinction between views and direct

36
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,340
experience sometimes they get tangled up by the views or sorry a direct

37
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:04,620
experience is something that comes in through our senses seeing hearing touching tasting smelling

38
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:10,860
and of course thoughts is one of the senses in the Buddhist teachings

39
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:17,340
and we could say views our thoughts that are partially hidden or completely

40
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:22,560
hidden and so if that's part of what views are

41
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:29,460
well then how do we even know what our views are if they're hidden and I talked a little bit about how we

42
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:35,520
could do some settling practice allowing the mind to settle down and then these things become just a

43
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,400
little bit more visible or we can also do some inquiry practice

44
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,919
dropping in the question what am I not seeing or what view is

45
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:52,939
underneath this it's another way to potentially work with it

46
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:01,979
so building on that today I want to talk a little bit build on this idea of letting go

47
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:08,580
those of you have been around in the Buddhist scene this is nothing new right we hear about this

48
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:14,699
a lot in fact it's kind of like a central theme of this idea of it's

49
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:22,080
the opposite of clinging we know that clinging brings suffering

50
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:29,300
this is the second Noble Truth cause of suffering is clinging or

51
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:35,160
grasping or thirst craving we could use all these different words

52
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:43,039
it's the same thing it's maybe we might even say it's the opposite of letting go

53
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:50,220
and so just a reminder that you know that this practice is not about acquisition

54
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:56,960
we talk about cultivating having a bit more settleness having more

55
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,220
insights and more mindfulness that just naturally grows the more that we practice

56
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,639
but it's not about like getting things not like getting badges

57
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:15,180
I sat for so many hours this week or I went on this Retreat or something like

58
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:20,000
this I had this meditative experience

59
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,560
it's not about acquiring these things those are things that sometimes we do to

60
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:32,699
make ourselves feel better nothing wrong with that I suppose but it's also there's a way in which that

61
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:39,000
can kind of like slide into well having these Acquisitions quote unquote

62
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,900
might think that that's part of the purpose of practice but instead no we're cultivate our

63
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:53,880
meditation we go on Retreats Etc just as a way to support more freedom

64
00:06:53,880 --> 00:07:00,600
less suffering it's all about this

65
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:06,720
and of course I'm using this word freedom and suffering in really broad ways

66
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:13,440
suffering might just mean a little bit of stress a little bit of uneasiness

67
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:19,560
Freedom can be complete freedom

68
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:25,020
Liberation Awakening can also just be more peace

69
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:34,280
or is less being pushed around by our minds and all of our experiences

70
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:41,099
so with great with regard to views says this particular language that we find in

71
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:46,500
the in the suit does about letting go of views

72
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:53,400
there's this poly word party nissiga absolutely no need to remember that word

73
00:07:53,400 --> 00:08:03,500
but it often gets translated as giving up or relinquishing or giving away

74
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:10,800
this word relinquishing for me kind of feels like oh you have to pull it out of hands or something like there's like a

75
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,900
little tug like oh I'm not sure I want to give it up and maybe that's why sometimes it gets

76
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:21,319
translated that way but it's this word patina

77
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:29,759
is often associated with delight so it's this letting go

78
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:37,580
in the service of creating this inner wealth maybe this treasure

79
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:43,979
this sense of well it often says that it's creates the

80
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:50,339
conditions after this type of letting go there's gladness that happens

81
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:57,560
and some of you might be familiar with what sometimes we call the gladness pentad

82
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,940
I gave a whole talk on this I'll just mention it but it starts with gladness

83
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:10,680
it's a joy tranquility happiness concentration

84
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:17,100
gladness joy happiness so this type of Letting Go this type of

85
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:23,220
giving up or giving away with delight creates the conditions for the mind to

86
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:30,240
be settled creates the condition for this like Gathering Together of our

87
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,519
maybe different aspects of ourselves or different parts of our experience so

88
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:42,240
it's not a giving away or letting go that's it's not a

89
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:51,300
deprivation it's not like we're not having a loss of what is good

90
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:57,060
we're creating the conditions in which there can be more freedom

91
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,380
less suffering

92
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,940
so building on this idea there's also in this who does this other

93
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:14,580
poly word vosika that's often translated as letting go

94
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,860
different translators do different uh words different English words for these

95
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:26,640
different poly words I tend to like mush them together but there's something that's I think

96
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:33,660
kind of interesting about us letting go is that

97
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:39,380
pointing too often like letting go of a sense of control

98
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:46,320
so much we want to control things of course we do we want to be

99
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,260
comfortable we want things to turn out dwell for ourselves for others or our

100
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:58,920
loved ones you might even say so much of our life is a route you know trying to

101
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:05,959
get things to turn out okay it's another way of saying control them

102
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,240
but in the sutas and the Siegel Lovato which is um instructions for

103
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:19,560
householders in particular it says that the instructions are a

104
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:26,519
householder so in this case it would well I'll say it this way a householder

105
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:33,420
should let go of authority to their partner

106
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:39,420
let go of authority this householder should also Grant leave

107
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:45,660
to their workers at the right time so this way in which we might try to

108
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:52,740
control other people in the case here somebody who works for them say no you have to work overtime no

109
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:58,320
you have to take care of that our partner no you have to do this so

110
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,480
you don't have to do that but this letting go of control

111
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:09,420
of others of course we know it doesn't really work

112
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:16,680
but we try it anyway there's a part of us that maybe he's desperately wishing

113
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:22,560
we can control them and maybe there's even times in which the control

114
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,720
I mean we are able to influence them but right we don't really get to control

115
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:36,320
others and my Buddhas he recognizes that this is a lot of suffering here

116
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:44,040
so kind of building on this idea of not being not controlling others is so this

117
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:49,920
idea of letting go of this sense of ownership

118
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:57,180
because often the sense of ownership implicit not explicit this idea that we

119
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:03,120
can control it no this is mine this is my Striker nobody else can

120
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,160
happen and I get to say whether it's it's on this side or on this side

121
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:14,940
or something like this sometimes we don't think about that that

122
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:20,160
this sense of ownership it has this idea of well Noah then I get to decide what

123
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:26,700
happens to it and of course we have the sense that you

124
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:31,740
know this um these glasses are mine they're not anybody else's classes they

125
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:39,959
are mine they wouldn't work for anybody else chances are but there's a way in which ownership is

126
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:46,920
also just a convenient social contract

127
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:54,800
because I don't get to like if I donate them

128
00:13:54,899 --> 00:14:01,260
they're not mine anymore if they break or throw them away or if

129
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:07,320
something happens to them there's a way in which the glass whatever happens to glasses

130
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:14,339
happens to them whether I own them or not we could say well Diana you're the one that's choosing to donate them or you're

131
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:21,120
the one that sat on them and that's why they broke but right we know this that we don't

132
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:27,360
really own things when we die they don't go with us

133
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:34,560
these things they die quote unquote before us objects

134
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,560
so this I don't I'm not trying to say that ownership doesn't exist we

135
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:46,860
definitely have this in the modern West but there's also right different communities

136
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,320
have different relationships with ownership

137
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:58,860
so this letting go it's about stopping demanding that things behave a

138
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:03,959
certain way stopping of the sense of

139
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:10,699
say no this is mine if it's not yours

140
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,540
setting up this tension

141
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:24,899
and so notice how these ways of Letting Go that I'm talking about they're all associated with this sense of self

142
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:33,000
me and mine so whenever there's a sense of clinging

143
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,420
it's a synonym for there's a strong sense of self no this is mine

144
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:45,180
I'm like this I'm not like that there's a way in which there's a little

145
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:51,779
bit of a contraction or maybe a lot of contraction and the exact same way that we might

146
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:59,480
hold tightly to a view that this case a view of a permanent enduring self

147
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:08,459
so if we agree that this idea of letting go of kind of like relinquishing

148
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:15,240
giving away generosity or no longer clinging is a good thing it will help

149
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,399
support this movement towards Freedom well then how do we do this

150
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:27,300
and I appreciate that uh in the guteronicaiah

151
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:34,260
can you tell that I've been poking around in the suit does so I have a number of like pseudor references today

152
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:40,800
that's there is this um this impressive list of uh 17 of these like undesirable

153
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:46,620
states that you don't want like defilements starts with the usual greed hatred and

154
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:51,660
delusion and it goes on with the contempt and I forgot to know all the

155
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:57,240
list I remember reading it thinking like oh wow anger you know some of these things in there

156
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,519
so as these lists of these 17 different defilements and then there's a practices

157
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:08,880
to do with them to help or to support to work with these I'll use this word

158
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:16,079
defilements but as a subset of like these

159
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:22,740
defilements is this idea well let's uh relinquish them let's let them go

160
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:28,020
and so I just want to read you the two examples

161
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:34,559
so it's maybe I'll just make this even more complicated so there's all these defilements there's

162
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:40,919
things to do with them including letting go and then there's practices to help with letting go or whatever it is you're

163
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:46,740
going to do with them mostly letting go here's an example

164
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:53,640
for the complete understanding finishing giving up ending Vanishing fading away

165
00:17:53,640 --> 00:18:00,780
cessation giving away and letting go right trying to be as thorough as possible all these synonyms

166
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:08,460
of greed and then goes for 16 others two things should be developed

167
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:14,880
what to samata and vipassana

168
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,820
summative um settling down we could say It's

169
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:27,780
associated with Gathering Together concentration it's related to the word samadhi

170
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:34,559
and vipassana is this word Insight related to mindfulness this is good news for us right we do

171
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:42,059
mindfulness practice and there's a way in which the Mind does settle when we do this so it's naturally what's happening

172
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:48,000
another example is for the complete understanding finishing

173
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,760
giving up ending Vanishing fading away cessation giving away and letting go of

174
00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:00,419
greed four things should be developed what for

175
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:05,520
loving kindness compassion

176
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,759
sympathetic Joy and equanimity

177
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:17,160
this is good news too because many of us have a love and kindness practice or if

178
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:22,200
not there's a way in which we are familiar with it or maybe there's a way

179
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:28,140
we can have our meditation and or our concentration practice be imbued with

180
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:34,140
this sense of loving-kindness and there's this recognition that this is what supports this letting go this

181
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:41,059
movement of relinquishing Vanishing fading away cessation

182
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:49,980
so I talked about how there's this movement towards letting go is hoping towards

183
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:55,740
more freedom but even though we know this and even

184
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:01,860
though we might even already be doing the practices that might support this letting go

185
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:09,559
there's a way in which there's some letting go that maybe doesn't happen

186
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:17,899
or we might or we might be using letting go in a way that's not helpful

187
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:25,200
so just like we have this sense of like we might want to say okay just

188
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:34,340
letting go or maybe a Dharma teacher might want to say oh just let go let go everything that's let go you'll be fine

189
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:42,780
but of course it's not quite that simple and so I want to like flesh this out a

190
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:49,679
little bit and maybe one say one thing that I'll say is that the here's another suit to quote

191
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:56,340
the Buddha says I don't say that everything should be

192
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:01,740
given up or let go but I don't say that nothing should be

193
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:07,140
let go when giving up certain things unskillful

194
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:15,059
qualities grow and skillful qualities Decline and

195
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:20,780
if that happens don't give up those things but when giving up certain other things

196
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:27,780
unskillful qualities decline while skillful qualities grow

197
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:34,679
so this wisdom to notice okay what's helpful for supporting this with

198
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:42,200
skillful kusala what's wholesome what's helpful what's healthy

199
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:49,700
so is there a type of Letting Go that's unhelpful

200
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:56,480
is there a type of Letting Go that doesn't lead to more freedom

201
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:05,880
we might think of some but I like to point to

202
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:11,220
this uh and maybe I'll like I'm gonna play with the language a little bit here

203
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:17,220
there's a way in which sometimes people abandon we could use abandon for one of

204
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:22,340
these synonyms abandon themselves

205
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:31,158
abandon themselves what does that mean what am I pointing to

206
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:39,720
many of us have heard that a key Insight is like into impermanence

207
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:46,080
to see the inconstant nature of things in permanent nature of

208
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:52,200
things but it feels a little bit like a cruel thing to do if somebody has a life

209
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:58,080
that's very unstable and I just experienced a lot of loss to say oh

210
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,360
everything's impermanent instead we would say like to practice

211
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:13,080
with stability so that they can create the conditions in which they can see the impermanence

212
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:20,039
or in the same way right at one of these key insights is a suffering

213
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:25,320
there is suffering and it just seems insensitive and maybe

214
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:30,419
inappropriate and unhelpful if somebody has tremendous amount of suffering just

215
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:35,880
to say oh they're suffering instead might be appropriate for them to

216
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:43,039
cultivate the opposite to be noticing where there's well-being and happiness

217
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:52,140
so in the same way I could say the same thing for not self another key insight and we can say that

218
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:59,220
if we want to point to not self but maybe somebody really

219
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:07,500
doesn't have a clear sense of self or maybe they feel like they don't have clear boundaries with others or so maybe

220
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:14,820
what's appropriate for them is to cultivate a sense of self some confidence Maybe

221
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:21,059
that could then can support some letting go some opening into not self

222
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:27,179
so there's a way in which we need to like maybe be sensitive to and notice that maybe some cultivating of the

223
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:33,299
Opposites of these key insights can be a real support for our lives

224
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:41,960
help create the conditions in which these three things insights into impermanence insights into

225
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:48,360
unsatisfactoryness duka insights into not self so I would say in the same in that same

226
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:54,600
vein this idea of letting go to not abandon ourselves because

227
00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:02,580
sometimes we abandon ourselves in the sense that we might experience an emotion

228
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:08,940
that difficult unpleasant maybe it's exactly what we don't want

229
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:15,179
and it requires our attention and our care but instead we ignore it

230
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:21,000
instead we distract ourselves or whatever way we're just not present for

231
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,100
it so we're kind of like abandoning ourselves we're not being aware of our

232
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:33,000
experience we are like maybe discounting our

233
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,080
experiences thinking well I don't really it doesn't matter

234
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:47,220
maybe implicit in that is I don't matter or maybe there's this way we just have

235
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:52,980
this habit of turning away from our experiences and

236
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:59,100
not even present for our lives and we find ourselves kind of like

237
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:05,400
slipping our life slipping away or finding ourselves like wow what happened

238
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:12,059
the last few years or something like this or find ourselves sleepwalking through our life

239
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:18,179
I'm calling those like abandoning ourselves we could do it's like in general or

240
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:23,820
maybe when there's only certain experiences that we just

241
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:31,260
tune out turn away turn towards something else

242
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:37,080
maybe this is why we see so many people with their phones scrolling even Doom

243
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:43,080
scrolling right it's all bad news maybe but they're just doing it just as a way to distract themselves from what's

244
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:53,179
Happening or or maybe they yell at their partner or yell at the person who's driving or yell at the kids or just yell

245
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:04,220
trying to distract ourselves from our inner life like abandoning our

246
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:11,460
what are what's happening and to be sure there may be very good

247
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:20,778
reasons why we do this maybe it made sense earlier in our life it was a perfectly appropriate coping mechanism

248
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:30,240
so or maybe we have this idea as long as I have a spiritual life I don't have to

249
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:37,380
take care of all that messy stuff I just get you know I'm just going to strive and work and get awakened and then all

250
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:44,880
the messy stuff will disappear poof has it worked

251
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:51,900
right there's a part of us often that has this I think in the back of our minds of

252
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:57,679
course we come to this practice to alleviate suffering

253
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:04,278
so we you know partly want to turn away from it of course

254
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:13,980
so this idea of like abandoning ourselves we may be like discounting ourselves maybe our inner experience

255
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:19,260
difficult emotions or maybe something a little bit bigger like thinking that we

256
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:24,600
don't count when other people are

257
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:32,299
talking or having ideas or in groups thinking like oh well okay my opinion doesn't really matter so much maybe I

258
00:28:32,659 --> 00:28:38,580
or somehow thinking that uh oh yeah it's

259
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:44,520
okay that that is wildly inconvenient it makes me feel really uncomfortable but

260
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:51,000
I'll do it okay anyway because you asked we're kind of like abandoning ourselves and saying you know what I need to have

261
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,640
some boundaries here this doesn't mean we have to say yes to everything doesn't mean we have to say

262
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:02,279
no to everything but is there a way that we can kind of have a sense of

263
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:07,740
yeah this is what's appropriate this is what's comfortable and here's what isn't appropriate what's

264
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:17,120
comfortable so this idea if we want to let go

265
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:24,179
but I'm saying in order to do like some of the deepest letting go that's possible

266
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:31,799
when it differs to make sure that we're not abandoning ourselves not letting go of herself I'm playing around with words

267
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:38,399
here a little bit but just this whole idea that sometimes we can take some of

268
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:47,159
these ideas of just you know hold things lightly as a way to validate

269
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:52,559
not really being with some of our difficulties

270
00:29:54,779 --> 00:30:03,080
so how do we not do this then how do we not abandon ourselves

271
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:12,960
pay attention to ourselves noticing our inner life and for some of

272
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,240
us who have been disconnected from our emotions for whatever reason maybe this

273
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:24,000
isn't so straightforward maybe a mindfulness practice is part of

274
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,220
just getting acquainted with our emotional life

275
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:36,380
just even learning like the vocabulary of emotions

276
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:43,320
It's Not Unusual for people to just have a limited mad sad glad

277
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:50,940
I know one of those three but but you know that's our emotional lives are so rich and diverse

278
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:58,080
so one way to not abandon ourselves is to stay present for ourselves

279
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:05,220
have some curiosity what does it feel like noticing

280
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:11,220
and I'm saying this recognizing that there might be a really good reason why we aren't in touch with our inner life

281
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:18,779
because there might be some really difficult things there I like this expression that uh Jack

282
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:25,039
cornfield uses this unfinished business of the heart

283
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:33,240
and so is there a way that we can create the conditions on which that business can get finished

284
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:38,399
with care and respect for ourselves

285
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:44,100
not expecting it to be easy and fast or linear or

286
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:51,419
fun all the time but to still find this way to just be present for

287
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:57,120
ourselves with whatever's happening and not in a way that we're going to tip

288
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:03,000
into overwhelm it's absolutely the wrong direction if

289
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:10,620
we find ourselves always tipping into overwhelm is there a way that we can work with it where we don't and

290
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:15,860
where we don't tip into overwhelm but maybe just touch into

291
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:23,340
another support for not abandoning ourselves is just simply valuing

292
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:30,000
ourselves sometimes just our upbringing we've kind

293
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:37,760
of like been discounted or somehow think that we don't matter or we matter less

294
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:44,279
or something along those lines but is there a way in which we can

295
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:50,299
notice that we all matter every one of us

296
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:58,799
every single one of us it's one thing for me to sit up here and

297
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:07,039
to say this but it's another thing for us to really understand that or know it

298
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:15,240
anyway I say okay well that sounds nice Diana I have to be present for yourself and value yourself but how do you do

299
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,880
that here's the good news

300
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,519
it's the same practices foreign

301
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:33,899
[Music] this letting the minds settle getting some

302
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:38,940
gatheredness there's a way in which there's this inherent sense a little bit of

303
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:46,158
well-being that happens when the mind gets settled meditation practice

304
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:52,559
sometimes our meditation practice will have more of an emphasis on just settling down sometimes it'll have more

305
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:59,220
of an emphasis on mindfulness and just noticing what's happening and being really present for whatever's happening

306
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:04,500
two different kind of flavors and they interweave and if we want we can make

307
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:11,119
them really distinct but we can also just let them kind of flow from one to the next

308
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:16,740
the second way to kind of support us to not abandon ourselves so that we can let

309
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:24,320
go so that we can have more freedom this loving-kindness practice

310
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:30,780
compassion practice sympathetic Joy Equanimity these heart

311
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:36,419
practices and I used to teach blaming kindness

312
00:34:36,419 --> 00:34:43,260
practices a few times a week for years had an impact on me too it was great

313
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:48,780
fantastic I love doing it but um it was not uncommon for people to

314
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:55,618
say well you know it's so much easier for me to do loving kindness or Compassion or for others but not for

315
00:34:55,619 --> 00:35:00,780
myself in fact I would say that might have been

316
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:04,339
the most common comment

317
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:12,000
it's not surprising the wave you know we have so much sir

318
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,380
messages from our culture maybe that you have to be better do more

319
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:25,740
so maybe there's some intentional loving kindness practice for ourselves as well

320
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:31,260
as for others so these same practices that are

321
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:40,020
supporting letting go the same practice just practices that are supporting not abandoning ourselves

322
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:45,359
but there's a way in which to highlight or outline and

323
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:52,560
say explicitly not abandoning ourselves that might be a highlight for

324
00:35:52,560 --> 00:36:00,380
what maybe there's ways in which we have been doing this which we haven't even noticed

325
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:08,339
or we were thinking like oh no this is letting go or Equanimity or something but in fact it

326
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:13,440
was a way in which we were disconnecting or turning away from our in our

327
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:20,339
experience so it's not like we have to necessarily

328
00:36:20,339 --> 00:36:27,359
do something wildly different but just to bring this idea this notion into our

329
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:34,020
awareness into the way that we think about our spiritual practice and the way to

330
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:37,220
greater and greater freedom

331
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:46,200
so letting go and go of views which I've been talking about for the

332
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:55,220
past few weeks and today I'm talking a little bit more just about letting go but not abandoning ourselves

333
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:03,060
letting go so that we're holding things lightly but maybe with the when it comes to like

334
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:08,579
ourselves maybe we should have a little bit more cups so that there's we're just holding it maybe it's more like this

335
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:13,859
foreign like this I don't know

336
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:21,740
all these different ways but letting go without abandoning ourselves

337
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:27,720
so I think I'll stop there and I'll open it up to see if there are

338
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:32,060
some questions or comments

339
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:11,299
coming through I don't think it's on maybe the blue one we can turn up the blue one

340
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:18,800
kind of green those pesky batteries

341
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:29,000
oh so when those pesky battery chargers foreign

342
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:37,680
maybe this is just a stray thought that I had during your talk but about

343
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:43,619
halfway or two-thirds through you talked about

344
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:48,660
um not throwing yourself out but being with yourself

345
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:54,900
including during times of

346
00:38:54,900 --> 00:39:00,060
difficult reflection things come up

347
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:06,420
and being with them instead of putting two distractions if I'm

348
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:12,780
rephrasing you correctly so what that reminded me of was

349
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:19,140
a verse from the Terra gotha or Terry The Voice the the tales of the Elder

350
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:25,079
nuns Terry Terry Gotham which goes

351
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:32,640
I Delight oh I had it

352
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,640
um

353
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:48,240
oh taking Delight in all difficult or unpleasant experiences

354
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:53,940
taking Delight in it that's I forget the exact quote is

355
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:59,820
better but but that's the gist of it of course is not how we normally

356
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:05,359
want to think of unpleasant experiences

357
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:12,660
so how can it be delightful

358
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:17,420
to be with that do you have a sense

359
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:23,180
yeah when I met my best

360
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:34,320
collecting on yeah I don't like this experience but

361
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:42,500
it's my experience it's it's me it's part of me

362
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:49,800
so in that in my in in that difficult way

363
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:55,619
it is something to be cherished in a way

364
00:40:55,619 --> 00:41:03,900
part of honoring and respecting yourself not abandoning yourself you might even say yeah and it's also the springboard

365
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:09,300
from which growth can happen

366
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:15,000
so also there's this um

367
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:21,000
experience right when we there's something that's difficult that's happening and whether we're doing this

368
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,700
in an obvious way or in a subtle way there's we can be like pushing it away or

369
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:33,119
having a version wanting it to be different or and then there's this way in which we

370
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:39,240
just like put down the struggle and or just with it and just experiencing the

371
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:44,700
unpleasantness of it there is this delight to be to put down

372
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:50,099
the struggling with it and just to align with reality

373
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:55,200
this is what's happening and there's a there's this delight that

374
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:00,540
happens there with the just being mindful of it so the mindfulness has

375
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:06,119
this quality of I like this word delight which is not quite as strong as Joy or

376
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:11,339
happiness because I think that's a pretty tall order right but there can be this

377
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:16,859
the Delight of mindfulness of actually stopping

378
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:23,280
I'm using this word struggling wrestling tangling with trying to make it go away trying to control it all that kind of

379
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:29,820
stuff and I remember now it's our Delight in attention toward

380
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:37,500
all unpleasant experience what's the word attention attention a direct attention toward okay

381
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:42,720
so maybe the word is sought to you I wonder and I I'm thinking of some more

382
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,420
Nuance namely um if I may

383
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:56,180
really close attention well

384
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:04,920
we'll show you you know every little thing that's going on in your Mind Body

385
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:12,660
system including maybe contractions and only your heart or your throat

386
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:18,420
uh maybe not pleasant but oh yeah I'm

387
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:24,780
understanding myself better now yeah yeah there can be something sweet

388
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:30,359
about it even more difficult you know so I'm struggling with this still but that's as far as I've thought it oh

389
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:36,480
thank you thank you Bill and including this idea like okay now I understand something a little bit better about

390
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:43,039
myself maybe that's where some of the Delight is great thank you

391
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:57,300
okay so thank you thank you for your attention and for your practice if you'd
