1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:12,240
so good day everyone and welcome to this meditation session

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:20,400
and uh where this week we're looking at this category of this idea of

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:27,359
that all experiences are either pleasant unpleasant or neutral neither pleasant

4
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,360
or unpleasant and and these tie into

5
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:41,680
the teachings we had a few weeks ago in the wholesome and the unwholesome and there are some feelings of

6
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:48,480
pleasure or pleasantness of happiness that are wholesome and some that are not

7
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,239
wholesome and this simplistic way perhaps of

8
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:01,280
distinguishing between the two is if there's craving some kind of attachment

9
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:09,520
connected to it to the joy the happiness the pleasant pleasantness it's considered unwholesome unbeneficial

10
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,280
but if there's no attachment to it and and no

11
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,400
yeah no attachment to it at all then probably it can be considered wholesome

12
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:29,040
it's beneficial and so there are beneficial forms of well-being beneficial forms of

13
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,159
of pleasure that are used in meditation

14
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:40,320
and it isn't so much maybe used as the wrong word but are where we avail themselves of them we

15
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:47,439
allow them we make room for them uh in a certain way we kind of prioritize

16
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:53,360
them not strongly or intensely or with attachment or expectation

17
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,560
but we learn to recognize them and in their recognition of them

18
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,000
it supports us to be present the mind wants to be with things which

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,119
are pleasant and there are feelings that we can have that are

20
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:16,319
um within our body in our in our inner life which um

21
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:22,640
have no attachment in fact that some of them actually arise

22
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,560
with non-attachment with non-clinging or non-craving there's just goodness and this freedom

23
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:37,120
this lightness this ease that comes when we don't contract around desires that i just feel so good it's so

24
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,040
pleasant like a fresh air after being in a stuffy place for a while

25
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:51,760
and uh so as we sit in this meditation um rather than looking at the

26
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,239
pleasantness of

27
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,680
the conditions around us or the pleasantness of the conditions of

28
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,760
you know if you happen to be sitting in a very comfortable chair it might be very pleasant or there's

29
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,760
nice music playing or nice temperature it's nothing wrong with that

30
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,800
but that would not be the pleasure or the the wholesome well-being

31
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:29,120
that somehow is made in the space of the heart space of the in the inner

32
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,959
life that is opened when we let go

33
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:41,760
and so to sense and feel the wholesome well-being sense and feel the

34
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:48,959
the the uh that inner well-being

35
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:55,439
inner pleasantness inner uh that comfort which seems to be opening

36
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:02,239
seems to help let go of distractions let go of preoccupations let go of clingings of

37
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,519
all kinds or even let go of let go or fade away

38
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:14,239
anxieties and clinging so we have this within us as possibility

39
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,600
this capacity and it requires a little bit shifting our paradigm

40
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,000
shifting the orientation with which we are moving through the world especially

41
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,039
in meditation if we move through meditation

42
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:38,160
with the habit of selfing of referring everything back to

43
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,960
the self me myself and mine is probably some attachment there so there's less room for these pleasant

44
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,320
things if we are always pursuing

45
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,639
pursuing pleasure we actually narrow the space within which to feel the

46
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:06,639
wholesome well-being and joy so to assume a meditation posture

47
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,720
and maybe sway back and forth a bit sideways and

48
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,639
forward and backwards you kind of have to maybe even rotate around

49
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:27,039
as a way of kind of connecting to your body helping you find a

50
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:35,919
a comfortable upright or comfortable posture in which to

51
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,840
settle into

52
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:53,840
gently close your eyes

53
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,680
and taking a few long slow leisurely

54
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:08,400
breaths maybe three quarters full on the inhale

55
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:21,840
maybe a little fuller release of the exhale

56
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,560
deep inhale and then on the exhale

57
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:39,120
relax and settle in to your body here and now

58
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:52,160
and then letting your breathing return to

59
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,800
normal

60
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:09,360
and if you appreciate your physical body

61
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:19,919
does that make you a little bit more prone

62
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:31,840
to feel what is pleasant in your body

63
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:48,080
if you appreciate your inner life

64
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,599
in this body does that make you more prone to

65
00:07:53,599 --> 00:08:00,240
feel and sense an inner sense of

66
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:08,000
pleasantness pleasure

67
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:15,199
well-being even right next to any feelings of

68
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:27,840
the opposite

69
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:57,600
and then there's there anything if you appreciate your body breathing is there anything in the

70
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:04,800
breathing that's pleasant

71
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:12,080
or has a rightness to it or that you appreciate

72
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:27,600
letting go of your thoughts quieting your mind so there's more space

73
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,959
and awareness to feel

74
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,839
the body's experience of breathing

75
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,839
and letting your mind become quieter

76
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,279
not as a fight with the mind

77
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:06,160
but as a way of letting the mind feel and sense

78
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,760
something wholesome something

79
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:21,440
connecting something tender gentle pleasant

80
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:33,839
here as you breathe in and breathe out

81
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:47,839
breathing in and breathing out

82
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,040
breathing with

83
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:06,320
whatever is simple and pleasant

84
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:19,200
especially that which has to which you have no attachment

85
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:27,040
no clinging letting go of clinging an attachment

86
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:33,199
so there's more space to feel the goodness

87
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:43,839
that remains

88
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:18,400
if you are involved in thinking you're missing out on an

89
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:25,840
intimacy with the pleasant the wholesome

90
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,840
that's within

91
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,840
so

92
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:51,679
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

93
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:00,799
to see if there's some room you can make within

94
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:08,880
to feel some inner well-being

95
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,520
a place of tenderness or softness or

96
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:19,440
warmth something that you appreciate

97
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:25,760
that is has a sense of goodness or rightness

98
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:31,760
that's within you in your heart in your chest in some part

99
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:39,360
of your inner life maybe as you exhale to

100
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:45,279
settle into it as you inhale

101
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,080
expand it

102
00:28:53,360 --> 00:29:00,799
but resting in this place of what's pleasant in your inner life

103
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:07,360
now imagine that nothing is required of you

104
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,640
nothing you have to say or do but people

105
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:18,559
in your life come in front of you and what is it like

106
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:23,520
to receive them in this place

107
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:31,360
in your inner life of goodness of pleasure well-being just to receive their

108
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:36,960
presence without needing to react or respond or

109
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:43,520
want anything almost like you're welcoming them to also

110
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:48,720
feel the rest the pleasantness that's there

111
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:55,840
maybe receiving them as a pillow receives your head

112
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,840
not going out towards them but just to being available

113
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:12,799
to perceive and sense and be present for them in this receptive way

114
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,360
so that others have a place

115
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:32,320
in your inner well-being and from there perhaps you can

116
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,840
evoke well-wishing for these other people

117
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:47,679
extend your good will to them and to all beings

118
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:54,000
so that your inner well-being your inner freedom

119
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:01,120
includes a profound connection to other human beings

120
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,840
may all beings

121
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:13,279
be happy may all beings

122
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:19,840
be safe may all beings

123
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:30,158
be peaceful may all me beings

124
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:37,679
be free and may we contribute

125
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:47,840
to the welfare and happiness of all

126
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:14,159
um continuing on this series talking about

127
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:22,159
the vedana the pali word for feeling or feeling tone

128
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:27,440
and uh it's the feeling tone has to do with the subjective

129
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:35,440
experience that the nature of our experience so that when we

130
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:43,840
feel something physical like say we feel the warmth of the sun that um certainly their their senses are

131
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:51,120
activated uh maybe you can say on the surface of the skin just for the sake of that the thought

132
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,960
exercise but the feeling is a little bit deeper inside

133
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:04,480
because it's the interaction of the sensation a little bit with our response to it our

134
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,599
evaluation our perception of it and so it isn't just pleasant in

135
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:15,118
and of itself but there is uh some degree of it is also our

136
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:23,679
how we receive it how we meet it and so it's considered to be a more subjective

137
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:29,919
and so if we begin by going at the physical level like at the skin level with feeling

138
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:35,839
toned we're going a little bit deeper inside into what's more subjective it's it's

139
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:42,158
something that uh only we experience you know somebody else might experience the warmth that they're standing next to us

140
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:47,280
but only we um the uh you know have our own experience of that

141
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:53,358
subjective experience of of the warmth and it might be a little bit different than the person next to us

142
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:58,400
because as the warmth hits our skin and is felt subjectively

143
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,760
the subjective nature of it is partly this interaction with our mentality our

144
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:09,680
history our associations our responses to it and the person next to us has a whole

145
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:15,440
other set of those so we're starting to get into something very personal subjective

146
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,720
and we're beginning to take a movement deeper and deeper into this inner life and this is one of

147
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:26,720
the channels into it so the feeling tones are pleasant unpleasant or

148
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:33,920
neither pleasant or unpleasant and and it's it's it's simplistic because

149
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:39,520
every experience can be has these simple qualities to it

150
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:46,560
of course pleasant can be a wide range of things from just a mild sense of comfort to intense

151
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:56,000
ecstasy the unpleasant can be again mild discomfort to extreme you know

152
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:03,680
pain and um so there's a whole range but to reduce it to this very simple

153
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:11,599
label or pleasant and unpleasant or the literal poly is more like happy and

154
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:16,720
uh and painful is um

155
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:24,640
is um makes it can make things a lot simpler and help us become freer more simply so

156
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:29,839
if you go into a social situation that's very uncomfortable people are arguing and

157
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:36,079
and all kinds of terrible things are happening in you know in this conversation at a party for example or

158
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:44,800
something at work at a meeting and uh and um to try to figure out what's going

159
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:51,599
on and to understand the details and what you have to do and it gets very complicated but

160
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:57,280
to take a moment and recognize this is unpleasant

161
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:04,320
i know how to be with unpleasant things when things are unpleasant i can just kind of open up and be still

162
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:10,000
and quiet and just feel the unpleasantness i don't have to be reactive to it i know

163
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,920
how to be non-reactive which is just unpleasant it's intensely unpleasant

164
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:22,000
and and simplifying it to that level free of the drama and the stories of all connected

165
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,800
can be a given avenue a doorway into relaxing and opening up and finding

166
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:34,320
our balance getting grounded in the situation that might be faster

167
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:40,400
than trying to you know navigate the situation in order to to feel that so same things with things

168
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:46,079
are very pleasant oh this is pleasant and i know about pleasantness

169
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:52,079
and i know how to be present forward to experiencing it without leaning into it and without chasing

170
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:58,480
after it or something just allowing it to be there and feel it and this is a very powerful thing to do

171
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:04,000
if you want to start becoming free in the midst of your experience

172
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,839
and there's a number of ways you can to kind of experiment with this depending how motivated you are

173
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:16,000
how far you want to take some of these things one of the things that i did in my early years of buddhist practice

174
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,160
was that when i had an occasion to feel pain like for example i was i was

175
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:28,079
working on a farm at the at the zen center or different kinds of physical work that i

176
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,599
had to do some of it was painful for example i remember having to carry heavy objects

177
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:39,520
for a long distance and after a while it hurt a little bit i'll carry this heavy object

178
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:46,880
and so i made it an exercise that not to hurt myself but to see where can i find equanimity

179
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:55,280
with a pain where can i find non-reactivity with a pain just to feel it clearly recognize it's there but

180
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:01,839
but not get reactive to it and not take it personally not have pity for myself or

181
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:09,280
get angry at the situation around me just to feel the simplicity of the pain so i wasn't intentionally hurting myself

182
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:15,599
but when these things occurred i would take them as my practice until it felt like it was no longer

183
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,880
appropriate and then i'd put the thing down that i was carrying or whatever it was

184
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:26,880
another thing that a place to discover if you're motivated that i think is generally generally

185
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:34,000
probably pretty safe is is to take cold showers

186
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,920
and see if you can stand under the stream of the cold shower and find your equanimity find your

187
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:45,599
non-reactivity find your ability just to breathe easily and calmly and

188
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:51,760
feel the cold going going over your body and not cringe and not pull back and not

189
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:57,599
complain and not feel panic at the cold just and it might take a

190
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:04,880
while to kind of be able to stand there and just feel the cold uh and and say this is unpleasant but

191
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:11,119
um but then um you know okay i know how to be here and and in

192
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:17,760
the process of doing that you might not get to some wonderful result but you'll learn a lot about your reactivity and maybe you'll learn to

193
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:24,319
kind of settle and quiet some of the reactivity around the cold shower and these things in

194
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:30,960
working with pain working with um with the cold showers for example

195
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:38,319
is a training to really kind of understand our reactivity to understand the option

196
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:45,040
of not being non-reactive and in fact some things that they're initially uh

197
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:52,079
we know their fields you know we would subjectively say are very unpleasant can actually shift and become pleasant

198
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:58,640
i've done this exercise with the cold showers and after a while sometime i learned to relax and relax and relax

199
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:04,720
i came to really enjoy i felt it was actually felt pleasant to take cold showers but i needed to

200
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:09,839
have the body begin to relax and soften and and be there

201
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:15,920
but it isn't so much that you know have a life of cold showers but to use that to learn about how we

202
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,838
can relax and open and because

203
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:29,119
what's more important more important in terms of dharma practice

204
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:35,359
with time we're connecting to something that's deeper than physical pleasure of any

205
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:41,760
kind at all deeper than the kind of pleasure that it's not even pleasure anymore

206
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:48,000
but rather it's a deeper sense of well-being or happiness to the people who can make a distinction

207
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,040
between pleasure and happiness that's a happiness that can be there

208
00:41:53,040 --> 00:42:00,079
even when things are unpleasant uh we're opening to the kind of pleasure that's considered wholesome

209
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:07,280
a kind of pleasure that is not connected to directly to our senses being stimulated

210
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,880
it isn't because something nice is touching our skin our tongue our eyes our nose our ears it's a

211
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:18,720
pleasant sound for example it's also because not because the world out there

212
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:24,560
is telling us things which are pleasant for us to hear if someone says oh you're such a

213
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:30,560
wonderful person you're like the best person um you're great um

214
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:36,640
that is kind of an external stimuli which is stimulating something that you

215
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:43,520
know or conceit or something but there's a well-being that can well up from the inside

216
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,800
that is not because anything is being stimulated by stimuli from the outside

217
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:54,480
or stimuli from the inside if we're telling ourselves stories or fantasies

218
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:01,440
or something and so to discover this place to open to relax to be non-reactive

219
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:07,920
not for the purpose of being non-reactive so much but to make room to start sensing and

220
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:16,560
feeling the well-being that the pleasure that is not of the senses

221
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:23,119
and and so this distinction between of the senses and not of the senses a

222
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:30,880
little bit my vocabulary but that distinction is there in the buddha's teachings on mindfulness practice at some point as

223
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:36,160
we start continuing to practice with this vedana the feeling tone

224
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:42,319
the idea is to begin differentiating between a wholesome

225
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:49,839
pleasure wholesome well-being and that which is could still be wholesome there's a

226
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:57,280
distinction and of the senses and not of the senses

227
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:03,839
and this whole substance a wholesome experience of not of the senses um is something we

228
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:09,520
open to and then if we really discover this then we carry our well-being

229
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:17,520
with us wherever we go we're not so dependent on the conditions around us be just right so that we feel

230
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:22,640
at ease and feel peaceful so this uh you know dramatic exercise of standing

231
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:31,200
in the cold shower it's not so that you can learn to stand in the cold shower it's to learn how to release and relax

232
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:38,960
the reactivity we have to unpleasantness and then to discover that that

233
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:45,440
non-reactivity gives us access to open and re and connect to something quite precious and

234
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:51,280
beautiful something that a feeling may be of abundance or goodness or

235
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:57,839
or warmth or safety that lives within and i'll talk more

236
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:02,880
about this tomorrow and and tell you a little more about the buddhist languages of it

237
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:09,599
but um so some people are very oriented towards

238
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:15,040
their senses sense stimuli stimulating them and

239
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:20,880
and there's a whole other way to go through the life which is deeper and fuller and more profound

240
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:29,119
more sublime which is this welling up from the inside out that's not dependent on outside in

241
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:34,319
and that's one of the purposes of meditation is to discover that

242
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:46,800
so thank you so we'll continue tomorrow
