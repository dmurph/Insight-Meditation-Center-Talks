1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:09,660
so hello everyone and welcome to this Monday morning in United States

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,540
we're doing a holiday called Labor Day in

3
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:22,699
it's to celebrate to appreciate all the people who

4
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,320
offer innumerable labors for our our well-being the well-being of

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,559
our society to make everything run so I guess it's a

6
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,899
time of gratitude thank you

7
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,399
so um

8
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:53,579
there's a metaphor for mindfulness sometimes it's not just a metaphor but uh actual practice

9
00:00:53,579 --> 00:01:00,180
and that is uh listening and sometimes there's listening

10
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:07,320
meditation where he uh rather than focusing on the body or

11
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,860
focusing on breathing it's focusing on the sounds that are around

12
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:19,200
and some people find that it's more relaxing to be in the present moment

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:27,000
with sounds partly because with sounds we don't uh there's less this idea of control

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:35,700
less idea of trying to make something happen or some idea that we're supposed to have better sounds in order to you

15
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,880
know listen and um and uh sometimes listening is a

16
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:49,520
little bit outside of the ordinary flow of self-consciousness of

17
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,380
self-preoccupation of and it's kind of self-conscious kind of

18
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:02,520
orientation we might have about how we go through our lives and so that can relax and

19
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:09,179
and settle and there can be a feeling of just receptivity of no defensiveness no just

20
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:15,540
trying to justify or apologize or just allowing the sounds to come

21
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,360
and um and uh

22
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:30,180
and so it's a kind of a and it's l and then uh listening can be

23
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:36,420
intentional but as we relax deeply uh it becomes more hearing

24
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:42,239
the difference between listening and hearing is listening there's a active engagement

25
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,300
with hearing and hearing can occur without

26
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:53,640
intending to hear just their sounds and there's hearing and so to move from

27
00:02:53,640 --> 00:03:03,680
listening to hearing is also part of this relaxing so and as a metaphor uh then

28
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:09,900
the mindfulness practice is understood to be a form like listening

29
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:17,700
maybe sometimes in the form of sensing and the sensing that we do has that same

30
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:24,540
quality of non-defensiveness non-control just allowing things to arise and

31
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:30,480
um and there also there's a movement from intentional sensing to the

32
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,700
intentionality settling down relaxing because we're not going

33
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:42,060
anywhere else we're not we don't need to intend to sense because we're just resting in the sensing experience of the

34
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:48,299
body or of the breathing some people find that the idea of listening

35
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:55,200
deeply to what's within allows for kind of different sensitivity a different

36
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:02,900
curiosity a different way of getting out of the way and being connected to what is subtle

37
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:08,940
signals subtle messages subtle experiences Within

38
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:17,900
so we'll use that metaphor today for meditation so to assume a

39
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,320
h meditation posture

40
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:32,300
and we'll start first with sounds and then listing within

41
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,560
so lower your gaze or

42
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:44,960
gently close your eyes

43
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:58,040
and taking a few long slow deep breaths

44
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:11,300
relaxing on the exhale a long exhale

45
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:08,599
and letting your breathing return to normal

46
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:16,620
and continue as you exhale to let your attention roam around your

47
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:25,819
body to see where it feels good to soften and relax on the exhale

48
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:04,740
and then to also bring the attention into the head the center of the head the

49
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:10,940
area of the brain between your ears

50
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:18,259
sensing feeling whatever Sensations there are there in that area

51
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:24,840
and if there's any tension or pressure agitation

52
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,900
on the exhale soften relax

53
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:41,220
if you don't feel that part of your body much that's fine just to relax around it to soften

54
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:46,940
as if you're letting the

55
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:55,039
mind the brain expand and open

56
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,520
and settle down

57
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:21,080
and then open your ears to the sounds around you

58
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:45,420
maybe on the inhale being receptive

59
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:51,060
to sounds even if the sounds as they

60
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,620
Sounds of Silence

61
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:04,140
the inhale being receptive on the exhale

62
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:12,260
resting with the sounds resting in the receptivity

63
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:29,540
on the exhale relaxing the effort to try to listen or

64
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,620
searching to hear sounds

65
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:11,839
and if you find yourself thinking it's okay

66
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,440
but let go of your thoughts so you can

67
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:26,180
create more room and in the mind to listen

68
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:39,420
not to chasing sounds just allowing whatever sounds want to

69
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,660
come

70
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:47,839
whatever sounds you hear sounds of my voice

71
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:58,560
we don't interfere with the sounds as they travel to the ear as their first

72
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,740
heard in the air we might have thoughts and judgments and

73
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:12,560
reactions to sounds but that's a second step in the mind

74
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:20,120
the raw sound itself arrives and is there

75
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:59,420
sounds are always in the present moment

76
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,240
and then if you'd like you can continue with the sound meditation mindfulness of

77
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:46,920
sound or the attitude of listening

78
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:53,760
using that as a metaphor settle into your body

79
00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:00,800
and listen to what's inside of you

80
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:07,820
sense the body sense the breathing

81
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:15,620
with the same non-interfering receptivity of listening

82
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:28,820
Let It Be The Raw Sensations or breathing of the body

83
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:37,560
without getting involved or reacting stay close to the first step just the

84
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:44,339
listening to the sensations listening to changing flow of Sensations

85
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:47,120
in the body

86
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:35,280
listening to sounds listening to yourself

87
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:43,500
let it be a very simple practice as simple as it could possibly be

88
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,600
just listening and nothing else

89
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:52,220
all right

90
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:06,620
and then coming to the end of this sitting

91
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,539
to gently take a few deeper breaths

92
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,500
relaxing on the exhale

93
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:33,000
and now listening metaphorically

94
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:40,158
to the sounds of the world to the suffering of the world

95
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:49,399
there is a saying in Buddhism called listening to the suffering of the world the cries of the world

96
00:28:53,600 --> 00:29:00,559
and now to do so with despair or anxiety

97
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:07,080
but as if listening is part of the medicine the world needs

98
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:13,620
the world needs there to be people who listen deeply to

99
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:22,520
what's happening witnesses to the challenges

100
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:35,520
and to have meditation practice be a foundation from which to listen and see

101
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:41,760
in a caring way to first and foremost to

102
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:49,700
understand before we Act before we speak

103
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:59,220
and even before we speak to extend our well-wishing our Good Will

104
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:07,559
out into the world may all beings with no exception

105
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:12,559
may all people with no exceptions

106
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:20,419
be happy be safe

107
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:28,760
be peaceful be free

108
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:36,620
and may our ability to listen to people well

109
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:43,679
support the possibilities of the happiness and

110
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:51,440
well-being of others May our listening

111
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:55,159
be of benefit to this world

112
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:11,279
[Music]

113
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:23,820
doing this good day and welcome to this Monday first talk of

114
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:31,260
our next series and Following last week's discussion about why speech I'd like to do this

115
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:38,399
this week do wise listening and I thought it might be nice to do it

116
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:43,620
in the same five guidelines for speech

117
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:49,500
and to apply those to listening listen in a timely way

118
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:57,779
listen uh in a truthful way listen uh with um

119
00:32:57,779 --> 00:33:06,720
I a a nourishing way a pleasant way a a

120
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:12,480
listen to a way that really really can touch people's hearts in our listening

121
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,580
listen from the heart and then listen in a way that's

122
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:23,940
beneficial listen when it's beneficial know how to listen in a beneficial way

123
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:30,120
and then to listen with Goodwill so that's what we'll do

124
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:36,840
now listening is a meta both a practice in itself and a metaphor for practice

125
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:42,539
and um and there are times when we're communicating where it's not literally

126
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:50,159
listening some people are deaf and so not literally listening but there is a ways in which we receive

127
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:56,460
into our life into our self the communication that other people are

128
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:04,019
providing and um and that could be with an email or this that could be sign language or

129
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:09,440
other ways that people communicate and there's something about being

130
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:17,638
receptive to that in a deep way where we're sensing or feeling our way

131
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:23,158
um observing in a deep way what is being

132
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:28,679
communicated and it said sometimes in therapy that a

133
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:36,300
good part of what of successful therapy is the listening skills of the therapist the good a good part of the skills of

134
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:43,378
being a good friend is their listening skills of the of the friend to really listen uh to people

135
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:50,760
it's also sometimes very closely associated with spirituality the people who listen to the Buddha if

136
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:57,660
his first disciples were called literally called the listeners and uh and not the followers but those

137
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:05,280
who listened and back in the time of the Buddha there was no written communication there was no radio or

138
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,820
there was no TV and monitors all the communication happened orally people had

139
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:18,780
to listen or and or just or use their mouth for all the news and all the

140
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:26,520
knowledge all the education all the the uh entertainment and music and songs

141
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:32,460
and poetry were found received someone speaking them and so knowing how to

142
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:37,680
listen and I believe because of that people listened in a different way 2500

143
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:43,859
years ago because if uh they wanted to they it wasn't like you could go look up

144
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:50,339
the a poem later to review it or teachings later to review it you had to

145
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:56,220
either memorize it yourself or go find someone who did who could recite it but

146
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:04,020
so those is to to really listen deeply enough to hear it and it goes deeply into the memory banks is actually an art

147
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:10,020
a skill that uh many people in the modern world uh have lost or have never

148
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:16,920
developed and um in the I think the rules of Saint

149
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:23,579
Benedict the Catholic order the rules begin with the word asculta Latin for

150
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:29,579
listen so this listening is something really really significant

151
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:35,040
and the qualities of listening that make it really healing or beneficial is when

152
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:40,140
we can listen without inserting asserting ourselves into the listening

153
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:46,560
that our agendas our desires our wants are rejoinder to the conversation what

154
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:52,500
we think and we're kind of raring to go like a thoroughbred out of the uh

155
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:59,760
start of a race just waiting for the start button we're ready to speak but rather we're hold we're listening as

156
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:06,180
if what we're hearing from someone else needs to be complete we're interested in

157
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:11,520
the whole thing in a deep way to let it register to hear almost as if we're

158
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:17,460
listening between the lines uh the

159
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:23,520
the there's a kind of a little story I've heard maybe made up of a of a man

160
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:29,460
who's having trouble with his marriage and um and the therapist tells him you have

161
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:34,980
to really listen to your wife so he does that comes back the next week and say well I listen but nothing you

162
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:40,500
know changed and uh the therapist said uh you have to also listen to what's

163
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:46,200
between the words I was a bit you know what's not being said

164
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:52,740
and so this ability to kind of listen and to the words the feelings the

165
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:58,560
attitudes the concerns the history the context there's so many things to really

166
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:05,579
take time to feel and sense no that can't be known if we rush to

167
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:12,060
judgment rush to speak so in this in in the Buddhist mindfulness practice

168
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:19,859
uh listening that is a kind of can be as a as a model or an example of how

169
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:25,560
mindfulness can be that mindfulness then has similar qualities to listening we're

170
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:31,680
not asserting ourselves we're not inserting ourselves into this situation we're receptive we're taking in the

171
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:36,839
situation deeply we're letting it register we're feeling it uh you know

172
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:42,540
how it impacts us in many different levels on our mind in our hearts maybe

173
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:48,599
even in our belly and really feeling and listening and what's happening here and

174
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:55,260
doing the same thing with with another person how is it coming from their

175
00:38:55,260 --> 00:39:03,119
background how is it coming from their context since the world that in society where is it coming from the context of

176
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:09,540
their Joys and suffering of their life how is it coming from their hearts how is it coming from their belly and what's

177
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:14,880
happening for them so to listen deeply

178
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:21,300
is uh uh is a powerful thing to do and for people

179
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:29,900
who are doing mindfulness training developing the capacity for mindfulness this is a kind of a ready-made

180
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:36,420
kind of uh possibility for developing your mindfulness in in

181
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:42,839
communicate in communication in in the world in your relationships with

182
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:48,900
others if you want to develop greater mindfulness I simultaneously develop

183
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:55,880
greater skills to listen there's a story in my book that Monastery within of a

184
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:01,560
young person who um Family moves away for a year to some

185
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:07,859
distant country where there's a Buddhist Monastery and the young person goes and

186
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:13,200
learns about meditation and finds it very meaningful but then after the years

187
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:18,359
to return to their own country where there is no Buddhism though meditation no one seems to know anything about

188
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:24,780
meditation and um and the young person asks the abbess now that I come back to my home

189
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:30,200
country how can I continue my training and meditation and the episode

190
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:35,940
ask around for the person who is the best listener

191
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:43,260
in your community and then learn from them so the city of listening is a kind of so

192
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:49,079
akin to listening well is so akin to mindfulness so it's a way of developing

193
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:55,800
mindfulness in daily life in our relationships and so for today the idea of timely is

194
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:01,140
it listen at the right time and um probably it's always the right

195
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:10,859
time to listen to someone to listen deeply and um and uh but if they but if uh but

196
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:17,339
if we only listen to them and they're not interested in us or interested in our response at some point you know of

197
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:23,420
course uh at the time that listen is over but

198
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:29,520
the the time to listen also is not just to listen passively but to listen

199
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,859
actively and that's often the key to good listening is not to be a passive

200
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:41,000
listener letting just people speak but show them that you understand them

201
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:48,839
active listening often allows you means that you kind of uh say oh I understand

202
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:55,320
um you're having trouble listening and and that's a challenge for you or I understand oh look you have a lot of

203
00:41:55,320 --> 00:42:01,320
trouble at work I hear that and that must be hard so just little things that show that you're listening and you're

204
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:06,900
attentive I have been a conflict mediator and in

205
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:13,140
my life as a Buddhist teacher and the one thing I've learned is that

206
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:20,660
um conflict gets resolved much faster if the party is in a conflict understand no

207
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:25,680
that they have been heard and being heard means people have

208
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:35,460
listened and have understood and so I think a nice kind of guideline is that

209
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:44,400
that kind of like always the right time to listen and there's a saying I've heard that

210
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:49,700
says that you know God gave us

211
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:57,420
one mouth but two ears so we can listen twice as much as we speak

212
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:04,319
and um so you can probably adjust that saying in different ways but the um but the

213
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:09,780
idea that prioritize listening more than speaking

214
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:17,819
because then when you speak the speaking might be much more effective you won't have to say so much if you

215
00:43:17,819 --> 00:43:26,339
really you don't have to repair so much you don't have to explain yourself even more or clarify if you've listened well

216
00:43:26,339 --> 00:43:31,980
and really understood not what's what's happening with others then when you

217
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:37,560
speak it's a it can be

218
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:42,960
easier to speak for the five guidelines for speech

219
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:50,900
so um so for today if you'd like to uh

220
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:57,599
practice this trade in this during the day next 24 hours uh you look for

221
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:02,940
opportunities to listen well and if you're mostly alone but you're

222
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:11,640
listening to a podcast or the radio or something that's actually an interesting place to train in listening uh in a good

223
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:17,060
way watch your mind see what you're doing as you listen how much are you

224
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:23,300
losing yourself and losing some kind of deeper way of listening how much are you

225
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:29,940
judging or reacting and losing a deeper way of listening kind of below the words

226
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:35,819
that are spoken even or the fullness of what's being said

227
00:44:35,819 --> 00:44:42,660
so it could be you know just listening to something on the news that's particularly useful place to

228
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:49,140
listen because the news is often offered in a way that can be to hook us in or

229
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:56,040
get a little reaction from us and so to listen a deeper way to listen to politicians in

230
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:02,640
a deeper way and uh but listen to your friends your co-workers your neighbors

231
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:08,640
um see what it's like to listen it's in such a way that the people

232
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:16,560
you're listening to understand that they're being heard um before you come back with your

233
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:25,079
rejoinder and of course this doesn't always apply if there's a just a fun light back and

234
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:30,359
forth that's going to play full but anytime there's a little more serious conversation

235
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:38,520
to listen deeply is a wonderful practice so thank you very much and I look

236
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,240
forward to tomorrow
