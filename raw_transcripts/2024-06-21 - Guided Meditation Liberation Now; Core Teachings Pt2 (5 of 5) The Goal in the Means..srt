1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,080
so good morning for some of you good afternoon

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:13,000
for others good evening for maybe another set of you good day for

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,680
everyone and um so we come to the last

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:28,880
uh day of this five day series and the topic being today is

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:36,719
liberation and Liberation is often considered to be

6
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,120
an absence of certain mental

7
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:49,079
States rather than the presence of something which can be a source or

8
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:55,399
reason or an object of attachment

9
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:01,920
expectation um comparative thinking

10
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:09,799
uh it's an absence of greed hate and delusion an absence of clinging an absence of prejudice absence

11
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:17,040
of bias absence of conceit absence of

12
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,600
selfishness absence of resentment and

13
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:31,200
covetousness absence of so many ways in which we well human

14
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,960
beings harm each other including

15
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,119
ourselves and an

16
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:51,799
absence leaves us without something an absence is a simplification

17
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:57,479
of certain kinds of things and so one of the

18
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:05,359
characteristics of liberation is freedom from those things which

19
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:15,200
harm and one of the characteristics of the path to Liberation is that the is that the way

20
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,879
we practice the path should contain within it some of

21
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:27,360
the goal the goal is to be found in the

22
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,599
means and what what the how to understand that is that the very way in

23
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:39,720
which we practice Buddhism the very way in which Buddhists practice

24
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,080
meditation mindfulness is a

25
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,599
care maybe a loving care but a real care a

26
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:57,840
real kind of carefulness

27
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:05,640
attention is to be paid is to be given that the way in which we

28
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:13,159
practice is with as little greed hatred and delusion as we can

29
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:22,319
muster that we practice without attachment or clinging without hostility and without

30
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:30,680
conceit without selfishness without strain

31
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:39,040
without complacency or holding back without shutting

32
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,879
down without avoiding in the ancient text they talk

33
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:51,360
about neither accepting nor rejecting and uh we have to understand

34
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,760
carefully what that means that accepting and rejecting involves

35
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:04,840
kind of taking and pushing away kind of acquisition

36
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:11,200
appropriation let's and and

37
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:17,760
rejection so this absence leaves us in a state of radical

38
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:25,160
Simplicity awake here just

39
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,400
awake with the same Simplicity of what wakefulness feels like

40
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,360
waking up from a really good sleep or a nap there's something in that waking up

41
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,280
from really good sleep and nap that the wakeful state itself has that has this

42
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:48,360
Simplicity in it and

43
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:59,759
finally to become free of clinging free of hostility and craving

44
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:11,960
cannot be done with more attachment with more clinging with more hostility and

45
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,840
craving so to practice mindfulness with a care and a love and

46
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:24,280
a devotion maybe even a almost a religious

47
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,280
devotion

48
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:39,240
to free ourselves from those things that go

49
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,800
against the grain of

50
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:52,319
freedom and it isn't that we have to do it perfectly it's that we do it to the

51
00:05:52,319 --> 00:06:00,720
extent that we can and for what we can't we hold that

52
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,400
spaciously openly we hope that hold that with

53
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,800
kindness compassion we hold

54
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,960
that with faith that we

55
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:24,880
can practice with it meaning that we can be mindful of it and finding our

56
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,960
way slowly to freedom from it

57
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:39,599
but whatever is difficult not to meet it with more

58
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:46,240
difficulty you can't solve the problem with more of the

59
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:57,400
problem so assuming a meditation posture and gently closing your eyes

60
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:11,370
and here you are in the spot where you're

61
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:17,160
[Music] sitting [Music]

62
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:25,479
rising out of your seat arising out of whatever place that's holding

63
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:33,199
you here it's you your body body your heart your

64
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,280
mind it's so precious it's so

65
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:49,000
valuable you are a treasure

66
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,879
you are wondrous and to sit here caring for this

67
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:03,000
wonder that you are by being

68
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,479
mindful of whatever arises where the mindfulness

69
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,440
itself contains qualities of being

70
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:29,199
awake free of all the forces of harm

71
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:36,039
or as free as we're able to practice with for

72
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:39,279
today with

73
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:48,560
faith that this kind of care and this kind of love this kind of

74
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:54,000
attentiveness is the way to

75
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
Freedom

76
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360

there is freedom right

100
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:19,480
here just outside of whatever attachment you have

101
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,960
clinging just beyond your distraction

102
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:38,720
deep within below your thinking there is a place of

103
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:46,480
absence the absence of being

104
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,480
caught for

105
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360

for for

109
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,200
and then as we come to the end of this

110
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:52,039
sitting to take a few moments

111
00:26:53,360 --> 00:27:01,279
here to sit with a Wonder Wonder of being

112
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:08,600
alive The Wonder of being

113
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:19,600
conscious The Wonder of that corner of your heart your mind

114
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,840
your being which

115
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:30,158
knows how to be alive without

116
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,960
fear without

117
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:45,000
craving without

118
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:54,440
hostility a Simplicity of being free of

119
00:27:55,399 --> 00:28:00,720
conceit free of being

120
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,080
caught in

121
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:15,080
self here it's possible to breathe

122
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:22,960
freely here it's possible to sense or live

123
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,960
life easily

124
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:38,679
here it's possible to have a mind that operates

125
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:50,480
peacefully and to whatever degree we can int it or feel or sense this

126
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,158
possibility even if we imagine this

127
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:02,120
possibility to then to from that

128
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:10,919
place to be open to the world to be aware of people in your life

129
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:17,360
the people in your neighborhoods and communities the people around the

130
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:24,600
globe and for you to share with them through

131
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:29,640
whatever example you can provide

132
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:39,799
of a life that's free of being caught in forces of

133
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:45,320
harm forces of hatred and Prejudice and

134
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:55,600
bias examples of a person who lives with the opposite with generosity and love and

135
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:02,799
wisdom and may it be that radiating from

136
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:11,320
you is good will towards all beings may all beings be

137
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:20,600
happy may all beings be safe may all beings be

138
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:27,399
peaceful may all beings be free

139
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:40,940
[Music]

140
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,760
thank

141
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:00,960
you e

142
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,960
so suffering and the end of

143
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,158
suffering freedom from fixed

144
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:59,840
views the natural functioning of our life flowing freely through us

145
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:07,080
sometimes taking the form of love or care or

146
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:13,519
compassion all leading to or supporting or pointing

147
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:22,960
to Liberation and the path to Liberation a path that liberates us from

148
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,600
suffering brings at the end of suffering so these are the foundations

149
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:36,039
of the core teachings that I believe I base my teachings on and my practice on

150
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:42,159
my life on and so today the topic is

151
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:48,919
Liberation and the path to Liberation and um what's uh delightful

152
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:53,638
in this tradition is that

153
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:59,320
uh is the principle that before

154
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:06,799
Liberation there is practice and after Liberation there is

155
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:12,639
practice that the practice moves continuously through us even the Buddha

156
00:33:12,639 --> 00:33:17,720
after he was fully awaken would go in the forest to practice

157
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:22,840
meditation and um they uh and so in a

158
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:28,840
sense the difference between before and after an experience of a weakening or

159
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:35,760
Liberation um uh it doesn't matter that much what matters is that we practice

160
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:43,399
that the practice is sincere and uh the founder of San Francisco Zen Center Suzuki roshi made

161
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:50,720
this now often referred to statement that uh someone asked him uh um if I do

162
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:57,440
Zen will I become enlightened and he replied was if your practice is sincere

163
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:03,320
that's almost as good and so before before Enlightenment

164
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:08,800
practice after Enlightenment practice and so maybe in a certain kind of way

165
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,919
Enlightenment doesn't matter that much for what we do for what we dedicate our

166
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:22,599
life to so not to be too caught in the idea of some kind of experience of Awakening but to be kind of devoted to

167
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:30,200
just keep practicing uh the Dharma the mindfulness the compassion the concentration the

168
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:38,560
ethics all the different pieces the Eightfold Path now uh one of the things that I

169
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:44,520
like to emphasize is for the the goal to be found in the

170
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:49,679
means that uh if the goal is to uh a

171
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:55,320
radical way of being not caught in anything caught up in anything a radical

172
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:02,079
way of being free from uh uh being stuck free from being

173
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:09,720
obsessed free from being um uh oppressed with our own mind our own Hearts fear

174
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:20,240
and upset and dismay and criticism and anger to really the um uh that that's

175
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:26,800
the goal that the means to that goal should have some of the qualities of the

176
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:35,119
goal in itself it doesn't mean that we can just wipe away the ways that we're attached but it

177
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:41,520
does mean that we can begin finding a way to be mindful a way to be aware a

178
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:47,640
way to bring our attention to what's difficult in us to our attachments that

179
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:56,119
that way of attending is is free of attachment free of being caught to some

180
00:35:56,119 --> 00:36:02,599
degree and that even just to some degree uh if it contains part of the

181
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:08,359
goal that's enough to begin seeing a sliver seeing a little hint oh this is

182
00:36:08,359 --> 00:36:15,079
what it's like to be present without any attachment without any resistance

183
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:23,960
without any shutting down or any holding on or any uh self-

184
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:30,760
preoccupation this is what it's like to be free of preoccupation um and we start getting little senses of

185
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:37,599
it and then to be guided by that oh this is good this is the way forward this is

186
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:46,240
what the path is about uh and to have some confidence that you can find that in yourself in how you're mindful in how

187
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:51,800
you're aware and caring for your practice and so then

188
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:57,960
slowly uh one way of understanding what practice is is that that little sliver

189
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:04,359
of Freedom that you begin to recognize in how you're aware begins to grow

190
00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:09,760
begins to spread becomes bigger and bigger and so rather than focusing on

191
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:18,440
having some deep Insight or getting concentrated or like having you know aiming towards something exactly still

192
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:26,040
the same practice but um it's also kind of uh behind it or in you know in the

193
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:31,960
very mode in which we're engaging the practice something is growing and

194
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:42,359
something is growing and BEC bigger and bigger until it fills us until it kind of really uh um uh shows us deeply

195
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:49,400
deeply the experience of Freedom that's possible and um and in the teravan

196
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:55,560
tradition um the emphasis of doing this is by talking directly about uh

197
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:02,920
recognizing what greed hate and delusion is like and attachment is like so we can find a way to practice without that in

198
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:07,960
some other schools of Buddhism um um they they point to a different

199
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:13,640
possibility they have some way of pointing or the practitioner to the

200
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:20,480
place of non- clinging and just to abide in the best they can and then over years

201
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:27,920
that grows and develops until the sense of non- clinging becomes much more pervasive in who they are

202
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:36,640
and um but this the growth of freedom and um so well before

203
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:43,280
Awakening uh there is small Awakenings small sense of being awake and I love

204
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:50,240
this a metaphor of being awake for this Liberation from clinging Liberation from

205
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:57,800
suffering because um I don't know if it's true for everyone I don't know what the you know conditions are for people

206
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:03,560
that might interfere with this but uh some of us maybe have this experience of

207
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:09,800
waking up from a good sleep a good nap um maybe it's even maybe having a nice

208
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:15,160
cup of coffee for some people where there's a sense of feeling a wake a

209
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:20,200
wakefulness that uh is independent of what we're aware

210
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:25,599
of um if we're tired and grumpy and

211
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:34,119
things are challenging and difficult then it's almost like everything the eyes set their uh gaze upon it's just

212
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:39,680
difficult and challenging and everything is kind of seen as a difficult thing um

213
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:46,000
and even the the our awareness are knowing and thinking about it is just not doesn't feel

214
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,400
good but when we in in waking up from a really good

215
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:56,720
nap um and uh or sitting on a park bench on a day that we don't have any work or

216
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:03,760
any respons posibilities and just sitting there uh with nowhere to go nothing to do no one to be just looking

217
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:09,480
at the maybe children playing or the the squirrels running around or the wind in

218
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:17,240
the trees there's a feeling of contentment and just being just being alive is enough there's a feeling that

219
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:24,560
uh and it independent of what we know what we're aware of uh you feel this beautiful feeling of

220
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:29,920
just being awake it feels so clear and crisp and and content like it's kind of

221
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:35,319
like it it's a Clarity that's expansive without edges and then we go into the

222
00:40:35,319 --> 00:40:40,839
kitchen and there's a mess in the kitchen sink and it's like wow okay this

223
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:47,000
is just uh there's no reactivity to the mess in the kitchen sink it's just like

224
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:54,720
it's this too is happening in the clarity so uh so this so if you have an

225
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:59,960
experience like this in a park bench on know waking up from a nap or something

226
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:07,280
this is now beginning to be a guide where you start getting a sense of oh this is what freedom is like this is

227
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:14,560
what's possible and there might be other things in your life that has given you this kind of uh foraste of what Freedom

228
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:24,359
Liberation is and um and then to uh to um to uh so it's

229
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:31,160
we're growing that we're developing it as after a very clear when that's becomes really clear some definitive

230
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:36,560
experience of Awakening of Freedom radical freedom from all

231
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,680
suffering that that registers deep deep in our Consciousness in our in our

232
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:47,640
hearts in such a way that now there's a reference point for living

233
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:53,839
free and um and now the challenge is we still want to practice still that's the

234
00:41:53,839 --> 00:42:00,560
dedication but now we know something we don't want to compromise we don't want to we don't want to uh

235
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:08,480
give in forces of harm of hatred of fear um because that interferes with

236
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:16,359
this capacity of Freedom that is the channel which is the open door for the

237
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:21,760
wholesome goodness of our hearts for our capacity for love and compassion

238
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:28,760
generosity our compassion to be of service for others and for this world to care

239
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:35,800
and um and so uh after some experience of Liberation there's a uh there's a

240
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:41,680
kind of um for a while there could be a debate going on inside of us between do

241
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:48,640
I get angry at the condition of the world do I get dismayed do I get afraid

242
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:53,880
or is it okay to stay in this place of freedom is it okay to stay without

243
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:59,800
clinging without attachment without preoccupation and inevitably if you do this practice

244
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:06,839
well Freedom wins in the debate greed hate and delusion doesn't win fear does

245
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:13,200
not win dismay does not win because if we do that it diminishes us we lose

246
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:18,240
something we harm ourselves and we see that over time we also start harming

247
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:25,200
others in maybe subtle sometimes big ways there's not a a few uh people who

248
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:31,319
who have been engaged in the process of U you know to use a choice word

249
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:36,839
fighting for justice and have used the very forces

250
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:42,880
within of greed hate and delusion to to to fight for justice that is the reason

251
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:51,319
why there's Injustice and of course we want to live in the world to bring justice but to to

252
00:43:51,319 --> 00:43:59,160
know how to bring bring freedom our freedom our wakefulness to spread it into the world this is a possibility as

253
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:08,319
well so before Awakening there is the practice that can be informed Guided by

254
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:14,280
some intuition of Freedom after Awakening there can be

255
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:20,800
some intuition of Freedom that now really sets a stage that guides us not

256
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:29,079
just an intuition but a knowing to Freedom so I hope that uh uh you can

257
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:34,599
learn to appreciate that the that the goal can be

258
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:40,960
in the means and that that nourishes you that supports you that guides you that

259
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:46,400
inspires you in your practice and that through this practice that you can

260
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:52,200
benefit all beings so thank you very very

261
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:59,040

263
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:12,240
opportunity to partner with a local uh Nature Preserve called uh Hidden Villa

where we used to put on Retreats for 10 years and they would like us to come back and continue putting on Retreats as

265
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:25,800
well and um and we don't know if we were able to do it because of a variety of

266
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:33,480
factors here at IMC and um the uh so what we'd like to do is
