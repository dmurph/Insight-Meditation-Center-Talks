1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,878
so good morning everyone and

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,278
happy to be with you

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:21,600
and the topic for this week has been compulsive desires really of all kinds

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,800
and one way to turn this around and for ourselves

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,880
is to in some healthy wise way

6
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:41,120
have the attitude of wanting what you have so in meditation to not look for

7
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,719
something beyond or other than what's happening for you

8
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,559
but have an orientation like okay this is what i want now of course there are plenty of things

9
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:59,600
which are not desirable not not

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:06,720
that are painful difficult that might be happening as we meditate but this attitude of okay this is what's

11
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,240
coming so this is what i want not in order to suffer more

12
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,080
but to begin discovering a whole different attitude or way of being in the world

13
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:25,200
that's not driven by wanting something other than what is

14
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:33,680
and then something very different can start happening in the alchemy of the mind there can we can start becoming free

15
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,040
of what is so it's not celebrating or appreciating or

16
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:45,280
necessarily or or validating what is happening but rather okay this

17
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,360
is what's happening this is what i want so that i can become free

18
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,759
so that i can find this place of clear recognition

19
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:04,719
open awareness luminous presence where and it's maybe in a sense the

20
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:12,720
awareness is bigger than what the details are of what's happening

21
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,879
or as if the details of what's happening happen independent

22
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:27,599
of the usual ideas of self what i want what i don't want

23
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:37,200
and then something very different begins to shift and change if we just work with what is happening

24
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,360
practice right there with what he's here so you might to the degree to which you

25
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:50,000
find yourself distracted or caught up in desires for things to be other than they are

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,159
there are even desires to hold on to what's there what's happening see if you can shift that to a desire to

27
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:04,080
just allow this desire for what is happening

28
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,120
desire for what is going on including that things change and shift

29
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,200
including that some things stay and then in that allowing and then wanting what is happening

30
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,519
there you can begin finding some steadiness some calm some

31
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,560
peace some kind of paradigm shift

32
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,239
in how we are in this world that maybe is free

33
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:39,760
of compulsion and free of you know self-preoccupation referring

34
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:46,720
everything back to self so assuming a

35
00:03:46,720 --> 00:04:01,840
meditative posture and gently closing your eyes

36
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:08,159
and if what i just said seems a little troublesome for you or

37
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:15,519
you have ideas that too difficult for you or if

38
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,958
it can't be right it's okay

39
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:29,040
maybe instead you could smile a gentle smile inner smile

40
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,639
at the delight

41
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:42,000
of questioning looking deeper in this whole world of desires that

42
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,719
human beings live in that this is a time to appreciate

43
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:57,840
yourself and appreciate the possibility

44
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:07,680
of observing desires in yourself

45
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,199
and ex and considering yes there is an alternative

46
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,320
and that alternative might be

47
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:30,960
to take a few long slow deep breaths and as you exhale

48
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:39,840
to settle in to just what's happening here now

49
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:53,840
to take a deep breath in and perhaps relax your thinking mind

50
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,759
soften let go of your thoughts of past and future what has happened what

51
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:11,039
might happen letting the exhale center you

52
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,560
here letting your breathing return to normal

53
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:33,600
in this centering process centering yourself grounding yourself here on the exhale

54
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:40,080
relaxing your face the face can carry so much of the

55
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,160
momentum of our desires and wanting and

56
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,960
trying so hard

57
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,720
bearing down tightening up

58
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:06,960
and give the a chance to take it easy to relax

59
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:16,319
to not always be at the service of our minds desires and

60
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:31,840
aversions softening around the eyes the jaws

61
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,880
on the exhale to relax the shoulders

62
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,840
when the shoulders are tense

63
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:55,199
they're under the control of our minds the tensions in our minds

64
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:01,599
and to give the shoulders a chance

65
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:13,840
to be free of the mind and just soften relax a bit

66
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,879
and the same with a belly

67
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,919
maybe as an act of generosity to let the belly move in the direction

68
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,440
of relaxation

69
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,839
softness

70
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:56,080
and as you exhale to soften the mind

71
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,760
relax the thinking muscle

72
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:11,680
letting the mind become quieter calmer

73
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:24,480
or making space broad expansive space

74
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:32,800
so the mind is not making itself claustrophobic

75
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:51,839
the mind has breathing room

76
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,880
and then becoming aware of the body

77
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:19,839
breathing breathing in and breathing out

78
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,760
and see if you can find a way to be intimate with your breathing

79
00:10:51,760 --> 00:11:01,600
without clinging or pushing or strong desire

80
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,720
where's you simply want what's already here

81
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:15,120
want how things are right now as you're with your breathing

82
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,200
if you're distracted in a certain way

83
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,160
want that as well but not to hold on to it or

84
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:36,800
succumb to it but so you're not fighting it but rather

85
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,640
being mindful of it

86
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:56,000
without the need for it to be other

87
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,800
there's a way of wanting what's happening whatever is happening

88
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,839
there's a way that that can set you free

89
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:24,639
even free from any wanting

90
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,720
breathing in and breathing out

91
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,839
here

92
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:47,279
if you get distracted in your thoughts see if that represents some form of

93
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,839
desire that you're caught up in

94
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,839
see if you can let go of that desire

95
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,959
to return to wanting just what's here

96
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:22,959
being content with what's here so that you can be free

97
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:33,840
in the midst of life here

98
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:35,840
and then to end this setting

99
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:44,398
is there some way that you can be deeply content

100
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:53,600
just with what is happening at the moment some way that you can put aside

101
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,240
desires for anything else to be different

102
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:06,480
putting aside any attempt to change what is

103
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:16,320
and even imagining that you could do so is there some way that that enables you

104
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:22,480
allows you to respond to the world around you in a

105
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:31,120
new way in a way that maybe is more open

106
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:36,159
a way that is free of clinging and aversion

107
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,440
a way where you're not asserting

108
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:48,640
conceit asserting how it relates to me myself

109
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:56,399
and mine and in this contentment in this

110
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:02,000
willingness to abide in how things are

111
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:13,840
can that be a source for love for care

112
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:22,399
for kindness that has those qualities of non-assertiveness

113
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:27,840
non-defensiveness defensiveness

114
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:40,480
non-greed because love does not coexist

115
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:46,398
very well with greed and discontent

116
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:56,799
and as we come to the end of this sitting perhaps any way in which we can

117
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:04,320
discover the peaceful care for the world

118
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,840
may that care become strong

119
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:15,919
and gently motivating

120
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:24,399
and may we live for the welfare the happiness of this

121
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:29,600
world in ways that are appropriate for each of

122
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:36,080
us flowing from how we are when there's a

123
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,720
deep contentment and freedom

124
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:51,279
may we contribute to the happiness of others to the safety of others

125
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:58,559
to the peace of others and to the non-oppression of others

126
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:19,840
may all beings discover freedom from greed

127
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:35,440
so we come to the last talk about greed and non-greed

128
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:41,360
and i can imagine that it's a difficult topic

129
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:50,480
partly because desire is so integral to being alive as a human being

130
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:59,279
and they can feel incomprehensible to not have

131
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:05,760
the assertiveness of desire the compulsion of desire to have things be

132
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:12,799
different to want something different or it can be inconceivable not to try to hold on to

133
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:19,200
what is happening and this idea of freedom from needing

134
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:25,200
things to be different and freedom from needing things to stay the same

135
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,279
it's kind of maybe it sometimes doesn't compute and it's um but this is one of the

136
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:37,679
things that as meditation deepens and gets quieter we can start getting a feeling for a

137
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:43,200
sense for this kind of clear recognition clear awareness

138
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:51,440
that's settled and open that needs nothing to be different including doesn't need things to

139
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,559
not change from how they are

140
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:02,799
so the word greed is a umbrella term uh some people don't

141
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:08,399
relate to the word very strongly and don't identify that their impulses

142
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:16,480
of desire have any connection to greed but greed is an umbrella term for a lot of different

143
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:24,480
kind of motivations in the same family family of greed acquisitiveness

144
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:32,320
just wanting things is a form of greed miserliness not sharing not being

145
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:39,039
generous holding on tight to what one has is in this family of greed

146
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:44,399
strong biological lust uh biological passion that can feel so

147
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:50,960
natural and and uh something that we should of course just kind of give into and allow for it feels like freedom and

148
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:56,240
feels like such a wonderful pleasure to just kind of lose ourselves and perhaps

149
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:03,039
it can also be a form of greed if it's if it were being kind of compelled by it and

150
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:11,040
there's no freedom in it we give ourselves over to this force that in a sense takes over

151
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:17,440
rather than being free and having a kind of ease and a kind of

152
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:24,480
non-compulsion in how we act and how we live in the world of pleasure even

153
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:32,398
so uh in in the dharma the uh one of the kind of goals of

154
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:40,638
this practice of vipassana the practice of buddhism is to realize a

155
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:47,200
way of being or a possibility of radical and complete

156
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:54,878
non-greed non-compulsive desire and and it might be unimaginable that

157
00:34:54,879 --> 00:35:02,560
this is possible but it is possible and it's deeply satisfying it feels

158
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:09,119
that level of peace well-being uh sense of freedom that comes from that

159
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:14,560
is uh pretty phenomenal and then some people you know

160
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:20,320
anticipating or thinking about this goal are worried that if i have no compulsive

161
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:26,400
desire no strong desire that pushes me you know that or no holding on tight to

162
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,920
what i have that somehow i won't be safe somehow

163
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:38,240
life will become very difficult and so it's maybe it might have some truth

164
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:43,280
to it it's a little bit hard to know how everybody lives their life and the conditions their challenges that they're

165
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:49,839
living under but certainly we don't want anyone to be harmed by non-greed

166
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:57,119
but non-greed has this wonderful quality that the absence of greed is the absence

167
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:03,440
of states of mind that eclipse the deeper goodness within us

168
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:10,800
they obscure the deeper movements of generosity of contentment

169
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:17,280
of love of a kind of a deep faith in the

170
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:23,920
possibility of freedom and and this this capacity for

171
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:29,680
living a generous life not because generosity we feel compelled to be

172
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:35,680
generous not because it's but rather that generosity

173
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:42,880
is the kind of generosity of if your person has two hands the generosity of the left hand washing

174
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:49,440
the right hand and the right hand washes the left hand that there's a kind of unself-consciousness

175
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:55,119
in the hands there's kind of a coming together clearly there's they

176
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:00,480
need to be two distinct hands so they can do the work but they become one and they become

177
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:07,040
somehow uh not separate and so in generosity there's a coming together of the receive

178
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:14,000
the the giver and the receiver and also the gift what's been given and so it doesn't

179
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:20,160
become something that's self-centered it doesn't become something where that creates a kind of a

180
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:26,480
hierarchical distinction between me the giver who's special and you who's the one who needs something and

181
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:32,240
you better be thankful for what you've done what i've done for you there's a kind of a softening and

182
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:39,920
letting go of any of the barriers or clingings or holding on that that gets in the way of a sense of

183
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:46,480
mutuality or sense of this kind of simplicity where just the right and left hand coming together to do the work of

184
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:53,119
cleaning and so this simplicity and naturalness almost of generosity that comes from

185
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:58,400
some deeper place that cannot come from a place of greed

186
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:04,480
and part of this is that greed the compulsive desire that

187
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:10,240
in buddhist understanding psychology it always comes together with clinging

188
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:15,599
with grasping at something with compulsion where there's no freedom

189
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:20,880
and clinging and grasping are a form of suffering there's a kind of a

190
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:28,160
tightening a constriction a tension that comes along with clinging

191
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:33,920
and grasping so greed always comes with suffering even if the promise of greed

192
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:40,079
the excitement of greed acting on greed might be pleasant or has a promise of

193
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:45,920
pleasure in it the fantasies can be pleasant there's something in and of itself in the greed

194
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:51,920
if we really to pay attention carefully that it brings suffering not only that it

195
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:58,880
brings a kind of alienation from this deeper goodness deeper wellsprings of love and

196
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:06,640
contentment and generosity that lives waiting inside of us that it's not really us uh

197
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:13,359
it's not really what we usually identify with me myself and mine it's more like in buddhist terms like

198
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:20,960
the dharma that lives within us and so it's not exactly ours but it's not apart from us

199
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:27,599
and so greed always comes with clinging and the freedom from greed comes from

200
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:35,040
the freedom from clinging the freedom from grasping and that feels so good to be free of that tension

201
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:40,560
and uh and then it gives rise to a whole other orientation of how to live in life that

202
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:47,119
maybe is really foreign to the thrust of living that most people can live in this world

203
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:53,440
so it could even feel disorienting or frightening or or you know undesirable to have this

204
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:59,359
lack of clinging because so much of how we normally live

205
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:04,480
is based on clinging and grasping the other thing that greed always comes

206
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:10,720
along with it comes along with conceit it comes along with an assertion

207
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:16,640
of self of it's you know it's it's for me or i want this or i'm going

208
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:22,800
to keep this for myself and um i'm going to you know i'm going to grab it for me

209
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:29,599
and this self-assertion into the world is also its form of suffering it's also

210
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:36,560
a form of of um of sometimes of asserting greed and desire in the world

211
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:43,040
causes a lot of harm in the world around us as well either directly we can see it but also

212
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:48,960
many of its indirect that the ripple effect of our consumerism for

213
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,480
example that's based on greed the ripple effect of greed the greed of

214
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:59,680
capitalism that how it affects you know so much of the world

215
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:05,760
you know as part of the suffering that greed kind of spreads out like a disease almost

216
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:13,280
and so to to learn to discover again through maybe

217
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:20,000
meditation or some other means that it's possible to live and live well and happily and

218
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,200
successfully without the self-assertion

219
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,440
without it's kind of like

220
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:36,400
i don't know what occurs to me it's it's kind of like um

221
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:44,240
having a bicycle that uh maybe one of the breaks or is kind of

222
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:51,680
always kind of misadjusted it's always rubbing against the the tire the wheel and so you have to

223
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:57,599
pedal harder and forcefully in order to get the bicycle to roll but

224
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:02,800
and that that brake that's always against the you know against the wheel is a little

225
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,920
bit like the self that we always carry with us and uh and so

226
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,960
the rubbing of that and wears the all kinds of things out

227
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:18,720
but to undo the break and allow some deeper wellsprings to come up

228
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:25,200
that are defined by the absence of greed the absence of hatred and absence of

229
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:30,880
delusion and this is a beautiful way of living

230
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:37,520
and so the absence of grace comes absence of greed maybe for some

231
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:43,359
people will feel like a kind of a grace living a life of grace

232
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:49,760
and for other people it's living a life of love or generosity some people feels like a

233
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:55,359
living a life of freedom and so it's well worth taking a deep

234
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:01,040
look at this world of greed how it works for us take a deep look at the world of

235
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:07,359
compulsive desires that drive us and move us along both in our thoughts in terms of distracted thoughts

236
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:14,079
and the momentum of thoughts in our actions what we do and also in how we speak

237
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:22,079
and and and what is it like to let

238
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:29,680
speaking thinking and acting come from someplace where there's no assertion of self no clinging

239
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:36,400
and no greed and it's one of the great pleasures of life

240
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:43,599
so thank you very much and so then next week we'll do the same kind

241
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:50,079
of uh journey through the topic of hate or hostility or aversion depending how

242
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:55,440
we translate the word and so i look forward to that

243
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:00,560
and finally i'd like to say that there's a kind of announcement about imc

244
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:07,520
uh we have announced now a few times in different places that we were kind of scheduled to begin opening again on august 1st

245
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:13,680
so it's coming up pretty soon in eight days or so and uh i i think it's probably unlikely

246
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,800
that we'll open then so next week there'll be some announcements and on the imc

247
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:24,000
webpage we'll post it next week to be some clarity about when you know when we

248
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,400
you know clarity but you know a little bit more information about our opening or not our opening

249
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:36,880
and um so just if you live locally and you have those thoughts

250
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:42,400
please keep you know check check the website

251
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:49,838
