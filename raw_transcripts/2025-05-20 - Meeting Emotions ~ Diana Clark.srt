1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:08,319
good evening welcome welcome nice to see you

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:16,640
all it's funny how sometimes I find like little pieces of dharma just in little

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:24,760
snippets in the daily life and recently I I came across this uh

4
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:32,119
quote from Rilka letters to a young poet and just these few

5
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:39,079
lines let everything happened to you beauty and

6
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:46,600
terror just keep going no feeling is final

7
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:54,680
let everything happen to you beauty and terror just keep

8
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:01,840
going no feeling is final it's so like compact and there's I

9
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,560
feel like there's a lot there a lot there so I want to talk a little bit about

10
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:14,159
feelings about emotions kind of how to be with them and

11
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,400
the what our meditation or mindfulness practice can do as a support for

12
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:25,600
them i'll start with a little bit of a definition we can consider that emotions

13
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,000
are a form of communication from ourself to

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,680
ourself in some kind of way there's this opportunity maybe to learn something about

15
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:44,000
ourselves when we are in tune with our emotions like "Oh wow i'm really angry i I guess this is more important to me

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,280
than I realized or I feel sad." And this recognition like "Oh yeah

17
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:58,079
maybe I was more uh harmed or hurt or feeling grief or

18
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,439
loss more than I realized or something like this." or maybe some anger like wow

19
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:10,399
okay so maybe some borders or some boundaries were crossed and felt like I was disrespected and what is important

20
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,440
to me so it's a way in which emotions can be an important part of you know

21
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,800
having a rich and healthy life and it's a way that emotions can really be a

22
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,000
support for our lives but we can only learn from our

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,840
emotions if we can allow them to be there if we can allow the emotion to

24
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,480
exist and in some way be able to have some contact with it and to recognize as

25
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,800
best we can what it is and maybe the message it's telling us is obvious maybe

26
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,560
it's not obvious but there's something about not

27
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,760
pushing away your emotions or trying to run away from them which you know I I

28
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:04,879
spent a lot of time doing certainly many of you know I'm trained as a scientist and when I reflect back I think maybe

29
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:13,599
part of the reason why I went into science because I thought like oh they don't have those messy emotions there

30
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,879
little did I realize until I was a scientist right of course that uh

31
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,560
scientists turn out to be humans too plenty of

32
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,159
emotions so there's a way in which uh we can also consider that emotions are a composite so part of it are these

33
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:38,000
physical sensations the way in which we feel like fear or dread or something

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,440
like a lump in the throat or maybe there's heat in the face with anger or

35
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:50,400
maybe there's a knot in the gut with uh anxiety or something like this so all of

36
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,840
these emotions they have sematic signatures not the same for everybody

37
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:02,640
but uh it turns out if like if you have a like an outline of a human body and you ask people to color in the areas

38
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,920
where is sadness where is anger where is loneliness where is outrage whatever it

39
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:15,680
might be turns out that most people generally are coloring this in the same areas of the body tends to be the face

40
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,720
and the front of the torso for the most part for the most part it's not exactly

41
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:28,080
the same for everybody so there's these physical sensations there's also physical

42
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,800
expressions our faces are expressing emotions and there's some people who even get trained

43
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,320
in this and noticing the smile small flickers of the corners of the mouth or

44
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,320
the eyebrows or the eyes or something and can determine emotions so our

45
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:53,120
emotions are getting expressed maybe to others even if we're not so much aware of them and I'm sure we've all had this

46
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,240
experience where somebody is saying one thing but their uh ex emo their

47
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,080
expressions are saying something different it feels you like it feels a little confusing do I believe the words

48
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:11,680
or the what your eyebrows are saying to me and then of course there is the

49
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,960
thoughts the stories the whole narrative that we have that are going along with

50
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:23,280
the emotion i can't believe they said that and the next time I see them I'm going to do this and this is the third

51
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,720
time they've done it or you know whatever it might be or oh my gosh I can't believe I'm feeling sad again i'm

52
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:36,560
always sad i've been depressed for a decade and I'm never going to feel any better and I always feel terribly sad

53
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:44,000
you know there's this way in which the stories can like be perpetuating and fueling the emotions as well so these

54
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,120
different aspects and different might be considered a composite and so in this way we can work

55
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,759
with different aspects of uh emotions and from one perspective we can

56
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,360
say or consider that emotions of course are very personal there's something that

57
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,880
we experience and maybe are related to our life story and our history of our

58
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,880
life what we've experienced and how we've interpreted it

59
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,880
but for me I found this helpful to also put in perspective that yes all of our

60
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:28,000
emotions are our own but they are also you know part of the human experience

61
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,160
and this common humanity that we all have

62
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,800
emotions and it's also culturally and temporally specific

63
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:50,000
for example there's so many like books and movies and TV shows that about 19th century uh

64
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,880
United Kingdom I don't know exactly where we could say England at least very unflapable and very proper you know this

65
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:04,240
way right you know not a lot of emotion and you know kind of like uh upright right so there's a certain area era and

66
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,520
location and they have this certain type of emotional I don't know

67
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:16,639
expression and Jack Kornfield tells this story jack Kornfield is a an elder in

68
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:22,080
this uh lineage he tells this story of this was probably decades ago teaching a

69
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:28,319
retreat in Switzerland this was at a time when there weren't so many meditation retreats people from all

70
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:35,360
around Europe came to Switzerland to attend this retreat and at the end of the retreat he was reflecting maybe I

71
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:42,000
should say that during retreats there's uh individual practice discussions where each uh retreatant has a private

72
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:50,639
conversation with the teacher and at the end of the retreat uh Jack reflected wow it's quite something

73
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:57,599
everybody from this one country was had some anger and self- judgment was what

74
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:05,199
was coming up for them so members from another country were wildly just justiciculated talking

75
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,960
how painful and beautiful and wonderful everything was and then like from a

76
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:19,039
third country they had all these existential questions of doubt and the meaning of life so just this recognition

77
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:25,080
right that there's cultural um influences on our emotions

78
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:31,039
too and for me that was very helpful to just realize oh yeah it's like of course

79
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:36,200
I have these emotions I'm part of a cultural meu in addition to having

80
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:42,120
a a particular story particular

81
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,360
experiences and there are some that would say that the cultural male you

82
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:54,600
that is uh influencing our emotions today is this culture of

83
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,959
outrage everybody this is seems to be like the one thing that everybody agrees

84
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:05,839
on is to be outraged and this is pretty unique that like all the social classes

85
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:11,200
all the professions everybody's outraged and this is a way in which kind

86
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,560
of this in some ways that we could even say the western economy is built on this

87
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,720
there's so much of the media outlets and political discourse and advertising

88
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,399
these types of things are really promoting this sense of

89
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:36,240
outrage and part of this is um that we assume that outrage is a

90
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,279
reliable source for social change we can feel like oh yeah I need to be outraged

91
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:48,360
this is the only reason or only way things are going to be different than they are and dang it they need to be

92
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:55,920
different so I'm not going to comment on that except maybe I'll just share this story for me that uh has had a big

93
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:02,080
impact on me there was a time when I worked for a company that uh publicly

94
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:11,279
traded and we had missed a major milestone that was going to affect the stock price so right we have to uh send

95
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:18,000
out a press release so we sent out a press release saying that we had missed this milestone just the nature of my job

96
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,040
i knew all the details and it was fascinating to see like all what was

97
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:32,560
happening i can't believe this company is doing it they all are only doing this because of X Y and Z and I'm like wow it

98
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:39,079
has absolutely not one thing to do with what the truth was but then there's this all this media

99
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:46,079
kurfluffle that was 100% fabricated had nothing not one it was just fascinating

100
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:52,880
it was actually that we had made a stumble and we had made took a chance on some manufacturing process that turned

101
00:10:52,880 --> 00:11:00,480
out not to work very well and they were made up all these stories about something quite something for me to just

102
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:08,640
see the media the all the I don't know social I don't know all all the um

103
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:15,440
comments on things was just not even close and not only was it not even close

104
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:22,240
it was filled with outrage like we were all of a sudden bad terrible company but just turned out

105
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,880
that we took a chance and it turned out not to work well on something completely

106
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:35,040
unrelated so now I have this story in my mind so now when I'm seeing the media and saying things about I'm think well I

107
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,079
wonder if that's the full story it might be the full story but it might not and

108
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:45,720
chances are it isn't chances are it isn't

109
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:53,360
so this idea of you know emotions whether it's outrage or sadness or

110
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:59,399
loneliness or grief or joy or happiness but in particular the difficult

111
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:05,160
emotions and difficult might be different you know what's difficult for one person might not be difficult for

112
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:10,399
another but I like this story this is also from Jack Kornfield now that I

113
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:17,560
think about it um I just love this story that kind of talks about this

114
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:23,560
idea of one way to work with difficulties

115
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,720
so this is uh about the poison tree and there's this tree that uh has this fruit

116
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:37,519
that turns out to be poisonous and there's this uh some people when they discover or see that

117
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:43,279
there's this tree that has this poisonous fruit they their immediate reaction of okay we got to cut this down

118
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:48,639
got to get rid of this tree before somebody's harmed before I'm harmed and

119
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:54,880
let's make sure that you know get this out of here that it's uh doesn't harm

120
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:00,800
anybody and often this is our initial response to difficulties that arise like

121
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:06,399
oh get this out of here this I don't want to feel this i don't want to even acknowledge that I have this type of

122
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:14,240
emotion in me this rage or this despair whatever it might be

123
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:21,200
and sometimes there's this way in which we have this idea we just want to distract ourselves and we have these

124
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:27,440
little rectangular things that we put in our pockets that are computers that we tap that can help us distract ourselves

125
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:35,519
and entertain ourselves all day long right and we do this very often so that's one way to respond to a

126
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:42,959
poison tree is to cut it down and get rid of it so that the or try to cut it down try to get rid of it

127
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:50,240
but there's other people and we might say they've journeyied a little bit uh further on the spiritual path and they

128
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:56,000
recognize you know the power of the heart and they want to bring some

129
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,680
compassion and care to this tree so they have this idea that no no let's not cut

130
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:09,440
it down let's just put a fence around it we'll let the tree live and of this

131
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:17,720
fruit but we'll just put a fence around it to protect people so that they don't get harmed out of this so they have this

132
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:23,519
kindness they put a fence around it and so this is a really different

133
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:30,160
relationship to the emotions from get rid of it to like oh no it can be there we're just going to be with it in a way

134
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:37,160
that is not going to cause harm and then there's a third group of

135
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:43,440
individuals who meet this poison tree we could say they've have uh gone even

136
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:51,360
further down the spiritual practice that might be one way to consider it and they come across a poison tree a

137
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,920
tree that has poison fruit and their response is to say "Oh poison tree

138
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:02,480
perfect just what I was looking for." And they pick the fruit very carefully

139
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:08,760
and extract some of the elements of it mix it with some other things and make

140
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:15,880
medicine make medicine out of it for themselves and for

141
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:23,519
others i love this story this sense of so often what we think are our wounds or

142
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:29,040
our difficulties and I certainly have found this in my life turn out to be

143
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,720
source of strength and source of connection to other people a source of

144
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,720
some vulnerability which allows some intimacy with others some some

145
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:49,440
closeness so this way that how can we be with what we might consider to be the

146
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,759
fruit from the poison tree in Buddhist practice how we how

147
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:02,720
might it be a support for us to meet what we find difficult in life and be

148
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:10,199
able to transform it into medicine for us and for others

149
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:18,399
and so some of us might have even come to Buddhist practice to a meditation practice because of emotions maybe we

150
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:26,240
felt like terrible grief have had some tragedy in our lives or maybe we just have some

151
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:32,160
depression some sadness and maybe it's not entirely clear but we thought we

152
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,959
would give meditation a chance or something like this

153
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:45,600
there's a lot of people come to the dharma with suffering maybe you just

154
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,639
have this general sense I don't know what to do with my life it's not quite

155
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:56,959
going the way I thought it was going to go this job that I had was a great job

156
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:03,640
it was a great job it felt I felt like you know I wouldn't be able to get a better job

157
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:09,480
probably but somehow even though I had reached a

158
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:16,480
enviable position I felt like yeah something's not quite right something's

159
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:23,760
not quite right with my life is not going the way I thought it would even though I had I don't know did what I

160
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:31,200
thought I was supposed to do right so Many of us are bringing this um

161
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,240
some emotional discomfort or some uncomfortable emotions with us and part

162
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:43,280
of the reason why we find our ways to practice and we might have this belief that okay if I just practice hard enough

163
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:50,799
or um then all emotions will just go away i know I secretly had that idea that they

164
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:57,919
would uh somehow I would be alleviated from these pesky emotions yeah turns out it doesn't work

165
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:05,120
that way just like the scientists turn out to be humans that meditation and Buddhist practice turns out to be filled

166
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:11,919
with humans notably ourselves and others but we could say that with

167
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:20,120
Buddhist practice like this idea of freedom peace well-being awakening

168
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:25,840
liberation whichever words relate to you which are meaningful for you we could

169
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:32,520
say that awakening to emotions is to actually feel

170
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:41,520
them and not have them be a problem to feel them to nothing less and

171
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:48,760
nothing more just to feel them and have the problems of them drained

172
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:54,000
out and maybe we might even have like our range of emotions

173
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,080
um can increase my years of practice I've experienced happiness and joy that I

174
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:06,080
didn't know was possible i've also experienced just terrible like despair

175
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,280
and darkness too but there's a way in which our practice

176
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:18,240
is designed to hold it to help us be with it to increase our capacity to be

177
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,280
with it so that we don't have to organize our life our social situations

178
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:29,200
in order to just avoid any uncomfortable emotions it's amazing how much energy we

179
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:37,120
put into okay well I feel a little bit uncomfortable in that situation so I'm not going to go to that gathering or I'm

180
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:43,039
not going to stretch myself into this new thing that I might learn or because

181
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:48,080
uh I might get embarrassed or so many ways in which we limit ourselves just so

182
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:54,000
that we can avoid some emotions what would it be like what

183
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,200
would your life be like if you weren't afraid of emotions like yeah okay i might be disappointed i might feel

184
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:05,840
frustrated but I'm going to do it anyway i might feel sad if this doesn't

185
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:13,520
turn out the way I want i'm going to meet it anyway my partner my co-worker the

186
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,880
person that I see at the coffee shop all of them might be having uh strong

187
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:25,360
emotions and sometimes we feel like we want to avoid people like that after you know there's been a death in the family

188
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,720
or something and we want to like I don't know what to say and so we avoid them

189
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:38,320
what would it be like to be fearless and be able to comfort others if comforting

190
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:45,039
was what was appropriate and needed that would be freedom that would

191
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:50,200
be freedom in our lives

192
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:57,600
so one way that we might think about this is that mindfulness being

193
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,960
um feeling the feelings is being present for our

194
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:10,039
emotions is a way that we can for ourselves allow maybe an evolving or

195
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:17,760
resolution or a movement or I like this word metabolism of our emotions allows

196
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:25,159
them to move because that's their nature often emotions can feel

197
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:30,640
stuck but there's a way in which they're stuck because the thoughts are like

198
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,960
ruminating around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around often is what's

199
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:44,000
happening but if we can just meet our emotions and I'll talk a little bit in a

200
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,360
moment about how to do that there's a way in which they can evolve and

201
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:56,000
transform and shift and change that is their nature it's not their nature to always

202
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,799
be the same and often if we are can meet it we

203
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:08,159
might see that it's maybe it's not just one big terrible emotion maybe it's a

204
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:13,679
collection of emotions sometimes this grief may have some sorrow a little bit

205
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:21,159
of fear in there maybe some disorientation or sense of

206
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:27,840
powerlessness and there's a way of which when we make the room for them these different ones like we can meet them and

207
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:34,320
care for them these individual ones and allow it to kind of be seen and

208
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:40,200
known and pass away arise be known and pass away

209
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:47,480
often with anger there's sadness underneath or fear underneath for

210
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:53,120
example or maybe we're not even sure what emotions are maybe we're like okay

211
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:59,280
there's some fluttering going on deep inside and it feels uncomfortable and I don't want to look at it and we just try

212
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:06,440
to ignore it or maybe we're not uh feel like we have a wide emotional

213
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:14,520
vocabulary that's okay Do can we just meet whatever it

214
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:20,640
is so maybe this way of meeting emotions is a way in which we can make friends

215
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,960
with them some of us are some people are

216
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:33,919
comfortable with emotions and have a rich emotional life that uh supports them and help

217
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:39,679
connects them with others some people are not so aware of their

218
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:45,200
emotional life and prefer it that way but they find that their life is kind of

219
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,320
flat and maybe feels uh stale and dry in

220
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,760
some kind of way maybe some people just have a lot of

221
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:02,520
resistance and fear about their emotional life don't really want to experience

222
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:09,559
them and I feel like in my life there's been different uh uh

223
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:16,080
seasons where I felt like you know I've had a lot of emotions i felt very emotional and times when not so much but

224
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:21,960
I felt I could feel them and and I would say certainly now I

225
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:29,039
like it's really been transformed i certainly there had this like well okay certain emotions are okay

226
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:35,360
to feel happiness well-being joy the sad ones the confusion ones the anger ones

227
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,480
not okay but I don't feel have that feeling anymore and this absolutely is

228
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:47,840
due to practice meditation practice so is there this way that we

229
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:55,320
can make friends with our emotional life however it is right

230
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:01,360
now this practice is not asking us to be somebody we're not it's not asking us to

231
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:07,840
completely be different than who we are so we start with whatever might be

232
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,320
arising for us now maybe we have this idea that

233
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:20,400
um we want to be friends with our emotional life which means can we offer

234
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:26,600
emotions we might consider them as energies maybe can we meet them with

235
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:33,159
acceptance and compassion and if it's difficult to do

236
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:39,080
that can we meet the resistance to meet the

237
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:45,919
emotion and then if it's difficult to do that instead we find ourselves doing this intellectualization and

238
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:51,600
rationalization and just thinking about things and not really feeling the I'm

239
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:57,120
going like this in the body because often emot I feel emotions in the body it used to be all exclusively in my head

240
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:02,320
but now it's in the body but we can just start with oh yeah okay

241
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:08,080
there's more just intellectualization and rationalization and uh a certain way

242
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:16,000
in which we actually aren't feeling emotions but maybe they're just some mental activity around with them

243
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,720
we can start with that and maybe just hang out there for a little bit

244
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,840
with the intellectualization and just allow that

245
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:34,360
to maybe it's some breadcrumbs to something else that's richer that's

246
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:39,880
deeper but there's a way that being in particular with difficult

247
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:45,480
emotions can be like getting into a pool of cool

248
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:53,200
water okay we'll put our toes in and maybe that's enough to begin with

249
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:59,159
there is no timetable we don't have to push ourselves force ourselves to do things in a

250
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:05,080
particular schedule and we put our toes in we put our feet

251
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:11,600
in our lower legs and when we feel comfortable we can

252
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:17,520
go deeper in on another time maybe there is a time when we feel like we can go all the way in and then

253
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:23,679
maybe sometime in which we go into this cool water and with under putting our

254
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:29,640
head under the water and there's this way in

255
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:34,720
which we recognize that like with this idea of like being underwater we just

256
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:41,679
recognize oh this emotion is just part of the energy of life it's not a problem

257
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:48,240
it's just what's being experienced right now so how do we do this this whole idea

258
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:54,559
of putting toes in the water like how do we do that so I'll talk about some practical

259
00:27:54,559 --> 00:28:00,159
things here so some of this is like can be on the cushion or off the cushion in

260
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:05,760
your daily life or during meditation i'll start with some easy

261
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,840
things some obvious things posture of course the mind and body and

262
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:18,559
emotional life and everything is are connected and it's striking how you

263
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:25,120
notice how when I was talking about depression I was kind of like doing this with my posture because this is how it feels we often are kind of like slumpy

264
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,880
and collapsed into ourselves don't underestimate the impact

265
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:38,640
it can have to have an upright posture it's some it kind of it uh

266
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:44,720
communicates a certain amount of respect for ourselves for whatever emotion is

267
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,000
having and there's something about being upright that uh brings a little bit more

268
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:58,240
spaciousness and openness like literally like in the chest and the torso but just having a more upright

269
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:05,200
posture can be a tremendous support so just notice if you're feeling like whoa these emotions and sometimes we want to

270
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:11,840
like get into a fetal position or something like this when it feels terrible if possible can you be in an

271
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:17,600
upright posture if possible if your body allows you to not use a back rest but to

272
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:24,320
sit up with your own own you know your own under your

273
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:30,880
being supported by yourself sometimes on retreat i know

274
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:38,720
I've done this sitting upright posture with tears coming down but sitting here and there's something like okay sadness

275
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:45,919
is happening but it's not like the end of the world just it's just tears and

276
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:53,399
it's just sadness this is what it means to be a human all of us have loss all of us have

277
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:58,720
sadness so one posture maybe I'll sprinkle something in

278
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:07,039
here too maybe even If posture doesn't work feel your feet on the ground get like grounded feel like connected to the

279
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:13,760
earth in some kind of way this can be a tremendous support feel maybe what your hands are touching just you know

280
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:19,399
something tangible because the mind is wanting to spin out in

281
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:25,600
stories and we're trying to just like disrupt the momentum and just be here

282
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:31,120
now because the stories are elsewhere and that's not what's actually happening

283
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:37,559
what's in the mind so the hand

284
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:43,760
placement also can be something I said about what the hand is touching but sometimes it can be like you to put your

285
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:49,360
hand on your chest like oh my gosh this is hard but there's a way you know to

286
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,799
sit upright and have your hand on your chest is a way to acknowledge the

287
00:30:54,799 --> 00:31:00,240
difficulty but it's also like a gesture of care and respect for yourself instead

288
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:06,880
of this I know trying to hide or something or maybe there's in the belly

289
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:13,159
you just like wow you know maybe some

290
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:20,399
breathing so that's the next thing the breath it can be that uh you know with

291
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:27,039
mindfulness we're just noticing what the breath is doing but if we feel like there's a lot of emotions whether we're

292
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:32,320
meditating or just out in daily life the breath can be a tremendous support and

293
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:39,760
one way is just to in a subtle way not a big giant exaggerated way but just to

294
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:47,279
extend the exhale a little head just be a normal inhale but extend

295
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:54,799
the exhale a little bit this works with the parasympathetic nervous system just helps our physiology our nervous system

296
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:59,960
just to calm down so that we feel a little bit

297
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:08,240
more less frantic maybe or less uh fearful maybe or this way of just like

298
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,720
okay I can be here i can be here with this

299
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:22,639
so is there this way that then we can maybe explore the physical

300
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:29,519
sensations this way that as I said emotions can be

301
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:35,360
experienced in the physical body and letting the the mind is going

302
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:41,519
to protest it won't it will not want to do this but can you just be with the

303
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:47,440
physical experience sad sadness for example pressure around

304
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:53,679
the eyes this heaviness in the shoulders maybe there's this feeling of wanting uh

305
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:59,000
to collapse and just to be with the physical

306
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,360
sensations as best you can and most likely what will happen is you'll be with a physical sensation and then the

307
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:11,360
mind is going to want to tell you why you really shouldn't be doing that you got to think more about this terrible awful thing and then you just come back

308
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:17,039
to the physical sensation and then the mind is going to pull you away just come back to the body the mind's going to

309
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:24,320
pull you away come back to the body exactly like we do with meditation of coming back to the breath again it

310
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:33,000
doesn't matter how many times we do the same thing in a kind gentle way just coming back to the bodily

311
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,480
sensations and then there's a way in which this bodily sensations if we can

312
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,840
be with them as best we can if you feel like whoa I can't do

313
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,960
that it's just too much then be with your posture as best you can if this

314
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:56,919
just feels like whoa I can't do that do something else go outside be with

315
00:33:56,919 --> 00:34:03,120
nature talk to a friend call somebody do something like this we we don't want to

316
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:09,118
get into overwhelm but is there a way that we can just start to put our toes in the water

317
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:15,200
or our foot in the water or our lower body in the

318
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:22,158
water there's this way that to be with the physical sensations

319
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:28,679
a way there's a way to that we can trust the like the contact with the

320
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:37,280
emotion and kind of maybe trust that it knows the emotion knows how long to be

321
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:42,480
there or maybe there's this way to recognize

322
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:49,040
that emotions are a natural process we might say that they have

323
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:54,878
their own I don't know if it's makes sense to say they have their own intelligence but

324
00:34:54,879 --> 00:35:03,040
can there be a way in which we can trust that we don't have to fix it that moment

325
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:08,240
we so often want to just fix it we turn it into a big giant problem and we turn

326
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:18,000
it into a nail then we come along with our hammer and trying to hammer it but can we allow it to be there and

327
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,119
to be felt as best we can and allow it

328
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:29,520
to transform itself we are not doing the transforming we are not the one that are

329
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:38,079
making it change we're just making the space we're creating the conditions in which it will naturally do what it does

330
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:44,160
what emotions do i am not promising any particular timeline i am not promising

331
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:50,200
any miraculous cure i am promising this is a way

332
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:58,640
forward if we work with this as best we can without any particular demand that

333
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:04,920
emotions be done at a particular time or only certain emotions be

334
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:12,800
expressed there's something that happens when we meet them in this way our confidence grows and our capacity to be

335
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:19,720
with them grows and it gets easier and easier and easier and

336
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:27,400
easier the more we do this as best we can it will be

337
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:33,800
uncomfortable can that be okay can that be okay to be have some

338
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:39,280
discomfort to feel uncomfortable this is a way to have greater freedom in

339
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,880
life not only for ourselves but so that we can support and care for others not

340
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:52,880
to be afraid of their emotions this is a way in which our practice can be a benefit to the world

341
00:36:52,880 --> 00:37:00,320
maybe in some tiny way maybe in a giant way

342
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:07,400
so emotions no one can tell you how to feel them or what to do with

343
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:12,160
them but is there a way that we

344
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:20,440
can practice to find the freedom with them and learn to make the

345
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:30,119
medicine out of our emotional life for ourselves and for others

346
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:39,440
maybe I'll end just by with a simple simple thing here a lot of words I said

347
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,800
but really the physical body is really a

348
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:52,000
support for emotions we so much want to think our way through them

349
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,839
if you could think your way through them you would have done it already because how much rumination

350
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:05,440
thinking do we do about our emotions it doesn't work we have to actually experience them

351
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:13,440
in the body it turns out so with that I think I'll end and

352
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:21,440
I'll open it up to see if there are some questions or comments thank you

353
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,800
does anybody have some questions or

354
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:49,920
comments nobody is emotional about emotions this is good

355
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:55,560
maybe this felt like oh his old hat I knew all this

356
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:05,520
well Diane I'll say something thank you for your talk yes and I was thinking about outrage back in the 1980s I had

357
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:12,760
sat a retreat with um James Hillman and he talked about how people

358
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:19,599
were this this was a retreat for men how many men were um instead of having

359
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:25,440
outrage were having enrage oh so they had they saw things that they didn't

360
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:31,680
like in the world but it was all being going inside and it wasn't being

361
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:37,200
expressed as as action in the world

362
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:44,599
so that was I mean so sometimes when I hear the word outrage I always think well am I more of an outrage or an

363
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:50,880
inra or is there some skillful way to work with both of those thank you thank

364
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:57,599
you i never heard this expression enrage and I never thought about this outrage enrage has the word rage in

365
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:03,280
there thank you Jim it's fantastic in the 80s in outrage or they weren't

366
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:11,680
expressing their outrage it's always causing the inra yeah well James Hman was talking about how people would have

367
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:18,400
this energy about wanting to respond to the world but they would bring it with

368
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:24,800
them into the therapist's office and it would all get processed in the therapist's office and nothing would

369
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:30,880
happen out in the world so he was he was actually

370
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:38,000
um advocating for people to do something constructive with that energy

371
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:45,200
yeah yeah and emotions can really be a fuel for uh energy it's we might even say it's a type of energy that uh can be

372
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,160
a fuel for action in the world great thank you Jim thank

373
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:57,240
you anybody else have a comment or question

374
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:07,079
just a couple days ago I was talking to someone about this idea of outrage

375
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:14,200
and he said "My thought is we need a new bumper

376
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:22,000
sticker." And it says "Um if you weren't outraged you might

377
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,280
actually be able to do something about it." Very nice

378
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:33,000
so I don't know it was food for thought yeah yeah yeah thank

379
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,319
you yeah people are busy being outraged and they're outraged if you're not

380
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:43,359
outraged and you're Yeah yeah yeah that would be

381
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:55,440
great okay so thank you all thank you for your attention and I'm wishing you a
