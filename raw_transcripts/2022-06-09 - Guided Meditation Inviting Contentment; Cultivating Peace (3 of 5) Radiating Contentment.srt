00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,360
greetings everyone it's lovely to be here with you on this

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:18,240
dharmic path so again we'll begin our meditation by

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,279
making the conscious choice to first of all

4
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:29,519
leave all of our concerns preoccupations agendas worries

5
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,719
and responsibilities outside the door

6
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,719
of our meditation area for the duration of the sit

7
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,239
so take a moment to carefully put all your concerns in a safe place

8
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,520
on the other side of the door with the commitment to leave them there

9
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,039
during the meditation you wouldn't come back to them afterwards

10
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:03,120
no need for them now and as we have done over the last two

11
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:10,000
days we will continue to breathe in open

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,360
non-reactive receptive awareness

13
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,119
and we have a good friend who can help us with this

14
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,400
her name is sati which is the pali word for

15
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:33,840
mindfulness awareness many of you have participated in guild

16
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:41,200
series this year on the satipattana and in the final talk of the series

17
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,439
he spoke about living in awareness with sati patana

18
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:53,520
and if we can do that we know that we have a clear place

19
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,719
to abide in it's a home that we take with us

20
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:04,640
wherever we go maybe it's like

21
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:12,160
living in a messy house that has a clean living room so when messy challenges

22
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:19,920
fears desires attachments arise we know that with sati this lucid

23
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,560
awareness we have a clear place where we can abide

24
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:37,040
sati is the treasure the magic of vipassana practice

25
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,200
and we can call on her whenever we need help

26
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,000
so as we would do when sati patana practice let's begin our meditation

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,080
by bringing awareness to the fore we know that when awareness is strong

28
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,440
it opens the door to seeing when unskillful states arise

29
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,120
and then we can make the choice to not pick them up

30
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:16,000
so now bring this strong clear awareness to your posture

31
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,159
balancing and aligning the whole body

32
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,440
feel your physical and energetic connection to the earth

33
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,519
and now imagine your energetic connection to space

34
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:45,480
via the invisible thread through the small opening in the top of the head

35
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,280
sitting here between heaven and earth

36
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:03,599
now with a long deep breath invite your awareness to the experience

37
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:10,040
and sensations of the body breathing

38
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,960
breathing naturally now on the exhale relaxing

39
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,800
and letting go of the muscles of the face the eyes

40
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,840
around the eyes forehead

41
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,720
cheeks the lips the tongue

42
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,960
the jaw

43
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:08,240
and moving downwards relaxing the neck the shoulders

44
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:14,560
letting go in the arms and the hands in the torso

45
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,880
the heart center and softening the belly

46
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,520
relaxing the legs and the feet

47
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,198
breathing in lucid awareness

48
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:43,240
breathing out letting go

49
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:22,400
on the in-breath lucid awareness of this body breathing

50
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,120
and on the exhale letting go again

51
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,199
relaxing

52
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:15,279
sitting with the stillness and tranquility

53
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,560
of a mountain no matter what the weather is like

54
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,320
the mountain does not react

55
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:37,839
and as the body becomes still the mind has a quiet place to abide in

56
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,040
this is the piece of simply being

57
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:56,640
as agitation and craving are left behind we are soothed

58
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,640
nourished

59
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,560
with the body calm anchored in the earth

60
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:30,560
the mind and heart open softly becoming spacious

61
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,240
limitless and connecting to the vastness

62
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,720
of space

63
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,760
in his calm spaciousness of resting in awareness

64
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:56,040
our knots our places of holding can begin to untangle

65
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:20,759
breathing in receptive awareness

66
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:27,240
reading out calm letting go

67
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,600
the tranquility of calmly letting go

68
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,040
naturally gives way to contentment

69
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:14,000
we are in the safe space not needing anything

70
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:24,320
so now the invitation is breathing in calm receptivity

71
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:31,360
and breathing out well-being and contentment

72
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:37,519
nothing is needed we feel satisfied

73
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:43,319
by the simplicity of being here

74
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,440
breathing in [Music] calm receptivity

75
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:02,519
breathing out the well-being of contentment

76
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:26,640
if the mind becomes agitated we can be calm

77
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:33,120
about being agitated we hold ourselves kindly

78
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,640
when agitation is present but since we know that feeding our

79
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:45,280
thoughts does not bring relief we choose instead the dharmic path

80
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,720
of resting in spacious awareness

81
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,520
breathing in calm receptivity

82
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:03,240
breathing out well-being contentment

83
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:50,080
not needing anything we breathe in calm receptivity

84
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,679
now on the exhale we radiate out ease

85
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:03,278
and contentment to all beings everywhere including ourselves

86
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:08,640
and for this practice of radiating

87
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:15,840
the invitation is to bring to the corners of the mouth

88
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:22,559
the buddha's gentle half smile of contentment

89
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,080
breathing in calm receptivity

90
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:39,520
radiating out ease and contentment

91
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,919
on the exhale

92
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:10,240
as we come to the end of the sitting we bring to mind the people we will come

93
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,840
in to contact with today strangers

94
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:22,880
as well as people we know and we make the aspiration

95
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:29,760
of offering them through our own example the ease

96
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:35,039
of calm contentment one of the fruits

97
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:41,600
of cultivating a mind of peace with things as they are

98
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,720
may all beings ourselves included first of all

99
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,360
be safe

100
00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:00,398
being safe may all beings be peaceful

101
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:11,240
with safety and peace may all beings be contented

102
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:19,240
and may all beings everywhere be free

103
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:37,499
[Music]

104
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:50,199
[Music]

105
00:29:56,430 --> 00:30:00,059
[Music]

106
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:45,120
welcome everyone it's good to be here with you all

107
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:52,320
today is the third day in our theme this week of cultivating peace

108
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:59,120
and the flavor of the day in the spectrum of peace is contentment

109
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:04,640
in pali the word is sukkah which can also be translated as

110
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:11,279
happiness and i'll use these two translations interchangeably

111
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:16,720
sukha is the opposite of dukkha

112
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:24,240
and in the scheme of liberative dependent arising contentment

113
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:31,559
is born of tranquility which in turn is associated with joy

114
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:39,760
joy always contains happiness but contentment can arise in the absence

115
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:45,600
of joy this may be counterintuitive

116
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,799
but this kind of happiness can also arise

117
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:55,919
from the depth of grief when we allow

118
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:03,120
the grief to be as it is known and embraced

119
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:10,000
those of you who have heard me speak before may

120
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,640
know that i lost my youngest sister

121
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:23,200
to als motor neuron disease um i was the

122
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:30,080
uh eldest of four and she was the youngest with an eight year difference and she was my baby

123
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:35,519
and i adored her and um she grew up to be a

124
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:41,120
a wonderful wonderful wonderful person

125
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:46,240
and uh did so many good things in her life

126
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:53,440
and when she was 59 she

127
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:59,279
was diagnosed with als which is a death sentence

128
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:05,519
and it's a particularly challenging some may say cruel

129
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:13,440
illness in the sense that the body becomes progressively more and more paralyzed

130
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,679
and you know first you lose the use of your limbs and

131
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:26,480
then you can't swallow and eat so my sister got a feeding tube in her stomach

132
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:34,000
and then you can't use your hands anymore and so to be able to communicate

133
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,840
using a computer she had to learn to type with her eyes

134
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:46,159
every week for over five years there were

135
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:55,120
increasing challenges and when she got this diagnosis i was

136
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:03,200
i was just distraught it seemed so um

137
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,240
it seemed so not right why wasn't it me i'm i'm older i mean you know

138
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:15,040
she there was she was a model of kindness and generosity and

139
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:22,480
community support and she saved a rare plant species in maine

140
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:28,878
and so i was railing against the injustice

141
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:33,559
that this illness was happening to her

142
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:42,000
and a few months later i went on a

143
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,398
long retreat and um and i was still just

144
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:55,520
um this this pain was with me day and night

145
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:04,880
but um thanks to the practice and the beautiful instruction

146
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,799
the mind began to settle

147
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:17,838
and quite early on into the retreat

148
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:26,800
somehow i don't know how but i seem to dive into

149
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,240
this ocean of tears

150
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:41,200
and doing that was followed by

151
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:47,039
a feeling of happiness

152
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:53,760
and peace i had i had come to peace with the way

153
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,440
things are and i wasn't fighting against reality

154
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:05,359
anymore and so um

155
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:13,200
this was a tremendous help for me in my um uh

156
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:18,400
my desire to be uh of as much help as possible as like as i could be to her

157
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:24,480
during her five years of illness and it was essential because

158
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:31,680
when i was able to live with the reality of her suffering

159
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,800
with a calm useful mind i could bring that

160
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:44,400
to all my interactions with her and with her husband who provided her tremendous support

161
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:52,079
so um not expecting things to be different

162
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:57,119
than they are and

163
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:04,960
the mind becomes more peaceful when delusion is dispelled

164
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:12,480
and in the meditation we just practiced we

165
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:18,240
um explored how tranquility

166
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,359
can naturally give rise to the ease of contentment

167
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:29,440
our nervous system is soothed when the body becomes still

168
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:36,160
and the mind the heart can abide in the tranquility of lucid

169
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:42,640
receptive awareness many of you have participated in guild

170
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:49,359
series this year on the sachipatana and in his final talk

171
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:56,240
there he talked about living in awareness with sati patana

172
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:05,640
how knowing that we can be present in lucid awareness can make a world of difference

173
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:13,040
with strong awareness we have a peaceful abode when fears desires attachments and

174
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:19,680
challenges arise and this awareness

175
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:26,960
is a place of freedom that allows us to be present with our shortcomings

176
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:33,680
and our challenging mind states in a healthy way we see them arise

177
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:39,200
and we don't pick them up so in this

178
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:46,160
wholesome abode of strong awareness we know that there is the possibility of ease

179
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:54,799
when suffering and agitation arise we can be at ease with what is

180
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:01,240
we don't need to change reality to be okay

181
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:12,240
it's normal to want relief from agitation and the karmic samsaric path offers us a

182
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:18,480
wealth of unwholesome solutions to escape

183
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:24,480
and here again is a fork in the road we know that there is an alternative

184
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:32,320
dharmic path where we can find true relief from suffering and agitation

185
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:39,119
when we step into clear awareness we can be fully present

186
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:44,560
for whatever arises sati

187
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:49,760
mindfulness or awareness the first and most important

188
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:55,359
of the factors of awakening satya is our best friend

189
00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:01,680
on this path to awakening because

190
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:08,160
once the mind is free of obstacles and established in awareness

191
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:13,839
then gladness joy tranquility

192
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:21,520
contentment and samadhi arise without personal effort

193
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:31,119
the only effort that may be required is maintaining our mindfulness and not picking up the mental obstacles

194
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:40,560
so you may have had experiences of this when the mind is

195
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:47,119
clear and calm ordinary things become wonderful

196
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:56,000
simple things become beautiful and the mind settles more and more

197
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:00,640
and we experience this as a relief

198
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:09,280
knowing that this simple moment is enough

199
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:16,559
that we don't need anything except to be established in awareness

200
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:24,079
and then sweet easeful contentment arises from knowing

201
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:28,079
that this moment is enough

202
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,119
so i'd like to read you from

203
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:44,880
89 12 the story of king pasanati coming to visit the buddha

204
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:50,720
and the king was surprised when he arrived and he said to the buddha

205
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:59,119
here i see monastics smiling and cheerful sincerely joyful plainly delighted

206
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:05,599
their faculties fresh living at ease unruffled

207
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:10,880
subsisting on what others give abiding

208
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:16,680
with the mind free as a wild deers

209
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:26,800
and what he saw was the sangha of monks and nuns radiating contentment

210
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:34,160
and this was from the happiness that arose naturally from their practice

211
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:41,599
this kind of happiness does not depend on external conditions

212
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:47,040
it doesn't depend on getting our needs met

213
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,800
and the possibility of being content

214
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,480
may be much closer than you realize

215
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,880
by recognizing suffering and agitation directly there is the chance

216
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:12,640
to direct the attention to the alternative

217
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:19,760
of dwelling in the possibility of ease and the ease that we seek

218
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,960
comes from within

219
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:33,039
so for the next 24 hours

220
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,160
maybe you can um

221
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:46,720
practice noticing moments when

222
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:51,760
you don't really need anything except to be present

223
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:59,520
and with that calm contented presence

224
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:05,040
you can radiate that same useful contented mind
