1
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:11,120
so good day everyone and

2
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:18,160
the topic these days this week is we could call it just pleasure

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,000
but it's pleasure and and this pleasure doesn't quite work as

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,599
the opposite the pleasure and pain play so we say pleasant and unpleasant

5
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,719
but for this meditation i'd like to focus a bit on pleasure

6
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:42,000
there is the wise use of pleasure in meditation and not just as there is the wise the

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,920
growth of wisdom in regard to both pleasure and pain the pleasant and the unpleasant

8
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:57,520
but for now let's do the wisdom of pleasure in meditation

9
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,600
that let's assume that you will not become attached to

10
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,400
pleasure assume that you're not won't be chasing after pleasure or holding on clinging to the pleasure that

11
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,479
might be there let's uh start with the idea that

12
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,280
with a very relaxed open-handed way open-minded way

13
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,479
we appreciate the pleasure that's here as part of meditation

14
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:35,520
and particularly those forms of meditative pleasure that

15
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,360
make it easier for the mind to be present i think the mind is happier being

16
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,119
present for things which are pleasant than unpleasant and so if we can find things that are

17
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,159
pleasant in the meditation that's part of the meditation

18
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:59,040
that support the mind enthusiasm for being present

19
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:06,320
then it'll show up more in this present moment so as we're meditating i'll guide your a

20
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:13,120
little bit to experience pleasure and and i know that

21
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,959
some of you will have already have physical discomfort you're dealing with physical pains

22
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,520
and i'm not trying to say that you won't have those or it's wrong to have those

23
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:32,080
but it might be that even with the presence of those you can loosen up a little bit the focus

24
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:39,040
on them or concern with them just a little just enough so that you could also take in

25
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,480
that which is pleasant so you could also take in

26
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,879
to

27
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,800
so taking a

28
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,400
alert meditation posture

29
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:19,360
and if there's already some pleasure just in the posture which can be the case for people who

30
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:26,400
have been meditating for long enough that there's a kind of a visceral memory of the

31
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:33,239
goodness of the posture allow yourself to feel

32
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,319
the pleasure of the posture

33
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:46,480
and then gently maybe very gently so it's kind of

34
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,799
enjoyable take some deeper breaths just deep enough that it remains

35
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,519
enjoyable

36
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:06,000
and is there a way that you can exhale that you enjoy as well maybe almost as if uh the enjoyment of

37
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,760
ah as you exhale

38
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:23,440
and the joy of an inhale which is like a fresh breath of air filling in

39
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:32,639
the lungs it's almost like you're smelling the freshness and taking a delightful inhale

40
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,400
and a relaxing exhale

41
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,440
and then letting your breathing return to normal

42
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:54,240
and if you can now as you exhale

43
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,800
relax different parts of the body but if you can notice

44
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:10,520
any pleasantness or pleasure that comes with relaxation with a relief

45
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,479
maybe beginning with the muscles of the face

46
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,320
releasing around the eyes

47
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,240
releasing around the cheeks and the jaws

48
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,400
releasing the shoulders

49
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,360
softening the shoulders

50
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,160
softening and relaxing in the belly

51
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:43,120
and is there some way you can relax the whole body releasing any ways in which you're

52
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,560
bracing yourself against life

53
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:59,440
and appreciating the way that there is some pleasure

54
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:09,638
enjoyment in any degree of relaxation or calm there is in the body

55
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,759
and then letting the attention settle on the body breathing

56
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:57,360
familiarizing yourself with the experience of the body breathing

57
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:05,120
what moves in the body as you breathe what expands and contracts

58
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,840
what sensations are activated and appear and disappear

59
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:46,399
and then as you experience your breathing is there any pleasure

60
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:53,000
pleasantness in any of the sensations of breathing

61
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:05,720
maybe the pleasure is more on the inhale maybe it's more on the exhale

62
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:25,760
maybe it's the in the release of the chest as you exhale or the belly

63
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:34,360
maybe it's the speed and flow of the inhale

64
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:52,320
allow yourself to feel any pleasure

65
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,160
that's present in breathing even if some of the breathing is uncomfortable

66
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,759
is there any part of it that is pleasant

67
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,279
maybe the air going in down through the nostrils

68
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:22,440
maybe the subtle expansion and contraction of the back ribcage

69
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:45,560
if there's a gap between the exhale and inhale maybe the pleasure is in that pause

70
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:04,079
and if there are very simple ways you can adjust your breathing

71
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,959
adjusting it so it still feels like a natural breath

72
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:16,720
maybe adjusting by slowing the breathing down or a little bit faster

73
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:23,000
relaxing the belly and more breath belly breathing

74
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,279
maybe a momentary pause at the end of the exhale

75
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,240
where all things become still and peaceful

76
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,839
and if there's any pleasure in the breathing

77
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:07,160
be sure to feel that each time it appears stay close to the pleasure of breathing

78
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:17,120
let the thinking mind become quieter so that you can better register the

79
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:24,279
pleasantness the pleasure register it with your body

80
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:16,959
let the mind be pulled into the pleasure of breathing

81
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:24,880
pulled into whatever meditative pleasure that's occurring for you

82
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:30,320
gently allow yourself to be filled by it

83
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,519
awareness to be filled let it be a support

84
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,800
for present moment mindfulness

85
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:16,160
letting there be the kind of stillness that highlights the pleasure of

86
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,160
meditation

87
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,039
and let the pleasure of meditation

88
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:37,799
be a support for staying present

89
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:30,880
feeling whatever there is to enjoy about being physically present in your

90
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:37,360
meditation any pleasure pleasant sensations in your

91
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,278
body breathing

92
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:47,840
if you're more settled and calm in your body

93
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:54,840
maybe that is pleasant enjoyable

94
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,600
you breathe breathe with a pleasure breathe in and out with the enjoyment of

95
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:12,480
sitting here and see if there's something you can learn

96
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:19,520
about letting go by resting in the enjoyment of the

97
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,520
moment

98
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:15,679
and then it as we come to the end of the sitting

99
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:24,320
to whatever degree of enjoyment there is for you pleasure pleasantness

100
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,720
how might that

101
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:38,159
inspire you to wish pleasure enjoyment to others

102
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:45,120
that they can go through the world experiencing

103
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,880
well-being peace pleasure

104
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,440
delight happiness

105
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:02,159
maybe your own enjoyment can be something you wish others to

106
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:08,320
experience as well wouldn't it be great if everyone

107
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:14,880
could enjoy this life we would probably care for each other

108
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,840
more

109
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:39,440
may all beings be free of their afflictions and their

110
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:47,600
pains their sorrows may all beings

111
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,960
feel the pleasure and joy and happiness of life

112
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:03,120
may they be happy may all beings be safe

113
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,279
so they can enjoy this life

114
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,000
may all beings be peaceful

115
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:21,360
so the simple pleasures of a life are available

116
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:30,000
may all beings be free so they can live a life

117
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,960
that they enjoy and value and delight in

118
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:42,960
so we can live a life will we also delight and enjoy

119
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:50,720
caring for each other may all beings be happy

120
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:58,640
may all beings be safe may all beings be peaceful

121
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,440
and may all beings be free

122
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:16,800
[Music]

123
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,399
thank you

124
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,519
so

125
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:55,519
so there's this amazing quote from the

126
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:01,519
buddha after he spent his time doing ascetic practices

127
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:07,039
he went back to meditating in a way that he knew from earlier earlier in his life

128
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:13,039
where he experienced meditative joy and he said to himself that there's no

129
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:19,360
reason to be afraid of this kind of joy this kind of pleasure

130
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:24,399
and so the idea that there is joys and pleasures that we can experience that we

131
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:29,840
don't be afraid of or be hesitant to feel that actually our important part of

132
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:37,440
the practice the buddha went on to say that what he was discovering then in that pleasure and the joy

133
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:44,159
of meditation was he said this is the way to awakening this is the way to freedom

134
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:49,360
and so there is a path that opens up with

135
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:57,919
pleasure and delight joy in practice and how to find that and use that wisely

136
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:03,919
is one of the tasks that we're doing in meditation meditation is not supposed to be an

137
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:10,880
endless series of grim pains i've known people who have sat with a

138
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:17,200
lot of physical pain in meditation as i have and benefited a lot from doing so

139
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,399
i've known people who said with a lot of pain and discomfort meditation and have not

140
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:28,559
benefited from it or have benefited for a while but after a while it just it just

141
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:33,919
becomes grueling it goes on and on and some people will end up sitting with

142
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:39,519
unnecessary pain because they think they're supposed to sit in a cross-legged meditation posture

143
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:45,120
and they move to a chair and immediately they feel so much better and now they're able to kind of give

144
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:52,720
themselves over to the present moment rather than struggling with the pain of practice

145
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:59,279
but we don't want to only avoid pain and discomfort and we don't want to only pursue

146
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:05,840
pleasure and delight and the pleasant because the chances are

147
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:12,240
when we stay close to our attachments the idea is to become free

148
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:18,480
and the idea is to engage in the world of pleasure and pain in a way that is freeing for us and that

149
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:25,040
requires some wisdom like how do i find my freedom here one of my favorite quotes is the idea

150
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:30,638
that if you're only free when you when things are pleasant

151
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:36,398
you're not really free if you're only free when you're comfortable you're not really free

152
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:43,760
you need to become free in this practice when things are uncomfortable when there's also when there's pain

153
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:51,520
but uh but we don't want to it's not supposed to be stoic and we're not like just putting up with pain pain pain it's not

154
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,960
supposed to be all difficult there is a art to opening up to pleasure

155
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:04,000
and all that but part of that art is to really understand our relationship to pleasure

156
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,240
and pain i think that without putting in putting a spotlight

157
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:16,000
magnifying glass to really study what our reactivity is what our beliefs

158
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,000
are attitudes are towards pleasure and pain we probably won't find a wise way of

159
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,280
being with pleasure and pain rather we'll just kind of be driven by

160
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:33,680
maybe the lack of wisdom we have or the attachments we have or the unhealthy beliefs that are weighing

161
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:38,960
us down so to spend some time looking and seeing what do we believe

162
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:44,960
so some people believe that life is only successful if there's pleasure as soon as there's

163
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:51,599
pain or discomfort or emotional discomfort or mental discomfort it's a sign that somehow we

164
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:57,599
failed some we're not living up to that standard of a successful human being is

165
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:03,040
has um you know is wealthy and has is filled with the

166
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:08,560
joy and pleasure and and is able to navigate the life everything perfectly and fine and drifts

167
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:15,359
on a cloud and and if we can't do that then there must be something deeply wrong about who we are

168
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:21,280
but this uh this is just a delusion to believe something like that

169
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:28,160
every human life will have its share of pains and pleasure

170
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:34,000
both of them come with being human being and and so rather than having a belief that

171
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,480
has to be one way in the dharma we believe that we're practicing with whatever

172
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:46,480
comes our way and finding a wise way through it not trying to avoid it and not trying to

173
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:54,079
hold ourselves to some high standard of perfection and um

174
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:59,520
so um sometimes people who feel discomfort or pain

175
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:05,520
uh will be angry at it uh hostile even to their pain into themselves

176
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:12,880
some people get restless some people get bored very quickly some people

177
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:19,040
have a lot of ideas about who they are that they're trying to live up to or trying to avoid

178
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:26,640
and they get triggered sometimes by the by experiences of pleasure and pain um you know the ones that i'm the victim

179
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:32,000
it's happening to me and all this discomforts me me me so i'm the one who's so much of

180
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:39,520
it all about me and there's a way in which we all the discomfort discomfort of life gets drawn into our

181
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:44,560
identity or idea of who we are the idea of my history and my

182
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:50,640
and it's not necessarily wrong exactly that there's a lot of challenges in life

183
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:57,839
but that it's a magnet all the things that are difficult to the concept of me myself as the victim as the person who's

184
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:03,359
experiencing it the experiencer is

185
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:10,640
uh just makes things so much more difficult one of the exercises we do around pain

186
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:16,480
is um is to feel i mean you might try this right now if

187
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:23,280
you want just close your eyes and and see if you can look around in your body for some place where there's some

188
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:29,599
discomfort and um and probably the within reason the more

189
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:36,240
uncomfortable it is the more better for this exercise and then um

190
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:42,400
just in your mind and tell yourself that this is my pleasure my pain my pain is

191
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:48,079
this way um you know my pain is my knee my pain

192
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:53,119
is in my ankle my pain and just keep out of the word my

193
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:59,599
or i'm having pain i'm having pain and then take a deep breath and letting

194
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:06,240
go and then be aware of the pain or discomfort

195
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:14,119
and just call it pain or discomfort without the me or the eye

196
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:21,359
and perhaps there's a difference between these two ways

197
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:27,599
i don't know if in youtube like this we can i can convey this adequately but the um

198
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:32,960
but so it's not uncommon for people to start realizing after a while that if they let

199
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,320
this comfort just be discomfort without the pronouns or the i or me or

200
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:45,359
mine as part of it that uh probably some micro muscles around the pain don't contract

201
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:51,359
some of the micro emotions don't contract and get tight that the me myself and mine kind of

202
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:56,560
brings along a lot of extra baggage and to keep it so simple just pain just

203
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:02,079
pleasure and then when pain does arise also

204
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:08,960
then uh there's attitude towards them of being for against there's intentions there's agendas there's

205
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:15,200
strategies we have about how to and one of them is to get rid of it if there's pain

206
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:20,960
if there's pleasure some people don't feel safe with pleasure there's reasons why some people feel

207
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,319
distrustful of pleasure and it's going to go away or i've been burnt before

208
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:31,440
or i'll get attached if there's too much pleasure or something

209
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,560
and and so

210
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:42,480
what is the intention you have what's the attitude or the reaction to pleasure and

211
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,760
pain and one of the remarkable things that's possible to learn

212
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:54,079
is to have equanimity towards pleasure and pain to be able to turn towards it

213
00:40:54,079 --> 00:41:01,359
with mindfulness and look upon it just as you would look upon

214
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:08,000
maybe if you saw a bird maybe you can't identify the bird even but it's high up

215
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:14,240
in the sky the blue sky just moving through the sky and has a certain grace to it perhaps or

216
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:19,280
whatever you look up and you see it and and that

217
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:25,440
that bird high in the sky you don't take it to be my bird uh don't take it to be

218
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:31,440
you know that bird is probably flying you know not not flapping its wings uh just quite right it should probably

219
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:36,880
be soaring a little bit differently and you know someone needs to give it to flying instructions

220
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:42,880
and or i'm gonna tell i'm gonna try to explain to it what it needs to do we don't get involved we're trying to fix it we don't

221
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:49,680
associate it with ourselves it's just a bird flying in the sky so there's a lot of equanimity just like letting it be

222
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:56,480
in the same way you'd watch a bird fly through the sky without appropriating it in any way or

223
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:02,720
needing to do something about it so it's possible to um

224
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:07,920
to have that kind of equanimity towards pleasure and pain

225
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:13,280
and um and that's one of the these are this is a very important part of the training in

226
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:19,200
vipassana is to learn that kind of equanimity but it's not a

227
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:27,359
training than to be stoic with all pain and to be uninterested in all pleasure

228
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:34,319
the we want to be there's there's a appropriate interest both in pleasure and pain some pains we learn from

229
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:40,960
um we learn how to take care of ourselves better by paying attention to the pain and adjusting things

230
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:49,200
but pleasure um uh the pleasures of relaxation the pleasures of that uh just being

231
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:55,440
the pleasures that arise from meditation itself are a um

232
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,880
it's like a someone who's saying hey come here come closer

233
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:06,560
this is the way follow me there's a way in which meditative joy and pleasure

234
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:12,480
is a support for the practice and it's support for opening up

235
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:18,880
letting go and relaxing more fully rather than holding on to the pleasure

236
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:25,440
it is to kind of open to it feel it more so that there's a settling and opening

237
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:33,280
into the present moment and a deepening connection so the mind gets quieter and stiller

238
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:40,240
so there are so becoming wise about pleasure and pain

239
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:45,839
helps us then become also wise about pleasure wisdom about both is really helpful but

240
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:52,319
for meditation both are helpful and sooner or later in meditation you'll sit with pain sooner or later you'll see

241
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:57,760
it with pleasure and and for most of us it's sooner rather than

242
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:04,480
later and so rather than so this is part of the field of the four foundations for

243
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:10,160
awareness is to use the pleasure and pain of our experience

244
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:16,160
as a support as a as a foundation for learning to be aware

245
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:22,640
so pleasure and pain is not to be turned away from or grabbed onto but we're developing a

246
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:28,480
heightened awareness with this pleasure and pain which is part of all

247
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:34,079
experiences and as we do that we'll

248
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:38,880
start making this remarkable transition

249
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:46,800
from uh we'll talk about this tomorrow from the worldly dimension of pleasure

250
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:52,079
and pain to the spiritual dimension of it and

251
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:58,480
and that distinction i'll talk about more in detail tomorrow what that means and how it works

252
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:04,240
this is part of the four foundations of mindfulness is to make this distinction and to be able to appreciate the

253
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:11,119
difference between these two forms of pleasure and pain the worldly pleasures and pain and the spiritual ones

254
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:19,280
so that's for tomorrow and so for today i hope that you will uh try to discover

255
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:24,960
some more equanimity and spaciousness with pleasure and pain

256
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:30,880
and you might try freeing yourselves from appropriating

257
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:37,119
pleasures and pains as part of me myself and mine just pleasure just pain

258
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:42,800
and you're allowed to experience both and be at ease with both

259
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:49,599
so thank you very much and it's a pleasure to be with you this way

260
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:52,760
thank you
