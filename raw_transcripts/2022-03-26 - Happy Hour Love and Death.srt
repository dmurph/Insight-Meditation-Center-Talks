1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:06,720
so hello and welcome everyone it's lovely to be with you to feel your

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,080
presence different places in the world that we all are

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:18,080
and yet coming together in this heart space together to practice together to cultivate

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,160
to share our humanity with each other so

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,720
so for tonight's practice um

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,800
i would like to bring in a practice that is near and dear to my

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,800
heart and many of you know this already it's no news and it's a way that actually this

8
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,840
practice enlivens life enlivens the way we live

9
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:54,079
enlivens the way we love enlivens the way we interact it awakens us

10
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,120
right here and right now and that practice is the practice of

11
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:06,400
mindfulness of our mortality being aware not with fear not with trepidation but

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:13,680
yeah of course there's impermanence of course there's impermanence

13
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,240
and bringing that awareness bringing perspectives from

14
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,080
our impermanence that this life of mind this being this precious

15
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,280
being who is me is impermanent this

16
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,680
lovely being who is me with all their gifts with their

17
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,560
aspirations with their challenges with their difficulties in life oh yes this

18
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,759
being this being there's a sense of impermanence to really feel into that

19
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:55,520
sense of impermanence and let that be an opening and opening

20
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:03,680
to loving more deeply loving ourselves more deeply this being oh sweetheart yes this

21
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,039
is not forever you're not forever loving ourselves more deeply and loving

22
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:16,720
others because in the light of impermanence everything can become more precious not

23
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:24,800
less valuable not oh throw away but actually more precious more sacred

24
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:31,440
so i'd like to say that tonight's perhaps is um tonight's theme

25
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,040
maybe i would say is love and death love and death

26
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,239
enlivened loving more deeply caring more deeply

27
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:49,120
through knowing our impermanence so

28
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,040
so i'll be offering a guided meditation tonight um

29
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,720
and in many ways we can think of guided meditations and actually an act of

30
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:08,239
meditation or any act of actually being in the world is an act of perception act of

31
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:15,440
perception the way we perceive ourselves the way we perceive the world

32
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,920
this idea of perception is fundamentally important

33
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,640
and we can have perceptions that are helpful we can have perceptions that are not helpful

34
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,480
to happy towards peace happiness service for ourselves and others

35
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,680
so with the guided meditation i will offer tonight

36
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:46,640
the intention is to bring up to invite to encourage particular ways of

37
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,840
perceiving particular perceptions

38
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:59,120
particular perspectives that lead to perceptions

39
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,519
and doing this

40
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:12,239
encouraging these perceptions to arise these helpful perceptions to support us in our life in

41
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,079
our loving in our being i will guide us through

42
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,919
a say as as we often do um

43
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,520
here and happy hour with some invitations with some

44
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,720
um perspectives taking on perspectives

45
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,080
and these perspectives just to say um

46
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,000
as i will guide you will become clear in a moment as i will guide you through this practice but just to say a few

47
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,280
preparatory moments preparatory remarks and then i think what i will do is so

48
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,520
you know i will be locking the zoom room tonight because i want i don't want people to join late tonight this is a

49
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:07,280
comprehensive meditation and if you happen to drop out it'll be you won't be able to join back so you know this

50
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,720
um so with the invitations that i will make in no way

51
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:20,160
uh will is there a um an intimation that

52
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,360
they are true that you know that there is life after death there is no life

53
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:33,520
what we don't know i haven't been there to come and tell you so i don't know so so we take this on as a as exercise the

54
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,800
way you for example if you're an athlete you would imagine hitting the ball just

55
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,840
to bring up a sense of oh what is it like or when you're practicing loving

56
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:50,479
kindness you see your loved one and you see your connection to them or you see yourself

57
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:57,039
through their eyes to bring up particular perceptions so in the guided meditation at some

58
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:02,400
point i will invite you to perhaps see yourself to see yourself as oh

59
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,440
having died from the other side again not to assume there is another

60
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,520
side there maybe there may not be let's be agnostic but these are devices i'm using these

61
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:20,080
devices in this guided meditation to bring up particular perspectives okay

62
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:26,880
and particular perceptions that may support us right here right now in

63
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,639
our life right here right now okay we're good with that

64
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:39,039
yes i've set it up okay great no assumptions no not positing anything

65
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:45,280
just trying to use skillful means to open up our

66
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,080
perceptions to open up our perceptions

67
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:57,520
okay so with that i invite you to get settled and i'm

68
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,840
going to lock the room now here we go

69
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,599
okay there so so let's begin

70
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:15,960
let's land let's land in our seat

71
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,840

72
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,638

73

as always we arrive with the breath with the body [Music]

74
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,840
arriving landing

75
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:58,639
and letting go letting go of everything that has come before all the words

76
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:05,360
all the conceptions conceptualizations just dropping all of it

77
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,520
releasing no need

78
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:16,080
a beginner's mind beginner's mind

79
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:24,560
meeting this moment fresh meeting this moment fresh

80
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,599
what's arising in this moment

81
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,680
in the

82
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,560
body the breath

83
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,399
connecting with the soothing breath

84
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,800
the rhythm of the breath the sensations

85
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,560
releasing into the body

86
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,440
with each

87
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:36,519
out breath relaxing relaxing softening

88
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,720
releasing into the body here

89
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,839
releasing thoughts releasing

90
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,760
contentions entanglements

91
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,240
feeling your feet on the ground

92
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,760
your seat feeling your sit bones

93
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,199
on the cushion on the chair

94
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,079
arriving arriving

95
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,560
keep arriving every moment

96
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:50,880
and if the mind was distracted it's okay that previous moment is gone arrive

97
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,480
arrive afresh in this body in this moment here this

98
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,120
moment of aliveness

99
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,079
releasing releasing any thoughts

100
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:30,480
smilingly as if they're flying flying around you

101
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,040
not being entangled in the web

102
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:52,480
letting there be a sense of connection with the trust

103
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,399
the deep trust in your heart

104
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:12,160
sense of trust that is there even if it's hard to perhaps really connect to in this moment

105
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:22,680
in the sense of goodness trust and goodness

106
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,800
yours and others

107
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:37,240
awakening awakening goodness trusting in goodness

108
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,519
and non-harming

109
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:53,560
and kindness taking refuge

110
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,520
in benevolence your own benevolence

111
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:16,720
not causing harm the intentions for not causing harm

112
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,839
and those of others

113
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,919
and now i'd like to invite you

114
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,799
as we feel embodied feeling our bodies

115
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:04,000
the breath sense of

116
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,240
connection here now not in our head

117
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,679
but in body with the body

118
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,000
let us imagine take on try on

119
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:32,919
this perspective this perception

120
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:45,440
that you have died you are no longer living

121
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,720
i am no longer living

122
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:59,360
and for the purpose of this meditation not making any

123
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:05,840
assumptions or positing anything about life or death

124
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:13,799
but what if you take on this perception

125
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,960
of looking through our lives what has been

126
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:31,000
through the veil through the veil of the beyonds

127
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:44,600
this person who is me was me

128
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:52,480
as if you have stepped outside in a zone in an area where there is no

129
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:58,200
agency no agency

130
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:05,599
trying on the perception where you can see yourself [Music]

131
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:15,280
and you can see your loved ones but you no longer have agency anymore

132
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:21,640
in your life it's it's over

133
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:38,279
this might bring up sadness it might bring up grief

134
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,799
ah can we breathe with it

135
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:57,440
appreciating appreciating first this person who is us was us

136
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:03,679
their challenges their trials their tribulations

137
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:09,840
all the ways in which they suffered all the ways

138
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:17,080
they served they were kind

139
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:55,640
can we see ourselves from this distance as a beloved other

140
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,278
appreciating appreciating ourselves

141
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:25,760
maybe it brings up a sense of tenderness for

142
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:31,520
this being who is who is me

143
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,799
they really tried they tried their best

144
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,440
it was not easy for them

145
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:59,520
is it possible from this perspective to give our heart

146
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:06,720
to ourselves to this being who is me who was me can we give ourselves completely our

147
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:13,278
heart completely lovingly oh sweetheart

148
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,520
you thought your struggles your challenges were going to last forever

149
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,960
is there a wish for being more patient more loving

150
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:46,278
or to have been more patient more loving with this being who is ourselves

151
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:57,919
who was ourselves playing with

152
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,320
different perceptions

153
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:12,600
time was short time is short

154
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:26,240
how could have we loved how can we love support to care for this being who's

155
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,240
ourselves

156
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,278
who was ourselves

157
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:50,559
again stepping out stepping out of this frame

158
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:59,840
looking through our own eyes and looking at ourselves from a third person's perspective

159
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:09,039
through a veil [Music] of lack of agency

160
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:15,440
no longer possible perhaps

161
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:23,760
what does that bring up if we feel the opportunity is lost

162
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,880
for many can bring a sense of recognition how precious the opportunity

163
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,520
actually is

164
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,840
to light a fire

165
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,480
before action

166
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:51,480
not to take it for granted anymore

167
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:31,600
now also now let's take a moment to recognize also from this third-person perspective

168
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:37,840
stepping outside through the veil of lack of agency

169
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:46,960
looking at our loved ones at the world people we care about

170
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,320
or maybe even people we had challenges with

171
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:58,159
and maybe others in the future people

172
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,200
we don't know but

173
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:11,880
people who could have benefited from our kindness or action or service

174
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:25,919
is the heart moved from this perspective

175
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:35,679
recognizing that opportunity could be lost any moment any time

176
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:44,080
maybe from this perspective that it has been lost just bring us to more love more care for

177
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:52,240
our loved ones to give them the best the best of ourselves

178
00:31:53,440 --> 00:32:01,840
not miss any opportunity for generosity for kindness for love

179
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:10,080
because one day there will be no opportunities

180
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:15,720
it will be true someday

181
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:51,879
and stepping back stepping back into ah our first person experience

182
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,960
from our first person experience we're alive gosh

183
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,000
here i am in this body and this mind this life

184
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:43,200
i can connect with loved ones perhaps resolve

185
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:52,000
challenges with those i've had difficulty and love myself be here for this person who's me

186
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,960
care for them support them serve the world opportunity is not lost

187
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:05,120
i have agency time is short time is pressure

188
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:12,000
precious for loving deeply for serving

189
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,638
forgiving my best

190
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:26,480
offering my best my wholeheartedness my kindness

191
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:33,839

192
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:39,839
not lose any opportunity for loving for kindness

193
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:47,638
for generosity don't miss not to miss

194
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:32,800
enter the last moments of this practice opening our hearts to

195
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,839

truly recognize how precious

206
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:56,079
how sacred this opportunity

207
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:03,039
to be human this precious human birth really is

208
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:14,078
to love to wake up for the sake of ourselves and all beings everywhere

209
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,960
do not waste do not waste

210
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:28,040
may all beings be awake may all beings be free

211
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,979
[Music]

212
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:54,960
thank you all thank you for your practice

213
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,880
so the intention as i mentioned at the beginning with this guided meditation

214
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:08,960
was to bring a different perspective a sense of

215
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:17,119
a perception of love of care of

216
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:22,800
urgency that only

217
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:30,240
through mindfulness of our impermanence can be enabled so enlivening awakening

218
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:36,079
to live from that perspective instead of just taking it for granted here we go

219
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:41,280
yes yet another day etc etc

220
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,599
such profound practice this can be

221
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,839

you're still muted okay i uh

234
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:22,560
it it brought me it brings me courage to speak

235
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,160
um but this during it i just thought of

236
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:33,359
situations where i uh

237
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:40,319
often don't have good the courage to speak but it brought up for me the feeling of oh you know i i

238
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:45,760
i it brought up a feeling of courage there's one specific thing related to my

239
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,800
school and a parent a parent that it makes me feel courage

240
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:56,240
beautiful sense of courage through the sense of uprightness

241
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:02,160
uprightness and courage beautiful nice yeah thank you for that

242
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:07,520
it's lovely nancy writes sobering

243
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:15,359
reflecting on those living in the war zones where every moment brings the certainty

244
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:20,480
of uncertainty a heightened awareness yes

245
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:27,920
yeah thank you for bringing that reflection in the certainty of uncertainty

246
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:34,000
in some ways for all of us there is the certainty of

247
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,160
uncertainty we just don't live according to it we just live

248
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:45,920
as if the next moment is certain it never is it really isn't

249
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,960
breathing isn't and of course living in a war zone that's quite heightened for

250
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:57,359
clear reasons and having lived in the war zone myself when i was growing up

251
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:03,839
in iran during the iran-iraq war there is

252
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:11,760
an intensity of course to that megan says i am feeling called

253
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:18,800
to share some dharma humor that came up today on this theme one of the physicians i was working with in

254
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:25,760
palliative care said life is a sexually transmitted terminal condition

255
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,960
that many people do not realize they have oh that is funny sexually

256
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:38,000
transmitted terminal condition that's hilarious it is sexually transmitted and it's

257
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,359
terminal well yes exactly birth is terminal birth is absolutely terminal we

258
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:49,440
we all have a terminal condition you all thank you for that

259
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:56,240
somebody pointed out that i missed a comment oh yes i've missed a couple of oh my goodness i've missed a lot of lots

260
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:03,760
of comments here we go uh thank you for that um catherine says this one is hard for me i

261
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:11,200
live in constant anxiety of wasting my precious life which causes me to suffer and seek

262
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:16,240
distractions and feel disconnected then i feel guilty for

263
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:21,440
feeling anxious but it feels like if i truly contact the

264
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,800
reality of mortality versus conceptualizing it it would help

265
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:34,160
me wake up from this trance yes catherine yes absolutely it's not a

266
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:39,359
conceptualization you it's so profound what you've just

267
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:45,839
realized if we conceptualize then it becomes that you know there is terror management

268
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:53,839
theory and with um if we're afraid of our death then we actually end up wasting time but if we

269
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:59,599
actually touch into the reality of it um and and

270
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:05,280
yeah your comment is so insightful then it actually helps not waste time

271
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:10,720
not distract ourselves yeah thank you for that very insightful

272
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:16,400
another reflection uh i struggled with the third person perspective and when you mentioned

273
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,520
having no agency it dawned on me that i have and still do spend a lot of

274
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:27,760
time feeling i have no agency ah what an interesting insight to have

275
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:34,240
and actually realize that you have the feeling of no agency but actually you do have agency

276
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:40,400
so it might be helpful to really feel into what really not having agency feels

277
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:46,240
like in it's like emptying the cup of tea completely emptying the cup and then

278
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:52,640
when you bring it back it's like oh actually there is some cup there is some tea in here maybe it feels cold or

279
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:57,920
stale but there is tea in here it's not empty so thank you for that reflection

280
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:04,240
and continue to work with that um one more reflection i have been doing

281
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:09,440
five daily reflections for a while but there doesn't seem to be any urgency

282
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:14,960
even now while we contemplate mindfulness of death um

283
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:20,400
i recommend the practice of this could be my last breath

284
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,839
um that can bring up a lot of agency and this practice i just brought

285
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:32,400
up try this because you know in it take your time maybe this 30 minutes was not

286
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:38,160
long enough really maybe the we as the weekend is coming take some time to just

287
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:44,960
settle in the body and then bring up um a sense of your debt there's nothing you

288
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:51,200
can do and then from that perspective look at your life it can be so profound

289
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:58,480
um it's 6 50 we should turn to small groups scott i do see your hand

290
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:03,520
uh let i'll come back to you let's let's reserve for

291
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:10,160
the end at the end i'll come back to you so um so i like to set up the breakout

292
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:16,000
rooms it's so precious to offer each other our presence

293
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:23,119
um after after this practice so my invitation

294
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:28,240
is to um again we're speaking for our own benefit

295
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:36,560
not for each other speak from from our own experience not commenting not reflecting not managing

296
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:44,000
not serving as a facilitator just speak from your own experience close to your heart or hold silence

297
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,280
offer your kindness and we'll go around and each person will

298
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:54,960
say one nugget if you have ten just say one the next person the next person will

299
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:01,020
come back to you you go around a few times and um

300
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:06,880
[Music] let's see if there's anything else i want to say to set it up

301
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:12,000
um [Music] i think that's it

302
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:19,760
so um so i need to do something to set the rooms here hold on one sec

303
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:25,440
okay so um be kind to yourself be kind to each other

304
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:32,000
this is a where the practice meets the cushion meets

305
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,200
live human beings who just like you live and die

306
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:44,480
okay so here we go take care of yourselves take care of each other

307
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:52,880
okay welcome back everyone the rooms are closed

308
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:59,280
and pretty much done but i did promise to come back to scott so scott if your comment is still relevant you're welcome

309
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:05,520
to share it um

310
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:12,079
what came up for me during this exercise which i thought was very this exercise is very profound is regret

311
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:17,520
and the the the piece of it that

312
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:22,559
i was thinking of was about 10 years ago my wife and i were

313
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:29,520
deciding whether to have a daughter or not and i didn't want a daughter i didn't want a son i didn't want a child

314
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:35,520
my wife did and i thought about it and thought about it

315
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:41,200
and thought about it and one day i thought

316
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:49,119
when i'm about to take my last breath am i gonna look back and regret

317
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:54,800
the decision not to have a child and i decided yes i was going to regret

318
00:48:54,800 --> 00:49:01,680
it and i my wife and i decided to have a child who turned out to be a beautiful

319
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:08,559
daughter and which has turned out to be one of the most profound experiences of my life i think an exercise

320
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:14,720
that highlights regret or potential regret is

321
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:21,440
so powerful yeah yeah thank you scott thank you so much for

322
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:29,119
sharing yes so beautifully indeed indeed and i've gone through
