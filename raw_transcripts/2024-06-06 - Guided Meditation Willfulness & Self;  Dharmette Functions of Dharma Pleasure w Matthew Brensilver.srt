1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,799
welcome folks welcome to you

2
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:16,080
all um okay let's uh let's meditate

3
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:07,960
Maybe be just to examine what you started to do when you

4
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,520
started to

5
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:20,560
meditate but you think it means to begin to

6
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:37,720
meditate Maybe stop doing all the things you began

7
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,879
we can pick up certain efforts later but for now put

8
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:17,480
all of them down anything you can stop doing stop

9
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,840
doing

10
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,800
e e

11
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:05,480
it maybe feels like we have to do

12
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,360
something but uh sometimes the feeling of having to do

13
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:21,280
something to make something happen it's a certain lack of trust in

14
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:29,758
our mind so what if

15
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,120
you begin to trust your

16
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:49,960
mind begin to trust the

17
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:58,319
awareness that doesn't depend on your willfulness

18
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:30,400
just enough with the suspicion

19
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:37,599
suspicion of yourself your mind

20
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:30,599
I give you an intentional anchor and uh say to uh attend to your

21
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:36,479
breath attend to your body attend to

22
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:41,759
soundscape are beautiful

23
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:51,880
instructions but uh it gives a lot of room for a self to

24
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,120
be born

25
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,120
the self that uh takes my

26
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:15,680
instruction and orchestrates the attentional focus

27
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:07,120
so what can you trust that uh doesn't depend on

28
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,440
you the truth is whatever depends on

29
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:31,440
me not so reliable

30
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,399
e e

31
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:51,360
maybe we could say the anchor is

32
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
everywhere

33
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

34
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
e

35
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,279
e e

36
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:12,839
in a sense the uh self's job is

37
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,240
willfulness if we don't give self a

38
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:34,160
job do we need a

39
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
self

40
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
e

41
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,079
e e

42
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:46,759
the self one of my friends said is experienced as

43
00:14:55,959 --> 00:15:01,000
tension so if we do anything

44
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,399
we

45
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:23,000
relax and we trust uh awareness to find

46
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
us

47
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

48
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

49
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

50
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

51
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

52
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

53
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

54
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

55
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

56
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

57
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,559
e e

58
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:38,799
we just keep uh letting our doing

59
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:47,279
this dissolve into the openness of uh

60
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,559
awareness e

61
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:44,720
maybe the the only job we give ourselves is to

62
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,880
uh surrender Trust

63
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:11,600
your meditation practice doesn't need

64
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
you

65
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

66
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

67
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

68
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,278
e e

69
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:28,278
maybe maybe we can say self is death

70
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,559
and awareness is life

71
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:07,760
how alive may we

72
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
become

73
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,120
e

74
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,120
e

75
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,080
e for

76
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:00,039
okay so uh

77
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:08,559
this friend mentioned him before a long time uh

78
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:14,000
practitioner and um it's really it's kind of like he's

79
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:21,240
living in a Dharma talk he's just it's inspiring actually it's like just always

80
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:28,120
actively working with something in his practice and so whenever we talk it's

81
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:33,960
like he's like Midway into like a really good Dharma talk he's giving to himself

82
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:40,000
then he just starts giving it to me and um he's uh he's

83
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,240
persuasive and um I remember one conversation he was like you know we say

84
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:52,760
to everybody let go and open to anich open to uncertainty comprehend suffering

85
00:30:52,760 --> 00:31:00,039
comprehend Dua you know he said it's too much much it's just too

86
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:05,679
much we need to teach pleasure I'm in this path of pleasure

87
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:13,039
right now you know and he wasn't talking about like Hedonism exactly but the path

88
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:21,360
is indeed about a certain kind of pleasure we call happiness

89
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:26,960
peace there is um such a thing as uh the

90
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:34,000
wholesome Pleasant wholesome Pleasant the pleasure that uh leads not to more

91
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:41,559
craving but to actually to well-being to to satiety like we are

92
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:47,320
full you know craving never culminates in

93
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:52,360
satiety but in a cycle and so um I

94
00:31:52,360 --> 00:32:00,200
wanted to speak uh a little bit just about the kind of like some of the different species of Dharma pleasure but

95
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:05,880
more centrally what are the functions of Dharma pleasure what are the functions

96
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:11,200
of Dharma pleasure so the species the species of

97
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:20,360
Dharma pleasure you know many things we could you know go on forever probably but um

98
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:28,639
few that come to mind for me just the pleasure of of having a path

99
00:32:28,639 --> 00:32:36,240
that there is a path that has been walked by uh other Dharma ancestors before us

100
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:42,919
that there's a path actually a path that someone has made sense of the

101
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:49,639
intensity of The Human Condition there's a lot of pleasure just

102
00:32:49,639 --> 00:32:57,159
in that there's pleasure in having one's

103
00:32:57,159 --> 00:33:03,159
Dharma heart known understood seen not

104
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:10,080
misconstrued we call it s the the Delights of spiritual

105
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:17,399
friendship kalana there's the pleasure of uh more

106
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:24,799
closely aligning our deepest ethical intuitions with our

107
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:32,519
behavior and maybe there's always some Gap between what we know and what we can

108
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:38,679
do what we can pull off but Dharma practice brings us into deeper

109
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:47,120
alignment between our commitments and our acts and this feels very

110
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:55,440
good there is the pleasure of um of non shame non shame because we've sort of

111
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:01,840
worked through all the ways that the self constellates shame we've worked

112
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:10,919
through all the ways in which we're out of step with our values we've worked through all the things that um feel like

113
00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:18,480
they testify to something wrong with me there's the pleasure of just we we

114
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,839
can't be found out anymore you

115
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:30,040
know can't be found out it's not that there aren't different dimensions of our own

116
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:37,638
being uh but we we can't um we've sort of left no stone unturned with kind of

117
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:43,398
like this this um yeah fearless self-investigation

118
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:50,118
and wherever there's shame we a it out we air it out we

119
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:57,520
realign and there's a sense of like ah can't be found out

120
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:03,440
there's the pleasure of love all the species of love of kindness and

121
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,960
compassion and Delight Joy gratitude all these they feel so good their

122
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:14,880
pleasure their pleasure we know hatred simply does not work given the

123
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:21,040
architecture of our nervous system it it cannot work it cannot

124
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:28,359
work it's inherently painful and love is not

125
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:34,359
there's the pleasure of concentration the unified mind we say

126
00:35:34,359 --> 00:35:41,480
samadi and samade is the kind of resolution of

127
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:49,920
ambivalence the resolution of being pulled in different directions Ambi

128
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:56,200
veent and it feels so good anytime you

129
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:03,720
know in our life we've come to resolve some measure of ambivalence it feels very good not to be

130
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:09,560
split feels very good for the mind not to be split against itself for our

131
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:17,400
wanting not to be split against itself there's the pleasure of reverence

132
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:22,520
reverence just like we all need something to

133
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:28,599
rever you know and you see when people don't know what to rever don't have

134
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:33,839
something to rever they go

135
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:43,280
crazy the highest happiness the the Buddha says is uh

136
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:52,359
peace the phenomena not stimulating chitta not stimulating heart

137
00:36:53,520 --> 00:37:00,720
mind that was just a beginning kind of catalog of darn d ma species of Dharma

138
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:08,079
Pleasures okay but what what is a different question what's the function of pleasure how does pleasure function

139
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:14,839
on the path other than just feeling good and that's very

140
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:21,000
good well one function of Dharma pleasure is simply to keep us going on

141
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,400
the path if it's all grind sometimes we can stay with it for a while but it's

142
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:34,400
it's harder it's harder and so in other words

143
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:42,200
um excuse me uh faith is induced by

144
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:48,839
Pleasure this this weird way in which we we really deeply link pleasure and

145
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:55,079
progress and sometimes that's really wrong but in this case okay yeah fair

146
00:37:55,079 --> 00:38:01,680
enough that Dharma pleasure signals something this is a worthy

147
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:09,760
trajectory Dharma pleasure is um it's it's Rich it's Rich it's a satisfying

148
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:17,280
pleasure that doesn't generate more craving and there we know the pleasure

149
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:25,400
that kind of compounds the cycle of acquisitiveness getting tasting whatever

150
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:31,920
the pleasure is the partial satisfaction and partial heartbreak of

151
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:38,359
it and the kind of disappointment and then the doubling

152
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:45,960
down and the reiteration of that cycle Dharma pleasure is not like that

153
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:51,000
it um doesn't doesn't reinforce the cycles of

154
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:58,960
compulsivity and it Dharma pleasure replaces some of the other sense

155
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:05,560
Pleasures we might be busy chasing and so yeah generally speaking

156
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:12,280
like we continue to do activities that are rewarding it's like operant

157
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,839
conditioning because in the early parts of practice and early Parts might be

158
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:25,359
many years there is a lot of thawing of delusion that's painful there's a lot of

159
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:33,160
uh purification and tumult and intensity and uh there's maybe not

160
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:40,240
so much Dharma pleasure and the motivation can kind of wobble and so the pleasure sort of helps

161
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:45,319
us consolidate our motivation when it starts to kick in meditation starts to

162
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:52,400
be actively rewarding and It prepares us for deeper

163
00:39:53,720 --> 00:40:02,800
growth pain generally attracts the Mind pleasure broadens the Mind pain and

164
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:08,640
suffering it it Narrows our attentional Focus it's like it's almost inherently

165
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:14,119
suffering is inherently self-absorbing you

166
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:21,280
know they're like suffering and the rigidity of self the contraction of self

167
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:27,920
the attentional claustrophobia those are all correlated

168
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:36,000
and so um yeah this this kind of um this

169
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:44,400
pleasure is about beginning to broaden broaden the mind broaden the field of

170
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:50,880
awareness and it's it's notable that um that happiness some kind of Happiness

171
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:58,200
some kind of pleasantness some kind of pleasure precedes concentration and

172
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:03,359
Insight normally we think well I want concentration I want some AUD I want

173
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:09,359
Insight so that I can get happy but it's actually happiness that's

174
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:14,039
the precondition for those

175
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:20,000
goodnesses sometimes sometimes yeah I I for sure pain can be very good for

176
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,079
concentration there's nothing but the pain and I

177
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:33,119
spent a lot of time just like that in practice but um the Mind fatigues if

178
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:40,400
that's all if if all we ever do is see what's right in front of us you know

179
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:48,200
like that kind of focus the way pain Narrows the attentional

180
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:55,160
bandwidth and so that can be useful but we also enjoy right as humans as animals

181
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:03,440
looking out from altitude over distance right and amidst pleasure we

182
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:10,400
sort of perceive our life from a higher altitude and the vigilance that we often

183
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:15,480
live with that dissolves the landscape of the mind is more

184
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:21,920
open and there's a feeling of trust because we kind of just biologically

185
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:27,440
trust pleasure it signals there are no problems to be resolved

186
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:33,359
and so much of our Insight on this path comes out of our kind of the noticing in

187
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:39,319
the peripheral view when we're looking for for kind of

188
00:42:39,319 --> 00:42:44,760
goodness or understanding for Solutions right here right in front of

189
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:51,520
us it it can contract the mind and pleasure helps widen the field it's

190
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:57,559
almost like when I'm looking very intently right here right in front of me where's my insight where's is my

191
00:42:57,559 --> 00:43:05,200
goodness where is my concentration when I'm looking in that way there's a kind of like more rigid

192
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:12,520
model of the self and it's almost like new discoveries about who what we are new

193
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:21,480
models of what we are need to kind of sneak up on us and our narrow focus is a kind of

194
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:27,440
reiteration of self sometimes and with the broadening

195
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:35,400
of of pleasure there's sort of like we start to to learn from our peripheral

196
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:40,078
vision a lot of learning comes from

197
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:47,880
there with the deepening of pleasure uh there's more room for purification which

198
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:56,319
is still always going to be a part of our path until we're done and the path is a kind of dialectic

199
00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:02,920
of feeling good and feeling bad efficient

200
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:11,079
suffering a dialectic of feeling good and feeling bad and there's pleasure and love and

201
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:18,520
refuge and delight and Purity and then there's purification and the pleasure makes uh

202
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:24,240
more room to digest the pain the pain of our past the habits

203
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:30,680
that get us into trouble the pleasures kind of like almost like a robe that uh is Broad

204
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:36,760
enough to wrap up our pain and so

205
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:42,839

206
00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:49,040
