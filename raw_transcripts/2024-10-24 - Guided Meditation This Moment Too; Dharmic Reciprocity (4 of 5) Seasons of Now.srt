4
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:24,400
chat and just sensing in the much wider group of people practicing together in

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:32,040
silence that your chats represent and I'm imagining comments

6
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,640
about hearing that you can hear me which would be

7
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,920

[Music] perhaps taking a slower longer

13
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:45,719
breath and ATT tuning to how this body this

you taking a moment to adjust your posture take a LP of tea

16
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:11,200
and then allowing the eyes to soften perhaps

17
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:22,519
close and setting the intention to show up wholeheartedly in

18
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:31,239
this moment this time set aside

19
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,080
for your own

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:56,720
breath allowing the breathing to be natural normal

22
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:11,280

the last remaining moments of this meditation

88
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:17,600
together the invitation is to reflect back on this time these

89
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,398
moments reflecting appreciatively

90
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:33,679
acknowledging any challenges or

91
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:43,440
difficulties with compassion

92
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:51,679
trusting that this too is part of the season of

93
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:58,039
practice such difficulties can be composted

94
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:06,480
are composted by the light of awareness

95
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:15,200
mindfulness especially when kindness is

96
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,640
present then turning that kind attention

97
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,679
to

98
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:40,919
savoring harvesting up any of the good

99
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:50,398
moment Cal or Joy mindful awareness or

100
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:58,278
patience searching all the corners of the heart and mind

101
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:10,120
Gathering them together and letting them nourish you your

102
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,158
practice by appreciating

103
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:27,640
them then casting that internal gaze outwards

104
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:35,278
to your fellow practitioners here near and

105
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:41,919
far anyone who does or

106
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,398
has supported your

107
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:56,600
practice sending them a pulse of Goodwill meta

108
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,600
and then opening your

109
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:24,960
heart and sending those good wishes to the others in your life including yourself too

110
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:35,480
may they be safe

111
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:42,240
happy healthy may they be

112

114
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:07,480
through our lives to all of the lives we touch and all of the lives they

115
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:21,679

[Music]

118
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,200
thank you for your

119
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,039
practice e

120
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:52,039
so dear sa we reached the fourth talk out of

121
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:58,519
this series of five on dhic reciprocity this kind of unfolding Journey in quiry

122
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:05,080
that I'm exploring with your kind attention and your ideas

123
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:11,399
sometimes so I'm going to open right away with a

124
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:17,480
story this is a teaching story that um the Buddha has recorded of having

125
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:23,760
given once upon a time there were four brothers sons of a king

126
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:29,559
princes and over the years their father had told them about this kind of almost

127
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:35,440
mythical hardto find tree which the ancient language roughly

128
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:43,760
translates into something like a thingumy tree or a Whatchamacallit tree and um they grew

129
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:49,720
curious and decided to go find it for themselves but the way they their

130
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:56,200
schedules work I guess prins are busy The Chariot here could only take one at a time a few weeks apart or a few months

131
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:01,440
apart even so the first one travels off and

132
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:08,120
sees um is taken to this clearing and shown and shown this tree that looks

133
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:15,919
like a gigantic charred stump just blackened and there's little green specks little buds all over

134
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:22,919
it and then returns and then sometime later the second brother goes and sees

135
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:29,440
this what looks like a gigantic banion Tree on his journey

136
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:37,279
big leaves fresh and green huge canopy the third brother goes sometime

137
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:43,039
later and what he sees is this just flame of

138
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:52,000
color red and pink and um the fourth brother goes

139
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:59,399
still later and sees in that clearing strips of bar hanging down and

140
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:04,440
the tree kind of Limp weighted down with these huge

141
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:13,559
fruits so after he returned they had a discussion and one of them talked about the tree as being a blackened hulking

142
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:18,600
stump next one said oh it's a Banyon tree and the next one said oh it's like

143
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:24,679
Flame or a cooking piece of meat I find that an odd description of a tree and

144
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:30,600
then the fourth said oh it's an ACAA tree and they disagreed they got into you

145
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:36,159
know a mild argument over who was right so at some point they had a chance to

146
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:42,519
have dinner with her father and um explained the disagreement and said who's right what is this thing that

147
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:50,480
you've been telling us about the father smiles and gently chides them asks them

148
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:57,200
why are you all confused you didn't check with the charioteer as to what the tree is like

149
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,919
in other Seasons so I think that's kind of a

150
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:08,358
sweet family Story the Buddha though told this teaching story to underscore

151
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:13,839
the freeing power of different forms of meditation

152
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:19,720
different manifestations of it equally powerful

153
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:26,480
practice insightful practice useful practice can look different in different

154
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,679
seasons could be due to the different external

155
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:40,878
conditions just as the temperature and the amount of light and the season changed the trees cycle or it could be

156
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:46,480
more about an internal cycle without quite as

157
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:52,480
obvious external conditions our age Health the amount of

158
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:58,040
concentration or energy available biological processes

159
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:05,599
what's unfolding in emotional life practice during grief is different

160
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:12,839
than practice during the joy of a new baby these different internal

161
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:21,240
conditions can be honored expressed acknowledged

162
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,839
recognized so the encouragement of this story is to honor these natural seasons

163
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:35,119
Cycles rhythms regardless of season meditation

164
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:40,320
practice can be deeply helpful especially if we open to some of

165
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:48,599
the other gifts we talked about offerings we can offer our practice this week this trust whether borrowed bright

166
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:58,240
or verified wholehearted attention and respect a dedication to non-harming

167
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:06,079
this word the story and the word season are kind of Lucky fortuitous in another

168
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:12,640
way the ancient language poly has a word for meditation bavana

169
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:18,480
that translates as meditation cultivation as well though

170
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:25,720
cultivation mental cultivation internal cultivation and within each person's

171
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:33,520
process sometimes it's time to to till the soil sew the seeds develop capacity

172
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:40,640
lay the groundwork build skills of mindful awareness over and over

173
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:49,560
again other times it's definitely time to compost trust that even what stinks

174
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:57,640
could be a cause and condition for more growth later if we attend to it properly

175
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:03,160
kindly appropriately other times it's the

176
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:08,640
season of growth and this could be a slow gradual process of growth and

177
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:15,359
maturation over time or a growth SP just like that little baby is going

178
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:21,920
to have a growth spurt kindly observing with the sunlight

179
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:29,599
of awareness watering the practice watering our relationships with kind

180
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:35,000
attention that that creates the usefulness the

181
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:45,760
benefits of the practice over time and in some Seasons it's time to

182
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:51,119
harvest gather the fruits reap the benefits the

183
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:56,960
Bounty of the meditation practice whether they be benefits of insight

184
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:06,240
confidence beautiful experiences or a simple simple maturation and grounding

185
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:13,839
steiness maturity or something else in my own experience this Harvest Time often ends

186
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:20,720
up cycling right back to one of the other seasons of meditation

187
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:27,960
practice so to be gracious to recognize the moment the season the UN

188
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:33,119
folding that you're in that your practice is in in the

189
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:40,560
moment this kind of offering up of this attitude of graciousness

190
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:48,838
okayness brings much ease Joy steadiness

191
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:58,000
Simplicity all of that can come from flowing with the season of The Practice

192
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:04,200
can be a real gift season also or timeliness also

193
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:10,560
applies to ATT tuning to the amount of effort or Acuity that's possible or

194
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:17,319
helpful on a certain day during a certain retreat in a meditation

195
00:39:17,319 --> 00:39:22,599
session or over longer cycles of time months or

196
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:28,720
years it also applies within a single moment

197
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:37,200
it's so helpful not to assume but rather to attune to what

198
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:43,079
is humbling forward into the future or looking back in the past comparing not

199
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:51,200
so useful and if you do it we all do it sometimes kindly recognizing it and

200
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:58,760
recognizing okay this too this is this moment that help

201
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:06,680
disengage from these potential blockages to the practice in other words attending

202
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:14,960
precisely to this experience this moment this now and letting go into

203
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:22,119
it is an art and the purpose for the purpose of

204
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:28,760
mindfulness meditation the immediate process letting go to now is helpful

205
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:37,319
because the only time we have is now it's the only present moment you

206
00:40:37,319 --> 00:40:43,480
get one moment at a time the sense of timeliness and

207
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:49,640
Precision in the practice connecting sustaining honestly with the fullness of

208
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:55,200
the moment of each moment can open

209
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:03,119
into a potent kind of timelessness flow of the Dharma of

210
00:41:04,359 --> 00:41:09,880
meditation and this can be a beautiful experience and very

211
00:41:11,319 --> 00:41:17,160
nourishing mindfulness of this larger scale of time unfolding of seasons is

212
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:22,920
incredibly helpful when contemplating afterwards as I guide us to at the end

213
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:30,920
of each of these meditation sessions it can also be helpful beforehand in developing a broader sense

214
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:40,400
of context before entering a meditation session or a longer formal period of

215
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:46,920
practice and then I probably don't need to tell you that all of this applies to

216
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:52,839
relationships timing and relationships reconnecting with them

217
00:41:52,839 --> 00:41:58,720
recognizing when it's time to reach out when it's time to support when it's time to give

218
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:04,319
space all of this applies to relating to

219
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:11,040
others every bit as much as it applies to relating to ourselves and our

220
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:18,680
practice as we've been exploring all week these relational and internal

221
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:24,640
applications kind of mirror each other and flow into each other they affect each

222
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:34,559
other timing of whener respond when to speak when to stand up or step

223
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:42,520
back all of these are dimensions of wisdom too as I was contemplating this morning

224
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:49,280
this talk I was considering how a sense of timing and wisdom are so

225
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:58,720
closely interrelated being able to settle back and choose when or graciously be with

226
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:04,839
this moment when as naruna says I'm on the side of

227
00:43:04,839 --> 00:43:10,920
those who side with reality because reality always

228
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:17,599
wins and that doesn't mean we can't be involved or or or impact or influence

229
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:24,480
what's unfolding but rather is an encouragement to have a deeper

230
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:30,599
understanding of the larger flow of cause and effect as it unfolds over

231
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:37,440
time conditionality and offering with a sense

232
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:43,960
of that the seasons the larger ecology that's part of what we'll

233
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:52,000
explore tomorrow so thank you for your kind

234
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:58,480
attention and your assignment for tomorrow should you choose to accept it

235
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:04,119
is to notice how you relate to timing and the

236
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:11,920
seasons in your life the season of this Autumn if you're on this part of the planet between now and

237
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:18,160
tomorrow and you're welcome to add thoughts about that in the chat or to

238
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:23,440
reflect on them silently in this moment as

239
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:29,040
well so thank you all be well

240
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,599
be with you tomorrow
