1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:07,720
good morning so um yeah

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:13,759
so this being this closest Sunday to Earth Day I thought it would be a good

3
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:20,240
day to celebrate it with a uh Earth talk day uh talk Earth Day talk

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:27,199
and um this is very kind of a topic that's very dear to me because of what I

5
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,480
feel is a very intimate and close connection to the earth to the natural

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:41,200
world that I kind of grew up with and continued to be part of in different parts of my life that it seems that um

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,239
who I am as a person is almost inseparable from what the earth is what

8
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:53,280
the natural world is and the representative Um this little story that I like for

9
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,280
that is when I was uh going to college at um Central Valley in California in

10
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,320
town of Davis uh they had some magnificent oak trees

11
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:12,880
in the courtyards of the campus uh old massive majestic oak trees and um

12
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:19,840
somehow they had survived from being cutting cutting down and I think there was a time when these massive great

13
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,759
majestic oak trees were spread out across the valley uh the earliest

14
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:32,960
records of Europeans coming to the peninsula which was uh Admiral Vancouver

15
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,600
in something like 1780 or something no yeah i think something like that uh he

16
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,799
describes that there was like an English park along from here right lit l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l literally where we are with massive oak trees and

17
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,960
I think he came in the springs grasslands and and so in Davis on the campus they

18
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,360
have uh some of these big oak trees and I was studying botany I took a bot

19
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:05,280
class and uh in the beginning of that quarter they talked about the cycle

20
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,039
of oxygen and carbon dioxide and how it you We breathe out carbon dioxide the

21
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:17,520
the the trees breathe that in and convert it through to oxygen and that

22
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,480
the oxygen that we breathe is uh coming from the plants around us and

23
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:29,160
um and uh so I was quite absorbed in this whole can the

24
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:36,480
biochemical description of how this works on the big blackboard in the very big campus hall and so I got probably

25
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:45,440
got somewhat you know absorbed in that topic and mind got kind of quiet and uh the

26
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,319
class was over and I walked out and I was came into the courtyard

27
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:58,000
stunned as I stood there i kind of froze in my tracks and looked at uh these

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
majestic oak trees and the thoughts that went through my mind was I need these

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,640
trees to produce oxygen for me the plants not just the trees of course but

30
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,080
um more than I need both my kidneys more there's parts of my body I don't need as

31
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:24,560
much as some kind of thing outside of me that's producing the oxygen and um and so I had this question

32
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,840
where do I start where do where do I end where

33
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,920
does a tree start where does a tree end i mean where where who are we uh if I

34
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,440
need the tree more than I need my left hand kid left kidney or something where

35
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:50,000
do I begin where do I end what is this connection and and I remember my mind got so still and quiet and feeling of a

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,080
kind of vast kind of sacred uh space just being with this these

37
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:05,200
massive oak trees and um the uh now this is the third year I'm

38
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:12,200
going to do a pilgrimage uh in Marin County it's a walking pilgrimage tonight this time about 5 six

39
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:21,280
days we're going to leave the Spirit Rock Meditation Center and walk over the Marin Headlands over Mount Tam um and uh

40
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:28,639
some of the places we go uh have um have old growth forests old old

41
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:34,479
growth redwood forests and maybe you've been there we go to Mir Mir Woods early

42
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:42,280
in the morning before everyone comes and it's uh very very quiet there and peaceful and these trees are

43
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:48,960
magnificent and uh for me maybe for a fair amount of people get quiet being

44
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,240
there in those groves and in fact one of the groves is called a cathedral grove

45
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:01,280
so the sense of the sacredness the specialness of it and the reverence that's there and there's a kind of maybe

46
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:09,360
a kind of healthy humility that comes with being a human being in the presence of these massive ancient trees some of

47
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,320
them probably easily a thousand years old if not more and

48
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:20,880
um and um and it kind of for me it changes my

49
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:27,680
relationship with all these places of me and the world i feel like now I feel like I'm in a reverent relationship to

50
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,720
the natural world to the world i feel like uh I feel I don't feel like I'm

51
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:39,840
dominating someone who's going to dominate the world i feel I'm a small little member of this family of life on

52
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,880
this planet uh and feel a kind of uh I feel more alive in this humil

53
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,320
humbleness or reverence in the relationship to these groves than I do

54
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,479
uh watching Netflix surfing the web or something

55
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:06,560
working on my computer and um and uh and I' I've reflected one of these pilgrimages about

56
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:13,280
um the native people of that area when this there were a time before they were

57
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:20,759
logged things were cut down uh freeways put in that uh I think there were many

58
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:27,520
places that uh had this massive trees and redwoods and you know you walk along

59
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:34,840
the coast there it's spectacular the the marine coastline and

60
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:41,280
um and uh I'm sure that there was plenty of situations where there was a very

61
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:49,600
different relationship for who we are in relationship to the natural world by having it that way imagine I I've

62
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:56,080
imagined myself here on the peninsula before there were any uh of

63
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:03,680
these square buildings that uh we have here now and

64
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,960
what it would be what it would have been like walking 300 years ago 400 years ago

65
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:15,759
here in the peninsula and uh with these great massive oak trees there was one on

66
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:21,680
Pulgus one of the streets here nearby a massive old one and when the city

67
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:28,160
decided it it needed to be cut down because it was it was in danger of falling

68
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:34,720
um and it was relatively close to a school and you know falling on cars or whatever uh there was all these people

69
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,639
protested and they tried to stop it but they no success and uh so then they did

70
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:47,280
the uh the ceremony around the tree and all the see all these kids stuff that they put kids local neighborhood kids

71
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:54,560
came and kind of honored the tree and said goodbye to it and so this way in which our

72
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,759
relationship to the natural world can shift and change depending how we're in

73
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:06,639
touch with it what we live in it in it um and uh and how we participate in it

74
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:14,800
so this pilgrimage that we do it changes my relationship to the land by spending five days walking across it and um and

75
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:21,080
we walk usually in the morning in silence uh we do some ceremony as we go

76
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:26,840
along and um the um

77
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:36,760
um so the sense of be this greater humility um and then for me a kind of a

78
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:44,159
renewed promise I make to try to walk on this world gently try to walk on this

79
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:52,120
world without having such a big impact on it the Buddha when he was

80
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,920
enlightened before he was enlightened um and we have in the statue we have the

81
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,760
statue depicts the moment if you see his uh right hand drapes over his knee and

82
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,880
it's him reaching forward to touch the earth and uh the

83
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,920
the as was the custom back then but in what had now for me becomes a

84
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:21,680
phenomenally powerful symbolic value the Buddha uh

85
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:29,360
the stories say was born under a tree outdoors he was enlightened outdoors

86
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:37,040
under a tree his first teachings were done outdoors under a tree he died

87
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:43,360
outdoors laying on the ground between two trees they say the trees were flowering so it was kind of a special

88
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,040
time and uh and on the on the night of his

89
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,680
awakening um they say that this kind of

90
00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:00,080
particular evil trickster kind of character showed up called Mara to try

91
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:07,120
to prevent him from becoming enlightened and uh and and came to him and said you

92
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:14,959
don't deserve to be enlightened who do you think you are to do that i mean isn't this you know you know you you're

93
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:22,720
not worthy of this and um and so the Buddha did didn't reply directly exactly but what he did

94
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:29,760
was he uh he put his hand and touched at the earth the earth touching gesture and

95
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:37,839
called upon the earth to be his witness for his right to be awakened to be free

96
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:46,880
to be free now no longer caught in the in the traps that Mara the tempter uh uh

97
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,800
was setting up to trap him in and uh the primary thing that Mara how traps people

98
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:59,000
is with sensual desires occasionally probably you've been caught by

99
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:07,040
that and so the you know so he so but and and he the last thing Mara wants is

100
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,880
someone who escapes his his realm of sensual desire so he

101
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:20,440
really wanted to stop the Buddha and so the Buddha touched the earth and they they say the earth then had uh

102
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:27,040
shook bearing witness of all the compassionate things the Buddha had done

103
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,720
through his many lifetimes all his practices he done that yes he was worthy

104
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,000
of it and um and I love this that uh we

105
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,839
call on nature for to witness we call on the earth um to be our

106
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:50,480
witness so if you're meditating or if you're walking on the earth what does

107
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:57,040
the earth what what can the earth earth be a witness for you what does the earth

108
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:03,079
say about you what is it there to show you about

109
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:08,440
yourself and uh and I'll leave that question now for now to hanging

110
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,880
there um the

111
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:21,120
um um but one of the things is that

112
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:27,360
um we live on the earth and it's so easy to forget it

113
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,800
we live with the earth and in the case of the Buddha touching the earth it was

114
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,560
rep they had this idea that there was the earth goddess so mother earth some people like

115
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:46,000
to say historically they nowadays may be the parent earth but this kind of parental the source of life that the

116
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,360
earth has been for all of us and um it wasn't so many years

117
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,680
ago in the scale of time that apparently there was no life

118
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:05,320
on this earth there's been more period of time with no life on this earth than there has been life on this earth

119
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,800
so

120
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:18,160
um and then if we think about how long humans have been on this earth it's much

121
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:26,160
shorter period of time and I've read I don't know I don't know the latest research on this but uh I read some time

122
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,440
ago some idea when they do genetic testings of human beings and now they

123
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:38,279
can kind of look back in time through the genetic evidence that

124
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:44,320
survives they think that all humans are descended from a small group of people

125
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,480
tribe there were probably just a few hundred large somewhere on the plains of

126
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:55,360
Africa at some time a few thousand 100 thousand years

127
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:02,279
ago or something and I love this idea that we have we all have common

128
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:09,680
ancestors it makes us all kin it makes us all family and to call on that that we're

129
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,720
all family in some ways we all have shared ancestors if we could trace it

130
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:21,720
back we would be able to all walk up maybe to the same little group of people and say

131
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:28,680
"Hi I'm the result of what you started thank

132
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:36,279
you for my life." And we'd all kind of be gathering around the same group of people to thank them

133
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:41,680
maybe there's a story that's told in the Jatica tales that also goes back many

134
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:47,519
many millennia thousands hundred thousand millions of years billions of years

135
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:54,160
uh which tells stories of the Buddha in his previous life before he was the Buddha and some of these are like uh

136
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:02,240
Asop's fables and the fable here is that of the the Buddha was a um deer he was

137
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:09,040
the king of a of a herd of deer very large herd of deer and he was called the

138
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,240
banyan uh king the banyan deer banyan

139
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,680
being the buddhi tree and um and the story goes that

140
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:26,240
there was a new king in the land and this king loved to hunt and so he took a

141
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:32,600
um the royal forest very large forest that had lots and lots of her herds of

142
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:39,199
deer and uh he put a large fence around all of it to keep them all there and

143
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:44,320
then once a day he wanted to go hunting he wanted to kill one one deer a day so

144
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,880
he could have food and so he can kind of enjoy his sport of

145
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:56,240
hunting but his hunting that way uh he would come with his entourage and

146
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,759
soldiers and elephants and it was a big to-do when he came hunting and the deer

147
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,880
would get afraid and they would start rushing often all this way and that way

148
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:12,160
to get away but they were trapped inside this large area and so that made them

149
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:18,079
panic even more and so he was successful in you know killing one deer a day but a

150
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:23,120
lot of deer got injured in the process us they would trip over each other trip

151
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,480
over logs they you know those who had antlers would run into people others you

152
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,759
know stab them and things so it was kind of a mess and so one day the king of the

153
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:40,160
banyan after the the king had hunted one of the deer went up to the king and said

154
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:47,279
"Excuse me sir uh you have to realize what you're doing here you're injuring a lot of the

155
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:54,800
deer you're harming them there more are dying than need to die because the way you're doing this hunting and I'm here

156
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:02,320
to ask you to please try to to do an act of harm reduction and um he wasn't asking him to

157
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:08,438
not kill because maybe that was asking too much but uh

158
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:15,520
as intermediate was to ask for harm reduction and the harm reduction was um

159
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,959
we will provide you with uh we'll have a lot we'll have uh what was it called um

160
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,640
we'll we'll we'll choose someone to have a lottery or what call you know where um

161
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,760
not a lottery but what do you call when you pull pull uh straw

162
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:39,360
and what choose letter choosing lots yeah yeah anybody see who

163
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:45,679
you know would has to uh present themselves to the king to be killed every day and that'll create uh won't

164
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:52,400
create all this other harm the people running and trying to chase the runaway and so that's what they did and

165
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,760
these uh you know compassionate deer who wanted to

166
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:04,640
prevent uh so much harm being done were willing to sacrifice their lives to for the greater good in a sense

167
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:13,080
then one day uh it came upon a pregnant dough to be the one to offer herself her

168
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:21,400
sacrifice but she was pregnant so she went to the king and said "Please can I not do it until after my dough is

169
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:27,600
born." And uh but the king said "Well I can't really ask someone else to do it

170
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:33,360
in yourstead but uh don't worry don't you don't have to do it." And so the

171
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,400
when the when the king came to hunt that day the king offered

172
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:45,559
himself as in order to save the the dough and the

173
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:53,679
pregnant child and uh but the king uh that the deer the king deer was kind of

174
00:18:53,679 --> 00:19:02,760
very majestic very you know had a strong presence and stood there in all his

175
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:09,600
dignity ready to be killed but this got the king's attention

176
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,799
and the king said "I can't kill another king you know in this kind

177
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:21,039
of majesty." And so he said "What are you doing here?" Right and u and the

178
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:26,080
deer said to the king the story about the the pregnant dough and that he was

179
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:33,880
taking her place so to save the dough and the child and the king was so moved by the

180
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:40,880
compassion the care and the sacrifice that the deer king was willing to make

181
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,480
that he was this changed his heart dramatically and he said "Okay from now

182
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:55,039
on I'm going to stop killing any of the deer." And the king deer said "Dear king

183
00:19:55,039 --> 00:20:00,120
that's not enough can you make a vow not to kill any

184
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:06,480
animals and the king said yes so in that realm from then on no animals were ever

185
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:14,399
killed so it's a fable and um the

186
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:21,880
um and it said or I'll say that when the moment the

187
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:27,520
king said promised yes he would no longer kill any animals that's when the

188
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:34,000
forest started to heal itself we've harmed so many places in

189
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,880
our world in the natural world when are they going to heal some of them maybe never will

190
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:46,799
heal i was uh when I was in high school I went to hear a talk by Richard Leaky

191
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:54,240
some of you might remember him uh he was one of the first not first but a really important anthropologist of ancient

192
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:02,559
humans and I think he was the found was found at the time remains of the oldest human uh in Africa the skull of an

193
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:07,840
oldest human and so that was a big deal so he knew a lot about you know how

194
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:14,400
evolution and you know and he in this big auditorium explained that what he

195
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:21,320
had seen is that a species that oversp

196
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:28,200
specialcialize die out and he used the example of some like great uh like um

197
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,520
um what do they call those um those elephants with big tusks that no longer

198
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:39,919
mammoth woolly mammoths they apparently they their tusks got so big they couldn't function very well anymore

199
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:45,360
defend themselves very well and so um then they were easy to hunt and so they

200
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:52,720
died out because they over specialized this big so he was saying that back this was 1960s late60s that if we over

201
00:21:52,720 --> 00:22:00,320
specialized as humans that we were going to have the same fate but in some ways we already have we've had civilizations

202
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:06,880
come and go over the millennia and I saw some of that uh growing up in Europe i

203
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,080
grew up a little one of the places I grew up was in the Adriatic coast and um

204
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:19,240
and in you know my eyes there were some really beautiful islands that uh we would visit and go vacation

205
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:25,840
on uh we would go sailing sometimes along these islands and part of their

206
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:32,400
beauty was their starkness uh of just being rock just these but

207
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,480
they weren't always just rock they were had been a time when they were filled

208
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,159
with olive and grape orchards and uh you could still find

209
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:52,000
back then in the 60s if we went diving into the water uh in these little bays you could find um uh clay vases that had

210
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:59,039
fallen over the boats and and uh find a lot of pottery shards left over from that time and when they came the ships

211
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:05,720
came the Roman ships came to get the olives and the grapes or the grape juice whatever they made

212
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:13,400
wine and uh and then they overfarmed and uh all the soil washed

213
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:19,919
away and the islands can no longer uh bear a lot of vegetation because all the

214
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:27,080
soil walked away and so the people who were surviving and lived off the land had to move because they could no longer

215
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:34,799
survive and that's happened to whole civilizations in Mesopotamia where they over farmed overused the water and then

216
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:41,600
um um you know the civilization collapsed so it's what Richard Leaky said if you over specialize do too much

217
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:49,919
things collapse and um I grew up partly also in Los Angeles in the 60s and uh I remember

218
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:56,080
still very well the amazing amount of smog that LA used to have back then and

219
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:04,880
we would get sore throats just by breathing the air back then and uh runny eyes and remember

220
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:10,080
sometimes flying back to Los Angeles from being in Europe and going out of

221
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:16,520
the airplane and the smell of this thick smog was quite

222
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:21,880
something and um and

223
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:28,480
uh the direction it was going i don't know if anybody would have survived in Los Angeles but that's one of the good

224
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,600
relatively good stories of uh of cleaning the air and um the catalyst

225
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,520
catalytic converters all kinds of things happened that cleaned up the air enough so it's not as bad as it used to be i

226
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:45,559
don't think people get sore throats anymore in LA from the smug

227
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:51,760
so um what kind of harm reduction do we we

228
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:59,200
do we in do we do can we do are we the king who goes around killing the

229
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,880
metaphoric deer by how we live in our lives how much dies how much is killed

230
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:11,120
how much is killed uh and destroyed inadvertently by the lifestyles that we

231
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:17,440
have and how many you know there's a spill over what's the equivalent of of

232
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:23,520
uh the king hunting and um and then the secondary effect of all the other deer

233
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:29,960
dying what happens to us what do we do here what are we

234
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:41,000
destroying the um so one of the uh kind of dramatic

235
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:48,480
I think very clear teachings of the Buddha is that he distinguished between

236
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:55,919
the natural world and he didn't use this word but the synthetic world world he

237
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,960
made a very strong distinction between the natural world and the humanly

238
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,720
constructed world uh what we can build and make and think

239
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,760
that doesn't exist in the natural world itself it's not natural in the sense

240
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:18,480
that um uh it doesn't not produced by the natural world and it doesn't have

241
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,720
the na doesn't participate in the natural process of regeneration of

242
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:29,760
self-healing doesn't selfreplication and um and I saw that

243
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:35,840
when I went to spirit rock last week a little bit representing of it for me was

244
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:41,919
uh so great to be at spirit rock this meditation center in Marin County It's designed to be outdoors between

245
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:47,760
anytime you go between different buildings there and uh you really feel like you're part of on the land in a

246
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,520
nice way and uh I've been there going there for over 35 years now be even

247
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:59,360
before there were any buildings there and in about

248
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:06,000
1993 the person who started IMC before I got involved in IMC a man named Howard

249
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,159
Noodleman who started it him and his wife Ingred in

250
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:17,960
1986 in Menllo Park and then when I got here was had moved to Palo

251
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:24,320
Alto uh he died and so to and he had been president of the Spirit Rock board

252
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:30,960
and so when he died we we went and bought uh three oak trees and planted

253
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:37,200
them uh near Sir Francis Boulevard as you go into Spirit Rock uh in his honor

254
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,840
well those three trees are still there and they're just look like they're more grand every year I go to Spirit Rock

255
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:50,360
they're growing developing and and now they've been you know over 30 years they've been growing

256
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:56,399
there in 1998 they opened the medit the big

257
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:03,919
residential meditation home which uh you know 27 years ago was

258
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,480
shiny new i remember what it was like i was like "Wow

259
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:14,960
this time when I was there I looked around wow it's aging it's beginning to

260
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,799
rot the wood in the side of the building and rust here and there and you know

261
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:26,399
this is not going to this is not going to last so well for another 27 years but

262
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,840
those trees are doing just great

263
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:39,039
we build things that uh that don't exist in the natural world and not don't participate

264
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:44,720
in the natural process of life because they don't replicate they don't reproduce they don't they're not and

265
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,640
some of those things that we create that are not natural the synthetic things uh

266
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:57,440
cause a lot of harm and so now we have all these microplastics that are we're finding

267
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:04,159
deeply embedded in um you know in our body in our brain that end up and I

268
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:10,559
think I read this last couple of days that they're finding something microp in the fallopial tubes it's not going to be

269
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:16,520
long before we find microplastics in the embryos is that what we want to have in our

270
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:21,760
life and um so we have to be very careful about the synthetic world that

271
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:28,960
we're creating and for forever chemicals so the Buddha had this he

272
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:35,200
didn't know about all the things that we create synthetically now but he made a made a very clear distinction between

273
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:42,080
what's constructed and in his mind it was really the things we construct in the mind that don't exist in the natural

274
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,840
world a lot of the concepts ideas and that we live in ideas about me myself

275
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:52,880
and mine uh greed hate and delusion um

276
00:29:52,880 --> 00:30:00,440
that we construct on that these constructions these ideas these worlds that we move into that we our fantasies

277
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:07,520
create can create so much harm and um and the Buddha wanted to

278
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:13,840
kept pointing us back to the natural world in ourselves and he used metaphors

279
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:19,440
of the natural world outside to as a representation of how the natural world

280
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:25,520
works so we can find it in ourselves and uh and I think the most

281
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:31,520
dramatic uh use of this kinds of metaphors that uh using part of the

282
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:39,200
natural world that's in us to represent the natural world that's in us you know in terms of spiritual practice in life

283
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:46,880
was um he referred to something which uh um something profound within us that

284
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:53,520
arises from something that he called the yo the yoni yoni is the source of life

285
00:30:53,520 --> 00:31:00,080
for humans it means the womb the the profound attention profound

286
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:05,440
contemplation the profound engagement with life that's womblike coming from

287
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:11,760
this deep place within it's a generative place the Buddha talked about spiritual life is a

288
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:19,279
life we're growing and um and I want to

289
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:25,919
um say something i've said that a few times

290
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:31,399
um we um

291
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:39,600
uh in in uh English Buddhism we use the word practice a lot to describe what we

292
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:46,880
do we practice meditation for example and a lot of people who practice meditation so the common question in the

293
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:53,200
Buddhist circles in the west is what is your practice and then people usually reply

294
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:59,279
with a technique i practice mindfulness i practice loving kindness i practice

295
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:04,799
zen i practice this and that um and that's nice but it's usually describing

296
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:11,120
it by technique the ancient from the time of the Buddha the equivalent word to the

297
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:17,440
word practice that kind of fits in the same kind of context um that word um

298
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:24,640
what it it means is um uh to grow to cultivate to develop something

299
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:30,240
but it can mean to grow so what happens if you were asked not what you pra what

300
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:37,480
are you practicing but instead you're asked what are you growing what would you answer

301
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:43,919
then if you say what you're practicing I think there's easy to say well I'm practicing something else you're

302
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:49,559
practicing that I'm practicing this and I'm practicing the better thing but what are you

303
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:57,519
growing now we're talking about the natural world within and uh and something we all have

304
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:04,679
we all have inner growth we all have this natural world inside that can grow we all are

305
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:10,200
nature it's hard to imagine that they'll ever have a human being who's not born in a

306
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:16,080
womb will they ever be able to incubate or gestate a in a lab a human being is

307
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:22,559
that possible i hope not it's amazing what's what our natural

308
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:28,559
world is like that which is in it within us the natural world within us that can

309
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:33,919
think that can feel that can heal to some degree that can replicate all kinds

310
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:41,320
of things that arose out of this earth came from this

311
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:48,760
earth that is part of the earth's natural processes we're sharing this in a profound

312
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:57,240
way that makes us kin makes us family with all life on this planet

313
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:04,398
um that uh it's not just

314
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:12,358
like you know the earth is all the things we see in the natural world are not just

315
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:18,520
decoration for our pleasure it's participating it's a

316
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:23,839
participatory natural world that we participate in it participates in us it

317
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:30,398
provides us with oxygen it provides us with food provides us with so much in order to be able to alive we need the

318
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:35,919
natural world and we then our naturalenness has

319
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:41,040
a chance to grow and and for the Buddha we have to t

320
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:48,878
we're learning to tap into to support to generate to care for to preserve the

321
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:55,079
natural world in ourselves so we don't get caught up in the constructed synthetic

322
00:34:55,079 --> 00:35:01,880
world that uh humans have been very clever in creating over these last

323
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:08,280
centuries the the Buddha also saw the constructed world of ideas of

324
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:13,839
self and um ideas of status ideas of

325
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:21,040
dominance ideas of right and wrong and good and bad that

326
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:28,839
there is they're causing so much harm in this world

327
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:34,440
um so the idea we're all kin we all belong to this

328
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:41,280
world and um and what

329
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:47,320
the and what the redwood trees remember what the deer

330
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:55,359
remember we're just we need to re-reme remember re-remember reconnect to that

331
00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:03,680
how much we're part of this natural world how the earth cares for us and if the earth cares for us

332
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:09,560
shouldn't we care for it should we can we walk on this world

333
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:15,320
lightly and what would that look like at least in terms of harm

334
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:20,800
reduction the idea of stopping causing harm might not be natural

335
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:27,200
just as I saw a um there's a at Spirit Rock last week

336
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:33,280
there's a a white egret has kind of taken up residence at Spirit Rock and

337
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:39,760
now it doesn't seem to be very afraid of people you can't get too close but you can get 10 feet away from it and it's

338
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:46,240
been there for about a year and so it's kind of cool to see this white secret they named it

339
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:52,760
pole and um but one day I was standing 10 ft away and it was doing what it does

340
00:36:52,760 --> 00:37:00,079
and and uh suddenly it just kind of snapped at the ground and in its in its

341
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:07,599
bill was a lizard that had it caught and I was told there's very few lizards around Spirit Rock right now because of

342
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:13,280
this this one egret and on one hand at first I thought

343
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:20,078
"Wow this is like an amazing natural thing to watch." But then I thought about the

344
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:27,680
lizard and I felt for the lizard but you know some of that it's not going to stop

345
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:34,440
that's going to continue but can we at least do harm harm reduction for ourselves

346
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:40,200
um so we don't hold ourselves above nature that we are

347
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:47,359
nature may we be like the king of the deer may our compassion spread out into

348
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:55,880
the world so that we everyone is cared for everyone's respected and valued

349
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:04,560
may we have forests that are sanctuaries cathedrals sacred places

350
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:10,800
that we go there to to remember who we are in some deep way that we can't

351
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:16,119
remember so well so easily on the freeways in the Bay

352
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:21,000
Area in rush hour traffic

353
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:34,280
and perhaps this earth is not something to be saved maybe it's something to come home

354
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:40,720
to and if we come home to it and live with it as our home then maybe it will

355
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,040
save us

356
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:52,960
the natural process of this natural world the regeneration the self-healing

357
00:38:52,960 --> 00:39:00,760
of the natural world has the ability to heal us save

358
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:07,640
us if we allow it to if we connect to it in such a

359
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:16,079
way and the earth I think will always continue maybe you know life as we know

360
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,040
it will be radically different maybe the human race will

361
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:29,599
disappear but for a long you know the earth will be here life will probably be here in some

362
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:36,079
form or other so we're capable

363
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:43,119
but it looks like we're we know now and since the 20th century that we're quite capable of destroying this world as we

364
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:48,440
know it and if we do that we destroy

365
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:56,320
ourselves but if we say but if we come home to this world and touch the earth let the earth be the

366
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:01,440
witness to our own naturalness maybe the earth will save us

367
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:07,599
that's my hope on this Earth care week

368
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:14,000
2025 so thank you and uh we have a few minutes maybe we can take five minutes

369
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,440
if anyone have any comments or questions you'd like to ask and

370
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:45,960
Maybe that means you're all eager to go out to the Edgewood Park

371
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:51,640
or go out for you know walk on the trails here in the peninsula that would be nice to

372
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:56,838
believe oh yeah morgan

373
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:06,960
I think so down uh hi my name is Morgan and I wanted to

374
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:13,520
just mention that there is a a cemetery in Santa Cruz that uh for ecology they

375
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:18,880
they sell the redwood trees for burial and so if you have loved ones that you

376
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:25,680
want to have a family tree you can buy a tree and you can bury them in the

377
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:32,400
redwoods in Santa Cruz and it'll be there for as long as redwoods last great

378
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:38,880
thank you it's a beautiful uh I didn't call better a better forest that's what it's called yeah thank you i didn't know

379
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:44,079
there was such a thing in Santa Cruz but there's a number of places now that have green burials where sometimes they plant

380
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:49,119
trees as part of it and and um and we're going to maybe walk by it when we do the

381
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:55,400
pilgrimage this year it's in Tennessee Valley in Marine County

382
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:04,400
there so thank you may you love this earth
