1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,240
Okay so I'm a rusty I've been away quite a bit

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,059
from here and so all the buttons to push and things to check and uh

3
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:20,160
the settings were set were not proper in the software part of this YouTube

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:27,300
broadcast this morning so I I wasn't able to get it up and running until just a few minutes before seven

5
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,880
so thank you for being here I'm delighted to be with you and

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:41,120
and the last two weeks I've been involved with it teaching the Dharma teaching practice

7
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:48,059
in outdoor settings first 24 7 in the Santa Cruz mountains and

8
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:53,520
where I even slept Outdoors under the stars and taught and practiced in a

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,980
Grove of trees in a wonderful Meadow and then this last week in Colorado and

10
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:05,820
the mountains outside of Boulder at nine thousand feet and beautiful places to be

11
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:15,080
practicing and in Colorado practicing together with moose who were in the area

12
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:23,420
uh so my friends the

13
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,939
I think that uh well mindfulness practice the awareness practice we do

14
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:36,960
when in mindfulness uh it is very simple but in being simple it's both very

15
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:44,880
radical and it's also um uh you know maybe sometimes hard to

16
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,259
appreciate the Simplicity of it so the Simplicity of it is that

17
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:57,360
it's just to know very simply what's happening to be aware of it

18
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,899
but to be aware of it the Simplicity of it is to be aware of it without any reference to oneself

19
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:11,940
meaning that it isn't the usual self the usual me and my concerns my orientation

20
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,480
my projections my values my

21
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:23,640
fears my judgments that is doing the awareness

22
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,739
there might be uh self-concerns there might be concerns

23
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:35,760
about others but the radical nature of awareness is that we can know those but we're not

24
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,640
living in them it's more like we're living in the awareness we're living in the simplicity

25
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:48,120
where the awareness is kind of like um if you look into the sky at a bird

26
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:55,519
going through the air the the space the bird flies through

27
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:02,580
is not the bird but it allows the bird to fly through space it allows us to see

28
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:09,300
the bird and um the so awareness can be almost like that

29
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:16,500
it's uh it's the awareness they can know if we're self-concerned or measuring what's

30
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:23,159
happening through the filter of ourselves what I have to do who I am how good I am how bad I am

31
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:30,060
but we don't believe in those or we don't latch on to them because the awareness

32
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:35,519
is not appropriated as self we're just aware just like space

33
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,459
and um and so uh and the reason why this is so

34
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:47,580
useful is that when meditation is about myself

35
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:54,180
meaning when meditation is about self-concerns and measuring myself and judging myself or

36
00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:00,180
trying to accomplish something for myself we're limiting our capacity for freedom

37
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:07,220
and for joy but if we can just step away and just keep it so simple just aware

38
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:12,780
then uh there's something joyful about that there's something free freeing

39
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:18,019
about that so that's the so it's radically simple

40
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:24,660
but challengingly simple so what I'd like to offer

41
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:31,020
uh is um is um

42
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:37,500
a little sentence you can tell yourself as we go through this meditation

43
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:45,180
and it's not to deny anything about yourself it's actually to be acutely aware of

44
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:50,639
everything that goes on but uh but to have the sentence

45
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:57,300
it's not about me it's not about me the awareness is not

46
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,460
about me just being aware not about me right now just to be aware of what's

47
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:07,979
here just to be aware of what's here and it's not about me

48
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:13,199
and now if that's troubling for you to say that then don't do it but you might

49
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:19,440
if you can find Freedom in that if you can find even some joy in that

50
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,380
then maybe say this sent little sense it's not about me and then

51
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:30,600
come back to your breathing and be with your breathing and to use that sentence not as a mantra

52
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:37,979
but if your thoughts if your concerns start going into something about me

53
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:45,539
myself and mine then say it's not about me right now

54
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:52,560
in these next 20 minutes that we have for this period just for now me can come

55
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,440
back it's not about me it's just to be aware just to be aware

56
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:04,400
not about me so to

57
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,800
assume a meditation posture that's appropriate for you

58
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,840
in one of the four dignified postures

59
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:21,120
sitting lying down standing

60
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,960
or walking and to

61
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:34,259
adjust your eyes so that your eyes are the

62
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:40,620
engaged in a way or not engaged in a way that's relaxing for you

63
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,000
most commonly

64
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:57,180
is commonly to close your eyes or lower your gaze with

65
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,020
half open eyes

66
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:17,120
taking a few deep breaths through and relaxing on the exhale

67
00:07:53,940 --> 00:08:02,000
and then to let yourself be as simple

68
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:07,940
with your awareness mindfulness as you as you can

69
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,940
the simple knowing of breathing

70
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:23,840
simple knowing of sounds and what happens in your senses sense doors

71
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:31,220
simple knowing of your emotions or what goes on in your mind

72
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:37,979
as if there's no past and future it's just the Simplicity of this moment the

73
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:44,339
experience of this moment and if you find that your

74
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:51,140
your thoughts maybe your emotions are somehow connected to

75
00:08:51,140 --> 00:09:00,019
identifying it as Me Myself and mine self-concerned in any kind of way

76
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:09,240
tell yourself it's not about me for these minutes meditating

77
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:18,860
it's not about me it's about being aware

78
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:24,019
where the awareness is not about me either

79
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:32,180
awareness is wider more spacious

80
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,660
than me

81
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,800
where the knowing

82
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:54,500
has a quality of effortlessness

83
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:40,399
knowing is simple just knowing

84
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:52,500
without laying on top of it feelings

85
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:58,940
senses or ideas of I'm the one who knows

86
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:05,540
it's not about me in being aware

87
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,839
if your thoughts are about yourself

88
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:55,880
remind yourself that meditation is not about yourself

89
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,440
not about thinking about yourself or concerned about yourself

90
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,260
it's simply to be aware of what's here

91
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:20,060
and if what's here is thoughts about self

92
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:27,320
to be aware of that simply

93
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:39,380
almost like those thoughts are not really you they're just thoughts

94
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,400
foreign

95
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,659
foreign

96
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,900
foreign

97
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:47,419
the idea of it's not about me

98
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:57,000
is to remember that awareness can be wider broader

99
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,100
Freer when it's not

100
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:09,320
pulled into or participating on our self-consciousness

101
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:16,440
our self-preoccupation self-judgment

102
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:29,360
we're always in a way

103
00:25:29,659 --> 00:25:37,320
larger or Freer than any thought or idea

104
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:41,539
contraction we have around ourselves

105
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:53,600
and when self-preoccupation limits our capacity for joy

106
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,940
limits our capacity for love

107
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:08,659
and we see that then the expression is not about me

108
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:16,200
can be an opening into this wider world of freedom and joy and

109
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,980
love

110
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:29,220
may it be that our practice

111
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:35,340
is one that brings joy and compassion and love into

112
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:41,000
this world as medicine

113
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:54,260
for the problems and challenges this world faces to support all beings on this planet

114
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:02,000
may we help create a safer caring

115
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:10,760
and Freer world by learning how not to be

116
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:17,340
excessively self-preoccupied self-concerned

117
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:26,880
may all beings be happy may all beings be free

118
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:34,640
may all beings be safe may all beings

119
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:38,120
live in peace

120
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:53,279
[Music]

121
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,778
thank you all

122
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:12,860
and I'll take this moment to um

123
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:18,659
mention that if you have trouble logging on today to this YouTube channel

124
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:26,640
which I did as well it was because the settings for

125
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:32,520
broadcasting onto YouTube were were set wrong they weren't the public it wasn't

126
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:38,460
on the public setting so it was being recorded on YouTube but not publicly available

127
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:45,900
and it took a while for me to discover that I think it helped to to understand the settings

128
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:52,260
and partly because I've been gotten Rusty and doing this YouTube broadcasting and

129
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:57,919
and um so um

130
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:05,520
you know it was we need to go public I think a couple of minutes before seven and so hopefully uh just for those of

131
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:10,679
you who tried before that the problem was not with your links the problem was that um

132
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:14,539
it hadn't been made public yet

133
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:39,000
so I return here to after being away for a

134
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,700
couple of weeks with many momentous events happening and

135
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:52,679
this country and around the world and and the earthquakes the the the

136
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:59,640
the fire in Maui and just the tragedy of it it keeps growing and more we learn about it

137
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:04,919
and um for anybody who lives in Hawaii and in

138
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:13,520
Maui and I send my condolences and my love and

139
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:19,440
and um and people who are maybe here in

140
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:26,059
California dealing with a flooding in Southern California and

141
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:32,940
and they're in your in our hearts no

142
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,019
so um

143
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:45,899
and I hope but that uh this

144
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:53,460
practice that we do is really for the benefit of this world

145
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:59,480
and that in the ways the way the way in which it benefits ourselves

146
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:04,860
makes it possible for us to be to offer

147
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:09,899
the right attention support love Compassion Care

148
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:17,399
for this world around us and maybe it's just the very local world of a few people around us maybe it's

149
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:23,100
broader worlds but that this practice does

150
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:28,440
um Orient us to live in a way that

151
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:34,620
um doesn't add to the harm of the world but actually it adds to

152
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:42,059
uh ways in which we can benefit this world so in the last uh I don't know a few

153
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:48,059
months when I've been teaching here I've been teaching about compassion and I

154
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:54,539
kind of wondered if I had been finished with this series but in thinking about it these last couple of weeks

155
00:31:54,539 --> 00:32:00,720
I wanted to do one more week maybe a concluding week on compassion it felt important to actually spend a

156
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:09,059
whole week on the joy of compassion the happiness of compassion and uh and perhaps for those who have

157
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:15,240
been listening to this series on compassion that um as you start understanding the Ecology

158
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:23,580
of all the different pieces of compassion and how they come together that we can understand and appreciate

159
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:28,860
that there is the potential for our

160
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:33,960
compassionate relationship to the world to be one that brings joy and happiness

161
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:41,700
or a sense of lightness or sense of sweetness or something that feels quite

162
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:49,460
right there's no sense of rightness that um lightens us perhaps or

163
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:56,159
makes the suffering of the world not so heavy and oppressive for us to live with

164
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:02,700
and this is one of the great aspects of compassion is when compassion is free

165
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:09,480
of any kind of attachment any kind of self-preoccupation any kind of way in

166
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:15,260
which we get caught in identified with the suffering

167
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:21,840
or any way in which we are the suffering of the world somehow

168
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:29,279
gets uh gets um doesn't move through us in a way that

169
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:34,740
feels free and doesn't move through us in a free and light way

170
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:40,740
that when it doesn't that um the full potential of compassion and how

171
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:46,980
beautiful and profound and important it is to have it Islam is limited

172
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:55,200
so I want to talk about that this week the joy of compassion and I'd like to do it by uh trying to

173
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,539
evoke or point to the joy of the four different supports or foundations or

174
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:06,659
elements that that are there as part of compassion if compassion is really going

175
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:12,060
to fulfill its full potential and many times when we have compassion

176
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:19,800
and it can be genuine but it hasn't really um moved into its full potential and maybe

177
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:25,560
even feels overwhelming and we you know overwhelming and difficult to have compassion and there's compassion

178
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:31,200
fatigue for example that um it's these different elements haven't

179
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:36,378
really come to fulfillment so I've talked about how the four

180
00:34:36,379 --> 00:34:43,398
aspects that come together to really benefit the compassion is awareness

181
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:50,220
Attunement appreciation aspiration and then action

182
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:55,740
and each of those are associated with a kind of joy that kind of delight and

183
00:34:55,740 --> 00:35:01,140
happiness and so for the first a healthy

184
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:07,500
compassion comes with a well-developed sense capacity to for really being aware

185
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:12,920
and and to learn the art of being aware

186
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:21,619
without identification or being aware without adding into the awareness

187
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:28,079
judgments and evaluations of Me Myself and mine and this is where

188
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:36,540
kind of the knowing the awareness the recognition the mindfulness can operate with a kind of

189
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:41,940
um a certain kind of effortlessness

190
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:50,400
because to apply effort to being aware is all too easy the idea of I'm the one

191
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:58,740
who's applying effort and because of that all these Associated ideas of what I'm

192
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:04,200
who I am and why I'm doing this and and judgments about my capacity and all

193
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:12,140
kinds of things come along independent of that just many people go around with a lot of self-concern

194
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:18,480
everything is measured but how this what this says about me or what this how this

195
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:24,420
is for me or how this is against me or how I'm a victim of this or how I'm a

196
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:31,619
consumer of it and I just want to have more or um and and um and some of this of course

197
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:38,940
is not wrong but when it limits us when it actually contributes to further suffering and

198
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:46,500
more attachments and limits our capacity to serve the world in a Freer away then there is another way

199
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:51,599
and the other way is to learn how there's certain kind of way to be

200
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:57,119
mindful that has a certain quality of effortlessness a certain quality of it's

201
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:06,900
just awareness to just there that just arises and and to kind of enter into or return

202
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:12,660
to a clear sense of attention to the present moment

203
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:19,079
that has no self-efforting making oneself do

204
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:27,420
something but rather it's an allowing it's an opening it's a relaxing into the awareness into

205
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:32,640
the knowing um this is where uh knowing or awareness

206
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:39,500
can start providing feelings of Joy or happiness that are lightening up because

207
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:44,820
because so much of the self-concern and self-preoccupation that we live our

208
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:51,480
lives with dampens down the joy dampens down the freedom that we have it limits

209
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:56,640
it quite a bit and some other idea of joy that people

210
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:02,160
have and happy Pursuit of Happiness is that pursuit of a happiness where we

211
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:07,920
that we build up the sense of self where the self gets praised or the self

212
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:14,520
gets aggrandized or itself gets you know proves itself as being somehow wonderful

213
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:21,960
in the eyes of others or something and some of that unhappiness as people have is also connected to the sense of

214
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:31,380
self and that failure and not good enough and and um feeling that somehow we're wrong

215
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:37,380
and and the radicalness of this awareness practice is how it points to

216
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:43,200
the possibility of being alive of being aware and present outside of the

217
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:48,660
limitations of these judgments and evaluations of ourselves that we live

218
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:55,440
with so the Simplicity of awareness maybe even the effortless quality of it

219
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:01,560
um is or some kind of way in which it's not really self doing it maybe there is

220
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:10,160
a kind of activity of being aware but there's not a sense that I'm the one who's doing it or it's about me

221
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:16,320
um and so the freedom from self-preoccupation the freedom from this constantly be concerned with ourselves

222
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:21,720
is why some Buddhist teachers will say that if you want to be happy have

223
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:27,420
compassion for others live for others and it's not exactly because of living

224
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:35,220
for others that the joy comes but sometimes the reason they say this is because the joy comes from not having

225
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:41,820
the tight contracted agitated painful ways in which we live when we're

226
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:47,839
self-concerned and so we're kind of loosening up that and stepping out of it

227
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:53,160
and now forgetting it this is self-forgetting that compassionate

228
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:59,040
service can provide and uh is maybe why some people do it

229
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:04,560
and um and but if you only do compassion

230
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:10,800
compassionate work in the world to forget the self but haven't really addressed you know

231
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:17,099
it's almost like it can be a distraction from self and they could certainly can be a lightning and easing up that happens

232
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:23,520
when we kind of forget about ourselves or forget about our we were distracted from all this

233
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:30,480
healthy awareness practice um learns how to be to honestly be present

234
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:37,200
here for ourselves what the for all the different kind of

235
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:44,339
ways in which this mind works and the even the self-preoccupation self-concern and evaluations we make

236
00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:52,680
but to see it to know it to be aware of it without identifying with it without

237
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:58,980
adding on top of it more attachment more self on top of it it's almost as if we're beginning to

238
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:05,220
hold Who We Are Who how we mind works and identifications we have in a lot

239
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:11,640
with lots of expensive space and we identified a little bit more with the largeness of space than we do with

240
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:16,400
the smallness of self identity

241
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:23,640
and so to cultivate and develop awareness practice and have that awareness be ready to

242
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:29,880
encounter the suffering of the world this kind of free awareness light awareness open awareness spacious

243
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:35,900
awareness non-self non-self-concerned

244
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:42,060
non-self-referenced awareness where we know ourselves well

245
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:49,140
and we start knowing the world of the round us others then compassion has a chance to be

246
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:55,079
present and to share the joy of Freedom the joy of awareness which is free the

247
00:41:55,079 --> 00:42:01,859
just the joy of being aware and the final Joy of awareness of mindfulness practice

248
00:42:01,859 --> 00:42:07,160
that I want to emphasize is that um

249
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:11,838
is that um

250
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:22,560
the joy of having an awareness practice that

251
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:30,000
had the joy of the faith the joy of the appreciation of knowing we have a practice that can meet

252
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:37,560
our own suffering and meet our own selfing our own self kind of challenges that we live with

253
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:44,820
and aren't we lucky to have a practice that helps us to work with us to work through it to find a way with it to find

254
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:49,859
Freedom with it it's not always easy it takes time

255
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:56,460
but there's a joy of knowing that you have a practice that has bring so much good to oneself and to others

256
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:02,220
so the joy of awareness as we get a sense of that possibility the sweetness of awareness that

257
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:07,260
then we can find um then we're in a better place and ready

258
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:13,500
to experience the joy of compassion so

259
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:19,740
then we'll continue on this theme and I'm happy to be sharing it with you

260
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,460
thank you
