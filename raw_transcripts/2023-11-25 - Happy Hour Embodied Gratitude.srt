15
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm going to change the settings on so that unmuting won't be possible the

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:51,719
space stays quiet and changing chat settings and last but not least of the

17
00:01:51,719 --> 00:02:01,680
Preparatory things I do is to turn on recording for the sake of Audio Dharma here we go

18
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,000
great okay so hello hello and welcome everyone

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,160
to happy hour so for today's practice given that it is

20
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:20,319
um in the US at least it's one day after

21
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:26,360
the Thanksgiving holiday which was yesterday here and uh on Wednesday we

22
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:35,000
did gratitude practice and and um I have a memory of of of uh the reports that

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,360
came back some reports that many felt better turning their minds and hearts to

24
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:46,000
gratitude after the practice we did so let's let's do some more of that let's

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:55,959
do more gratitude practice and again in holding it lightly uh there's no should you should

26
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:01,640
if the voice comes that you should be grateful for this just drop it let it be

27
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:09,840
a gentle leaning into um sense of appreciation for what arises or or not

28
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,280
maybe you just sit in sense of silence and appreciation for the breath

29
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:23,080
so so let's begin let's begin our practice together let's begin so let us

30
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:29,280
arrive together arriving in this body in this

31
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,200
moment however it's showing up whatever it's showing

32
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:58,680

practice

121
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:46,159
so a little gratitude practice little different from the one we did on

122
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:53,640
Wednesday slightly different tone flavor but but also similar so I'd like to

123
00:28:53,640 --> 00:29:01,279
invite us now um the way we engaged in the small groups

124
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:09,960
On th on Wednesday together was to go around and each person would would share

125
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:16,960
one thing that has brought them Joy or they're grateful for and and that's such

126
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,120
an uplifting practice we can't have enough of that I think if I remember yes

127
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:27,919
um um Neil afterwards said we should do this every single time so so we're doing

128
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:34,559
it a second time so it's such an uplifting practice just to both to um

129
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:39,760
share to really reflect in the presence of others what has brought us joy what

130
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:46,279
has brought us gladness and and what we're grateful for either or and also to

131
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:52,519
to hold witness to what brings joy to others it lifts uplifts the heart it

132
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:58,799
uplifts the heart it brings so much joy so so let's go a reverse alphabetical

164
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:40,920
reminder during the meditation I remarked upon in the group of you know it doesn't have to be this huge

165
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:46,040
incredible wonderful thing just to be tuned into the nice little things that

166
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:51,400
happen during the day that make the day special make it good was was so nice

167
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:58,720
because there's so many of them if you really are listening so so that's it beautiful

168
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:05,680
thank you for highlighting that Abraham exactly there's so many and yeah if we tune into them yeah

169
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:12,520
there's more good than Challenge and of course our minds tune into the challenge and take the good for granted that's

170
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:17,720
just the way we operate as human beings it's all of us it's all of us so it's

171
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:24,440
nice to turn towards the good this this silent This Whispering of goodness this

172
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:32,040
Whisper of goodness that's throughout yeah Jim I see your hand

173
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:37,240
going ask you to unmute and if it's possible to turn on your camera to see you you won't be on YouTube but it would

174
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:41,720
be nice to see you as you ask a question or

175
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:52,240
reflect yeah so uh so I'm in Old Vietnam B and um I really L the

176
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:58,319
meditation I re I really didn't share on gratitude I shared on my experience of

177
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:05,000
the relationship between uh attachment and safety because it's something I work

178
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:12,040
with in embodied healing for myself for my PTSD and what I came to understand was

179
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:20,240
the role attachment played and I also was lucky enough to find a medical doctor who flunked out of

180
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:25,400
school in her last year healed herself with embodied healing rather than the

181
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:30,960
medical mind mod and explained to us how important it

182
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:37,079
was to feel safety I think we're safe because my

183
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:45,280
door is locked or I have food in the fridge and I've been working on that

184
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:51,839
process and I reflected when you started going down that road not enough Dharma

185
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:57,520
teachers talk about this aspect of it because it really is a bridge between

186
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:05,480
Dharma and embodied healing yeah yeah to share thank you

187
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:13,319
yeah thank you so much for sharing um so important so significant the the somatic

188
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:22,760
the somatically feeling safe somatic really letting the practice be somatic not just um in our heads or thinking but

189
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:28,839
but embodied really embodied somatic and

190
00:45:28,839 --> 00:45:35,119
um yeah it's so and and I'm so happy to hear that you have found ways to really

191
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:42,559
connect with that in your own practice because that is Paramount for every single person and in fact um you know

192
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:48,640
the Buddha uh put that first put mindfulness of the body first in the

193
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:53,760
four Sati panas and the four foundations of mindfulness the body is first it's

194
00:45:53,760 --> 00:46:02,920
always first it has to be embodied um and and yeah and and um and many

195
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:10,119
Dharma teachers do try to bring it in um I hope I trust and I think nowadays even

196
00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:17,160
more so with our understanding of how trauma lives in the body and how really the embodied sense of safety is

197
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:23,400
important and it cannot be emphasized enough Jim I know that when I really got

198
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:29,280
it in my practice years and years ago the embod my practice just shifted and deepened in
