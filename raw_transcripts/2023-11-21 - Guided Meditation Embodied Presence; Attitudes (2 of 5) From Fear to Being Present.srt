00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:09,759
hello from Redwood City and welcome

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:18,119
and it's a wonderful thing to be with you all and it's a wonderful thing to

3
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:25,119
come here and sit in this seat that I have meditated in for so many years and

4
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:31,279
to assume my position uh my meditation position which

5
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,480
um I want to emphasize for you for this coming

6
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:43,840
meditation one of the pervasive emotions in many people's

7
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:52,359
lives sometimes quite evidently and sometimes in the background is fear

8
00:00:52,359 --> 00:01:01,280
anxiety and sometimes the opposite of fear is um courage

9
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:09,880
but I would like to uh offer another uh kind of antidote or alternative to fear

10
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:17,240
a healthy one and that is to offer our full presence to what is

11
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:25,640
happening so we might not know what to do we might not know what to say but uh we

12
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,320
don't maybe we don't even courageously deal with the fear or face

13
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:37,720
the fear overcome the fear but we offer whatever the situation is our our

14
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:43,280
attention clear present attention we don't we

15
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:50,079
don't NE necessarily have courage but we don't cow we don't necessarily distract

16
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:58,119
ourselves um but we uh attract ourselves to the present

17
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:05,479
moment we stand here We Stand we sit we're present with a certain

18
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:11,360
intentionality that uh that maybe is an alternative to fear

19
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,599
especially fear that's an attitude chronic fear that's a almost like a

20
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:25,920
that's been conditioned into us by life circumstances that's not really necessary to have all the time so the

21
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,840
attitude of fear we somehow will transform it into an

22
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,360
attitude of mindful presence and for that it helps to assume

23
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,200
a posture that offers some stability strength and

24
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:50,800
Clarity that we are here really here and present kind of like you know standing

25
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:59,400
our ground or taking our place so if you're meditating lying down

26
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:05,480
uh one way the posture might help this if the body allows for this is with your

27
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:11,640
feet you know on the bed or on the floor the soles of the feet bring your knees

28
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,959
up towards your chest having your elbows to your side on

29
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:24,239
the surface on the bed or the floor and have your your your hands pointed at 90

30
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,000
your arms at 90Â° angle so your hands uh fingers are pointing directly to the

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,879
ceiling parallel to each other so that uh there's intentionality and Clarity

32
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:41,879
here I am with the feet with the hands that kind of oh this is here I'm really

33
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:47,599
here I'm present and there's an intentionality in both those that uh is

34
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:53,840
comparable to the intentionality if you're sitting cross-legged is to sit uh

35
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:00,959
well balanced on the floor on your cushion and sit upright uh but there's an uprightness

36
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,280
and a little bit of openness of the chest if you're sitting in a chair or a

37
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:13,920
couch to see if you can adjust yourself so that um there is a

38
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:20,120
greater presence you offering being present in your

39
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:26,240
posture just like if you sit up straight and come forward on the

40
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,000
couch or something you're going really going to listen to someone and really show that you're that you're really attentive to what

41
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,800
they're doing you sit up and maybe you come forward so to assume a posture of

42
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,800
presence of attention more than you normally would in meditation if the focus on meditation

43
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,720
is relaxing so taking some

44
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,520
care one way to do this also for if you are kind of leaning back into

45
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:02,720
a chair or the couch uh if you if your hands aren't already this way is to put

46
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,759
your hands uh on your thighs either with

47
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,600
Palms down or Palms up whichever one of those gives you this greatest sense of

48
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,520
kind of strength and presence and here I

49
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,520
am and then lower your

50
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:31,479
gaze and if it's comfortable gently close your eyes

51
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:41,759
and taking a few long slow deep breaths emphasizing the inhale more than the

52
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:48,680
exhale where the inhale we're taking our place here we're

53
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:58,360
filling the immediate space of our body and with our breath with our attention

54
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:06,120
with with this kind physical feeling

55
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:15,520
of clarity around here I am here I am in this body in this

56
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,400
place on the exhale relaxing into

57
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:31,919
here but emphasizing the the strength the clarity the um

58
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,560
fullness of filling your lungs with oxygen

59
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:46,400
and a little bit greater sense of substantiality or fullness of the body

60
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,400
in breathing out in breathing

61
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
in

62
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:14,360
and then letting your breathing return to normal and take a few moments to

63
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:23,039
feel whatever stability or strength or Clarity of

64
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,560
presence that you can feel through your

65
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
body

66
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:45,000
and with that as a support becoming aware

67
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:49,840
of how the body experiences

68
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
breathing

69
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:15,918
on the exhale relaxing the thinking

70
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,120
mind

71
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,440
softening the energy of

72
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
thinking

73
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:47,480
not living in your thoughts by feeling

74
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:53,040
recognizing what is beyond the edges of your thoughts certainly your thoughts

75
00:08:53,040 --> 00:09:01,480
don't fill the universe beyond the the edges of the

76
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:07,320
thinking the sensations and feelings of the body being

77
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
here

78
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:40,440
usually we do some body relaxation at the beginning of a

79
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:47,240
sitting instead feel your body as it is tension at

80
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,320
all without being troubled by

81
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:03,360
it letting all the sensations of the

82
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:12,399
body kind of coales or support a Clarity that here you

83
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:19,519
are here you take your

84
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,399
place fully

85
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
unapologetically

86
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
for

87
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:17,320
and if there is fear maybe find a place

88
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:27,360
within maybe a small little point of stability where there is no

89
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
fear

90
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,880
and allow the fear to be in the background in the foreground the

91
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,200
stability of

92
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
presence

93
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
e

94
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
e

95
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
for

96
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:30,600
on the exhale relaxing your thinking thinking mind

97
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,160
mind on the

98
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:42,519
inhale assuming your place here

99
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:50,959
fully with some strength with some clarity with

100
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:58,320
some sense of really belonging to this place at this time and you're allowed to

101
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,480
with your your full body to inhabit this

102
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:12,240
location as you breathe in filling yourself with attention and

103
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
presence

104
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
for

105
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,519
e

106
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
for

107
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
for

108
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
for

109
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,320
with the

110
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:42,440
gentleness enter into this moment more fully through your

111
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,799
body with the posture maybe a little more straight and upright

112
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:57,320
or the hands in a little bit more of a intentional

113
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
position

114
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,158
or with the

115
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:19,000
inhale feeling more rooted here in this place this

116
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
body

117
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:43,679
steadying yourself in the body here and

118
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:56,720
now as an alternative to being afraid

119
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,240
anxious apprehensive

120
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:15,559
iive in such a way that fear recedes to the edges of our

121
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:23,480
being still there but it doesn't interfere it

122
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:32,679
doesn't color this place of stability and

123
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
presence

124
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
e

125
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
e

126
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
e

127
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:09,080
gently but clearly offer a real presence to this

128
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:16,240
moment this time here in this

129
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,559
body a presence that a little bit like

130
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:41,960
a snake that's growing bigger and it sloughs off its

131
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:48,080
skin a presence which is strong and firm and

132
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:56,120
gentle which something grows so that something else falls

133
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:05,679
off or receed EDS maybe fear recedes and falls

134
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
off

135
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
for

136
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:27,279
and as we come to the end of this sitting to take a few moments to imagine

137
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:34,039
visual realiz what would it be like for you to be in a place

138
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:38,880
situation that normally involves a bit of

139
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,480
anxiety but rather than giving into the

140
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:51,559
anxiety you establish yourself stand

141
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:58,480
sit with presence stability

142
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:04,919
kind of really showing up at least for yourself here and now in the

143
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:08,960
middle of an anxious

144
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:32,240
situation and perhaps when we're

145
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:41,720
not in our anxiety but rather in our presence our

146
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:50,320
attention it's easier to have good will to wish well for

147
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:57,880
others and so we end this sitting with a well wishing for all all

148
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,520
the people we might encounter

149
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:13,278
today may they be happy safe peaceful and

150
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:23,720
free may they Thrive May good things happen to

151
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:32,360
them may may may they be safe enough that their fear

152
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:41,278
abates and when we with them may we be a safe person for

153
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:53,120
them maybe through our presence may all beings be

154
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,880
happy may all beings be safe

155
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:09,240
may all beings be peaceful may all beings be free of

156
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:24,410
[Music]

157
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:32,039
suffering thank

158
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,399
you

159
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:34,279
h hello and welcome to this talk second talk on the topic of

160
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:41,240
attitudes and as I'm bending this week on this topic I'm pairing up uh an

161
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:47,080
attitude which is not very helpful for us with an

162
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:53,480
attitude which is and by attitude here uh I'm more

163
00:29:53,480 --> 00:30:00,159
focused on not so much attitude of the moment particular circumstance sense where we might have an attitude we don't

164
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:06,760
like it or we're impatient or we feel frustrated with something and we it's kind of an attitude than we have while

165
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:14,519
we're present for that particular activity but rather something that's more pervasive in our life and today the

166
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:21,120
topic is fear and one of the advantages and maybe sometimes the

167
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:26,159
challenges of doing mindfulness practice meditation especially going on Retreat

168
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:31,320
where we practice bringing attention all day and because we're there all day kind

169
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:37,960
of really being mindful we start seeing how often we get caught and uh and then

170
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:43,679
we see the patterns of what our mind is thinking or our emotions are feeling and

171
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:49,120
not a few people discover that uh there's a pervasive level of fear or

172
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:54,919
anxiety through their life much more than they realized and it's kind of in

173
00:30:54,919 --> 00:31:00,039
the background or underneath all the other kind of concerns we have and

174
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:05,360
sometimes in being pervasive it casts its influence on the way we think the

175
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:11,200
way we behave the way we even physically look at the world um we can be looking

176
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,399
the World Through The Eyes of of anxiety or fear

177
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:22,760
apprehension and um and so there's a lot uh of wisdom and

178
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:28,480
a lot of uh uh for bringing attention and

179
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:34,240
Care uh maybe even love to our fear and one of the things I like to teach is

180
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:40,360
that the one of the roles of mindfulness really being present for anxiety is to

181
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:46,720
help our anxiety feel safe so we don't spin out even more by We Touch into our

182
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:52,679
fear but we allow our fear to be there so that we uh it can kind of begin to

183
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:58,320
relax I think of fear as always a secondary unless there's uh something

184
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:04,519
imminent danger like a uh in the moment I think of a lot of chronic anxiety to

185
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:10,159
be secondary to something that more deeply that needs needs us needs

186
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:15,600
attention and the avenue to it in classically in mindfulness meditation is

187
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:22,120
to learn how to be present for fear anxiety so that it can begin to relax

188
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:27,600
and you can reveal what's deeper for today I would like to suggest an another

189
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:34,039
alternative to uh an attitude of anxiety attitude of apprehension or fear that we

190
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:43,480
might be carrying with us pervasively through much of a day or all the time and that is um uh a clear sense of

191
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:49,240
being present and to do that in a embodied way physical way even if we

192
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:55,279
don't feel uh confident or feel uh you

193
00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:02,360
know that that's kind of we don't feel strong or don't feel stability and presence we can

194
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:08,399
assume with our take take it take on but a physical posture a posture that here I

195
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:15,200
am I'm present and um and that doesn't mean that we have to go towards the thing

196
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,720
we're afraid of we don't have to resolve it we can even do this you know we take

197
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,880
a few steps back or if there's a a social situation where we feel anxious

198
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:32,480
uh we don't have to be in the middle of it we could maybe be you know standing you know on the edges of the group or

199
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:39,720
something but not to give into the fear not to continue to let appr apprehension

200
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:45,519
condition us have an influence on us but rather uh recognize that it's

201
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:53,120
there and then offer our presence to the situation offer a clear like we we we

202
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:58,919
are taking our place here and now if we're standing we're standing our ground

203
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:06,320
if we're sitting we're taking our place like this is almost like our Throne or something like this is where I belong to

204
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:13,599
sit here upright and dignified and we're not resolving the fear we're not but we're not acting from

205
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:19,960
the fear we're not addressing the things we're afraid of directly we're just uh

206
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:27,200
not cowering or shrinking or being preoccupied by the fear we offer we're

207
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:33,679
here we're present and uh in one version of this is something that I had to learn I don't if

208
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:39,480
I had to learn it but I uh was motivated to learn it uh when I noticed how much

209
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:44,520
fear I had was to be counterphobic and I couldn't do that initially but at some

210
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:49,919
point I had the confidence the ability to turn towards the things I was afraid

211
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:55,760
of and take a step towards them sometimes literally so and that made a

212
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:03,280
world of difference for me and and uh to not uh uh allow the fear or the

213
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:09,599
apprehension to dictate how I my posture my voice my behavior um but to somehow

214
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:16,040
break through it and this idea of taking our place maybe standing upright and

215
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:23,400
strong or sitting upright and kind of really present um as a way of not not

216
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:28,560
denying that there's apprehension and fear but not letting it unduly influence

217
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:34,640
us and affect us and affect the choices we make about our posture what we say

218
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:40,839
what how we look what we what we look at or um we don't you know look down and

219
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:46,640
avoid or kind of excessively shy or something but to really take our place

220
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:53,160
here and offer our presence and uh I'm offering this suggestion also not as a way of

221
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:58,240
resolving the issue or if there's some kind of present moment re reason to be

222
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:04,079
anxious um you know coming into Thanksgiving for many of us in the United States there might be social

223
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:11,280
situations that Thanksgiving Gatherings that brings us anxiety and um and not to resolve those

224
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:17,599
but not to but and but not to uh cower either not to go forward not to go

225
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:25,440
backwards but take our place here I'm here definitively I don't know what to do but

226
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:32,920
I do know how to be present I don't know what to say but I do know how to be quiet in a way where I feel

227
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:39,920
like I'm I'm really taking my place I'm here I count I have value I'm here other

228
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:48,000
people might not treat you differently because of it but it might make a world of difference to have that as a practice

229
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,079
um than you know the the implicit

230
00:36:54,079 --> 00:37:00,200
or unintentional practice ice of practicing fear practicing

231
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:07,480
anxiety and um and when fear anxiety has become an attitude uh it means that we

232
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:13,040
are we've spent too much time thinking about it too much time being conditioned

233
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:19,599
by The Chronic way of thinking about this there's danger there's fear there's problems and there certainly are in this

234
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:25,760
world of ours and I don't want to deny the the the realness of some of the

235
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:31,560
things we're anxious about but it's not necessary to always be anxious when the

236
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:37,240
danger is not imminent because if we do then it's conditioning us and adding and

237
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:43,920
strengthening this pervasive attitude and there's a loop between feeling you

238
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:49,240
know an attitude of fear that creates influen us to have

239
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:55,160
thoughts about fear about what we're afraid of and concern and that creates more of the fear and it's a kind of a

240
00:37:55,160 --> 00:38:00,800
loop and sometimes you you know it spirals out to a panic attack but to uh

241
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:08,839
to somehow break that maybe gently that Loop that looping by not always giving

242
00:38:08,839 --> 00:38:14,359
into the fear but taking our place standing up being really

243
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:20,040
present and um and this is different than just being mindful of situations

244
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:27,079
because sometimes when when we are relying only on mindfulness uh we don't see how much our

245
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:33,800
mindfulness our attention is somehow unintentionally maybe even

246
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:42,119
subconsciously being shaped or influenced by the the fear itself and so to kind of break the

247
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:51,880
cycles of fear or break kind of the mold of it that we're kind of stuck in by sitting up clear strong present and

248
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:57,440
having a sense of steadiness and stability that maybe is not very strong

249
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:03,079
but is there as an alternative to only letting the attitude of fear have the

250
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:09,720
upper hand or be have too much influence on us and I'm not suggesting that this is

251
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:16,960
easy in many circumstances but there might be some circumstances where uh you can practice

252
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:25,960
this and um to switch the attitude from Fear to being present to being present

253
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:34,280
in an embodied way and um and uh and then see what

254
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:40,520
happens what happens next maybe it's easier for you maybe you do feel like

255
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:49,880
you're breaking out of a certain kind of for some people even a kind of prison or kind of uh to be always in the you know

256
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:56,680
you know surrounded or caught up in apprehension fear anxiety and I'm not offering this as a

257
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:05,319
solution as the final you know this is going to make everything go better or easier but uh it is a different attitude

258
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:11,200
that we can step into that can begin to make a difference and can also change

259
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:17,319
our relationship to fear uh so that uh when we do bring

260
00:40:17,319 --> 00:40:22,760
mindfulness to fear that respects fear that holds it gently that uh we have a

261
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:27,839
greater capacity to do that because we bring that sense of stable presence to

262
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:33,839
the fear and when we're fully present for it then uh we don't get uh pulled

263
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:41,640
into it or unduly influenced by it so

264
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:47,040
um so if you find yourself with fear

265
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:52,800
especially minor fears or minor anxieties for this exercise uh and we want to be careful

266
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:59,240
when there's strong fears and you know strong tendencies towards anxiety that this what I'm saying might not be

267
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:06,680
appropriate but to practice with the small ones and see what difference it makes and see uh what happens to the

268
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:12,599
anxiety and fear when uh you offer this alternative embodied

269
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:22,839
presence um being really here present so um thank you very much and

270
00:41:22,839 --> 00:41:29,920
um and I'm hoping that this focus on attitude today will be a

271
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:35,880
particularly interesting um topic of mindfulness on this holiday weekend

272
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:41,000
where our life is a little bit different than how it usually is and maybe has

273
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:49,680
different kinds of challenges than our ordinary life so thank you very

274
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,319
much
