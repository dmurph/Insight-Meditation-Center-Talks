1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:11,840
so good morning good day and here for our meditation

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,279
and one of the [Music] remarkable tools that we have for

3
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:23,920
meditation and for living a wise life is our physical body

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:31,519
this body of ours is a finely tuned instrument of perception it's as if it's an antenna

5
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:38,559
that picks up so much sense data from the environment from within side of ourselves

6
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:46,800
and even if our we doing i don't have uh

7
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,559
all our senses operating properly as i get older my eyes are not seeing as

8
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,800
well my ear ears are on here as well and um

9
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,000
still it's a phenomenal apparatus that we have

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,360
and if we barrel ahead in our thoughts and activities it's all too easy to not be attuned

11
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,799
tuned into this wonderful instrument this wonderful

12
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,280
antenna this wonderful source i would say even of wisdom

13
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,960
because there's so much understanding that can come but what i'd like to emphasize for today

14
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:38,079
is that the body that is

15
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,799
uh if we have um uh

16
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,079
when we have mindfulness of the body when we're aware of our body

17
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:56,479
the body tends to move towards equilibrium to have homeostasis

18
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:03,200
the body will will find its way to the midpoint balance point between

19
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:10,239
stress and excessive relaxation or or slumping or

20
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,400
and it'll find its balance between

21
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,560
pulling back and moving forward find its balance in so many different ways

22
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,239
and one of the ways it does it for people who are tense is it you can feel the body wants to

23
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,599
move towards relaxation to releasing the tension and

24
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:39,920
it's one thing to feel the tensions of our body the holding we do it's another thing to feel

25
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:47,360
the momentum the call the the the almost like the desire the the tension

26
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,680
has to relax to release to feel the momentum towards relaxing

27
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:00,000
in the opposite end of the spectrum if we're too slumped or too kind of collapsed

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,280
if we really feel that and tune into that we'll feel the body's movement and

29
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,480
this almost like desire to uh be aligned to be upright to have its energy moving through the body

30
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:19,840
in a uh in a good way in an energy energized way alert way

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,760
and it's possible to tune into the body and follow the body's kind of

32
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:32,000
kind of directions towards balance directions or tendency towards

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,159
equilibrium and it doesn't have to we don't have to do a lot of

34
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:44,239
it's not even not possible it's not even necessary to do so much of the work ourselves

35
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:50,959
but rather our job is to tune into what the body is going on in the body and the body will find its way or tell us

36
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:57,200
clearly what needs to happen so to begin

37
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:04,159
what is the posture that your body wants to take right now

38
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:11,040
putting aside ideas you have of what a good meditation posture is

39
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:19,600
if you feel your body from the inside out what would be nice for your body right

40
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,120
now and whatever it might be

41
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,759
it will be probably temporary sooner or later

42
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,520
there'll be a time to be a different way

43
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:46,880
and if we live in the policies in our minds about how we should be we won't listen or hear or feel

44
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,400
what the body is about

45
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,639
gently close the eyes

46
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,039
and often on these morning 7 a.m sits

47
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,080
i discussed beginning with a conscious effort to relax different parts of the body

48
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,600
sometimes with deep breaths but for this morning

49
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:29,280
don't do that rather let the body do it as it sees fit

50
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,280
take a few moments now little time to scan through your body

51
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,320
and check in with it are there tensions anywhere in the

52
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:47,680
body are there places of holding tightness

53
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
resistance

54
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,759
and not to do anything about it right now but rather

55
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:08,960
let it be there but feel it well sense it

56
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:22,960
until perhaps you feel that within the tension itself

57
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,840
there's a desire to relax

58
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:37,600
then relax but not before

59
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,720
or then allow that part of your body to release

60
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:11,039
there might be in the body a global embracing ourselves against life

61
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,360
by tightening up in fear of

62
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,319
some unknown future life itself

63
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:31,840
and feel that if make space for it give time to get to feel that bracing

64
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,639
holding back

65
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,960
just because your mind doesn't like it

66
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,039
don't start with the mind directing the show

67
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,800
feel the body

68
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:04,400
or maybe there's some contraction or pressure in your body of wanting doing

69
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:12,199
the eagerness of leaning forward a restlessness

70
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:24,039
make lots of room to feel and sense how that's experienced in the body

71
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,879
there may be physical tension associated with thinking

72
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:56,720
[Music] pressure constriction

73
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,839
take your time to feel that until you feel that within that

74
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,839
constriction

75
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,880
there is a request to relax

76
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:57,120
and now become aware of your breathing be aware of your body breathing

77
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:10,480
and without any effort to do anything different

78
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:19,320
notice if there's any tension or resistance holding in the breathing pattern

79
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:32,320
let yourself be okay with that your job is simply to know and feel

80
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:40,360
any tightening or holding associated with breathing

81
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,880
and then for the rest of the sitting continue in a relaxed way with your

82
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,880
breathing or with tuning into your body

83
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:53,040
and if you wonder often thought take that as a

84
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:59,600
instruction as a reminder to come back to feel

85
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:06,320
your body settle into your body's experience of

86
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,680
itself as if you can trust the body will find

87
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:17,760
its way if

88
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,120
you have a clear non-reactive awareness

89
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,880
awareness without an agenda just aware

90
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:37,839
listening sensing feeling breathing the breathing body

91
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:44,519
body breathing the body itself

92
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:58,440
whatever you might thinking now might be thinking now

93
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:06,000
consider that for now that your body is more important

94
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,880
the experience of your body

95
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,399
is where the meditation will unfold

96
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:53,960
and after these minutes of sitting quietly

97
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,039
has anything shifted and changed in your body

98
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,039
how does your body feel now

99
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:15,120
and might there be some movement in your body

100
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:26,000
to be sit be more upright to open up more

101
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,080
be straighter

102
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:39,919
the healthy opposite of relaxing

103
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:51,200
what is the call within the body more relaxation or more

104
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,360
a brightness

105
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,480
and coming to the end of this sitting

106
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:17,600
sometimes we come to a place through meditation

107
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:25,039
that we're not living from our mind as much as we are

108
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:31,039
from our body and not so much from our body but from

109
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:37,840
the body sensitivity and antennas and the body's resonance

110
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,120
with the world around us

111
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:49,840
where things like kindness friendliness love

112
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:57,360
seems to well up from the body independent of

113
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:03,840
the policies and beliefs and ideas of the mind

114
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,640
and as we sit here in the last minutes

115
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:20,399
is there any even slight

116
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:28,320
place of kindness tenderness love or good will

117
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,840
that you can find in your body

118
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,799
maybe for yourself

119
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:43,720
maybe for the people in your life

120
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,799
maybe the kind of good will you might have

121
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,679
for even people you don't know

122
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:09,760
and if there is such a such care or love compassion that

123
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:15,278
arises from your body from your torso your heart

124
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:24,880
or even if you just wish it did that wishing that that was the case

125
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:32,720
is very significant and from this place nor this wish

126
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:39,279
give words to that kindness by repeating

127
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:47,440
quietly to yourself may others be happy

128
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,840
may others be safe

129
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,760
may others be peaceful

130
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:13,240
may others be free

131
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:20,220
[Music]

132
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:35,419
[Music]

133
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:29,278
so good morning good day good evening

134
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:36,799
and um so we're continuing with this discussion of anger

135
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:43,200
and as i said now that anger is a sign

136
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:49,120
and one way of saying a message and one way of understanding that is

137
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:55,919
that it's a sign that something is wrong somewhere or other something is wrong

138
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,960
and some wisdom is needed to not assume automatically that this

139
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:09,278
what's wrong is out in the world or to assume automatically that what's wrong is within oneself

140
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:15,840
but it's a sign that something is off that something needs attention

141
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:22,720
and it's one of the first things to do is to learn from it to find out what it is to stop and take a good look what's really

142
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:29,039
going on here and when we meditate especially this is a great place because we don't have to

143
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:34,399
then hopefully when meditating say anything to anyone or do anything in the world

144
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:41,519
you can just really be present and feel it and be so we want to learn from it

145
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:48,559
one of the things to learn is that [Music] how anger motivates us

146
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:55,120
and that's part of the danger of anger that sometimes anger comes with very strong motivation to do something to say

147
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:01,919
something just very forcefully to someone or to act forcefully or something

148
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:08,960
and and and when the motivation sometimes has

149
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:14,399
the upper hand and that's why for example for example expressions of anger are speaking angrily

150
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:20,240
people lose touch with themselves as they say it the motivation is so strong and so

151
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,679
powerful that they don't really know what's happening in their body and their hearts their minds they've lost

152
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:32,080
sometimes in extreme versions they're kind of possessed by anger and they don't have not really touched

153
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:38,480
into what's happening here and this losing touch with oneself when we're angry

154
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:45,679
is a great uh hindrance a great shortcoming

155
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:51,120
the wisdom the clarity the ability to be able to act wisely and

156
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,960
speak wisely in the world happens a lot from being grounded in one's body

157
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,000
to be present here and and that can happen even when we're

158
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,360
angry and that way we won't lose ourselves in the anger

159
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:14,720
and so training ourselves to kind of be in the body stay present so it helps to think of

160
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:21,200
of anger as being part of part of what anger is is if there's a motivation in it

161
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:28,480
and so ask yourself what is the motivation here what is the desire what's the wish that you see happen

162
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:34,800
and regardless of what the degree of anger might be it could be irritation it could be

163
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:41,280
um and no even annoying something relatively mild what is that

164
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:48,878
this becomes particularly important when anger annoyance irritation

165
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:55,440
is hostility has become it's a low-key and chronic

166
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:02,400
and so it has nothing to do with any particular incident that's happened but rather it has to do with it become a

167
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:10,720
way of living a way of kind of an attitude which we have and the whole assessment of chronic

168
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:16,320
anger hostility is very different than the analysis or

169
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,359
the consideration of incident specific anger where there's something happening

170
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:28,320
right in front of us and the chronic that goes on for a long time that's that is particularly

171
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,440
debilitating that tends to have a powerful force

172
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:39,760
to help people actually not be in touch with themselves that they might feel the opposite because the energy of anger is

173
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,960
so strong that they feel humming with it but actually there's there's such a big cost

174
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:52,000
we lose something the buddha gave this um a list of the

175
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,839
downsides of anger of being angry especially maybe chronic anger

176
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:03,920
that maybe he give it gave it to people to motivate them to

177
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:10,960
do something about their anger not to live this way and so

178
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:16,960
he said that the ill effects of anger include

179
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:22,560
looking ugly being in pain

180
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:28,560
making mistakes the loss of property

181
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,838
falls into disputes and disgrace

182
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:43,599
loss of friends and then a rebirth in hell

183
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:46,320
so um

184
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:55,680
the so i don't know if that motivated some of you like oh wow all those things can be there with anger chronic i think of

185
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:01,760
it as chronic anger this kind of persistent stream of it so um

186
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:08,640
so one of the ways to respect anger is think i believe is not to give into

187
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:14,720
it as a motivational force to say or do something but rather take the time to feel it and

188
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:20,800
to know it and to feel and know it in the body and the body

189
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,960
can process this the body knows how to unfold and relax and open up and reveal

190
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:32,880
and and sometimes when we take the time to sit down and feel

191
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,800
anger in the body it gets stronger there can be murderous rage that arises

192
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:45,440
but when you're sitting still maybe that's the end that's the whatever has happened is so powerful

193
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:51,839
that something has been is erupting inside of us and we it's and

194
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:57,119
if we're not acting on it or expressing it meditation is about letting that

195
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:02,240
eruption happen or meditation but letting

196
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,440
the whole thing dissipate and dissolve because sometimes what keeps it going is

197
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:13,920
the telling ourselves stories repeating ourselves the the injury that's been done or it's the repetition of certain

198
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:19,680
trains of thought which keeps the anger the annoyance the irritation going

199
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:26,720
and so to sit quietly and feel it in the body is an alternative to all those stories

200
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:32,160
and then the body then you can allow the body to do what it wants to do you know

201
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:37,200
the deeper process to do what it was to do and it might be an eruption

202
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:42,560
or it might be dissolving and it's not your job to choose which it

203
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:49,520
is but to really be attuned to see what needs to happen here and hopefully be quiet enough still

204
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:54,720
enough go for a walk long enough that you allow the whole process to

205
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,800
to maybe come to some completion in ordinary life especially with

206
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:08,560
incident specific anger and we have to kind of act on things it's very useful to learn how to diffuse

207
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:15,280
the anger how to be with the anger so that it doesn't automatically trigger motive

208
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,560
motivational actions we say or do things and here again

209
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:26,720
training ourselves so it's second nature to be mindful of the body so we feel

210
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:33,200
uh what's happening the body can be a source of stability to come back to the body and just sit and

211
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:39,040
be or stand feel you feel your feet on the ground the body can also be the means by which

212
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:45,040
we diffuse some of the energy of anger some of the intention and motivational force of

213
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:51,040
anger that interferes with our ability to really be attuned more deeply

214
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:57,040
what's happening attune to the deeper emotions that might really be the bigger issue that's happening

215
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:02,400
more attuned to the situation we're in and to take a better look at what's happening

216
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:08,880
more attuned to ourselves to if we're if the anger arises because of a story we're telling ourselves

217
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:14,800
to question the story is that the right perspective that we have

218
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:21,359
so to tune into the body and then to find ways to diffuse some of that energy of anger

219
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:26,880
by relaxing breathing breathing breathing breathing deeply and

220
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:33,200
relaxing breathing and relaxing on the exhale breathing and feeling the

221
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:38,319
expansion of the rib cage in the torso as a way of kind of grounding yourself

222
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:43,599
in the body and feeling something that's really primary the primary experience of

223
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:49,920
breathing notice your posture when you're angry maybe the posture

224
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:56,480
is one that does not doesn't lend itself to diffusion to settling if you're you know both both hands are

225
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:04,319
in a fist um it maybe it's not that difficult to relax the fist to relax the hand to open

226
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:10,000
it and doing that is part of the diffusion process

227
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,680
settling it quieting down and diffusion is not the same thing as repression

228
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:20,880
or denial or escaping from it diffusion is to

229
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:28,480
settle some of the some of the uh ways in which we're getting disconnected from ourselves

230
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:35,520
and to feel more deeply what's happening to be more present and to settle the tr the motivational

231
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:41,119
triggers that might come with with anger so that we're not speaking from the anger or

232
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:47,040
acting from the anger and and we can kind of feel and sense what's going on

233
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:53,680
and so finding out where you are each of us probably has our own

234
00:41:53,680 --> 00:42:01,200
specialty of where in the body anger is most expressed it might be tension and tightness in the

235
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:07,200
belly it might be in the chest it might be in the face or the jaws it might be in the hands

236
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,720
sometimes the eyes i've seen angry people in their eyes are feel so tense

237
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:19,280
and fixed and locked in it might be somehow in the forehead and

238
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:25,680
there's places where we get headaches because of all the the tension associated with maybe irritation

239
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:31,599
and anger so wherever your way is your place get to know it so that when you go about

240
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:38,480
your life and it's an incident of anger you know to go to that place and maybe relax and settle

241
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,920
um the um learn skills of diffusion lose skill

242
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:49,440
learn skills of being grounded in the present so that

243
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,880
anger doesn't get the upper hand so that

244
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,160
you can learn from the anger rather than act on the anger

245
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:05,680
the expression of anger is not something we want we want to do

246
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:11,520
very often i once asked one of my buddhist teachers

247
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:18,079
um if it was ever appropriate to express anger and the teacher says

248
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:24,160
i said something i've got exactly that the date the time frame but the teacher said yes

249
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:30,160
once in a blue moon once at once in a great while like once every you know

250
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:37,040
five years or something um so i don't know if that guideline is the right one

251
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:43,520
but um it was fascinating to me this idea there might be a time but not that often

252
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:50,000
and so to have the ability to step back and the advantage of that

253
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,640
is that if anger involves something that needs to be addressed in our life

254
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:02,720
it's often addressed much more usefully motivated by other

255
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:08,480
emotions and feelings and ideas than the motivations that come from anger itself

256
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:14,560
so again it's not denying the incident was anger producing it's not denying the difficulty of the

257
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:21,440
anger but it's questioning the motivational value of anger

258
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:27,040
and that's where it's very rare that anger is useful as a motivational force

259
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:32,319
some people are quick to defend anger because a lot of good gets done in the world with anger that people are

260
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:37,920
motivated for justice and fight for it so maybe that's good but it's not so

261
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:43,119
healthy for the person who's angry and i feel a little sad when people

262
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:49,680
justify anger for that reason what i wish they would do instead is find an equal

263
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:55,838
or even stronger motivation from compassion

264
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:03,680
don't set up anger as don't justify anger if there are better

265
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:11,920
motivations to get the job done so diffusing anger so for this next day

266
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:18,800
you might if you find yourself irritated annoyed angry rageful

267
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:25,359
simmering resentful whatever you might feel

268
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:30,400
today see what you can do by tuning into your body

269
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,680
and like we did in the guided meditation tune into what's going on in the body really well

270
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:43,359
and see what the body wants to do see if the body wants to relax see if the body wants to be energized

271
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:49,680
if you if you do this during a walk as i've said before i i process strong

272
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:55,520
anger with walks does the does the body want to walk faster does it work slower

273
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:01,680
what what does the body want to do here to uh and um

274
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:10,160
and then also explore where can you relax what settles you into with the emotion

275
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:15,839
and um this is a personal skill that each person needs to learn for themselves so

276
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:23,000
how do you defuse anger so thank you
