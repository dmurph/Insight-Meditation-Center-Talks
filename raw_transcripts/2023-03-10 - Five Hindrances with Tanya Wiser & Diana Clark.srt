thank you thank you will the gain may be different

10
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:20,459
how is this can you hear uh through the hearing assisted device when um when I'm

11
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:27,560
using when the microphone is on does it work yeah yeah oh okay there we go okay

12
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:36,539
well here we are here we are welcome to week two of the five hindrances and

13
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:42,060
we're using some references from The Wizard of Oz to kind of explore the

14
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:47,940
hindrances so last week we just kind of did a an introductory and talked about

15
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:54,500
just introduce the five hindrances which are you know sensual desire agreed

16
00:06:54,500 --> 00:07:01,380
aversion ill will sloth and torpor restlessness and worry and doubt and we

17
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:08,580
describe them as energies so is one one way and we've offered a few ways to

18
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:16,680
describe them but one was as energies and so if you think about the energy of Desire or sensual desire if there's an

19
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:22,080
energy of Leaning forward into wanting right to pull something to you

20
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:30,120
versus the energy of aversion and ill will which is a pushing away right there's this backward movement or this

21
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:37,500
shoving away movement um with the energy of sloth and tormper

22
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:44,280
it's actually a lack of energy right not enough energy to be awake and present

23
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,380
um and there's the there's two elements of the sloth and topper one has to do

24
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:55,979
within the body and the other has to do within the mind the next set of hindrances is

25
00:07:55,979 --> 00:08:02,580
restlessness and worry which is too much energy so it's a body that is moving and

26
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:08,099
agitated and unable to settle or it's a mind that's worrying and

27
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:13,560
spinning and sort of unable to Center and rest

28
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:19,139
and then there's doubt and doubt is um it's sort of like it doesn't know what

29
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:24,720
direction to go in the energy and that's so there's a lot of starts

30
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,599
and stops kind of a no momentum has really established

31
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:38,039
um and uh yeah there's just not Clarity there's no Direction so that's the

32
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:45,060
hindrances as energy we also talked about them as veils things that obscure

33
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:51,959
things that make it difficult to see clearly and another offering was as things that

34
00:08:51,959 --> 00:09:00,200
hamper hamper ability to practice to progress to be free

35
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:08,700
so I'm I'm wondering if anyone had any Reflections from this week

36
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:15,240
about noticing the hindrances were you able to and take our invitation

37
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:22,019
to play be a little bit more playful with the presence of hindrances

38
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:27,899
instead of kind of feeling burdened by them

39
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:33,240
any thoughts guso Kevin and Jay you weren't here but you're welcome to chime

40
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:39,740
in there's Mike's if anyone wants to share

41
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,980
thanks Kevin

42
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:56,000
yeah something that came last week that I keep needing to be reminded of is uh

43
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:02,760
you know there's the hindrance and you see it and then uh my usual reaction is

44
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:08,180
a lot of aversion to having is like oh I see it oh my God it shouldn't be there

45
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:17,100
and um so yeah it was kind of caught in it um a lot for today until uh recent Sid and

46
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:23,519
then I was sitting there and we were starting and I was looking at the sheet and I was like oh yeah and then uh relax

47
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,860
about it um the feeling of it so

48
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:33,959
um yeah I'm ready to keep listening all right thank you Kevin

49
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:40,800
maybe I'll add like it's so fantastic that you recognize there's the hindrance itself and then there's our reaction to

50
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:47,880
it and so often we have a version to aversion and then we have a version to a version to a version and on it goes but

51
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:54,899
it's really great to notice that there's we have the hindrances and then then extra is wanting it to not be there and

52
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:57,560
autistic

53
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:11,399
so maybe I'll just briefly say a few things about we're going to move into now tonight talking more about

54
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:18,060
um desire and ill will and so you know we kind of are using the

55
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:25,560
reference of The Wizard of Oz the movie to kind of bring a playful and energy to it but

56
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:32,579
also to it's an easy reference to sort of exaggerations it just makes it so easy to see them so

57
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:38,820
for example well first of all I want to say there's kind of the the hindrance of

58
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:44,100
greed and desire but there's also something called damachanda which is

59
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:49,800
more of a wholesome impulse a wholesome desire so we don't want to imply that

60
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,959
there's no broom or space for desire in our practice it's actually an important

61
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:01,079
part of the path of practice without a desire to be free we would not practice

62
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:07,019
and Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz is kind of an example of damachanda she really

63
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:13,019
wants to get home she wants to you know go get home which we'll talk more about

64
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:19,140
what that means so um but some classic examples right

65
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:25,740
are before Dorothy goes to Kansas or goes to the Oz she's in Kansas and she's

66
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:34,019
quite disenchanted with her life and she sings the song Somewhere Over the Rainbow right and it's like over the

67
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:41,600
way up high there's a land that I heard of in a lullaby somewhere over don't you want to I didn't know

68
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:48,139
I might say that we're off to see the wizard but this one I don't think so you're not going to sing though

69
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:55,980
the sky Over the Rainbow the skies are blue the dreams you dare to dream really do come true someday I'll wish upon a

70
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:03,180
star and wake up where the clouds are far behind me um where troubles melt like lemon drops

71
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:08,279
above the chimney tops you know it just kind of goes on and and

72
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:14,880
um it's clearly an example of her wanting things to be better prettier you

73
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:21,839
know she has a desire a sense desire for pleasure so that's kind of a you know

74
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:28,560
more subtle way it shows up and then when we land in the Land of Oz the

75
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:34,800
wicked witch shows up right and when she shows up she says

76
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,839
um to to Dorothy I want those shoes you

77
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:46,139
know and then she says I'll get those shoes my pretty right and this very

78
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:51,839
Wicked way um later she even says uh well so she's

79
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:58,079
wanting I guess I'm combining there's the greed I want those shoes you don't

80
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:05,459
want to get them later she then is like threatening bodily harm to get the shoes the

81
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:11,820
aversion that oh well follows on the heels of the green and then I wanted to sort of talk about

82
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:16,940
the Emerald City itself so this is the home of the Wizard of Oz

83
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:23,639
and you know it's a really seen through rose-colored glasses you know by the

84
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:30,540
munchkin so they're singing the song we're off to see the wizard the wonderful Wizard of Oz we hear he is a

85
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:35,700
wiz of a whiz if ever a whiz there was if ever or ever was there was The Wizard

86
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,980
of Oz is one because because because because the wonderful things he does

87
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:46,320
so there's no content in this there's nothing really it's just all this

88
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,959
because because right um and and then just about the city

89
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:57,480
itself right um it's full and built on sense desire

90
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:03,320
right it's like painted horses right it's like everybody

91
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:09,720
everything's green right it's just like fancy fancy the first place they take

92
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,880
Dorothy and the friends when they arrive is to this like little fix it up Factory

93
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,459
where they get their hair done and the Scarecrow gets new straw and the lion

94
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:28,019
gets you know detailed tin man has all his rust removed so

95
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:34,199
um so there's an example of where you see you know uh sense desire

96
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:40,440
um two two other things is just to reference the yellow brick road itself this you know it's like there's often

97
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:46,800
talked about as the gold standards painted gold right light gold and

98
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:54,480
and I think it also for me represents the momentum of greed right there's this momentum of building and moving toward

99
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:01,380
what you want so then in aversion we've got that basic wicked witch right you know I'll get you

100
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:08,760
my pretty she kidnaps her tells her she's gonna kill her sets the timer takes the monkeys and sends the the Toto

101
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:15,060
the monkey's off to drown Toto in the river right I mean classic extreme you

102
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:22,860
know extreme on a less extreme a little bit more subtle disguised level I'll bring up the

103
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:28,560
wizard himself right it's sort of like a version or hatred disguised as a promise

104
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:36,300
to help he sends Dorothy and her friends to the wicked witch to get her broom

105
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:42,779
what what you know and he says you go do this bring it back and I'll give you all what

106
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:49,259
you want false promise sending them into life-threatening situation he doesn't

107
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:54,660
think they're going to survive so to me this is a real example of ill will

108
00:16:54,660 --> 00:17:01,259
so with that let me turn it over to Diana for the Dharma perspective

109
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:06,298
that was fun Tonya I don't think I will ever consider this movie the same again

110
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:12,240
especially when you would be the witch that was funny loving this

111
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:19,020
and I think it's good right because the hindrances I know for me I felt like it was a failing it was something when I

112
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:26,400
got cut with him I was saying like something's wrong with me in the practice so this is a lot of fun to kind of bring some levity to it

113
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,820
so I'm going to say a few more things maybe build on some what Tanya said

114
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:38,280
so just to reiterate the desire that's being pointed to

115
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:45,720
is not all desire of course right we need desire when we're hungry we desire to eat that's you

116
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:54,960
know such a natural part of Being Human the desire that's being pointed to here is we could say sensory desires so it's

117
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,600
the desire to have sense Pleasures things that taste good smell good feel

118
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:06,059
good these types of things and it's a hindrance when it's getting in the way

119
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:12,780
when it's hindering so we don't want to say that you know having some pleasurable experience is

120
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:19,320
inherently bad that's exactly where we don't want to go it becomes a hindrance when we are

121
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:25,080
thinking that pursuing Pleasures it will be a source of lasting happiness

122
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:33,059
and then we find ourselves on this hedonic treadmill trying to find the next one and then the next one the next one and we never get to more freedom so

123
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:39,559
it's kind of like the opposite of Freedom right is just pursuing the next sense pleasure

124
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:45,000
so one thing that we might say then that's so much about Buddhist practice this

125
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:52,620
whole practice is to help make this distinction okay so what kind of sensory desire is

126
00:18:52,620 --> 00:19:00,020
skillful helpful healthy and what isn't and often we can't see this distinction

127
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:06,900
when we're in the midst of it but when the mind starts to settle down a little bit with some meditation and maybe with

128
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:12,299
some of the pointing that Tanya and I are doing or pointing that you've heard in Dharma talks or read in books or

129
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:19,160
something can help support that but to help make this distinction between what is helpful

130
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:25,440
and so in order to help with this make the distinction part

131
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:32,640
of what we need to do is just really get to know desire this sensory desire this desire for

132
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,980
Pleasures with the senses so that it can stop being a hindrance

133
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:46,980
and that we can understand whether it's helpful or not helpful so it's part of like to experience it

134
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:52,919
this sensory desires just a part of the human experience and instead of thinking

135
00:19:52,919 --> 00:20:00,059
like okay this is a problem I have to do something about it it can be like oh here's an opportunity for me to learn

136
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:07,140
something here's an opportunity for me to see what's my relationship to these desires

137
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:12,960
am I holding on and thinking and hoping that okay this is going to make me happy

138
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:19,500
or are we looking at the objects and getting obsessed with the objects okay

139
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:25,799
look at that oh it's so beautiful as soon as I have that it's going to be great and wow look at the toaster as

140
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:32,760
soon as I get the new toaster making this up of course right then it's going to make breakfast so much better and

141
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:41,039
then once I have a good breakfast and my day is going to be better and then I can do all this kind of stuff so I just got to get the right toaster not too big not

142
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:46,380
too small you know this type of thing and we kind of start getting obsessed with the toaster

143
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:51,960
and not even recognizing how much as Tony was saying how we're like leaning

144
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:58,620
forward and we're just filled with kind of like this desire we might even say greed and we're completely detached from

145
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:04,620
our own experience detached from everything that's going around while we're clicking around on Amazon looking

146
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:12,299
for the perfect toaster so can we experience desire

147
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:18,960
and using as an opportunity to learn notice how we often kind of get obsessed with the object and get disconnected

148
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,780
from ourselves or notice how we might be projecting onto the object we're going to think

149
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:31,919
okay everything's going to be all right as soon as I get this course can say the same with a version

150
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:38,039
everything's going to be okay as soon as I get rid of this broken toaster that's taken up all

151
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:43,320
this space on my counter and I don't have room for the blender for my smoothies in the morning and I have to

152
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:49,740
make all that noise to move it around and I wake up my partner right these things that we do

153
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:57,000
so there are a few ways that um to help like well what is skillful desire what

154
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:04,760
isn't and here are some ways to maybe work with this does it get in the way

155
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:11,640
does it hinter does it get in the way if something's important to you

156
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,799
get in the way of your meditation practice does it get in the way of

157
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:22,320
feeling centered in your body does it get in the way to what your priorities

158
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:29,400
are in your life sometimes we are so busy pursuing the

159
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:36,120
next dopamine hit or something like that that um we fill our days with that

160
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:42,840
on the things that are really important to us get neglected so that's one way is it skillful or unskillful we could ask

161
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:51,019
ourselves is it getting in the way is there something else that we could be doing with our time and our energy

162
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:58,440
another thing that we can ask ourselves is that when we finally get attain

163
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:03,539
achieve what we're designed when we finally get that new toaster

164
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:09,179
does it bring the ease that we're expecting does it bring the

165
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:15,240
happiness does it bring a sense of freedom or we just immediately often oh okay no

166
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:21,120
I got the new toaster it doesn't match the dishwashers and I got to get a new dishwasher you know of course I'm making

167
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:26,700
this up but there's a way right in which there can just be it's we get to what

168
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:32,580
we're after but there's no sense of ease or satisfaction it's just like as I said

169
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:38,460
kind of like this hedonic treadmill so that's part of how we can discern is

170
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:45,539
whether it's helpful or not helpful so part of working with sensory desires

171
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:52,620
just to recognize it's happening and then to notice okay this is helpful

172
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:57,900
or unhelpful then some other things that we can do

173
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:05,039
is to look at what is the experience of Desiring

174
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:12,539
how does that feel how does it feel in the body Tonya talked about leaning forward and I

175
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:18,720
noticed that when I'm talking about desired I'm talking about toaster I just my body I was automatically going like this and there's this toaster out there

176
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:25,080
my body was automatically going forward like whether we think about it or not our body is you know often expressing

177
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:32,760
these things but it can be really helpful to notice what is the bodily experience

178
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:43,158
because if we pay attention we'll see that there's a certain amount of contraction or tightness or

179
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:48,720
there isn't a sense of ease and openness and relaxation there's a little bit more

180
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:55,500
of a doggedness like okay I gotta get this there's a certain tightness that's associated with it that often we don't

181
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:01,080
notice because we're paying attention to the object oh look how beautiful it is those

182
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:06,440
curves and it's shiny and it looks so great

183
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:15,240
Tony is loving it by the way I'm talking about the toaster I'm laughing about the way that you're talking about The Wizard

184
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:20,820
of Oz and this is great I think right the entrance is right we need to bring some levity to them

185
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:25,980
otherwise it can feel like oh heavy and but

186
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:33,020
so what can we do some things also is to maybe essentially

187
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:38,880
direct the Mind elsewhere away from that object of Desire one way we can practice

188
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,100
just in daily life and that might be a little bit of a little bit of

189
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:50,760
Destruction in terms of okay just what am I doing right now

190
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:56,120
and can I be embodied and present with what I'm doing

191
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:03,900
because sometimes what we're what we're doing is different than the desire like what we're doing is we're like trying to

192
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:11,460
find what it is that we're designing here I am leaning my body for it it's um so instead can we just be

193
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:18,000
present for our experience but maybe I'm not explaining this well that um maybe

194
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:26,220
like to apply ourselves a little bit more diligently or a little bit more energy to what we're doing uh maybe

195
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:33,299
that's distinct from the desire let's make that distinction so that maybe um if we're

196
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:38,340
standing in the kitchen just to be standing

197
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:46,860
for a trump if we're putting butter on the toast after it came out of the bad toaster then we can just like be with

198
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:52,860
that maybe I didn't explain that well but essentially it's kind of like

199
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:59,159
distracting yourself away from the desire and just be with what you're doing

200
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:06,960
and then something else that we can do is a support for practicing with desire is something that's not so easy to do

201
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:14,820
and really easy to miss is to notice the sense of ease

202
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:20,460
spaciousness is there when the desire is gone

203
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:25,500
and often we won't notice when the desire just goes away but it might be

204
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:32,460
like 10 minutes one hour 30 minutes I don't know how long later we're like oh yeah I don't have that desire anymore

205
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:37,860
and then just kind of feel in oh yeah there isn't that little sense of urgency

206
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:44,400
or tightness that was associated with it before the more often we can do this notice

207
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:51,380
this subtle sense of ease and freedom after the desire a husband satisfied

208
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:59,340
because once the body and the mind notice oh yeah not having it is actually

209
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:06,120
a pleasant state and really supports our being open to what's happening and what we might want

210
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:11,940
to do with our life then there'll be more inclination to connect with that

211
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:17,580
but this is not easy it takes kind of like a commitment or a reminder to

212
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:24,779
notice oh yeah I had that desire before and it's not here now

213
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:30,179
as to see the notice of the feeling so now I'll talk a little bit about kind

214
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:35,340
of like the flip side so aversion and ill will first I'll make a little bit of

215
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:41,760
a distinction between aversion and AOL aversion is just kind of like this pushing away just as Tanya said like

216
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:48,600
okay you know I don't want this and then for me I would say it will is like I don't want this and there's a little

217
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:55,799
flavor of hostility in there a little flavor of like dang it go away get out of here you know

218
00:28:55,799 --> 00:29:03,120
something like that with a little bit of a of a tone or something like this

219
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:09,840
so sometimes um we might might say like anger or resentment or having a grudge or

220
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:16,020
resistance these types of things or associated with aversion and ill will

221
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:21,720
and as we talked about earlier we might even say that fear is here too but fear

222
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:27,740
is a is a part of hindrances and it will because sometimes

223
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:33,179
with the ill will is because we are afraid that that's going to be

224
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:38,460
uncomfortable or we're afraid that it's going to whatever it is we're afraid of

225
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:45,899
so we have a certain amount of get go away because we think it's gonna um we're afraid of it we don't want it to

226
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:52,980
be around like like The Wizard of Oz oh there you go thank you who was afraid of the wicked witch coming to the Land of

227
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:59,279
Oz and so it's like go away Dorothy thank you Tonya you're absolutely right

228
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:09,899
that's absolutely right and then just like I was saying with uh desire old turning away or aversion is

229
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:17,880
not bad right of course it's healthy to have boundaries to say okay this is

230
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:24,480
acceptable this isn't I'm willing this is okay to have in my experience and this isn't I'm gonna walk away from

231
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:30,360
somebody who's yelling at me that's inappropriate for them to be treating me that way and to be walking away right

232
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:36,720
that's not a hindrance so it's the same thing for it to have the sensitivity of okay is this skillful

233
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,760
or unskillful is this helpful or unhelpful just in the same way that we're going to

234
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:48,299
do with desire and in the same way with a desire just

235
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:54,059
to recognize that the role of understanding it

236
00:30:54,059 --> 00:31:01,080
requires that we be present when it's there so to have this how does it feel in the

237
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:08,640
body what is the mind doing when we have this sense of aversion again we will feel a certain sense of

238
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:18,000
contraction and in the same way with desire I should say there can be a strong sense of me here and that thing

239
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,399
over there there's a really strong sense that there's these two things me against

240
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:29,460
the world in some kind of way so that thing over there I either want it or I don't want it and there's a real strong

241
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:36,179
sense of me here and this can be uh vague when I'm

242
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:44,100
talking about this but if you tune in you can notice that when we're not filled with desire or it will that the

243
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:49,860
sense of me being isolated and separate and disdained from everything else isn't

244
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:59,179
so strong and when that isn't so strong there's also more ease more freedom and peace

245
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:07,200
so one thing that we can also look at for desire I'm sorry for ill will

246
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:15,539
is to if especially if this is like a habit of ours is to notice what purpose

247
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:22,140
does it have in our life what's like underneath fueling it

248
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:29,360
some examples might be that we have some beliefs that we have some

249
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:35,480
beliefs that maybe aren't so clear for example

250
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:43,679
I can keep myself safe if I push everything away that's going to make me

251
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:52,020
uncomfortable this is a way to make myself safe or maybe we can have this um

252
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:57,659
having it will gives me a sense of Vitality like when we're really angry or

253
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:04,140
mad and trying to get rid of something there's a energy that goes through and it's like it feels like we're alive there's a little bit of drama associated

254
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:10,200
with it and we feel alive I mean it might feel like if I don't

255
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:18,899
have that then what would my life feel like or maybe we might have a another sense

256
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:24,240
of well I'm a person that belongs to this group

257
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,820
and this group likes this and doesn't like that so I don't like that and I

258
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:37,320
really don't like that because I want to be part of this group and so it's a way in which our sense of

259
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:43,860
identity is can be associated with you know having some ill will or some aversion towards something maybe the

260
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:50,760
same way with the desire to so just to have a some curiosity about like

261
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:57,720
what's underneath what's fueling and to recognize that there's often some hidden beliefs about it

262
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:04,860
and then maybe the last thing that I'll say about uh ill will or aversion is we kind of

263
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:10,618
actively apply an antidote and the obvious one is loving-kindness

264
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:16,740
so if you have a loving kindness practice you can bring this bring it in I'm not going to go into details about

265
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:22,260
what loving-kindness practice is but I do want to say one thing I am not

266
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:30,240
talking about having loving kindness for the same thing that we have ill will for that's a really tall order

267
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:35,638
what I'm talking about is just changing the ecosystem Inside the Mind

268
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:42,240
into like soften and like disrupt the momentum so loving kindness practice is

269
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:48,720
to like bring to mind the easiest thing to have loving kindness for kittens

270
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:54,540
puppies babies grandkids pets this type of thing bring those to mine and you

271
00:34:54,540 --> 00:35:01,020
notice how when you bring those to mine right then the the temperature of the ill Wellness version can come down

272
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:07,140
so that's Diana's little desire and aversion a little overview of that and

273
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:10,519
I'll turn it back to Tanya

274
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:18,720
you guys ready to do a practice great

275
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:26,339
so I'll guide you through the practice of raft it's an acronym I'll tell you what each letter stands for

276
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:34,079
R is the recognition a is allowing f is finding it and feeling it

277
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:40,079
there's two T's the first is teasing apart most simply put what's going on

278
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:46,859
from our reaction to it but it can be much more complicated and the last T is finding what we can

279
00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:53,220
trust in our practice so I'll guide you through it but I just wanted to give you the lay of the land

280
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:59,940
before we start so taking just a minute to settle in I'm

281
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:06,300
going to drop in a question for you to kind of just see what what

282
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:12,119
answer arrives and the first thing I want you to do is

283
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:17,700
to notice whenever your answer arrives if this is something that's just kind of

284
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:23,940
too big to work with right now and if it is just ask yourself the question again okay

285
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:29,220
so the question is what do I think needs to be different in

286
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,119
my life right now

287
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:51,180
so allowing yourself to connect or choose an answer

288
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:57,720
that feels like something that you can work with in this practice and that's in this room without getting kind of

289
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,440
overwhelmed

290
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:09,599
so do you all have a sense of something that you think needs to be different in

291
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,880
your life right now it could be very small

292
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:22,280
yes yes great yeah Jay

293
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:27,420
they're all big no small [Music]

294
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:35,220
yeah I got laid off recently yeah but in the small area I could say

295
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:39,119
he didn't require okay

296
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,579
okay great great perfect okay

297
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:53,880
all right so now the first thing to do so you've got your thing

298
00:37:53,880 --> 00:38:00,680
now just check in we're recognizing we want something to be different

299
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:07,260
do we want it to be better so is there some greed present

300
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:12,359
do we want it to go away is there some aversion present so is there a leaning

301
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:20,060
in or a pushing away so just recognize the hindrance

302
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,838
or hindrances

303
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:35,700
once we've recognized it if it's permissible to you

304
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:41,720
we want to allow ourselves to be in the company of the hindrance

305
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:48,200
to see if we can't turn toward the hindrance itself

306
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:57,240
and it doesn't mean endorsing it doesn't mean you know we're going to

307
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:03,000
give in to it but it does mean we're going to stop

308
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:09,000
fighting with it for a moment and allow ourselves to kind of turn Face

309
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,280
to Face and as we do as we find ourselves

310
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:20,099
turning toward see if you can shift your awareness into

311
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:27,780
your body see if you can find and feel where the

312
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:35,240
energy of the hindrance is manifesting in your body

313
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:42,540
what does it feel like what part of your body

314
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:47,820
or parts of your body can you notice it in

315
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:54,119
you might notice it in your throat your chest your hands

316
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:59,700
your shoulders your neck you might notice it in your eyebrows and

317
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:03,859
the little scrunch between your eyes

318
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:13,619
getting quiet enough to be able to receive the sensations in

319
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:19,040
the body connected to the hindrance

320
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:38,280
seeing if you can keep bringing your awareness back to the sensations instead of the story

321
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:44,160
ideas if you have a thought try and follow

322
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:49,579
them like a vibration into the body

323
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:04,440
notice if it's changing we'll do one of three things right

324
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:10,320
can grow can diminish or stay the same what's

325
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:14,960
happening for you In This Moment

326
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:31,519
breathing and sensing

327
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:41,539
being as simple as we can with the experience

328
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:53,060
at some point when you're ready

329
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:59,119
you can move to the next part of the practice

330
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:09,660
in the simplest part of this teasing apart is to see if you can't

331
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:16,740
first just acknowledge there is the thing that we think needs to be different whatever it is

332
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:24,140
and then our reaction to it and that's the wanting or not wanting the reaction

333
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:33,900
for me I find it very helpful to imagine a very spacious room

334
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:41,180
with a round table and as many chairs as I need

335
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:49,980
and with each thing that I see is part of this for example the thing that I think needs

336
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:56,700
to be different can have a chair a seat at the table and my response to it can have another

337
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:02,339
chair inviting them to sit down

338
00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:05,660
see them separately

339
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:14,400
and as you do you may realize there are some other

340
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,920
things that are present here

341
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:27,660
perhaps there's an idea of you an opinion A belief that has to

342
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:33,260
do with why you think you need this thing to be different

343
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:50,220
maybe there's an imagined future that feels threatened and it too needs a

344
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,940
seat at the table

345
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:16,760
there could also be memories from the past

346
00:44:17,339 --> 00:44:20,720
the way it used to be

347
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:32,060
or a different experience altogether that is somehow connected to this one

348
00:44:55,859 --> 00:45:01,440
allowing everything to have as much space as it needs

349
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,780
some of these things you may not want to go near and that's fine

350
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:12,500
some of these things you might feel comfortable sitting down next to

351
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:31,560
another question you can ask is what is the purpose of the hindrance

352
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,800
here

353
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,460
what is it trying to do

354
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:11,180
you could also ask what's feeding or fueling the hindrance

355
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:15,440
what's keeping it going

356
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:24,599
and there's no need to create answers if there's an answer that arises

357
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:30,680
allow it to have a seat if not no problem

358
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:39,540
we're just trying to untangle not create more Tangles right so just simply allowing yourself to

359
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:47,839
acknowledge the different pieces that come to you that are part of the situation

360
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:58,640
and at some point if you feel settled like you're seen clearly

361
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:07,940
you can move on to the next part of the practice this is about trust

362
00:47:08,819 --> 00:47:14,220
what can we trust about our practice

363
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:18,800
about what we've experienced or seen

364
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:26,300
what does it feel like to rest and Trust

365
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:38,839
can we remind ourselves that the hindrance is not Who We Are

366
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:58,880
if there's any sense of ease

367
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:04,640
try to orient toward that ease

368
00:48:14,819 --> 00:48:18,800
just breathing gently with it

369
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:47,339
sometimes if I'm having a hard time resting in the sense of ease or trust I

370
00:48:47,339 --> 00:48:53,160
might remind myself that this experience the hindrance or

371
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:58,460
whatever's going on is will change

372
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:10,440
that the way I'm feeling now will change probably fairly quickly in some way or

373
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,740
another

374
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:25,859
sometimes I just it's really helpful to remind myself that I'm not my experience I'm not limited by

375
00:49:25,859 --> 00:49:30,799
what's happening doesn't Define me

376
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:39,359
and that it's nature really it's something that comes and goes in

377
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:43,160
all of our minds and hearts

378
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:54,980
and if it's really hard I might even put my hand on my heart

379
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:01,099
kind of feel the warmth of my hand there

380
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:08,520
breathing into my heart I might say something like may I be at

381
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:15,019
ease may I have well-being

382
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,200
may I be safe from harm

383
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:41,400
to taking a few more wait minutes to practice in a way that feels supportive

384
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,880
for you

385
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:08,380
[Music]

386
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:20,780
foreign thank you Tanya

387
00:54:22,619 --> 00:54:30,720
so Tanya walked us through our recognize a allow F feel in the body

388
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:36,720
T tease apart with sitting around the table it was very interesting to have these different ideas sit around the

389
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:41,760
table and then to trust maybe some softening I don't think you

390
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:47,960
used exactly that word but and then even a little bit of loving kindness at the end

391
00:54:48,359 --> 00:54:53,819
so we'd love to hear from you guys how was that how was that meditation or

392
00:54:53,819 --> 00:54:58,830
maybe you have some questions about the hindrances in general or maybe even The Wizard of Oz

393
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:06,300
[Laughter] Tony I'll maybe I'll just say one tiny thing that I just imagined you watching

394
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:12,740
this movie with your kids and it made me just really happy when during that meditation so

395
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:27,660
I thought it was super helpful when you did the table I was like I don't know how many chairs

396
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:34,140
I can fill and then they kept coming and I kept adding chairs and it was just kind of nice I sat at the table for a

397
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:38,000
really long time and just recognized

398
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:49,440
I don't know if I put it in there I didn't want to throw on too much but it can also be helpful to allow the the

399
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:55,640
chairs to have relative size you know to like oh that thing is huge

400
00:55:55,640 --> 00:56:01,440
that thing's kind of small and then there's the possibility of a whole new

401
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:06,540
set of insights can come I found myself starting to I was kept

402
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:11,960
moving over yeah good yeah okay we're here

403
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:19,079
yeah it can be as big as it needs to be and and allowing the space to expand as

404
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:25,079
well just if you feel you need more space it's right there yeah yeah very

405
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:27,260
nice

406
00:56:31,859 --> 00:56:38,900
foreign yeah I really appreciated the um the meditation I think

407
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:44,520
between the two of you I was uh uh working through some of the stuff you

408
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:51,660
were talking about as you were talking and then part way through uh through the sit it

409
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:57,480
kind of just dissolved on its own and I just stopped paying attention to what you're saying I was just like appreciating it

410
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:05,819
um so it was really wonderful wise of you Kevin to let it just sit

411
00:57:05,819 --> 00:57:12,599
because one thing I didn't mention but I like to say is we don't always have to

412
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:20,579
go all the way through sometimes it's the simple Act of recognition and that's all that's needed

413
00:57:20,579 --> 00:57:25,859
like there's an almost an instant recognizing and allowing and it just dissolves

414
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:32,099
so you only go as far as you need to go you know in the practice sometimes

415
00:57:32,099 --> 00:57:39,119
there's really nothing to tease apart so you can just you know it's just kind of letting yourself rest

416
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:45,000
so yeah thank you for sharing that or maybe it even starts with feeling in

417
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:50,640
the body maybe just like oh there's some tightness here and then there's a

418
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:58,020
recognition allowing or maybe there's just something in the body and then some allowing so all right f t is nice I like

419
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:04,020
this idea of a raft that's going to take us over to safety or something like this but it doesn't have to we don't have to

420
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:11,579
do that acronym in that order and I won't say what other words I have thought of other words that uh

421
00:58:11,579 --> 00:58:19,099
oh never mind [Laughter] you'll have to tell me later

422
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:26,300
anybody else have a comment or

423
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:37,440
so um what if it's something that you wanted to fix a bunch of times in your life you

424
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:43,799
have fixed it before you're looking at it again how does that change

425
00:58:43,799 --> 00:58:50,700
if anything yeah well I mean just for tonight part of it was trying to could

426
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:55,740
you feel there's what you want to change could you feel into just that feeling of

427
00:58:55,740 --> 00:59:01,920
wanting to change it oh sure great okay so part of that tonight was just about

428
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:09,000
like this trying to get used to and recognize what the hindrance the not liking or the not wanting or the wanting

429
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:15,720
right feels like the impact of it so okay and so your question what if you've

430
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:22,880
already changed this thing many times and now you want to change it again

431
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:30,559
so can I ask you a question sure why are you asking this question

432
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:38,640
partially yes intellectual intellectual interest does it change the the model at all okay

433
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:46,079
okay is there an additional Insight that comes from thinking about some of these things do recur right and is there

434
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:51,780
wisdom and when you look at it a second third fourth time uh is there some additional

435
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:58,079
thing that comes that can be brought to bear mostly intellectual and interesting yeah

436
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:03,119
well I would say this is not an it's not an intellectual practice

437
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:10,140
no my question is it comes from yes but if you ask me why why the question yeah yeah yeah and so I would say experience

438
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:16,200
it find out you know what I mean like because the answer could be there's more there's not

439
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:22,740
more but you won't you wouldn't know that until until you did the practice does that make sense

440
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:29,880
maybe Diana if you have a a response uh yeah because maybe if something

441
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:36,240
that's recurring and you've done it before I would say pay attention to what's fueling it why is it recurring

442
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:41,400
but the uh when I'm saying pay attention I'm not necessarily saying dig and

443
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:46,980
figure it out it's maybe like Drop in like what is fueling this kind of like this dropping

444
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:55,740
in this question I'm doing this with my hands because it is more like an opening and like I wonder why this is occurring

445
01:00:55,740 --> 01:01:01,740
so it's a spirit of curiosity as opposed to I got to figure this out and sometimes when we do that then something

446
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:08,400
new will Bubble Up and then we can maybe work with whatever the new thing is sometimes if something is repeating

447
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:13,799
there's a reason and there's something underneath it so that might be something I could offer

448
01:01:13,799 --> 01:01:19,319
so we might learn something about ourselves some of our beliefs that we have that are fueling these types of

449
01:01:19,319 --> 01:01:25,980
things and it's these underlying beliefs that are when we recognize them and allow

450
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:33,619
them to lose some of their Authority this is where a real transformation happens

451
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:50,760
yes thank you that's I thought of that too that's a great idea just bring this to the table that I do I've done this so

452
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:58,520
many times before okay you get to sit in that chair yeah put a bigger chair

453
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:06,839
okay so now I'd like to provide an opportunity for you guys to talk to each other

454
01:02:06,839 --> 01:02:12,960
and about this and maybe we'll just have them be in one group together yeah

455
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:18,780
so we'll just uh we can go around this circle you guys will make a little

456
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:24,540
circle and then just one person will speak well everybody else is listening and then the next person will go the

457
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:30,839
next person the next person and we'll um do two questions and I'll give you one and then after I give you guys some time

458
01:02:30,839 --> 01:02:39,900
then I do the second one so maybe spend two minutes on your description or of

459
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:45,780
what you're discussing two minutes each yeah sorry

460
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:52,140
um so the first one is what role

461
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:59,700
does the pursuit of sensory pleasure or ill will have in your life is this something that is a real dominant

462
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:06,299
feature that you're seeing showing up all over the place where you're like no I'm pretty equanimous most of the time

463
01:03:06,299 --> 01:03:12,420
where are you finding yeah I my um ill will my anger gets me into a lot of

464
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:20,579
trouble or my shopping all the time gets me into trouble or something you don't have to share your deep dark secrets but

465
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:25,859
just this recognition what role do they have in your life

466
01:03:25,859 --> 01:03:32,339
so and I'll just add it could be protective roles yeah very nice right it's not just that it gets you in

467
01:03:32,339 --> 01:03:37,559
trouble but it may be it distracts you from something that's difficult you know

468
01:03:37,559 --> 01:03:44,819
so just just to like kind of because maybe there's a better way to do it but still it's how it has a role thank you

469
01:03:44,819 --> 01:03:50,460
thank you and maybe talk about the magnitude like it's really big or really small or

470
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:57,000
something like this then after you guys have been in a circle for a little bit then I'll give you a second question so

471
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:02,720
if you guys want to sit closer so you don't have to yell across the room

472
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:10,680
so two minutes per person yeah yeah two two minutes per person sorry I didn't

473
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,280
make that clear

474
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:18,078
thank you

475
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:42,600
hey you guys finished we finished around the same time so here's the second question

476
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:49,980
what meaningful or satisfying feelings do you have that are not connected the sensory

477
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:57,000
desire or ill will like what else in your life what are alternatives to sensory desire or ill will what are

478
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:02,520
meaningful or satisfying feelings you have which are not connected to sensory

479
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:09,020
desire or AOL yeah generosity gratitude

480
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:14,460
love you know these these types of things so what are some of the

481
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:20,599
I mean some of the feelings that you have and we'll just do the same thing going around the circle

482
01:19:23,239 --> 01:19:26,239
thank you

483
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:40,280
thank you I actually started singing myself

484
01:19:50,699 --> 01:19:56,420
it's not music is it is

485
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:13,260
have you finished did you all get a chance to share great you feel like

486
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:20,178
sharing it all about your sharing or meta sharing

487
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:29,480
you know what was the value of this time together for you

488
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:33,560
any questions

489
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:42,540
it all starts that uh I shared with Tanya like

490
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:49,380
before I like started this practice I had no idea how much like the this kind of like desire was like so much a part

491
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:55,140
of my life I'm like always trying to get the next thing sometimes it's books or yeah I don't

492
01:20:55,140 --> 01:21:01,140
know it's what's amazing to see and how much a habit it is kind of like

493
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:07,739
okay I wanna start a new habit okay well then I must need to buy something in order that I

494
01:21:07,739 --> 01:21:13,500
can start a gratitude practice I need a gratitude journal or I don't know I'm just you know it's just kind of it's

495
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:18,540
quite something so with practice it definitely has lesson

496
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:21,800
but sometimes I find myself

497
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:32,699
anybody else want to like talk about I don't have to as I said share any deep dark secrets but what was it like to

498
01:21:32,699 --> 01:21:38,520
look at the role of Desire nail will and then after that to look at okay what are

499
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:43,739
some things that are nourishing and supportive that are independent

500
01:21:43,739 --> 01:21:51,560
desire now well how was how was that like the contrast maybe between the two

501
01:21:57,110 --> 01:22:01,650
[Laughter]

502
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:09,179
I was talking a lot about how anger and fear are really big for me

503
01:22:09,179 --> 01:22:15,120
in my life right now and often it can feel like a really big

504
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:22,560
chair so what I do is I find myself sitting in a bench on a bench at a park

505
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:28,140
um watching the dogs and the kids and the Nate like the trees and the birds

506
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:34,080
you know you just kind of get lost in the nature of Life happening and it

507
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:40,380
helps me a lot yeah yeah stick yeah it's amazing right spending

508
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:46,199
time in nature it's like really you know how supportive for whatever is going on

509
01:22:46,199 --> 01:22:52,080
even when you're really happy it's nice to be a teacher yeah thank you thank you

510
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:57,420
yeah yeah I had mentioned I don't know if it's distracting me from dealing with the

511
01:22:57,420 --> 01:23:03,000
actual hindrances but it feels good so yeah yeah I I wouldn't worry whether

512
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:09,840
it's distracting you sometimes we need to spend time on side hanging out with trees and dogs and kids

513
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:16,380
well then um by abandoning the hindrances you know by by picking up the

514
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:22,020
nature you abandon the hindrance right so it's a beautiful thing it's wise

515
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:27,380
effort you know you're redirecting your attention

516
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:37,620
um yeah I I found it um yeah talking about

517
01:23:37,620 --> 01:23:43,020
um kind of the challenges and then when you pose the question what doesn't I was like oh this is great

518
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:48,659
um it was really nice to compare and contrast um I guess the clinging the non-clinging

519
01:23:48,659 --> 01:23:54,960
and keep things in perspective but I also found it really interesting

520
01:23:54,960 --> 01:24:01,520
to listen to everyone else what supports them and I think I'm going to steal all your guys's things

521
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:06,780
hopefully it's given freely and um yeah and it was also really nice just

522
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:09,500
to be in the community

523
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:19,620
but um so there's you know generosity nature

524
01:24:19,620 --> 01:24:25,380
um connecting with the Arts you know this creativity

525
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:30,780
um yeah and actually Gus did mention he joined the choir I started taking voice

526
01:24:30,780 --> 01:24:37,679
lessons recently but I just go karaoke by myself I was like oh I think a choir would be that that sounds cool

527
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:44,900
yeah it's like uh joining your voices together that sounds interesting yeah

528
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:55,880
one of the things I realized is that um

529
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:04,980
sometimes you can get real learning you're going to recognize the term from orthogonal sources right I mean not

530
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:10,980
along the path of where you're headed but things that you don't really would not consider but

531
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:18,000
if you put yourself in those situations and if you are open to that learning will come in a way that is not

532
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:23,340
predictable a priori but being in them

533
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:28,860
uh is very helpful and that that was part of the I mean I was just mentioning

534
01:25:28,860 --> 01:25:35,400
I decided a couple months ago that every week I'm gonna go do something with the Arts period whether I go see a symphony or a museum or whatever just do

535
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:40,440
something right because in the end it feeds my soul this is something I've known all my life but you

536
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:46,140
know I haven't done a lot of and so like no just just go do it and it may not be directly

537
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:54,179
predictable how that's going to impact me but it doesn't matter it it is something that when I do it

538
01:25:54,179 --> 01:26:00,420
I feel awe and I feel Joy I feel gratitude and it's totally

539
01:26:00,420 --> 01:26:07,380
separate from the the craving and the diversion right

540
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:12,739
thank you guys nice can I come with you

541
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:18,380
go to the museum yeah we can all go together

542
01:26:18,730 --> 01:26:24,300
[Music] girl

543
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:32,219
okay sorry use the Michael yeah

544
01:26:32,219 --> 01:26:37,800
um so I realized one of these one of my

545
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:43,080
um weak areas of practice with generosity I

546
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:49,260
could do mindfulness of breath you know body scans what all this stuff whether it's not having a regular

547
01:26:49,260 --> 01:26:54,719
generosity part and it was not integrated and I remember you know listening to

548
01:26:54,719 --> 01:27:00,840
some drama talks and Gil was talking the emphasis on it and some examples they give us great and I

549
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:06,600
won't go into that but the point that they wanted me to share is so I figured out okay in my budget

550
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:12,000
what can I do so I have some you know severe Financial limitations

551
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:17,460
and you know in my area there's a lot of homeless quite now it's even really

552
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:23,460
severe and sometimes even like food they would not take and but I figured out almost

553
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:29,159
everybody would take like a cold soda not Coke and those are really cheap if you buy

554
01:27:29,159 --> 01:27:35,340
like three 12 packs they give you two for free in safe years and I can buy like huge amounts and it's pretty cheap it's like you know

555
01:27:35,340 --> 01:27:42,360
40 cents a can or something so I throw it in the fridge and every day I'll put two in my backpack and before I

556
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:48,300
come home they have to be gone so my part of my mind is scanning for okay who can I give it who can I give it

557
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:54,239
and sometimes it's honestly a homeless guy some guy a security guard at the door like yourself travel friendship and

558
01:27:54,239 --> 01:27:59,520
say hey you want to soda and it it opens the door to a conversation sometimes you know and you know if it's just a bridge

559
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:06,420
sometimes and sometimes it's the homeless guys love just it's not the coke even you know for them it's like

560
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:12,239
you see me you know they feel so invisible everybody's walking by non-stop he's got this thing on and

561
01:28:12,239 --> 01:28:17,880
there's so many homeless people also overwhelmed you know and just this even if it's not like hundred bucks it's like

562
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:23,580
okay wow you know somebody sees me you know so and just in that I can't I can I can I can feel it because even when he

563
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:29,520
says that God bless you you can feel the sort of almost a grief in him of you know I need to be touched and so on

564
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:35,040
so you know it's been an experiment for a few months now and so far I'm loving

565
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:41,179
it I'm not stopped you know so it's still going well there's such a budget in my budget

566
01:28:41,179 --> 01:28:47,219
what a great idea beautiful great idea I hadn't thought of that it's such a great

567
01:28:47,219 --> 01:28:53,100
idea and I can imagine even if you're homeless maybe you don't have cold drinks very often either exactly yeah I

568
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:59,960
usually just give you know regular dinner list the cold adds an extra punch to it you know they're like whoa it's cold

569
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:11,280
it reminds me of a practice I did for a while which was to like literally

570
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:17,880
when I was approaching a crosswalk or a four-way stop to really stop early

571
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:23,340
like so that if there was any pedestrians there was a generosity of space

572
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:29,580
right this essence of offering safeness to people and it would create a

573
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:37,560
connection often that people would really like it they kind of would take it in make eye contact or or I just felt

574
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:42,659
Joy because it just felt like a sweet thing to be doing yeah

575
01:29:42,659 --> 01:29:49,860
I think it's nice to be creative about how we are generous with others because there's there's what we do with that has

576
01:29:49,860 --> 01:29:55,139
to do with objects and money but there's also what we give with our attention

577
01:29:55,139 --> 01:30:00,900
which you're also describing right giving your attention acknowledging someone

578
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:05,840
you know yeah that's great

579
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:16,260
well anything else so it's great I loved hearing from you

580
01:30:16,260 --> 01:30:23,340
guys yeah really really lovely really fun so um maybe I'll just do a very brief

581
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:29,760
summary of the key points and um and then we'll we'll wrap it up

582
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:36,420
so I think just the reminder reminder so you've heard this before is

583
01:30:36,420 --> 01:30:42,540
to invite more of a sense of curiosity lightness playfulness

584
01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:50,060
when you are working with experiencing thinking about the hindrances

585
01:30:51,600 --> 01:31:00,239
just think about the Wizard of Oz foreign and remember we're not saying that all

586
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:07,020
desire is bad or that all you know aversion is bad you know it's is it

587
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:15,000
hindering is it wholesome is it skillful if it's not hindering

588
01:31:15,060 --> 01:31:21,300
you know great right if it's not causing harm

589
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:29,658
you know just watch out for your clinging watch out for identifying with it right

590
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:37,380
um so you know some of the skillful things are to if you see like the most subtle

591
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:44,460
lay at level is you can kind of try and ignore the ill will and just kind of redirect your energy right or your

592
01:31:44,460 --> 01:31:49,500
desire trying not to feed it so just don't you don't have to give it a ton of

593
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:55,560
attention is one method another is to reactively redirect your attention right

594
01:31:55,560 --> 01:32:00,900
to or try and re-engage in a different way that isn't feeding into the desire

595
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:06,360
or aversion to notice what you're doing that feeds

596
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:11,460
it and stop feeding it if possible like you know

597
01:32:11,460 --> 01:32:16,560
um we can you know feed a version if we

598
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:21,840
think that you know for example if we're being critical of something

599
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:27,540
maybe our boss who's you know and our co-workers appreciate that we're being

600
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:32,760
critical because we're speaking to a problem

601
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:37,860
wanting our approval of our co-workers or wanting to advocate for them can be

602
01:32:37,860 --> 01:32:43,560
feeding aversion in that situation so we need to pay attention to like

603
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:52,340
what's feeding it and then make sure we check ourselves and that we're not engaging in things that are causing harm

604
01:32:52,620 --> 01:33:02,040
it's helpful sometimes to to kind of pull away or remove things that trigger aversion and and desire you know like

605
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:07,440
maybe you don't go on Amazon you know maybe there's various things

606
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:14,639
that you do to kind of take a break right from the normal triggers

607
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:20,159
um and really notice when when the you know desire and aversion are present and

608
01:33:20,159 --> 01:33:25,500
then when they're gone don't just not just when they're there but when are they absent

609
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:30,719
and when they're absent appreciate what it that absence feels

610
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:36,659
like usually there's a sense of more being at ease more being settled

611
01:33:36,659 --> 01:33:42,679
there's not this and there's not that it's more

612
01:33:43,139 --> 01:33:50,880
so notice that savor it appreciate it and try and sustain it so you might

613
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:57,420
notice then the mind oh my God it's so relentless pretty soon you can start to

614
01:33:57,420 --> 01:34:03,300
feel and the mind will just offer this next thing you need to go get or do or get rid of

615
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:10,560
and if you're if you're staying close closer to the ease you can feel the dis-ease that starts to

616
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:16,940
arise with that and you might say not now not now

617
01:34:18,540 --> 01:34:27,480
all right Diana you wanna you know I have uh here my my job now is

618
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:32,580
to remind about the homework but the homework that I have written down I don't think it's for this no the hinders

619
01:34:32,580 --> 01:34:38,639
didn't get updated so um it's on the handout though right yes and of course I

620
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:48,080
only brought one of the two handouts so you know so I'll just make up some homework great

621
01:34:48,540 --> 01:34:53,639
I think it could be really helpful to like before our meditation period to

622
01:34:53,639 --> 01:34:59,040
remember tap into what you talked about those things that are supportive that

623
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:06,719
are not with desire and ill will going to the Arts being generous with the homeless spending time in nature just

624
01:35:06,719 --> 01:35:13,500
bring those to mind before your meditation period and just see how meditation unfolds

625
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:19,199
just like how does that support the maybe some openness or some ease with meditation

626
01:35:19,199 --> 01:35:25,860
so play around with that okay so here we are at the top of the

627
01:35:25,860 --> 01:35:31,920
hour it was uh great being here with you guys practicing together

628
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:37,639
and we'll see you next week thank you
