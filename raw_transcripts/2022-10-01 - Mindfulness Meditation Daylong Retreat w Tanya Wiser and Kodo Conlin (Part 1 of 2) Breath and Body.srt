[Music]

14
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:49,440
I thought if it's okay with everyone just while I welcome you I would take off my mask for a minute and put it back

15
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:55,279
on good morning

16
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:05,880
so nice to be with all of you in my estimation it could be a perfect day for mindfulness

17
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:12,600
sort of settled feeling from the clouds and the light this time

18
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:18,419
my name is codo conlon this is my friend and colleague Tanya Weiser

19
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:24,960
and this is Insight Meditation Center and you've come online or in person for

20
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,240
a day long of mindfulness first thing I'd like to do is welcome

21
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,419
all of you welcome everyone and to state that everyone is welcome

22
00:28:35,419 --> 00:28:41,700
whenever your background or history or your location whether that be

23
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:48,620
geographical or social everyone is welcome here to do the practice

24
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:56,100
so I welcome you um one of the ways that IMC as a as a

25
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:03,120
center I think supports the feeling of Welcome is that everything we do is freely given

26
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:10,080
everything isn't that amazing and we offer the teachings as a in the

27
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:16,620
spirit of a gift and if at the at the end of the day you feel inspired to support support what we

28
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:23,960
do here they're ways to give a box there and a kiosk over there

29
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,960
as I was sitting here I was realizing there's some of course I have my plans and my notes

30
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:39,960
for what I want to say and then there's a way that we make the day of practice together

31
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:46,020
so as I was sitting here and my heart was sort of settling in and my body was settling in

32
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:52,080
what came to my mind as what we're doing today is um

33
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:59,340
one way to understand it we're making peace we're making making peace

34
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:06,919
with ourselves for ourselves with each other for each other peace with experience

35
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:12,299
there's something about that that helps me to settle in and feel welcome and safe

36
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:15,620
here in this space

37
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:25,320
so today the the [Music] idea will be we will move through the

38
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:31,080
progressive instructions of mindfulness meditation pretty gently guided

39
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:37,440
pretty gently guided mostly we're practicing together today sitting and walking practice and then

40
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:44,000
there are some sign ups for those of you are here there's sign ups for practice discussions that we can do

41
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,600
Tanya is there anything you'd like to add to the beginning

42
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,039
thank you Coda yeah

43
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,820
and don't hesitate to ask for a sign up for a practice discussion kodo and I are

44
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:11,880
here so it's just the sign up sheet at the end of the stage gives you 5 or 10 to 15

45
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:17,159
minutes to just ask a couple of questions about your practice

46
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:25,158
and um I'm just curious a little bit about your experience with practice

47
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:32,960
um so does anybody here feel pretty new to meditation

48
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:39,179
okay Joe yeah

49
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:49,380
yeah great um so anybody feel like um

50
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:56,299
uncomfortable with not having a lot of instructions during the meditation periods

51
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:02,220
you do Joe yeah and you do too Tina and you do too okay

52
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:11,220
so we'll we'll maybe modify a little bit happy to yeah um and try is anybody find

53
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:16,799
getting you know a little bit more instructions disruptive to your practice

54
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:23,700
those of you who have more experience is that okay yeah great great great

55
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:29,700
okay good is there anything else yeah one other

56
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:36,899
thing is um we'll have Hillary was here to get us started as the manager Sally will be

57
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:44,880
here at the end of the day part of the practice here is that we clean up the center together afterwards

58
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:51,480
so um are there some people who are willing to commit to sticking around it takes about 15 minutes after the end of the

59
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:58,200
day one two three four five great great and anybody else if you want to stick

60
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:06,080
around the more we can do more if there's more of us but the basics are great so

61
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:13,460
okay that's what I wanted to add great anything else you want to say

62
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:22,679
I can say maybe just a just to orient to the space would be a good thing to do

63
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:27,919
um most important things you're in the meditation home

64
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:33,659
restrooms are over here there's water hot and cold water and kitchen around

65
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:38,760
the corner if you need that um where will we be doing practice

66
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:44,399
discussions outside oh good yeah so um

67
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:49,799
we'll we'll do we'll set up some chairs in the parking lot okay on that side of

68
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:52,100
the building

69
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:01,320
so what I have inside will be pretty much silent unless there's a need to

70
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:05,778
talk for logistic or for question and answer

71
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:14,099
you want me to say anything about lunchtime anybody curious about lunch situation Corey that was a yes for you

72
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:21,720
or no yeah okay great um so we'll keep silence inside we have

73
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:29,040
tables um and we can put a table over in front of the redwood tree which could be for

74
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:34,440
silence people who don't want to talk during lunch and then in the parking lot we'll put a

75
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:41,398
couple of tables where people can talk so um so it's important just to tune into what

76
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:47,700
feels right for you and maybe you decide to eat it under the redwood tree and then you move to the other tables

77
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:55,740
because you wanna connect with Sangha right it's not we're not seeing much of each other the way we

78
00:34:55,740 --> 00:35:02,580
used to before covid so we're trying to create whereas normally maybe we'd have a full silent lunch here

79
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:07,859
we want to support connecting so if you feel like you want to connect

80
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:15,859
with people and I'll give a little bit more instructions later but we'll have lunch at 12 I'm pretty sure

81
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:21,420
um oh yeah that's easier 12 30 looks like 12 30. um

82
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:27,780
there's microwaves in the fridge in the kitchen if you brought your lunch if you did not there's a few places that you

83
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:34,079
can walk to on Broadway that are pretty fast to get your food so did I answer your questions about

84
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:39,960
lunch say enough about it we'll have an hour great

85
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,380
okay

86
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:06,480
so I'm just going to take a breath for a minute invite you to do the same I'm just going to kind of come back into my cell for a

87
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:14,480
minute here and the first part of the instructions will be mindfulness of breathing

88
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:18,560
so we'll ready ourselves

89
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:30,079
and I'll do a little bit of extra talking at the beginning to orient ground toward this practice

90
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:46,560
So the instructions I'll do this little bit of talking and then I'll kind of do

91
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:52,500
some more centering to move into like more of a guided meditation just just to

92
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:59,579
orient you to what to expect the day and the way the practice is

93
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:04,339
taught here is we start with mindfulness of breathing

94
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:11,280
and then we move on to mindfulness of body emotions thoughts and open

95
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:19,940
awareness throughout the day and we start with the breath

96
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:27,800
because for those of us who are comfortable tuning into the breathing

97
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:35,400
it's so accessible it's moving and flowing through our

98
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:42,740
bodies it's a constant rhythm

99
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:50,059
something that we can tune into that's in the present moment

100
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:59,040
it's a beautiful support for practice when it works for us and if it doesn't

101
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:04,859
there are some other things you can focus on I'll talk more about them now

102
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:12,000
but in whenever I use the word breath if breath doesn't work for you you can substitute it with hearing

103
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:19,740
sound or Sensations so you have kind of those three options

104
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:25,380
to help yourself with this morning's practice and

105
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:33,720
throughout the day it's a focusing on the breathing

106
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:40,859
helps us stay connected here without getting lost in our thoughts those little mini movies that happen in

107
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:48,240
our minds all the time and with the breath moving the way it

108
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:53,780
does changing flowing

109
00:38:55,079 --> 00:39:00,599
we can always bring our attention back again to it over and over again when we

110
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:03,200
wander away

111
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:13,740
there's an analogy that we're using the breath like an

112
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:21,560
anchor so a sailboat comes into the bay and

113
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:29,160
if they don't want it to float away or get pushed up onto the rocks

114
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:36,720
we drop an anchor at anchor grounds and holds the boat in

115
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,200
relative steadiness

116
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:48,240
in the same way our breath can be our anchor helping us

117
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:56,599
not get carried out to sea or turned over by our emotions

118
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:05,900
or maybe even abandon the practice altogether getting up and walking doing other things

119
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:15,660
so when we have an anchor we start to stabilize the mind we give

120
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:21,359
it something to hold on to in a way

121
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:24,920
to stay connected to

122
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:38,820
and we will wander the tide changes the waves change

123
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:46,338
so do the conditions inside of ourselves our minds and hearts and bodies

124
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:53,940
you know an anchor on a boat that has a a long

125
00:40:53,940 --> 00:41:03,240
rope or line so you know we the boat does move

126
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:10,200
and then you know maybe when the boat gets pulled too far

127
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:15,780
it starts to tug on the anchor in the same way something can happen quite naturally for

128
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:21,540
us is if we wander at some point we'll wake up we'll

129
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:29,460
realize it and that's a little like the Rope tugging on the anchor we're right there right there the the

130
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:32,540
anchor is back

131
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:45,839
to doing this as gently as we can and

132
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:53,220
awake and aware with this intention

133
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:57,980
to stay this day

134
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:09,200
if you choose the anchor of sound instead of breath

135
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:18,420
the invitation is to receive sound when it comes your way we don't need to go out and find sound

136
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:27,900
it will come to you and when we listen when we allow hearing

137
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:33,180
we can tune into how it feels in our body where it resonates the same way we

138
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,838
do with breathing

139
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:44,000
if we choose Sensations to be our anchor

140
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:50,280
it can be helpful to choose something like our feet or our hands

141
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:55,800
and then you know there's other Sensations that will come in our body but we can have a kind of an anchor of

142
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:00,740
our hand and hand or our feet on the Earth

143
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:12,380
so let's take a moment to lift our shoulders

144
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:18,540
unroll them back and open up the chest [Applause]

145
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:27,260
might do that a couple of times you might bring your shoulders your elbows toward each other in the back

146
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:34,339
and naturally then the body can take a deeper breath

147
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:42,920
so allowing a few longer slower deeper breaths with this opening

148
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:52,319
and then finding this posture is balance between alertness and

149
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,920
relaxation

150
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:10,500
it can be useful at the start of the practice to do a brief body scan just sort of

151
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:15,540
taking your awareness and moving from the top of your head

152
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:23,099
down through your face and shoulders just touching into the experience in

153
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:31,260
your body and if you notice areas of holding or tension maybe just pause

154
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:38,760
breathe into the tension and with the exhale invite invite a sense of letting go of whatever

155
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:45,900
is not needed just slowly moving down through the

with the belly inviting it to relax

160
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,460
to let the breath flow down into the belly and the belly expand with the

161
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:22,818
inhale

162
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:42,359

ankles and feet

165
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:09,960
and if there are Sensations that remain or holding or tension just let them be

166
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,500
as they are

167
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:21,200
and let's bring our awareness now back to our anchor

168
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:32,180
sounds coming sounds going

169
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:39,020
Sensations coming going

170
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,520
breathing in and breathing out

171
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,940
just tuning in

172
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:11,180
knowing that we're letting the breath come to the foreground of our awareness

173
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:18,140
so it's not that other things won't be happening

174
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:25,200
we don't have to stop thinking you don't have to stop hearing if we're

175
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:31,920
using the breath just sort of letting the breath move

176
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:37,740
into the center of our awareness

177
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:42,800
or our anchor into the center of our awareness

178
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:53,099

179
00:47:53,099 --> 00:47:59,480
I'm curious I you're welcome Brett how are you breath

180
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:07,220
let me feel you let me know you

181
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:46,819
getting to know the breath is not thinking about the breath picturing it but rather

182
00:48:46,819 --> 00:48:52,819
experiencing breathing feeling

getting to know how your body is breathing today

00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:26,900
and just resting where you feel it the most strongly

189
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:34,040

and stay present even connected to the breathing as doing so

it's okay to move to a chair or it's okay to do what the body needs

foreign breaths at a time

256
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:59,699
three breath Journeys you'll see if you can connect with the

257
01:08:59,699 --> 01:09:07,758
full inhale and exhale followed by the next and the next

258
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:16,758
and notice if there's any tension or

259
01:09:16,759 --> 01:09:23,120
irritation or difficulty happening inside yourselves

260
01:09:23,339 --> 01:09:29,719
and if so if you can give it a hug

261
01:09:32,580 --> 01:09:38,420
just a gentle caring

262
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:41,960
hug

263
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:49,278
the staying with the breath

264
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:55,819
a few more breaths at a time

foreign [Music]

266
01:11:59,659 --> 01:12:06,320
just a little short bathroom stretch break we'll come back for

267
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:12,780
instructions for walking meditation at five till and then we'll have a 30 minute walking

268
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:19,679
period so just taking a minute to take care of your body we actually were sitting a

269
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:26,159
long time because we sat half an hour before so I just take care of your bodies go to the

270
01:12:26,159 --> 01:12:32,600
bathroom drink come back we'll be back here at five tail

271
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:23,400
all right maybe we should all stand up let's give

272
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:31,580
our bodies we'll do this instruction just standing give ourselves a break

273
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:40,679
so um you know when we're walking when we're doing walking meditation

274
01:20:40,679 --> 01:20:46,140
um we can make it fairly simple

275
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:52,580
for ourselves and kind of just focus on our feet

276
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:59,239
oh the camera that's right I forgot hi YouTube sorry

277
01:20:59,239 --> 01:21:04,440
we can make it pretty simple and just sort of be aware lifting placing lifting

278
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:10,980
placing you know sort of like that would be lifting placing is sort of like saying in and out with that inhale and

279
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:17,640
exhale so we're going to notice we're lifting up and we're going to notice we're placing down

280
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:24,800
so there's two parts know that and feel it right so practice mindfulness is about

281
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:30,900
experiencing not thinking about using the mind to help us track what's

282
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:36,719
happening can help us stay with the experience makes sense

283
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:42,199
so just walking at a pace that's comfortable

284
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:47,820
for you and you can play with that I encourage you to try different speeds

285
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:53,300
sometimes when you're on Retreat you'll see people walking like

286
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:58,500
incredibly slow like this just incredibly slow

287
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:04,260
feeling just the teeniest tiniest little movements

288
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:11,100
just staying with it and that can be very supportive for building concentration

289
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:20,060
but it also can make us tight and tense it's also fine to walk a little faster

290
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:29,460
you know pay attention to um kind of the impact of the spacing

291
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:35,040
you might notice um just when you find the right pace it's

292
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:40,080
like oh okay a little bit of this breath you know

293
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:46,020
like ease we don't want to try over hard

294
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:51,739
we want to make it easy to be present for ourselves

295
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:57,900
if I if we're having a hard time staying with The Walking our mind is doing a lot

296
01:22:57,900 --> 01:23:04,500
of wandering there's more things to start to break down your experience into smaller bits

297
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:10,800
you can do a lot more of like um really kind of maybe breaking down the

298
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:18,719
oh heels up toes up you know a foot's off foot's reaching heels down toes down

299
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:25,679
if you want if you feel like that would be helpful for you maybe a few back and forths I wouldn't

300
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:31,219
overdo that but it's a little bit like trying to help yourself

301
01:23:31,219 --> 01:23:38,940
get connected to the flow so it can be a little bit more detail can be helpful

302
01:23:38,940 --> 01:23:44,820
the other thing is you can actually kind of just feel your whole body walking

303
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:50,340
you can just oh like open up more expansively to the experience of the

304
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:56,820
whole body with the feet so

305
01:23:57,300 --> 01:24:02,460
we'll uh we can walk inside if we walk in the hall

306
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:10,440
we walk the way Jan's going which is the short Direction and you can also walk outside we tend to

307
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:18,000
choose a path of walking so like 15 20 feet or something like that long

308
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:23,280
and you walk come to the end

309
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:28,440
for me it's very helpful at the end to stop

310
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:34,320
just pause and kind of let the awareness come back in and feel what it feels like

311
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:40,560
there's a momentum of moving that when we stop we can feel the settling

312
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:45,780
and then when you feel that settling that's for me my cue to think about

313
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:53,520
turning kind of allowing all the energy to settle okay and then I set this

314
01:24:53,520 --> 01:25:01,579
intention okay may I be aware and turn and walk back the other way

315
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:12,659
it's also okay to walk around the block right if if it's not feeling supportive for

316
01:25:12,659 --> 01:25:18,300
you to do shorter walking go for a longer walk it's okay

317
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:25,860
be careful of not blocking driveways it's okay to say hi to Neighbors

318
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:33,000
even though we're in silence right we don't need to not everybody else is doing a mindfulness day-long Retreat so

319
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:39,980
you know be generous and kind you don't have to shut yourself down in any way

320
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:45,440
anything you want to add kodo or any questions

321
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:51,960
okay so we'll do walking practice until 11 30.

322
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:58,699
we'll see you back here then foreign

323
01:57:16,380 --> 01:57:24,060
so just as we're settling back in after the walking period

324
01:57:24,060 --> 01:57:30,540
before I start talking about this next piece of our practice

325
01:57:30,540 --> 01:57:37,560
just want to mention it always seems apt when we're about to talk about mindfulness of the body that

326
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:44,099
use my phone also as a medical device so if you see me on it through the day it's part of what I'm up to it's just taking

327
01:57:44,099 --> 01:57:46,880
care of this body

328
01:58:09,659 --> 01:58:16,020
I felt the impulse to say welcome back but it feels more like welcome to continuing

329
01:58:16,020 --> 01:58:21,980
continuing the practice just gently continuing through the day

330
01:58:23,400 --> 01:58:29,040
and with our what we've done so far we've

331
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:34,800
focused on mindfulness of the breathing and

332
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:40,679
part of the function is that we've started to awaken this

333
01:58:40,679 --> 01:58:47,719
feeling part of our experience a sensing part of our experience

334
01:58:47,940 --> 01:58:53,239
that is directly Here and Now

335
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:59,239
um and in some way is direct simple

336
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:06,920
just right here we've started doing this with the breathing

337
01:59:10,619 --> 01:59:14,960
centering our experience on the breathing

338
01:59:15,719 --> 01:59:22,860
anchoring with the breathing dropping that anchor

339
01:59:22,860 --> 01:59:29,639
into the bay partly so that we can feel when the boat

340
01:59:29,639 --> 01:59:37,500
starts to move oh the attention is tugging here

341
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:42,020
all my thoughts are asking for my attention here

342
01:59:44,280 --> 01:59:50,540
with this anchor of the breathing we recognize those Tugs

343
01:59:51,239 --> 01:59:55,698
otherwise we might move about and never know

344
02:00:03,960 --> 02:00:10,020
and as we've started relating with the breathing in this way

345
02:00:10,020 --> 02:00:17,760
one thing that may be starting to become clear

346
02:00:17,760 --> 02:00:24,360
is that the the felt sense of the body breathing

347
02:00:24,360 --> 02:00:29,540
is distinct from the commentary on it

348
02:00:29,639 --> 02:00:36,659
the felt sense of the body breathing is different than our stories about experience

349
02:00:36,659 --> 02:00:43,460
comments about experience the breath makes no comments

350
02:00:50,040 --> 02:00:57,980
and so we're prioritizing what's Here and Now and sensed and felt

351
02:00:58,860 --> 02:01:03,138
and so far we've done that through the breathing

352
02:01:07,880 --> 02:01:13,860
in some ways this can highlight how so much of our normal frame of mind at

353
02:01:13,860 --> 02:01:20,880
least for me has so much to do with this fear of thoughts this fear of

354
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:28,679
thinking the stories and images the fantasies

355
02:01:28,679 --> 02:01:36,860
that pull me into the past and the future my breathing is just here

356
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:44,900
so the thinking has quite a an outsized influence Maybe

357
02:01:49,860 --> 02:01:55,760
and in the background of this practice a sort of Buddhist way of Reckoning

358
02:01:58,920 --> 02:02:06,000
the mind is one of six since doors

359
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:11,940
everything that goes on in the realm of thinking just this one cent store

360
02:02:11,940 --> 02:02:14,960
one out of six

361
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:25,980
and as we begin tuning into the breathing and tuning into this felt sense tuning into the felt sense of the

362
02:02:25,980 --> 02:02:29,060
breathing through the body

363
02:02:31,320 --> 02:02:37,679
or Waking Up waking up to more of our experience than

364
02:02:37,679 --> 02:02:40,639
this one-sixth

365
02:02:51,540 --> 02:02:56,639
the trajectory of the practice is such that we aim to include all of our

366
02:02:56,639 --> 02:03:02,960
experience everything gets to be included

367
02:03:08,159 --> 02:03:14,539
first with the breathing and now we extend to include the body

368
02:03:17,580 --> 02:03:23,040
just a few introductory comments on practicing with the body

369
02:03:23,040 --> 02:03:28,638
and then we can meditate together

370
02:03:38,159 --> 02:03:45,540
as we tune into the body feel into the body know the body sense

371
02:03:45,540 --> 02:03:53,658
the body it too is

372
02:03:55,739 --> 02:04:01,880
not the commentary it is not the thinking

373
02:04:02,280 --> 02:04:09,420
there can be a whole movie going on maybe in the background of experience while we're tuned in to this foreground

374
02:04:09,420 --> 02:04:12,800
of what's being sensed

375
02:04:15,500 --> 02:04:20,760
and there's some Freedom here than the body being distinct from the

376
02:04:20,760 --> 02:04:26,460
commentary one of the ways I first came to see this

377
02:04:26,460 --> 02:04:31,638
was on a Retreat like this one

378
02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:40,580
I was experiencing some physical pain and had a story going along with it

379
02:04:40,860 --> 02:04:46,940
a sensation and some commentary and it occurred to me

380
02:04:48,179 --> 02:04:53,880
for some one reason or another the sensations in my little toe

381
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:58,920
came to the foreground of experience and I realized

382
02:04:58,920 --> 02:05:05,460
my little toe is not having a problem my little toe is having no problems with

383
02:05:05,460 --> 02:05:11,460
my story right now I've got this whole narrative going in my mind

384
02:05:11,460 --> 02:05:17,480
and my little toe is sitting there quite peacefully having its Sensations

385
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:28,520
the comments we're not the body

386
02:05:42,119 --> 02:05:46,400
one of the functions of tuning into the body

387
02:05:47,280 --> 02:05:52,880
something we can trust about the body as that is that it is always

388
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:59,179
experiencing and sensing Here and Now

389
02:06:04,860 --> 02:06:08,780
if what we want to do is stay present

390
02:06:11,219 --> 02:06:18,800
if we're in touch with the body then we know we're doing that

391
02:06:19,260 --> 02:06:22,340
we know that we're here

392
02:06:24,300 --> 02:06:32,340
there's a way that our thinking or commentary can often draw us into

393
02:06:32,340 --> 02:06:37,760
the short films of the past and future in our minds

394
02:06:37,860 --> 02:06:41,719
draw us into memory of fantasy

395
02:06:46,020 --> 02:06:50,900
and in some ways lose touch with what's here and what's now

396
02:06:55,860 --> 02:07:02,520
and through mindfulness practice it's this continuity of Here and Now

397
02:07:02,520 --> 02:07:06,739
it starts to build a momentum

398
02:07:07,679 --> 02:07:11,420
it starts to gain in steadiness

399
02:07:13,679 --> 02:07:18,900
and the flavor the flavor of

400
02:07:18,900 --> 02:07:24,020
groundedness embodiment

401
02:07:24,179 --> 02:07:31,520
the flavor of being here starts to come to the foreground

402
02:08:01,500 --> 02:08:09,800
I have heard Tanya say before that the language of the body is sensation

403
02:08:12,659 --> 02:08:17,179
much is communicated to us through the body

404
02:08:23,820 --> 02:08:29,760
if in this way of Reckoning our thinking is one-sixth of our experience

405
02:08:29,760 --> 02:08:33,800
how much do we perceive through the body

406
02:08:35,699 --> 02:08:41,239
Eyes Ears Nose tongue

407
02:08:42,599 --> 02:08:48,860
felt sense of the body how rich

408
02:08:55,739 --> 02:09:02,340
just as the breathing is a kind of companion I really to the body this way a very good friend

409
02:09:02,340 --> 02:09:09,020
and a sound advisor and what I mean by sound advisor

410
02:09:09,540 --> 02:09:15,000
sometimes I'll do this exercise where I'll uh okay feel free to follow along if you

411
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:19,760
like I'll open both my eyes

412
02:09:20,460 --> 02:09:24,080
and then I'll close one of them

413
02:09:26,040 --> 02:09:34,460
and you can see how visual experience goes two-dimensional

414
02:09:35,219 --> 02:09:42,840
we lose some of our ability to recognize depth

415
02:09:42,840 --> 02:09:49,580
textures can be challenging to navigate with one eye closed yeah

416
02:09:51,719 --> 02:09:59,059
and then being attentive open the other eye wow

417
02:09:59,099 --> 02:10:05,659
three dimensions light depth

418
02:10:11,699 --> 02:10:18,380
so for me living living uh centered in commentary

419
02:10:18,540 --> 02:10:22,880
is like having just one of my eyes open

420
02:10:24,480 --> 02:10:27,860
maybe challenging to navigate

421
02:10:29,940 --> 02:10:34,760
and when I tune into the body it's like opening another eye

422
02:10:36,060 --> 02:10:42,198
the visual field gets so much more rich textured nuanced

423
02:10:49,139 --> 02:10:56,400
so the body's a trusted advisor because with this extra vantage point of the body then I can find my way

424
02:10:56,400 --> 02:10:59,360
and find my way

425
02:11:08,400 --> 02:11:15,500
it's in this sense that the body enriches our experience enriches our everyday experience

426
02:11:17,219 --> 02:11:24,380
may not necessarily happen every time we sit a retreat but

427
02:11:24,920 --> 02:11:30,179
you may at some point in your practice find yourself marveling at something as

428
02:11:30,179 --> 02:11:34,040
simple as the texture on the painted wall

429
02:11:37,080 --> 02:11:39,679
look at that

430
02:11:42,599 --> 02:11:50,840
such as the enriching power of being present here through the senses through the body

431
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:57,440
and so it is with our inner life

432
02:11:59,280 --> 02:12:05,360
I find being present with the body allows for the flourishing

433
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:13,380
allows for the flourishing of what's wholesome and beautiful and wisdom presence

434
02:12:13,500 --> 02:12:16,099
kindness

435
02:12:18,900 --> 02:12:21,678
letting go

436
02:12:28,380 --> 02:12:35,000
there's a maybe thousand-year-old Buddhist teaching

437
02:12:35,580 --> 02:12:40,219
that says throughout the body there are hands and eyes

438
02:12:42,540 --> 02:12:49,320
the whole body sensing I'd like to invoke that as we move more

439
02:12:49,320 --> 02:12:56,599
into the meditation and I'll offer just a little bit of instruction as we sit

440
02:13:07,679 --> 02:13:14,159
so if you haven't done so already I would invite you to make your way back to your meditation

441
02:13:14,159 --> 02:13:22,040
posture and if you already have I invite you to renew that meditation posture

442
02:13:24,060 --> 02:13:28,880
when I say renew I I usually find myself

443
02:13:29,699 --> 02:13:37,880
rocking a bit on my seat finding center again

444
02:13:42,780 --> 02:13:50,239
reconnecting with the ground that's supporting me the seat that's supporting me

445
02:13:54,420 --> 02:13:59,940
I did a fair amount of my meditation lying down so the ground the ground can also be

446
02:13:59,940 --> 02:14:03,800
supporting us if we're meditating that way

447
02:14:14,099 --> 02:14:18,500
so feeling our way through the seat

448
02:14:26,280 --> 02:14:32,599
and then sensing our way up the spine bit by bit

449
02:14:34,320 --> 02:14:39,960
as you feel your way up the spine you may notice oh I can realign here just a

450
02:14:39,960 --> 02:14:46,079
little when I do that I often find myself rolling my shoulders back to come into

451
02:14:46,079 --> 02:14:48,560
balance

452
02:14:51,840 --> 02:14:55,219
the chest opens up

453
02:14:57,300 --> 02:15:00,739
the shoulders wide

454
02:15:06,440 --> 02:15:12,179
that's sensing my way up the spine all the way through the neck

455
02:15:12,179 --> 02:15:15,800
and up the back half of the head

456
02:15:19,079 --> 02:15:23,540
so if you can the ears are in line with the shoulders

457
02:15:34,800 --> 02:15:40,440
because this posture may be a little different than our habitual ones

458
02:15:40,440 --> 02:15:46,698
I find a few deep breaths helps me to settle into it and relax some of the tensions

459
02:16:14,760 --> 02:16:17,539
hmm

460
02:16:24,300 --> 02:16:29,480
you know for you to meditate with your eyes closed if that's comfortable

461
02:16:32,099 --> 02:16:35,239
relaxing the eyes

462
02:16:37,440 --> 02:16:41,599
relaxing the muscles of the face

463
02:16:46,500 --> 02:16:53,300
and for softening the jaw it can be helpful to open the mouth and then let the teeth float back up

464
02:17:06,719 --> 02:17:13,518
and as we did earlier just brief scanning through the body

465
02:17:13,620 --> 02:17:17,899
is there any extra tension here

466
02:17:19,139 --> 02:17:23,841
maybe in the arms elbows

467
02:17:24,960 --> 02:17:30,678
wrists fingers

468
02:17:35,639 --> 02:17:38,540
in the chest

469
02:17:43,800 --> 02:17:47,598
the ribs and the solar plexus

470
02:17:54,660 --> 02:17:57,500
the belly

471
02:18:01,800 --> 02:18:04,580
hips

472
02:18:08,040 --> 02:18:10,820
a seat

473
02:18:17,040 --> 02:18:21,620
any extra tension in the upper legs

474
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:27,439
to softening

475
02:18:31,559 --> 02:18:34,699
maybe in the knees

476
02:18:40,740 --> 02:18:43,820
lower legs

477
02:18:53,099 --> 02:18:58,939
heels feet

478
02:18:59,340 --> 02:19:03,380
all the way down through the toes

479
02:19:06,960 --> 02:19:14,420
the kind greeting between awareness and the body

480
02:19:29,519 --> 02:19:36,380
and for a minute or two accompanying our anchor breathing

481
02:19:50,100 --> 02:19:56,060
breathing in one knows breathing in

482
02:19:58,740 --> 02:20:05,479
breathing out one knows breathing out

483
02:20:17,820 --> 02:20:21,801
alert and clearly aware

484
02:21:28,560 --> 02:21:32,479
as we accompany the breathing

485
02:21:38,340 --> 02:21:42,438
surely some thoughts will arise

486
02:21:45,120 --> 02:21:49,280
the breathing is not the commentary

487
02:21:51,540 --> 02:21:56,420
and no problem

488
02:22:01,680 --> 02:22:10,040
as best we can I'm not the commentary passed right by

489
02:22:51,060 --> 02:22:53,060
e

490
02:23:06,240 --> 02:23:12,920
now too deliberately incorporate the body

491
02:23:13,680 --> 02:23:20,640
the invitation for the moment is to let go of any effort to direct the

492
02:23:20,640 --> 02:23:24,260
attention to the breathing

493
02:23:26,520 --> 02:23:32,359
and notice in the body

494
02:23:33,660 --> 02:23:37,939
what's the most predominant sensation

495
02:23:40,319 --> 02:23:48,500
if if one is there that's especially uncomfortable you don't have to pick the most uncomfortable sensation

496
02:23:49,140 --> 02:23:52,398
maybe somewhere in the middle

497
02:23:57,600 --> 02:24:04,579
so identifying that sensation turning our mindful awareness

498
02:24:05,640 --> 02:24:14,180
clearly see to clearly know that sensation through the body

499
02:24:30,600 --> 02:24:37,819
as we sustain our awareness in connection with this sensation

500
02:24:41,220 --> 02:24:44,239
what do we notice

501
02:24:51,720 --> 02:24:59,120
what's the quality of the sensation pressure

502
02:25:00,660 --> 02:25:03,500
vibration

503
02:25:07,800 --> 02:25:14,601
coolness Heat

504
02:25:15,960 --> 02:25:22,880
maybe twisting or a pinch or an itch

505
02:25:32,640 --> 02:25:37,220
in the practice of mindfulness that can't be anything

506
02:25:38,700 --> 02:25:42,319
our work is to know it

507
02:26:27,960 --> 02:26:37,220
attending how does that sensation change

508
02:26:39,420 --> 02:26:43,398
as I observe its particulars

509
02:26:48,420 --> 02:26:54,140
does it move fade

510
02:26:55,560 --> 02:26:58,579
change shape

511
02:27:08,040 --> 02:27:11,899
does pressing become tingling

512
02:27:38,160 --> 02:27:43,500
now to bring this all together I'll invite you to return to your anchor

513
02:27:43,500 --> 02:27:46,100
of the breathing

514
02:27:49,260 --> 02:27:52,580
maybe with a big breath

515
02:28:04,020 --> 02:28:09,261
just here with the breathing and steady

516
02:28:11,100 --> 02:28:17,780
and then when I when a sensation arises in the body

517
02:28:20,100 --> 02:28:26,939
that is compelling that is

518
02:28:26,939 --> 02:28:32,120
Sensation that is strong enough

519
02:28:32,580 --> 02:28:37,398
so as to call the attention away from the breathing

520
02:28:38,340 --> 02:28:43,800
then as we just did bring your mindful awareness

521
02:28:43,800 --> 02:28:46,938
to that sensation

522
02:28:50,100 --> 02:28:58,200
than when it's no longer compelling or predominant or it fades away or disappears

523
02:28:58,200 --> 02:29:03,080
come back to the anchor come back to the breathing

524
02:29:10,260 --> 02:29:14,540
all the while with awareness

525
02:29:32,399 --> 02:29:34,700
foreign

526
02:30:55,760 --> 02:30:59,720
staying here with the breathing

527
02:31:01,620 --> 02:31:09,619
until a bodily sensation becomes compelling

528
02:31:14,220 --> 02:31:21,021
bringing our whole mindful awareness to that sensation

529
02:31:22,399 --> 02:31:26,301
noticing any commentary

530
02:31:27,840 --> 02:31:31,398
letting that stay in the background

531
02:31:33,660 --> 02:31:36,979
the body in the foreground

532
02:37:18,479 --> 02:37:23,420
foreign foreign

533
02:37:33,300 --> 02:37:38,340
just a few more words about mindfulness of the body feel free to adjust your

534
02:37:38,340 --> 02:37:43,760
posture wiggle

535
02:37:45,180 --> 02:37:50,721
it's amazing how just a little move can let the pains go

536
02:37:56,760 --> 02:38:04,020
so with mindfulness practice so much starts to open up

537
02:38:04,020 --> 02:38:10,319
when we include awareness of the body one thing in particular comes to mind

538
02:38:10,319 --> 02:38:15,899
right now and that is in mindfulness practice there's both what we know

539
02:38:15,899 --> 02:38:23,580
the objects that we know and there's how we know the quality of that awareness

540
02:38:23,580 --> 02:38:30,180
and I find I find I learned so much about how I am

541
02:38:30,180 --> 02:38:38,040
by what I sense through the body like I can be working on something let's say um sometimes I will sew

542
02:38:38,040 --> 02:38:43,859
the needle and thread and I'll notice through the sensations of my body

543
02:38:43,859 --> 02:38:50,100
especially in my face if I'm do am I doing it with like tension

544
02:38:50,100 --> 02:38:55,620
or am I doing it with relaxation so much information comes through comes

545
02:38:55,620 --> 02:39:00,660
through the body or when the the blower was on earlier

546
02:39:00,660 --> 02:39:07,319
everything gets to be included and I noticed it was almost like my skin had

547
02:39:07,319 --> 02:39:15,660
10 percent more tension in it and then when the sound ended the skin opened back up so there's

548
02:39:15,660 --> 02:39:20,760
actually a there's a physical change that I'm wouldn't be sensitive to just

549
02:39:20,760 --> 02:39:27,261
through the story there's all this information coming through the body

550
02:39:29,640 --> 02:39:34,399
so the primary point of practice with mindfulness of the body

551
02:39:34,700 --> 02:39:40,260
sensing feeling recognizing the difference between the

552
02:39:40,260 --> 02:39:48,979
body and the commentary and really letting the body be in the foreground as much as possible

553
02:39:49,260 --> 02:39:52,040
staying here

554
02:40:02,100 --> 02:40:06,380
wonder if now might be a good time to talk about lunch

555
02:40:08,760 --> 02:40:11,720
foreign

556
02:40:23,240 --> 02:40:31,439
before I talk about lunch we see if there's some Reflections or questions

557
02:40:31,439 --> 02:40:36,500
does that sound okay and so um

558
02:40:37,740 --> 02:40:44,479
maybe just taking a minute to witness your own experience today

559
02:40:49,020 --> 02:40:54,500
just notice you know if there's anything that

560
02:40:55,740 --> 02:41:01,260
maybe is different prizing

561
02:41:01,260 --> 02:41:07,399
or difficult or

562
02:41:07,520 --> 02:41:12,899
surprisingly easy that you experienced in your meditations

563
02:41:12,899 --> 02:41:20,520
today so just just sort of like you know if

564
02:41:20,520 --> 02:41:27,660
you're going into the forest to collect some Treasures witnessing your own experience today so

565
02:41:27,660 --> 02:41:34,680
far collecting

566
02:41:34,680 --> 02:41:38,180
in a beautiful little basket

567
02:41:50,220 --> 02:41:54,979
and is there anything in this little basket

568
02:41:55,620 --> 02:42:03,780
that you would like to share or question that you have for kodo or

569
02:42:03,780 --> 02:42:11,819
myself and I don't know Sage if we have any Live on YouTube folks

570
02:42:11,819 --> 02:42:16,920
but they can certainly type a question or comment into the chat

571
02:42:16,920 --> 02:42:22,319
and we were happy to read those and respond as well

572
02:42:22,319 --> 02:42:28,200
so we do have a microphone to speak into

573
02:42:28,200 --> 02:42:35,160
so that it's recorded and everybody can hear so and it's okay

574
02:42:35,160 --> 02:42:41,640
you know we've been in silence now we're almost three hours

575
02:42:41,640 --> 02:42:48,060
so there may not be a lot that needs to be said and that's okay

576
02:42:48,060 --> 02:42:55,160
and if there's a question or a comment now's a good time

577
02:42:56,460 --> 02:43:01,399
yeah thank you Corey

578
02:43:05,520 --> 02:43:11,340
so one of the great things about today that I noticed is just how sensitive I

579
02:43:11,340 --> 02:43:16,740
was noticing myself my body um

580
02:43:16,740 --> 02:43:21,800
I was noticing uh yeah that that sounds

581
02:43:21,800 --> 02:43:28,560
uh would would reverberate throughout my body and

582
02:43:28,560 --> 02:43:34,920
that sometimes had the nice effect of bringing me back if I had drifted off

583
02:43:34,920 --> 02:43:40,140
so that was really cool and like even certain letters

584
02:43:40,140 --> 02:43:46,740
of the alphabet would reverberate more strongly and I would feel those

585
02:43:46,740 --> 02:43:51,740
I think I felt the S is more than anything else

586
02:43:52,740 --> 02:43:56,000
it was great

587
02:43:58,439 --> 02:44:01,521
thank you Corey

588
02:44:13,439 --> 02:44:18,021
you want to check uh the Stream

589
02:44:20,520 --> 02:44:25,859
see Honda sent three prayer emojis so that's got

590
02:44:25,859 --> 02:44:29,280
to be good beautiful

591
02:44:31,319 --> 02:44:38,040
so let me talk a little bit about um mindfulness of eating and lunch

592
02:44:38,040 --> 02:44:45,540
um if any of you ever done the mindfulness-based stress reduction program designed by John cabotzin are

593
02:44:45,540 --> 02:44:52,880
you familiar with that you you may have heard about the raisin meditation

594
02:44:53,580 --> 02:44:59,640
talk a little bit in case you haven't done that meditation I'm going to talk a little bit about what it's like

595
02:44:59,640 --> 02:45:07,859
and invite you to approach at least the beginning of your lunch in the same way

596
02:45:07,859 --> 02:45:14,460
maybe the first five bites you could treat as a full-on raisin meditation

597
02:45:14,460 --> 02:45:23,301
and then maybe periodically throughout you could pause and you know reconnect but um

598
02:45:23,460 --> 02:45:30,180
you're given about you know one or two or three raisins in your hand to start

599
02:45:30,180 --> 02:45:35,760
sometimes you get really plump raisins sometimes not so much sometimes they're

600
02:45:35,760 --> 02:45:41,760
different colors but all of a sudden right there there's things to notice about raisins that you

601
02:45:41,760 --> 02:45:47,760
might not normally pay attention to the color

602
02:45:47,760 --> 02:45:53,040
shape the sense of plumpness or dried outness

603
02:45:53,040 --> 02:46:00,540
the weight in your hand and you're invited to um

604
02:46:00,540 --> 02:46:09,300
there's a feedback happen in there thanks you're invited to get to know kotose

605
02:46:09,300 --> 02:46:15,840
your mic on okay you're invited to get to know these

606
02:46:15,840 --> 02:46:23,420
raisins like um you've never seen a raisin before

607
02:46:24,240 --> 02:46:30,479
so just being curious oh you might pick them up and you notice that at one end

608
02:46:30,479 --> 02:46:37,439
there's like a belly button a little dried belly button and the opposite end it's just a little

609
02:46:37,439 --> 02:46:43,800
round rump it's very you know doesn't have that

610
02:46:43,800 --> 02:46:50,760
um and then to like smell them did you know raisins have a smell they

611
02:46:50,760 --> 02:46:57,120
do and even to listen to them to put them

612
02:46:57,120 --> 02:47:03,420
near your ear and when you kind of squeeze them a little bit you actually can hear a

613
02:47:03,420 --> 02:47:09,420
little bit of a sound and then

614
02:47:09,420 --> 02:47:16,740
you take a minute here and you hold the raisin before you're going to eat it so imagine having a raisin in your hand

615
02:47:16,740 --> 02:47:21,960
right now picturing it and knowing that you're going to put it

616
02:47:21,960 --> 02:47:28,319
in your mouth in a moment and even as you imagine this notice what's happening

617
02:47:28,319 --> 02:47:31,160
in your body

618
02:47:33,600 --> 02:47:42,120
very often what's happening is you start to salivate your body is anticipating the reason

619
02:47:42,120 --> 02:47:49,140
it's actually already releasing digestive enzymes needed to digest that

620
02:47:49,140 --> 02:47:55,979
reason before we've even put it in our mouth and then we're invited to put it in our

621
02:47:55,979 --> 02:48:04,460
mouths but not to chew it but to let it rest to feel it with our tongues

622
02:48:04,800 --> 02:48:11,819
to let the flavor just sort of you know seep out

623
02:48:11,819 --> 02:48:19,500
and you're gonna feel this sense of wanting to chew the ma the the mouth knows what to do

624
02:48:19,500 --> 02:48:27,420
when we eat and so you when you're doing this practice you start to see everything that's happening before

625
02:48:27,420 --> 02:48:34,140
before you choose it and then you can witness this and not

626
02:48:34,140 --> 02:48:39,420
not just follow don't just start chewing wait a minute

627
02:48:39,420 --> 02:48:47,220
sustain feel the tension feel the wanting you're going to take a bite then

628
02:48:47,220 --> 02:48:51,979
and you may notice your jaw just wants to go

629
02:48:52,640 --> 02:48:59,100
so watching this too watching how the body wants to just move into chewing

630
02:48:59,100 --> 02:49:07,398
chewing swallowing trying to slow it down take a bite pause

631
02:49:08,040 --> 02:49:16,020
chew a couple more times pause oh the body's moving to swallow just okay

632
02:49:16,020 --> 02:49:22,500
can I see that too and then experience the swallowing and follow it

633
02:49:22,500 --> 02:49:29,220
all the way into the belly and then pause for a minute

634
02:49:29,220 --> 02:49:37,200
before starting with your next reason so there's a lot to experience

635
02:49:37,200 --> 02:49:46,260
and if we're just eating a meal we're invited to put our Fork spoon down between bites

636
02:49:46,260 --> 02:49:51,540
to take our time and to feel the greed or the energy the excitement the

637
02:49:51,540 --> 02:49:58,920
anticipation just be aware of it notice it not necessarily just give in

638
02:49:58,920 --> 02:50:04,859
to the automatic patterns of eating so that's you know play with this I

639
02:50:04,859 --> 02:50:11,160
invite you to play with us and like I said maybe you know the first two three

640
02:50:11,160 --> 02:50:17,100
four five bites see if you can't really take your time in this way with your food

641
02:50:17,100 --> 02:50:22,740
maybe even before even if you're sitting at a table where you'll be sharing and

642
02:50:22,740 --> 02:50:30,380
talking maybe maybe just agree to take those few bites together in silence

643
02:50:35,580 --> 02:50:41,040
the momentum you've built up in three hours

644
02:50:41,040 --> 02:50:48,979
you probably have no idea how much more present you are even if it's been hard

645
02:50:52,439 --> 02:50:56,841
it is actually something to protect

646
02:50:58,740 --> 02:51:06,000
it can be tempting to walk outside and just go and just sort of let all your

647
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:13,260
mindfulness go it's good to relax and enjoy your food

648
02:51:13,260 --> 02:51:20,880
but but maybe pay attention to talking a little less

649
02:51:20,880 --> 02:51:29,340
pausing a little more Maybe eating some at the silent table

650
02:51:29,340 --> 02:51:36,720
just be not rigid and tight at all but but a

651
02:51:36,720 --> 02:51:42,660
little more protective and careful and aware of the continuity of the practice

652
02:51:42,660 --> 02:51:48,120
that you've been building today take care of it for yourselves and for

653
02:51:48,120 --> 02:51:56,279
each other because you will impact each other and the way you move about and talk and

654
02:51:56,279 --> 02:52:03,660
eat and there are some tables it would be

655
02:52:03,660 --> 02:52:09,600
nice to get some help carrying them out everybody maybe can grab a chair there's

656
02:52:09,600 --> 02:52:16,020
these folding chairs over here on the side I'll open the cupboard up so maybe you could each be

657
02:52:16,020 --> 02:52:21,240
responsible for getting your own chair bringing it out and then back in

658
02:52:21,240 --> 02:52:27,420
it's not these you know ones that are out is a different set

659
02:52:27,420 --> 02:52:33,420
and lunch will be over at 1 30.

660
02:52:33,420 --> 02:52:40,020
so we have an hour to set up and disassemble afterwards as

661
02:52:40,020 --> 02:52:46,439
well and I do encourage if you feel

662
02:52:46,439 --> 02:52:52,500
comfortable doing some chatting to commit connect with your Sangha members

663
02:52:52,500 --> 02:53:00,540
you know about practice and how we're doing and you know it's a really precious thing to

664
02:53:00,540 --> 02:53:06,120
be here together I'm I'm I'm getting to know you all just a little bit and it's

665
02:53:06,120 --> 02:53:12,000

666
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:20,720

667
02:53:21,180 --> 02:53:26,520

668
02:53:26,520 --> 02:53:31,460
spots where it's pretty quick and easy to get some good food

669
02:53:32,399 --> 02:53:38,880

670
