Christmas morning for those of you who celebrate Christmas Merry Christmas

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,259
for those of you who don't marry anyway

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:35,760
a day of chair um I've been inspired by Christians who

6
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,700
celebrate who Christians who celebrate Christmas as a day of love

7
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:49,399
kind of a universal love so um

8
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:55,500
today a little bit uh following and continuing

9
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:03,239
kind of a theme that I've been teaching this last week I want to start with a quotation from

10
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,180
the Buddha where he says something like

11
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,820
um if it were not possible it was if it was not possible

12
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:21,360
to cultivate the wholesome I would not teach you or instruct you to

13
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,600
cultivate the wholesome but it is possible to cultivate the

14
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,659
wholesome therefore I instruct you or teach you to cultivate

15
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:39,540
the wholesome so uh it's a kind of I think a very kind

16
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:46,619
of a celebration statement about our potential that we have the potential whether or

17
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:52,500
not we use it to do things that are wholesome the Pali

18
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,960
word is kusala and um you know if you want to make it really

19
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:04,439
simple in English we would say do good but that kind of misses some of the

20
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:10,039
nuances or richness of the term that the word kusala

21
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:16,739
means both something which is really wholesome or beneficial or helpful it

22
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:23,640
also refers to something which is skillful which is done well for a particular purpose

23
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:29,340
and then you have to ask her what's the purpose but when you translate it as wholesome

24
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:35,700
then the purpose is itself it's to be nourished to be supported to do something that feels like it's hole

25
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:41,160
making makes you whole or wholehearted or something part part of it

26
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:47,040
but the kind of the the idea of wholesomeness is uh though that what has

27
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,140
been beneficial for us are beneficial for the world that it's a

28
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:58,140
non-afflictive it's a absence of causing any kind of harm to oneself and to others

29
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:03,840
and to be for our welfare so this this with this language of our welfare for

30
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,200
our benefit to help us to develop us to strengthen us all kinds of things we have this

31
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:16,800
potential now we could just ignore that potential or just kind of take it on

32
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,959
some kind of Faith well I'm good enough I don't have to do anything special you know I just

33
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:27,540
can't go along with my life and you know I'll stop I'll stop for pedestrians

34
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:34,920
you know and you know you know live a good life but they um but the word um

35
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:42,420
so that's fine you know maybe you live a basically good life but uh it's possible to cultivate this

36
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:48,060
wholesome so that it brings a feeling a sense of inner thriving

37
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:54,720
a sense of abundance Within and uh this is part of what the

38
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:01,200
teachings of the Buddha was about was not just to do good for yourself and for the world but to cultivate something

39
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,720
that brings a kind of fullness a wholeness an abundance a phenomenal

40
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:14,220
sense of thriving from the inside out so our sense of thriving does not depend

41
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:20,479
on conditions in the world that uh you know that

42
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:26,280
but rather has to do with the conditions of Our Own Heart their own inner life

43
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:33,300
and so there's a lot of attention given to this inner inner life that we want to cultivate and develop

44
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:39,720
and I was kind of maybe because I was giving this talk I was struck when I was meditating with all of you now

45
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:46,139
that after some minutes there was a clear shift Within Me and the shift was you know I've been

46
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:51,240
thinking about the things over these last few days and coming down here and

47
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:57,060
and so I was still kind of a little bit my mind was a little bit in the momentum of my concerns my thoughts my activities

48
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:04,979
lately and then after sitting here breathing for a while I could feel there was a shift and I I could say oh now I'm here

49
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:10,259
it took me five minutes or it took me a while but now I'm here and now I was

50
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:15,360
here I could feel the sense of being here not just in this

51
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:22,020
room but more kind of physically almost I'm I'm here in this body it's almost

52
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:28,380
like now I'm connected and I had this sense of expansive space in my body when

53
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:34,259
I was finally here okay here I am and um and now I could feel that now

54
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:41,400
that I'm here in the space of my body now there were space for the good for the wholesome for the

55
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,440
beneficial to flow or to grow whereas when I was caught up in my

56
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,780
thoughts uh the space within was kind of tight if I even was paying attention to

57
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:58,080
the space there was no space it was tight it was contracted I was kind of in my head in a sense

58
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,560
and the head is a very different place for to be the source of the wholesome

59
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,680
than it is to be kind of here in this body grounded in it with space in it for

60
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:17,039
something to flow and to well up and to be here the difference is that when I'm in a

61
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:22,919
head I could have the idea and the admonition I'm supposed to be good I'm

62
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:28,139
supposed to do nice things and and it comes from a conceptual

63
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:33,300
conceiving world of logic ideas things I've learned from other people how

64
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:41,759
things should be it's a place because I'm so disconnected to the rest of me it's difficult sometimes to notice the

65
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:48,060
bias that's operating there it just seems like it's the truth or something and um and there's all kinds of biases

66
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:54,180
by which you know this thinking mind can live by without even being seen but when I dropped in that moment where

67
00:06:54,180 --> 00:07:00,660
this thing switched and I could feel oh here I am I found that I wasn't as interested in my thoughts anymore

68
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:06,419
they were okay but they weren't really the name of the game and but I had much more clarity

69
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:13,139
about it and I had much more choice about what I did next

70
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:19,259
I had some Choice a brother to stay there or I had some choice to you know I would

71
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:26,400
had I had some really good thoughts going so you know and uh and so I could go back up in

72
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:32,099
those thoughts and um you know I had a choice but I could feel that what felt

73
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:39,120
wholesome what felt really good and nice place to be was settled here in the

74
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,300
present in this open space in my body within that it was a there I could

75
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:53,099
generate different it was different source for choices I make different choice for what

76
00:07:53,099 --> 00:08:00,720
I want to develop or how I want to be what or different choice about what I want to give energy to

77
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:07,139
the um you know what do I you focus on is you know gives a kind of energy to things and keeps things spinning and

78
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:12,900
going sometimes but if you give your your attention here inside

79
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:18,720
um and there's qualities of generosity or love or

80
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,720
kindness or gentleness calmness wisdom

81
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:31,440
then to focus on that within makes room for it allows that to grow make space

82
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,500
for it validates it authorizes it to kind of be there it's

83
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,599
okay you're allowed to be there it's good I'm not going to overlook you

84
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:48,959
one of the interesting things about this switch to kind of really being here it was a little bit easier to see that

85
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:54,120
these deeper feelings deeper way of being was not so connected to my usual

86
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:59,700
self-identity my usual kind of self that I'm operating and this is how I need to be and this is what I need to do and

87
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:05,880
this is what those people did to me um but there's something you know certainly happening within me

88
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,519
but I was less inclined to take it you know to take it personally or to

89
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,620
claim it or appropriate these inner wholesome feelings I could feel that if

90
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:23,459
I appropriated it it made some smaller space for it so we have this wholesome that Buddhism

91
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:31,440
Buddha said cultivate the wholesome and then he offered things like meditation practice as a as I think of it as a seed

92
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,959
bed that you prepare sow these seeds of the wholesome can grow

93
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:44,220
and that's a very different way of thinking about it just saying do it just do it which might come then from the

94
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:51,300
conceptual mind the head it might come from all kinds of other places than just coming from the seed bed deep inside

95
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:57,720
that Wells up and flows so one of the things that's needed if we

96
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,940
want to cultivate the wholesome is desire

97
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:09,180
and without some desire for it why would we do it why would we put any energy

98
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:17,760
effort into it and I emphasize this emphasis this this uh idea of the need for desire because I

99
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,820
think that generally us Buddhist teachers including myself

100
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:30,600
um um don't talk about the desire in a good

101
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,940
way that often don't hold it up as being important if anything we talk about you know

102
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:42,600
attachment and craving and thirst and greed and the issues should let go of and it could easily and you know easily

103
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,640
kind of Desire gets put into that same category just listening to us

104
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:53,040
but uh without some kind of desire for the

105
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:59,519
wholesome why would we cultivated why would we focus on it and um

106
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:05,040
so and the Buddha actually said that he talks about you know have the desire

107
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:11,940
for practice have the desire to cultivate you know awakened desire for the wholesome

108
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:17,640
so it can I think you know a little bit thus Buddhist teachers need to spend a

109
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:23,880
little time reclaiming desire as a good thing as a place for us

110
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:30,720
the danger for doing that is uh in any kind of uh instructions to

111
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:38,160
cultivate something develop something is one is also dangers one danger is it puts us in the

112
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:44,940
self-help camp and a lot there's such a strong momentum among many parts of the culture around

113
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:50,040
here to be self-help which just becomes another attempt to reinforce and develop

114
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:56,940
you know there's yours your idea Your Glory as a self

115
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:04,740
and the danger of that is that it's impossible to maintain that so sooner or later you'll crash and uh you can't live

116
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:09,959
up to the hype and the you know of kind of building up a good perfect self it's

117
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:17,399
no such thing the other thing is that some people here I have a few of people occasionally you

118
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:23,880
see it somewhere in this kind of part of the world there's certain kind of neurotic attitude towards doing

119
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:30,360
the more the better we have to do more have to be efficient you know you have to get ahead you have to you know work

120
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:38,300
60 hours a week if you're kind of want to you know but ideally 75

121
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:44,339
but you have a generous boss so it's only 60. and um you know this emphasis on you

122
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:50,540
know doing doing doing and then we have so much possibilities for many of us here that

123
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:56,940
even those of us who don't have to struggle to survive we you know so many things we feel like we should do and

124
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:02,940
accomplish and manage and keep up and so this idea of doing is kind of

125
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:11,240
that lends itself to more doing even more I'm so busy already now I have to do this Buddhism thing on top of it

126
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:17,519
give me a break and um and so and because of the certain

127
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:23,279
kind of neurotic sense of doing and entertainment and improving oneself

128
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:30,720
Buddhist teachers in the west have made a lot of emphasis on um not doing on acceptance just letting

129
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,959
shelf be just being which has been very powerful for many westerners because it allows something

130
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:44,279
to unwind and to settle and then at some point maybe they have that switch that I described earlier today you switch and

131
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:50,880
oh now I'm here I feel yeah it's okay just to be and then

132
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,980
you can turn on the desire you can turn then you can maybe have the

133
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:04,079
desire for the wholesome you can switch it on in a Wholesome Way and that's the art of

134
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:11,300
it how do you have desire which is wholesome how do you have desire which you feel

135
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:16,800
nourished by you feel inspired by you feel you're delighted to have this

136
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,079
desire wow I'm so lucky I get to have this wonderful desire

137
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:28,380
it's not a burden it doesn't it doesn't you don't add it to your to-do list like okay desire

138
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:37,019
wholesome States check that off done that it's uh it's uh it's like wow

139
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:43,500
just even having a desire feels like wow that's pretty cool is that possible

140
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:48,660
it is but I think it requires a really being

141
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:53,760
grounded settled here in the present moment in yourself

142
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:59,459
if you're racing around in your head spinning around with thoughts ideas racing around your body

143
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:06,660
and then it's hard to find that seed bed that Source inside where there can be because a welding up

144
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:11,820
of almost a selfless desire it's almost as if it's not really you

145
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:16,920
know part of your usual contracted sense of self

146
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:23,699
and feel the goodness of it oh here is something within me that really cares for me that really

147
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:30,980
wants the best in me that wants the best even for the world because how can I

148
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:37,380
support and bring welfare and happiness to others if I don't have it myself

149
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:43,320
so this desire oh look at that it's almost like kind of wakes you up to

150
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:48,899
pay attention oh look at that desire desire for the wholesome for the

151
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:54,180
beneficial the desire to thrive emotionally or

152
00:15:54,180 --> 00:16:00,300
psychologically or you know this inner spiritual way that we talk about in Buddhism

153
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:06,600
are we allowed to do that there are people who feel they're not allowed to do that

154
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:12,120
I've known people whose own kind of teachings they got no not Buddhists

155
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:18,779
growing up was uh you were absolutely not supposed to have a lot of Joy because Joy was kind of almost like

156
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:24,000
bordered in a carnal sin and so and so kind of held that hold

157
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,240
back I've known people who've held themselves back in meditation because they couldn't get themselves

158
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:37,740
wouldn't let themselves get concentrated because as we get concentrated there tends to be good feelings that come and

159
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:44,160
some of those good feelings are very physical and they like I'm not allowed to do that there's something wrong with that

160
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:49,740
and then there's people who feel that any kind of focus on personal well-being

161
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:58,139
is somehow selfish and all you're supposed to be altruistic all the time and so the self-focus is a

162
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:04,500
problem it is a problem sometimes and uh and maybe that's part of the some

163
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:12,600
of one of the challenges uh in in a practice like we

164
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:20,120
do where there's a lot of this introvert Focus is to be able to differentiate between narcissism and healthy

165
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:26,520
inner Focus that's not self enhancing or making and as a teacher I talk to a lot

166
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:32,820
of people about their practice and every once in a while in a great while I talked to someone who is saying all

167
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:38,039
the right words about you know focusing inwardly and I kind of think wait a

168
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:44,580
minute this is somehow something doesn't seem quite right here maybe it's the frequency frequency in

169
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:52,340
which they use the word I just like this is like it seems like every other word is I

170
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:57,900
and so so it can be a problem what we're look what we're talking about here but

171
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:03,660
the important thing is it doesn't have to be there is something really beautiful

172
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:08,880
that awaits us within that we can cultivate in a beautiful desire to awake

173
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:15,360
to do it so um the

174
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:21,720
uh so the kind of the uh there's something called for right efforts which I've talked about this

175
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,940
last week so some of you have heard this already but I think it's worth hearing again if you did

176
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:32,760
so these four right efforts have to do first two have to do with the unwholesome

177
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:38,760
the inner thoughts ideas impulses motivations desires

178
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:45,179
that were within us that are unwholesome unbeneficial they're called in by the Buddha

179
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:53,880
afflictive they hurt there's an ouch in them and and then there's the uh wholesome

180
00:18:53,880 --> 00:19:01,080
which are beneficial they bring about welfare they bring out a certain kind of healthy kind of pleasure they kind of

181
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:07,200
they feel good to have them so two two of the right efforts have to bother about the unwholesome and two

182
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,480
have to do with the wholesome the unwholesome the Buddha says uh uh

183
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,940
have the desire to make an effort

184
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:24,740
to to prevent the arising of unwholesome states

185
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,260
so if every time you go in the shopping channel

186
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:36,299
you feel miserable from the exhaustion of all the things

187
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:42,179
you want to buy so that's that desire to want to buy all

188
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:49,320
those things is unwholesome so have the desire to prevent that from

189
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:55,919
happening don't go on the shopping channel or limit yourself to a minute

190
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:01,200
or do something else you know anyway so there are things we can do to just avoid

191
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,340
have the wisdom to know what to avoid because it triggers you in ways that are not healthy

192
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:13,559
the second right effort is to ER is to bring up the desire

193
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:20,520
to make the effort so it's not just a desire for something but the desire to work for it to make

194
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:26,280
the effort for it bring up the effort to abandon

195
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:31,559
the unwholesome that has that's happening inside of you

196
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:36,900
and what's this very important part of this language because Buddhism often gets associated

197
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:43,320
with letting go these Buddhists are all about letting go when the Buddha talks about what we let

198
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:49,860
go of it's always inner mental states which are unhealthy

199
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:56,220
I don't think he sadly ever soaks about letting go of things in the world but he is talking about the letting go

200
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:03,539
of greed and hatred that we have resentment Envy avariciousness all kinds

201
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:09,360
of things that are inside that are unwholesome so the world is the world but how we

202
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:15,360
relate to the world is the issue so this abandoning of what is unwholesome

203
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:22,980
have the desire for it then have the desire for the for evoking

204
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:30,480
wholesome States so wholesome states are good so what would you do to evoke them more

205
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,580
make sure you get enough sleep if you can make sure you have some down time

206
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:43,559
be sure you spend time with people who inspire you and bring out the best in you make sure you I don't go in the shopping

207
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:50,220
shopping channel go if you can if you really have to do open the channel go on some some channel that inspires you if

208
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:56,640
you feel good and kind of it's delightful for you whatever it is

209
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:04,320
um you know there's a there's choices to be made here it's not just leaving things to chance

210
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:09,659
and part of the choices is what we what behaviors we avoid and what if behaviors

211
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:15,659
we engage in that's what a wise life is involved in that kind of reflection and

212
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:21,240
thinking and then um

213
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:26,120
evoke the desire to make the effort

214
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:32,480
to develop expand Thrive

215
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:38,880
strengthen increase the wholesome the Buddha uses a whole series of words

216
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:46,799
here what you do all these you know kind of phenomenal words like the word abundance is in there or increase and

217
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:54,179
develop strengthen so avoid the wholesome

218
00:22:54,179 --> 00:23:00,780
cultivate the unwholesome so I went through this review for some of you because if a very important

219
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:08,640
reason having desire to developed to strengthen the wholesome

220
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,039
is important that desire is important

221
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:22,500
we want to look at the desire study the desire get to know your desire

222
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:28,520
to ensure that your desire is wholesome

223
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:35,520
that the desire is not it doesn't have any unwholesomely mixed in it if there's unwholesomeness mixed with

224
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:42,240
your desire for Spiritual practice chances are you're going to suffer

225
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:48,299
chances are you'll have stress and not a few people have gotten done

226
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:53,700
something like meditation or Buddhist practice and they're greedy like or

227
00:23:53,700 --> 00:24:00,059
they're ambitious or they're afraid and they're you know or they feel like there's a duty and

228
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:06,360
they have to they should do it or they're trying to get rid of something that's they don't like and so they're doing the practice because of their

229
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:12,179
aversion those are all unwholesome states

230
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:17,280
and if you those states are mixed into the desire the desire becomes

231
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:23,340
unwholesome so what is a wholesome desire

232
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:28,158
wholesome desire has no stress as part of it

233
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:36,620
and do you have any do you have any inkling of what a stress-free desire is like

234
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,840
you have a lot of desires every day I guarantee it the desire to go pee

235
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:51,720
desire to open the door a few of those desires have no stress in

236
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:58,200
them you do them almost mindlessly almost like unself-consciously

237
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:06,600
study those desires that you have through the day that have no stress in them

238
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,940
and see get a hang of them a feel for it to get a sense of what it's like to have

239
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:19,158
desires that well up that are stress-free tension free

240
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:25,980
also there are desires that the wholesome desires have no

241
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:32,279
um they don't have any sense of burden to them I think it's a burden obligation

242
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:38,640
I don't know if that's always unwholesome exactly but it's rarely going to produce a wholesome feeling in

243
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:44,340
the desire I think rarely sometimes

244
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:50,220
and um and so certainly no sense of burden in the desire

245
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:55,860
no big I should do this but rather it's more like the feeling

246
00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:02,480
inside maybe translate this for yourself but for me to say it's more like the feeling inside

247
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,520
wow I have the opportunity for this

248
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:15,659
wow let's do it how often do you have that feeling

249
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:20,940
you get up in the morning to make your breakfast wow I'm so lucky I get to have

250
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:27,240
this desire for food for breakfast and desire to make something here as opposed to make breakfast like I have to get

251
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:33,539
sober as quickly as I can because I have important things to do like it's like to like maybe meditate

252
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:40,740
and learn to be present and instead of

253
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:47,460
learning to be present with making breakfast so what I'm trying to point to here is

254
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:53,460
the idea that we can become the students of Desire of your desire

255
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:59,159
and to discover how your desire can be wholesome beneficial

256
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:04,740
something that brings you some sense of nourishment or support or Delight or joy

257
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:10,320
in the pursuit of other wholesome things

258
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:17,340
do you have any sense you have any clear idea of what inner movements desires feelings

259
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:22,320
impulses emotions motivations

260
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:28,400
mind States heart States that feel for you

261
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:34,100
nourishing supportive delightful inspiring

262
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:43,080
and I would suggest that for many people in our society they have very little experience of this

263
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:49,380
without having the world evoke them for them and so they go looking in the world for

264
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:56,340
something to do that is going to bring up these good things inside but but to discover how to find it in

265
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:01,440
oneself and really recognize it in oneself and

266
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:07,260
then have it kind of be able to have the desire to strengthen it to expand it to

267
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:12,659
grow it to take that seed bed and water it and

268
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:18,259
fertilize it and do what it takes to develop it and grow it

269
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:24,179
so the Buddha said if it were not possible

270
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:30,600
to develop the wholesome I would not teach you to develop the wholesome

271
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:37,200
but it is possible to develop the wholesome therefore I tell you develop the

272
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:43,260
wholesome so I hope by the end of this 30 minutes

273
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:49,520
okay if the first time I said it was a little bit burdensome for you to hear

274
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:56,400
oh no more work these Buddhists I'm hoping after the end of this talk that

275
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:03,659
maybe have some sense that this actually could be a quite inspiring teaching

276
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:08,880
and um and maybe it's one that will prepare you

277
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:18,059
to get ready for the new year so thank you very much and we have 15

278
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:25,080
minutes before we usually end so we can take maybe a few a little bit of that if you want to ask any questions or comments

279
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:30,840
and before we do over here I'll just last thing I'll say is you can go ahead

280
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:38,480
and give them the mic is so we're not going to be open next Sunday uh so that'll be the January 1st

281
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:45,020
we won't meet here and so we'll we'll meet um so I'll be back before

282
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:52,320
yeah so yeah I won't be here the following someday either we have a guest teacher for that week

283
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:57,480
foreign hi Gail my name is Rick thanks for the

284
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:02,760
talk and uh I just wanted to ask you if you would mind elaborating on something

285
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:09,899
to make it more real for me um I definitely relate to like the joy of

286
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:16,740
sitting down and making music or sometimes just having my croissant but I wonder you said there's something

287
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:21,899
very beautiful within that we can cultivate I would love to just hear an

288
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:29,279
example or two of how that is real for you I think love is one of them kindness

289
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:36,600
love that does in there a warmth the tenderness there is also sometimes a sense of

290
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:42,779
generosity that's there that's quite beautiful and strong and full kind of embodied generosity not like just like a

291
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:48,480
policy in the head there is sometimes feelings of peace

292
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:54,779
that are quite lovely to fix it Tranquility to feel inside that are considered wholesome

293
00:30:54,779 --> 00:31:00,740
there is joy happiness

294
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:08,299
is that enough okay contentment is another one

295
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:15,059
thank you Gil um

296
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:20,760
the word crucial it comes from a grass called kushala

297
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:26,299
grass which is very sharp so you find it used throughout the scriptures

298
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:32,399
it has even though they translate it as skillful it has the connotation of razor

299
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:39,360
sharp skills like a person walking on a tightrope or somebody operating with missionary where

300
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:47,880
they can get injured so it refers to the discriminative knowledge and in fact in the bhagavad-gita this is

301
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:55,200
one of the definitions for yoga yoga is called yoga Karma kaushalam it is it's

302
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:02,399
fine to keep your mask on I hear you fine yoga is called Skillman action

303
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:09,240
it's it's called um yoga Karma kaushalam so it's a skill it's the razor sharp

304
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:14,419
skill in action so I just want to do it okay thank you

305
00:32:14,419 --> 00:32:21,419
I've heard that before and that I said it takes a lot of skill to be able to pick the grass because you'll get cut if

306
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:24,559
you're not careful how you pick it

307
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:41,960
I just wanted to say thank you for your teaching all year and all the years great

308
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:54,000
thank you Gil um regarding desire I'm aware of desires

309
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:02,039
that I have that create a great deal of tension and that is the desire to be better at something

310
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:08,039
I happen to be a dentist and I have a desire to be a better dentist and it

311
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:13,080
creates a lot of tension how do I react to that or how do you

312
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:18,419
what would you react to that so when we start with the the top kind of the top

313
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:24,360
end or like bird's eye view looking at this desire of yours yours that brings tension

314
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:30,620
uh what would be a Wholesome Way of beginning to address it

315
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:37,559
hard work and step back further because the heart is hard work feel wholesome to you yes

316
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:44,220
oh so tell me how that works how does hard work feel wholesome that

317
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:49,679
how do you you feel better after you work hard oh yes I my my highest Highs

318
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:55,740
are after having accomplished something difficult and having done it well great

319
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:00,899
lovely so now how would you address how using that way of working hard how would

320
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:06,440
you now address this tension around wanting to do it better

321
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:14,158
I am I'm aware of I mean I work because I

322
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:22,020
want to work and I enjoy it a lot I don't have to work anymore it's different than I was 20 years ago but um

323
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:27,300
I'm aware of a kind of another conflicting desire like

324
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:33,240
why would I go to work and do something that's very difficult when I could just sit at home

325
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:38,700
you know I could sit at home and listen to meditation tapes or music whatever

326
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:44,339
and it's an interesting quandary that in my own mind I mean I would like to be

327
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:49,679
comfortable but I want to be um have have the accomplishment I guess

328
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:57,300
I'm kind of seeking the high of having done something well and that is just hard

329
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:03,619
work and requires a lot of creates a lot of tension yeah I think I think that the

330
00:35:03,619 --> 00:35:09,540
them in the generic against response to you is for you to spend a

331
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:15,000
lot of time being mindful of what's really driving you and what's really happening underneath the layers is

332
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,040
happening in your mind because there's probably layers of beliefs and attachments and clinging operating there

333
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:26,700
you don't even see especially because of all the tension and it has in there and um

334
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:32,220
so I think to do some kind of a deep investigation of this maybe with the

335
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:38,160
help of someone else who can you can have me in conversation with and kind of dig into it would be really nice

336
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:44,940
but you also seem to have something really wonderful about you and that you have this wonderful sense of uh doing

337
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:50,940
and throwing yourself in to do something really well uh that's it seems like could be a

338
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:56,700
beautiful thing to free from all the attention to do without any tension but to do it with the light and

339
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:01,800
wholeheartedness is a wonderful thing and listening to you I wondered whether

340
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:07,859
doing your Den I don't know where you do it now but if you do your dentistry in a different place then you're doing it

341
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:13,440
do it for free for people who are low income and I wonder if that would give you a

342
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,900
whole different sense of accomplishment and whole different level of challenge because you say you don't need to

343
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:24,960
anymore and that that would kind of allow you to explore a whole different side of yourself

344
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:30,359
that would come and grow then then you can if you do it like in the old what

345
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:37,140
you've been doing for all these years yeah I do a fair amount of that fantastic that's um does that make a

346
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:43,740
difference where you do it in terms of you're what you're talking about here not really no it doesn't matter if somebody's paying a lot of money or not

347
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:49,460
very or no money the the it's the work and the outcome of the work that matters

348
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:54,720
yeah well I think you have something good going here but uh there's something

349
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:01,680
for you to discover there that frees you from the tension and it might even allow you to without

350
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:07,740
the tension you might actually find that you enjoy it even more that there's a you're kind of in the flow of it in a

351
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:16,339
much more a beautiful way wonderful way thank you thank you

352
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:32,400
um I had heard the word um Chanda offered once as like a a counterpart to

353
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:38,460
Taha his wholesome desire and um and then another scholar told me

354
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:44,760
that it's more like neutral like you want to turn left here to go where you're going which was disappointing

355
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:52,260
because I had named my dog Chanda by that point um but it brings up a whole new thing of

356
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:59,220
neutral sort of Desire yeah um but my question as a practitioner is

357
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:06,839
um a tendency to cross-examine myself is this spiritual materialism am I is it

358
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:13,440
becoming grasping so I guess like a distinction between a wholesome desire

359
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:19,200
that's inspirational and and and leading to a good place versus sort of a near

360
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:25,920
enemy of wanting well for us is already said first about

361
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,800
Chanda so the the poly word c-h-a-n-d-a is um

362
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:39,300
I don't know if it's exactly neutral but it's um it's um ambidextrous

363
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:45,960
so it can be the word can be used both for wholesome men on wholesome and

364
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:53,820
sometimes in context is clear as being as unwholesome in context that's wholesome and um so it kind of can take

365
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:59,760
different shapes that way so it's still a good very good word in context so in the context of your life it's still a

366
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:06,740
good good name and um

367
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:13,160
so then that you're asking about the difference between wholesome desire and grasping

368
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:18,839
one what oh yeah spiritual gas screen yeah it uh

369
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:26,640
if um if you have some some intuition that there's spiritual grasping going on

370
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:33,599
um then see if you can flush out the stress or the dukkha the suffering

371
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:39,359
that's part of that grasping because sometimes it's just becoming an

372
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:45,480
expert and recognizing stress or tension or dukkha the Buddhist word suffering

373
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:53,280
becoming really sensitive more and more sensitive to how it operates even the most subtle ways is a window to be able

374
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,960
to identify what's unwholesome

375
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:03,420
so suffer better laughs

376
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:16,440
thank you for a very nice session on the wholesomeness of the desire

377
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:22,260
uh I think in our first conversation one-on-one with you I have presented to

378
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:27,300
you that my connection with Buddha was I used to

379
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:34,800
visit this place um it was actually a hotel where they had a

380
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:41,960
um a restaurant called Lumbini Lumbini is essentially the birthplace of

381
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:47,940
Buddha yes um and right next to it they had a bar

382
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:55,560
called Krishna within the same compound the hotel called Siddharth and Krishna

383
00:40:55,560 --> 00:41:01,020
is essentially a bar in the hotel is called Krishna

384
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,980
Krishna

385
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:15,619
oh the name of the bar is is called thirst craving

386
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:23,040
so I I wondered like I mean if that's like a wholesome uh desire like I mean

387
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:28,260
that's uh like it's why would they would name it that way I mean or they're just

388
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:34,500
being honest so the word in pal in Pali it's Tana in

389
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:38,579
Sanskrit I think it's uh and

390
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:46,980
um it's under I don't know with all the meanings are you know different areas of India in the English of Indian

391
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:52,619
language but then listen the Buddhist terminology it means it literally means

392
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:57,720
thirst but it has the connotation of uh craving

393
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:04,460
and so the so a good place to go for the craving for alcohol is to the bar

394
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:10,619
so they're just being honest and I I would hope that Buddhists would

395
00:42:10,619 --> 00:42:18,240
see that and say oh that's not my place [Music] so he would rather go to Lumbini than

396
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:25,320
yeah so so we're fascinating that that will be near the birthplace of the Buddha there's a bar called that no the the

397
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:33,800
restaurant was Lumbini and the bar was Krishna ah I saved great well

398
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:40,859
maybe the last one please yeah this might be my name's katita um this might be similar to a question that was asked

399
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:45,900
but I still wanted to ask it um two wholesome desires that I feel

400
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:52,560
like I have um they feel like their intention with each other one is like generosity and

401
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:59,160
wanting to help others and the other is to like be in community and just to be with others

402
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:04,260
um and yeah I guess my question is

403
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:11,040
yeah that they almost seem to like work against each other to the point where it feels like I can only really cultivate

404
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:17,400
one um and I'm just wondering

405
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:24,119
I guess what do I do about that in the sense of like I have this deep desire to help others and to be better

406
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:30,660
and to to just um when I say help others and help myself just be the best like we can be

407
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:36,720
and I work in mental health and just to like you know so everything around me I see in this way in light of how we can

408
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:43,319
be better and do better for each other and then I see community and I try to be in community

409
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:49,980
um but it's difficult for me because it's not it's not achieving like the standards I have for myself or wanting

410
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:56,160
people to be better so I'm like constantly um judging the way we do things the way

411
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:02,880
we reach out together in just just different things like that and I'm just wondering how to so let me so let me see if I understand

412
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:09,300
so the desire to be generous to do good for the world is really out there in the

413
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:14,400
wider world so to live in a community bounds you limits you

414
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:19,800
for because that takes time to be in community and so that you have less time to do the work the good work out there

415
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:24,839
so is that the attention yeah and I need community and I want to do it with

416
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:31,880
another I guess wholesome desires to do it with people right but it's it's kind of hard to work together sometimes

417
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:37,619
I'm noticing people you know we work differently worked and it's like I don't know there's like a it's almost hard for

418
00:44:37,619 --> 00:44:44,300
me to sit in that yeah Community is uh easy except for the people who are in it yeah

419
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:52,020
the um so so uh I mean I mean this is a really important topic so I feel like

420
00:44:52,020 --> 00:45:00,619
whatever I say will be just shorthand for okay so please for you know allow me so one is that um

421
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:08,040
part of your desire to do good for others can be for the people in that community that you're in

422
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:13,260
and that takes much more work it takes a lot more time you get much more reward

423
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:19,619
sometimes by doing things out there where you don't have to deal with interpersonal issues but to click to to

424
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:28,859
work on the interpersonal issues in a community in a Sangha or anywhere is doing uh similarly important inner

425
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:34,800
work as sitting in meditation by yourself is doing inner work you're purifying yourself you're clarifying

426
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:40,920
yourself discovering yourself in in really rich ways and there's plenty of Buddhists who have not done

427
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:46,920
the community part of work have just done a lot of meditation and they're really truncated in terms of their

428
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:54,720
development because they haven't been challenged by interpersonal issues and if you really want to kind of really uh

429
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:02,940
discover and work through a lot of the attachments and limitations and and unhealthy ways in which we can be to be

430
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:08,240
find a community that you feel like the right place to struggle in for you

431
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:13,859
then then you're pure you're kind of developing yourself and clarifying

432
00:46:13,859 --> 00:46:19,500
yourself purifying yourself and so the work you want to do Beyond there is does two things you're better at it because

433
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:26,339
you know the interpersonal stuff really well that's been come that's become your clean Channel now

434
00:46:26,339 --> 00:46:31,440
and the other is you've helped create a model for others about how a community

435
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:37,800
could be together and having more we need more Community models of healthy community

436
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:44,760
how does that sound it's very inspiring and it makes me want to just keep trying and to find a good community and to find

437
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:51,300
a community that I can trust and feel safe in and I think I have a few options I just have to realize it's a process

438
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:56,880
great great so it's not a community that is every you don't go through a community of just people who are all

439
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:03,060
Angels no no that's no fun I don't enjoy those

440
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:08,339
communities anyways but rather it's more like oh these are the people I want to be if I'm going to be in conflict with

441
00:47:08,339 --> 00:47:12,740
someone these are the people I want to be in conflict with
