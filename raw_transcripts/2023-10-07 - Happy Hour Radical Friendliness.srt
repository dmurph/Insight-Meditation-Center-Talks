45
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,320
distraction sleepiness

46
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,880
heartache can we meet this moment with

47
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,360
friendliness and steadiness of

48
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,519
heart steadiness and for steadiness it helps to connect with the breath the

49
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,040
sensations of the breath in the

50
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:42,079
body not as a yard stick not as it should but as a way to support

51
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:48,839
ourselves as a way to sooe [Music]

52
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:56,350
stabilize the same way that an anchor can stabilize a [Music]

53
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:04,000
boat from drifting here and there and

54
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,800
everywhere and then and yet don't let it be so heavy-handed this anchor of the

55
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,820
[Music]

56
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,360

62
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,839

63
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
weary

64
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:40,000

87
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:21,840

170
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:43,079
the dishes I'm in like a tiny little Ohana unit so it's like my sink for the bathroom and the dishes and all the

171
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:50,960
things I look at it and I just smile at myself and I I just I'm

172
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:58,599
trying I I'm able to pause and notice the inner critic I'm able to pause and

173
00:49:58,599 --> 00:50:04,200
just be like oh there you are and I love myself and I'm giving myself the benefit

174
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:11,319
out that I'm doing the best I can and even though there's too many things to do and never enough time to do them that

175
00:50:11,319 --> 00:50:18,520
like I'll figure it out and I have the best of intentions and so I'm Gonna Love This

176
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:24,040
Love Story we've been talking that you've mentioned I've dedicated to it I'm dedicated I'm going to do a ceremony

178
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:40,799

179
00:50:40,799 --> 00:50:46,319
self-advertisement um and and you know it it can be up and it's not what you're

180
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:51,760
talking about so I I I know what you're talking about it is beautiful it is the

181
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:58,280
wisdom of the ages we need to deeply appreciate love the

182
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:06,359
um the you know the goodness the beauty the challenges the the The Faults of

183
00:51:06,359 --> 00:51:13,119
this being who means doing their best because that's how they're going to grow that's how they're going to show up as

184
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:18,960
their best they're not going to grow and become the best they can in in a

185
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:25,720
container of self-judgment and self-hatred it just does not happen it is in the container of love and accept

186
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:31,920
that actually one takes responsibility for for one's faults and one's

187
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:38,520
challenges like yeah sweetheart you screwed up I still love you and we're going to do better next time so I am

188
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:44,200
just Overjoyed to hear that you're dedicated to it and and the message is

189
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:49,720
getting through this is so beautiful and so creative to write it on your mirror thanks for sharing that anything else

190
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:57,040
you want to add a yeah just that I think you know and I do think it's giving me the capacity to to show up for others

191
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:03,319
and the same you know like that's the purpose of it right it's a much bigger purpose than this individualized nature

192
00:52:03,319 --> 00:52:08,960
of meeting the inner critic differently um it's for a bigger scale for like we

193
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:16,359
do you know may have benefit all right so exactly right yeah we need to start

194
00:52:16,359 --> 00:52:21,440
with ourselves so that we can have the

195
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:27,720
loving caring stance to towards all you [Music]

199
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:56,440
[Music] said service to to all being everyone we

200
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:02,480
don't do this for ourselves we can do it for all things everyone [Music]

201
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:09,760
I yeah I um had an interesting experience with Mara on my sit um I was

202
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:17,079
feeling a lot of anxiety in my body and I and I told Mara I saw her but I told

203
00:53:17,079 --> 00:53:24,440
her I would take care of her and that it was okay and that um I trust her to be

204
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:33,200
with me so that was yeah that was really nice yeah beautiful and what happened oh um

205
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:39,680
my anxiety um dissipated and um and I also told myself

206
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:45,680
well it's not going to kill me and uh but I just

207
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:51,720
liked the um embodiment of the trust um

208
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:57,640
that um it would be okay and then I could take care of

209
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:06,359
it nice nice it's it's beautiful expression of friendliness towards XYZ

210
00:54:06,359 --> 00:54:11,400
towards the moment towards challenges instead of having adding more aversion

211
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:17,720
to what is challenging meeting them with kindness and seeing how they get transformed because of course we've

212
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:22,839
tried you know hating them and pushing them away and being angry with them how

213
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:29,359
well did that work let's try something different for a while this is great thank you Audrey I

214
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:34,559
love it yeah friendliness towards far and also again to contextualize for for

215
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:41,680
those who might be new again what what Audrey is speaking about is not giving into the distractions and the mara you

216
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:47,400
know whatever Mara represents and here as some people might wonder what is this Mara they're talking about so in

217
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:55,079
Buddhism the um in in Buddhism uh Mara is the representation of all the what

218
00:54:55,079 --> 00:55:02,480
what's called hindrances or rather all the coverings the the ill will and and

219
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:09,240
and being distracted and sleepy and you know all the things that get in the way it's kind of a personification of that

220
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:16,119
and yet the way to work with Mara is and and in this case the sense of anxiety

221
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:21,960
and and and remorse and restlessness is another one of the Mara and what Audrey

222
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:28,359
was speaking about and and it's so unhelpful to try when they arise on our

223
00:55:28,359 --> 00:55:36,359
path and of course they arise they arise when we're meditating they arise in our daily life it's not helpful to to have

224
00:55:36,359 --> 00:55:42,440
ill will and push them away in that way but um so so the the middle way is the

225
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:48,039
wise way between suppression and Indulgence so one

226
00:55:48,039 --> 00:55:53,400
doesn't want to indulge them but you don't want to to suppress them either so

227
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:59,799
the middle way is why wise relationship and what Audrey was describing is this

228
00:55:59,799 --> 00:56:04,880
wise relationship can I accept that you're here can I be friendly can I

229
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:10,960
soften around you not give in to you and yet not hate you so that that that

230
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:17,920
middleway wise um relationship thanks Audrey that was

231
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:23,680
great yeah yeah any other reflection before we

232
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:31,200
close especially if you have not spoken recently and of course you can put them

233
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:40,200
in chat remember yeah maybe we'll leave it as

234
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:46,400
