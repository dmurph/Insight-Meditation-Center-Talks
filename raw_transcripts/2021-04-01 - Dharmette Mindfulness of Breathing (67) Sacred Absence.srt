1
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,720
so we're continuing now with the last

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,280
steps of

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,679
last of the 16 steps of mindfulness of

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,679
breathing

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,119
and we're coming now to the the 15th

6
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,439
step

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,480
and which is uh the polyword that it

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,920
represents that has been

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,359
being used is niroda

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,960
and in the 14th step the poly word is

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,480
v raga the rhoda is spelled

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,480
n-i-r-o-d-h-a

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,280
and um and it's sometimes it's nice to

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:43,600
just

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,160
use the pali words because in the

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,480
original context and in india

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,239
these words have really rich

18
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,000
connotations

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,199
in fact the these the

20
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,399
raga and eroda are sometimes

21
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,199
listed almost as as synonyms or almost

22
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,480
as synonyms

23
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,760
for liberation itself and so they have a

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,520
very very kind of almost sacred or

25
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,640
special

26
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,360
quality that the english word for viraga

27
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,840
which i've said sometimes translated as

28
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,720
fading away

29
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,600
and sometimes as dispassion it doesn't

30
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,240
really capture the richness of the

31
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,759
the the associations or the the way it

32
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,479
feels in pali to the raga

33
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,119
and then same thing with niroda such a

34
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,400
rich

35
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,680
world word that in the original context

36
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,479
i think that

37
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,600
it really felt like a heartwarming idea

38
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,320
that

39
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,399
you don't get from the english

40
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,479
translations

41
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,280
the most common translation for niurota

42
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:49,759
is

43
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,880
cessation and cessation just

44
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,000
end you know ending doesn't really

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,799
bring for most of us doesn't bring much

46
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,840
heartfelt feeling

47
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,159
inspiration delight joy just cessation

48
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,119
it's like

49
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,360
just seems like okay it's not the ending

50
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,920
of something

51
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,280
the word niroda comes from the

52
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,959
prefix knee which means without

53
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,400
not free from

54
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,680
and rhoda which means obstruction

55
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,400
so it's being without obstruction so

56
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,560
cessation is a very different feeling

57
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,200
than

58
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,400
free of obstruction and maybe the

59
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,959
cessation of obstructions

60
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,239
cessation of blockages or clinging or

61
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,280
contraction or

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,879
what gets in the way of freedom and so

63
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:43,680
the 13

64
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,680
the 14th step the fading away the

65
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,040
dispassion

66
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,400
is the involves the fading away in the

67
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,680
ceasing

68
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,720
the ending of uh

69
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,480
attachments of cravings of conceits of

70
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,400
the driveness compulsive ways we're

71
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,080
being that

72
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,120
heaven definitely a feeling of uh

73
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,440
stress and maybe even pain associated

74
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,959
with their drive with their

75
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,560
presence and that the the

76
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,040
the pain of those the stress of those

77
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,239
becomes more and more apparent

78
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,360
the more wonderfully and beautifully

79
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,840
quiet and still the mind becomes a

80
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,959
meditation

81
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,159
the more calm we are the more they stand

82
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,000
out and highlight as being wow this is

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,640
kind of

84
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,360
uncomfortable to feel this way that in

85
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,959
ordinary street consciousness we might

86
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,480
not feel and so i can even say what's

87
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,239
the big deal

88
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,519
it's okay to have a little bit of

89
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,000
irritation but in deep meditation a

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,599
little bit irritation it doesn't feel

91
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,400
like a little bit

92
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,959
it feels like a real disruption and more

93
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,040
importantly an obstruction

94
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,680
to deeper peace deeper freedom

95
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,400
so the 15th step is one trains

96
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,840
um

97
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,599
observing cessation

98
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,439
one will breathe in observing

99
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,280
cessation won't breathe out observing

100
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,320
non-obstruction

101
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,320
when we'll breathe in observing

102
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,160
non-obstruction one will

103
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,280
breathe out and and so

104
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,000
uh as we get deeper and deeper at some

105
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,479
point we observe

106
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,520
a sacred absence we observe the absence

107
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,880
of something

108
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,080
and the absence uh that was really

109
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,400
strong is really uh noteworthy it's like

110
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,240
um deeply inspiring

111
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,280
so with watching in constancy

112
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,759
in constancy we're watching things come

113
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,160
and go they arise and they pass

114
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,400
and this and being in the river the flow

115
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,880
of transiency

116
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,080
but as we do that we begin to

117
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,919
the attachment to reaching into that

118
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,360
river of change

119
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,880
begins to give up can still relax

120
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,320
and with that something ceases something

121
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,560
stops something is no longer there to

122
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,360
obstruct

123
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,639
the freedom and that

124
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,680
and that absence is not just a temporary

125
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,639
absence like

126
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,800
it fades and then comes back a second

127
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,160
later or

128
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,160
fades away and comes back a minute later

129
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,600
or something

130
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,759
but it there's a way in which the

131
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,919
cessation the ending of it the

132
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,199
absence of it is really

133
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,639
impactful for the mind and the heart

134
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,000
wow it's possible

135
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,039
to really be free of cynicism

136
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,639
wow this is right you know i've been

137
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,240
sitting cynical

138
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,000
for decades wow this is possible

139
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,199
or i've been always you know

140
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,680
preoccupied and self-preoccupied with

141
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,800
self

142
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,360
wow this preoccupation with me myself

143
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,199
and mine has fallen away

144
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,720
and it's not here i can look around

145
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,639
where is it it's not there

146
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,400
wow it's it's absent it's ceased

147
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,880
it there's a non-obstruction now that i

148
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,880
realize that self-preoccupation was a

149
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,919
kind of a

150
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,560
obstruction or wind drag or something

151
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,520
jealousy doubt

152
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,840
hatred resentment

153
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,120
all kinds of desires that sometimes are

154
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,960
there kind of in the structure of how

155
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,199
our mind works

156
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,800
so embedded fear

157
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,080
and wow this has ceased for now

158
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,759
it might come back the next day it might

159
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,680
come back at the end of the meditation

160
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,280
but there's something about the

161
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,720
thoroughness

162
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,720
of that absence which makes an

163
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,840
impression

164
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,599
and then of this i know is possible

165
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,880
i had no idea this was possible and

166
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,919
of course this is like coming home or

167
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,319
this is health or this is my birthright

168
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:12,960
or

169
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,080
this is worthwhile this you know it's

170
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,919
worth this is is fantastic

171
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,919
and any movement away from it any way of

172
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,919
picking up the compulsion

173
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,479
that's a diminishment that's not really

174
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,479
worth it anymore

175
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,639
and that's not the direction to go

176
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,880
that's not the way i want to live

177
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,919
this is how i want to live without this

178
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,400
obstructions this kind of stress of

179
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,960
these kinds of things

180
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,759
and when this sense of absence is really

181
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,360
impactful and strong enough when it's

182
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,160
really

183
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,840
a very very deep thorough absence then

184
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,879
a person will never be the same again

185
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,440
it's almost as if that absence is a

186
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,639
living

187
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,759
memory or presence or something that as

188
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,800
a guide

189
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,199
oh this is where freedom is this is

190
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,639
where peace says this is where truth is

191
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,280
not truth propositional truth but just

192
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,240
the true way of being a certain way

193
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,120
and and and then it becomes an

194
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,080
orientation

195
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,879
for how to live our life or to say it in

196
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,639
different way

197
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,680
the tradition what the tradition says

198
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,960
when then has entered into the current

199
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,840
the good current the current that takes

200
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,440
us to full freedom

201
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,599
so we're in the river of change the

202
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,760
river of intransicency

203
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,719
but we've now discovered that there's an

204
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,518
a place that's not in the eddies

205
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,480
that's not in the in the brambles that

206
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:46,959
are

207
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,519
growing into the side of the river but

208
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,200
where notice maybe in the center of the

209
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,519
river there's a beautiful current

210
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,760
that if we stay in that current it'll

211
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,440
carry us

212
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,399
to the tradition talks use this as

213
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,120
analogy

214
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,320
to the ocean of liberation and freedom

215
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,120
and so this so i call this the sacred

216
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,399
absence

217
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,160
the absence of and to recognize the

218
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,080
value of absence

219
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,839
and this is a hard thing for many people

220
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,279
to appreciate

221
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,399
that absence has importance

222
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,920
the uh in a sense you can watch the mind

223
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,519
and see as soon as there's a quiet

224
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,200
moment in the mind sometimes it seems

225
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,560
like a mind just reaches out for the

226
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,240
next thing to think about

227
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,880
or we have certain problems and as soon

228
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,240
as that problem is solved

229
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,000
the mind just goes on to the next thing

230
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,680
and the next thing and the next things

231
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,720
the mind is filling itself all the time

232
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,040
but but to appreciate absence

233
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,080
cessation this deep sacred

234
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,279
pause or stopping and

235
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,440
let it impact us wow it's true

236
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,560
so that it's possible to be free

237
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,720
so it's a little disappointing for

238
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,399
people who always want to

239
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,920
have something that's be reassuring

240
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,760
something that's a confirmation that

241
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,519
they're important they're valuable

242
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,760
that they're on the right track that

243
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,519
they can have the badge to tell their

244
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,480
friends look i

245
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,240
have this beautiful thing the spiritual

246
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,480
quality or something and

247
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,920
but and an absence is not a badge you

248
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,720
can put on

249
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,360
absence is not the presence of something

250
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,160
there might be our ability to be present

251
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,519
for things of the world

252
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,680
become stronger but freedom is not

253
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,560
something tangible it's not something

254
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,040
that

255
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,240
in a sense that the mind can focus on as

256
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:42,480
an

257
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,880
object of attention in a usual way that

258
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,680
things we can

259
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,880
see and touch and feel

260
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,880
and so it's very easy to overlook

261
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,000
absences

262
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,560
or to diminish their importance in fact

263
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,120
in

264
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,480
in the history of buddhism in the

265
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,240
ancient world

266
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,160
there were debates and big concerns

267
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,519
about

268
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,600
some people some great buddhist teachers

269
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,360
couldn't understand

270
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,040
how an absence could be

271
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,720
that the ultimate goal the ultimate

272
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,399
freedom of buddhism was somehow

273
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,240
represented by an absence

274
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,480
it had to be a thing it had to be some

275
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,440
something and

276
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,959
they posited a variety of different

277
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,360
kinds of transcen transcendent kind of

278
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,120
states and experiences

279
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,320
because it had to be a thing um so

280
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,000
whether that's true or not

281
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
uh is besides the point what i'm trying

282
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,120
to say now

283
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,600
in the 15 steps of mindfulness of

284
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,480
breathing

285
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,839
it becomes it's at observing absence

286
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,040
observing cessation observing a space of

287
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,200
non-obstruction

288
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,720
observing how with the fading away of

289
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,399
of these you know passion for

290
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,040
these lust for clinging for craving

291
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,920
that it uh at some point the stopping

292
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,320
the cessation is so

293
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,760
full and sometimes it happens like like

294
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,480
a

295
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,079
like a quantum shift wow and sometimes

296
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,480
it happens slowly or fading away

297
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,079
but something and

298
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,440
and it might be just one thing it might

299
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,440
be cynicism or it might be

300
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,600
doubt but something that's been plaguing

301
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,120
us for a long time

302
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,560
boom wow we notice

303
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,880
this is possible and it is possible

304
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,560
and the buddha made this great statement

305
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,040
if it was not possible if it's not

306
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,200
possible

307
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,760
to i'm kind of paraphrasing him if it's

308
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,440
not possible

309
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,560
to bring an end to our unwholesome

310
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,399
mental qualities

311
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,200
i wouldn't teach you to bring them to an

312
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,959
end

313
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,519
but it is possible to bring unwholesome

314
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,560
mental qualities

315
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,880
to an end to cessation

316
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,320
and so i teach you that this is possible

317
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,920
so this 15th step is an

318
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,279
encouragement to appreciate

319
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,360
absence to appreciate sacred absence

320
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,160
take time recognizing when a

321
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,519
preoccupation when

322
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,959
greed when anger when desire when lust

323
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,320
when anything like all these things that

324
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,320
the mind involved in mind contracting

325
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,560
the heart contracting

326
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,680
notice know it appreciate when it's not

327
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,200
there

328
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,839
and that appreciation will allow to grow

329
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:38,480
or

330
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,320
allow you to feel some confidence about

331
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,399
this and keep making space

332
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,720
in sacred space sacred openness of

333
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,680
attention

334
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,240
to be more present and more here that

335
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,839
supports this whole process

336
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,959
of of furthering along onward leading

337
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,320
aspect of this

338
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,199
path of practice

339
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,120
so um breathing in

340
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,680
cessation breathing out observing

341
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,880
cessation so

342
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,160
thank you all and may

343
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,600
you appreciate the all the

344
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,720
absences that occurred to you today that

345
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,800
will enliven you or say it maybe

346
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,399
or just uh

347
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,760
just delight you benefit you open you

348
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,040
free you and there's probably much more

349
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,160
absences

350
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,240
that are the door to step through today

351
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,399
than you realize

352
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,480
may you appreciate the sacred absence

353
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,519
today

354
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,839
thank you
