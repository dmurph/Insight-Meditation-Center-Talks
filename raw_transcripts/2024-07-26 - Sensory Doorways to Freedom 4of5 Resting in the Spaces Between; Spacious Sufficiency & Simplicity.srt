1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:07,320
so today we are going to continue the series on um practicing with the sense

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,639
doors and I'm going to pick up on the theme of yesterday at least

3
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:18,560
initially which is to practice with

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:25,800
spaces and um spaces between mind the

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:33,200
gap so um taking a moment to adjust your posture maybe wiggle take that last sip

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:40,079
of tea greet your friends if you're on the

7
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,360
chat settle into your body and enjoy the silence if you're not

8
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,719
on the

9
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:58,039
chat and softening the eyes as if looking out

10
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:04,680
over a broad M up Big

11
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:13,118
Sky distant Horizon allowing the eyes to

12
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:25,759
close then noticing any of the variations of tone light color in the

13
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,439
eyelids softening the muscles

14
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:39,320
and then softening the [Music] tongue allowing the tip of the tongue to

15
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,200
rest on your pallet of your

16
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,719
mouth noticing any lingering

17
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:03,640
taste and inviting the whole body to

18
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,759
relax

19
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,640
soften allowing your stomach your belly to be

20
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:32,400
loose and perhaps taking two or three longer slower maybe even deeper breaths

21
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,280
diaphragmatic

22
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,640
breathing inviting the body heart and mind to be

23
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,640
here

24
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:03,560
now noticing the sensations of each

25
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:12,439
breath the little space between each exhale and the next

26
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:25,280
inhale and then allowing the breathing to be natural and normal

27
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:47,439
and tuning in also to any ambient sounds in your

28
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:53,560
space distant sound of vehicles or

29
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,599
animals breathe or water

30
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:08,799
and ATT tuning to a sense of the distance the

31
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:15,640
spaciousness between your ears and the sound

32
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:36,919
and then establishing mindfulness awareness at the

33
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:46,560
Forefront Gathering your attention on whatever your

34
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,400
primary object anchor of attention

35
00:04:53,639 --> 00:05:01,160
is could be the wash of all of these experiences just moving through

36
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:07,600
or any one of them sensation sound

37
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,360
breath I'll say a few words about mindfulness of

38
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:30,520
breathing and feel free to adapt those instructions

39
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:43,240
noticing the swell of the

40
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,919
inhale the fullness at the top of the

41
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,880
inhale and the release the

42
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,280
relaxation as the exhale

43
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:27,599
begins staying with all the little changes through the

44
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:35,720
exhale and resting dropping into the Gap at the end of the exhale a little

45
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,199
Still

46
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,199
Point and allowing the next inhale to naturally

47
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:03,240
emerge whenever it feels

48
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,360
easeful staying in contact with the

49
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,639
moment and noticing

50
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:35,520
appreciating any of the silent es the still points the spaces

51
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:45,319
between relaxing

52
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,560
allowing

53
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
receiving

54
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440

e e

58
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:43,279
you find yourself distracted appreciating the moment of

59
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:49,040
returning to awareness of the senses awareness of

60
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:56,519
now rather than judging or criticizing your

61
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:06,120
practice appreciating the shift from the world of thinking

62
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:13,480
planning back to the Simplicity and space of the sense

63
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
doors

64
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240

72
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:21,079
from time to time noticing the overall quality of

73
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:30,800
experience Pleasant unpleasant or neither

74
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:38,199
staying connected

75
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,560
resting in the sensory spaces

76
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:52,519
between whenever possible and allowing all of the

77
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
rest

78
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840

e e

86
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:58,039
and then the final moments of our meditation together

87
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,960
the invitation is to gather your attention

88
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,600
in your emotional Center your heart your

89
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:17,039
core the sense of

90
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:28,520
appreciation casting memory back remembering

91
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,520
any moments of challenge or difficulty in this

92
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,960
meditation with care and

93
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:47,360
compassion appreciation for your capacity to keep

94
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,760
showing up be

95
00:22:52,880 --> 00:23:00,440
present recalling that any experience

96
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,158
and be metabolized for further growth

97
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:16,120
wisdom death and from that place of

98
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:22,480
care compassion also

99
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:30,440
appreciating savoring embracing any moments of goodness

100
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:36,000
mindfulness awareness

101
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
patience

102
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:48,919
spaciousness Azure

103
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:57,039
present allowing them to nourish your heart and mind

104
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:03,720
these two are onward

105
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:20,799
leading and then casting your internal gaze outwards to the others this life

106
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,400
touches here near distant

107
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:36,840
forming the wish that this practice may have a beneficial

108
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,520
ripple effect for them as

109
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,679
well may our practice here

110
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:56,120
together be a cause and condition for all

111
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:02,600
beings to feel safe from harm and causing

112
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:09,080
harm we all beings to be

113
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:17,240
peaceful content happy and for all beings

114
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,679
everywhere to be free

115
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:49,520
thank you for your

116
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,278
practice for

117
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:54,200
thank you dear s and um I'm curious since many of you are

118
00:26:54,200 --> 00:27:01,360
bowing and um offering appreciations in the chat if you might also if you did it

119
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:08,240
offer what you noticed in the last 24 hours in terms of Surfing the senses or

120
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:13,679
noticing gaps spaces in your sensory

121
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:20,679
experience what um what unfolded for you if anything and it's fine if nothing did

122
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:25,840
but it's fun for other people too to see

123
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,919
listening more

124
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:55,919
great I love reading all of the little [Music] um pieces people are

125
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:02,080
offering about what they've been noticing in their sensory experience the fog the

126
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,320
owls the

127
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:17,240
sun trying to see things without naming so much yes that can be

128
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:22,679
profound the aliveness of the landscape the

129
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,360
hills appreciating the gift of Senses yes absolutely

130
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:37,559
quite a [Music] gift clows and rivers of breath

131
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:43,880
Sensations these are beautiful we could write a group poem this morning

132
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:55,039
today thank you I promise I'll read the rest of them later probably need to start talking and offer

133
00:28:55,039 --> 00:29:04,399
special empathy for anyone whose Gap was forgetting to notice the Gap that is also human so human and often the first

134
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:09,760
step in the practice is noticing afterwards

135
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:16,159
the wish and then slowly it happens right afterwards and then in real time

136
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,600
and then organically at the

137
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:28,159
beginning so yesterday we covered hanging out at the sense doors which

138
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:35,320
which was a couple of different practices that I just mentioned surfing the senses and resting in the spaces

139
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:41,519
between sensory experiences minding finding the

140
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:47,159
Gap gaps plural today I want to talk a little bit more about that second

141
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:53,519
practice of being in the spaces being in the spaciousness that's available at the

142
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:59,559
sense stor and then bring in a related onward leading practice as

143
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:06,880
well so I'll recap just a little bit because we barely covered this yesterday but yesterday the invitation in that

144
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:14,880
second practice was to notice the spaces available between objects between what

145
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:23,480
meets our senses our eyes ears Etc and to rest there just kind of hang

146
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:29,159
out there and the space in between can be

147
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:36,399
between Sensations sounds sight objects like between trees or tree branches

148
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:45,039
between Hills between our body your body and other things or even a sense of the body

149
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:52,399
occupying moving through space especially when we tap into the

150
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:59,080
senses this way they can be doorways to easeful and a radical

151
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:05,120
Simplicity in present moment experience even if we're moving around and about

152
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,480
our day I've had moments of spaciousness happen even in heavy traffic on Golden

153
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,639
Gate Bridge by noticing this so it's

154
00:31:15,639 --> 00:31:21,760
portable there's this possibility of tapping in to just a touch of comfort

155
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:29,840
Stillness in any sense experience so

156
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,120
eyes finding this at the eye door we call

157
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:40,880
it it's the difference between looking at something and seeing that I talked

158
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,480
about the first day that finger wiggling practice of tuning into the peripheral

159
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:53,399
vision the overall Act of seeing rather than looking softening connecting

160
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:59,679
appreciating visual receptivity itself and then noticing what artists

161
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:06,360
refer to and photographers as negative space the space between around and above

162
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:11,600
things the space between the image of my body in the background for example or

163
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,398
the space around your computer

164
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:23,240
monitor the space around all of the objects in your

165
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:30,679
room this has a couple of nice effects one is it actually can

166
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:36,600
be a way of calming the mind if there's any emotional overwhelm there's

167
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:45,279
something about doing this that's inherently calming and then whether or not there's

168
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:51,120
any emotional overwhelm emotional activity it can be an entry point

169
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:56,880
into a much softer quieter place especially if you're able to notice

170
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:03,600
vastness of any kind the sky is available to most of

171
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:09,480
us sometimes I find it helpful to invite this practice with wisdom questions I

172
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:17,760
call them vas Coons and they are for example am I

173
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,960
aware of what in the

174
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:29,759
senses and what is the quality of awareness right now

175
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:37,720
and these are not questions that need to be answered with words or even asked with words it can feel like a sense of a

176
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:44,960
question mark meeting the moment however you might notice if this

177
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:51,360
practice works for you a shift in Acuity at the sense door and just to

178
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:58,360
appreciate rest in that sometimes nonverbally moments

179
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:04,399
people experience resting at the sense doors especially the visual door but it

180
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:11,878
can be all of them as a kind of transparency like being a window for

181
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:19,280
awareness in the world yesterday I also spoke of noticing

182
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:25,919
the gaps the spaces in physical pain and that can be incredibly powerful

183
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:33,760
for those of us who have had or have have ongoing chronic discomfort or

184
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:41,599
pain those with practice experience on this um sit may also have occasionally

185
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:46,878
noticed that the same kinds of spaces the same kinds of gaps can happen

186
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:53,158
between thoughts and emotions in your heart and mind even in the midst of

187
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:58,560
emotional pain and suffering and internal storm

188
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:06,680
can notice the absence of a thought or painful emotion when shifting to another

189
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:13,320
sense as well I have an anecdote for this um from a retreat I saw this was

190
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:19,000
many years ago now well over a decade ago and I did something that I don't

191
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:25,320
recommend any of you ever do which is I had a difficult conversation with someone right before going into silence

192
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:30,440
phone call and if you've ever sat a retreat you know that

193
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:38,400
whatever the last few things you did of consequence are often are featured in your mind sometimes for days or at least

194
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:44,839
hours and so my mind was just reviewing this conversation and trying to figure

195
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:51,720
it out and work with it and and da d da da da very unpleasant but the practice was

196
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:57,960
continuing there' be moments of of presence and then moments of distraction with this

197
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:06,040
and at a certain point the attention just naturally moved to the space in the sky between the

198
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:11,720
clouds the sun coming through and the mindfulness was strong enough to notice

199
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:17,359
that boom the suffering stopped and

200
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:22,560
then the heart and mind the attention could just hang out

201
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:28,800
there so the invitation is to notice these kinds of

202
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:35,040
moment dramatic or small notice your own clouds parting

203
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,640
your own mental story

204
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:47,640
parting you can notice these gaps at the ears especially the perception of

205
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:55,240
distance between yourself and what's heard or the silences between the

206
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:01,599
sounds noticing the ends of a taste or the end of a

207
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:07,960
smell and noticing moments of balance Stillness

208
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:15,760
equipoise in your body Stillness between

209
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:25,079
Sensations it's often our minds that stir up distraction or

210
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:32,520
activity can you find a place in the body that's still quiet

211
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:40,240
spaceship and if hanging out at these sense

212
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:45,720
doors it's also really helpful to notice

213
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:51,880
V knowing simple knowing of pleasant unpleasant or

214
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:58,200
neither many of us I would dare say most meditators

215
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:03,680
after you've been practicing for a little while it's more inherently Pleasant to be with the

216
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:08,720
Simplicity of the body the moment seeing

217
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:16,119
hearing tasting then it is to be caught up in

218
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:23,079
the stories of the Mind the virtual reality knowing simply Pleasant

219
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:31,000
unpleasant or neither is important information and and it can undercut

220
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:38,240
reactivity stop stories in their tracks and it begins to deepen these sensory

221
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:43,560
doorway practices in a wisdom Direction which I'll talk about more tomorrow this

222
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:50,200
is the deeper end of the pool for this practice but meanwhile it's so simple

223
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:57,640
just to notice every now and then Pleasant or not or unpleasant

224
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:04,640
a sense of sufficiency can emerge from practicing with the sense doors in these

225
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:10,040
ways and that sufficiency contentment

226
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:15,240
Simplicity generosity help to open any

227
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:19,839
clenching clutching of the heart and

228
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,440
mind so between now and tomorrow your assignment should you choose to accept

229
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:33,440
it is to experiment with resting in this simple intimate connection with the

230
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:40,520
world through noticing again any spaces between sensory experiences around

231
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:45,960
things within yourself and notice the

232
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:52,800
vena notice what nourishes you in these

233
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,130
practices thank you so much for your kind attention it's a joy to be with you

234
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:05,040
[Music] and look forward to being with you again tomorrow
