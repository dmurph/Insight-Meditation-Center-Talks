1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,839
so good evening nice to see you all as many of you know I'm continuing

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:13,960
this uh introduction to mindfulness meditation Series today is class four

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:19,279
it'll be the last class on mindfulness meditation I'll be continuing on in

4
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:27,039
other weeks uh after this um with some other topics related to meditation but

5
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,330
uh the introduction to mindfulness meditation was the four

6
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:40,200
[Applause] weeks so maybe I'll just give a brief uh review of uh what we talked about uh the

7
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:47,199
first three times we met the first time I emphasized

8
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:53,719
mindfulness of breathing just resting the attention on the experience of

9
00:00:53,719 --> 00:01:00,399
breathing and I'm emphasizing this word experience or Sensations

10
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:08,080
rather than you know thinking about breathing rather than Imagining the breath going in and out or some other

11
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,560
things that's that's a another way to meditate but for mindfulness we're just

12
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,960
staying with actual experience and this alone can be a

13
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,840
practice to distinguish well what is it about to think about breathing and what

14
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,560
is it to experience breathing and for me I sometimes would

15
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:40,000
uh think about uh think I would consider that the experiences don't necessarily

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,560
have words it's just an

17
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:51,159
experience whereas to think about breathing is words primarily so that

18
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:56,320
could be one way to make a distinction and so when I'm doing guided

19
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:05,159
meditations I'm often talking about the sensations of breathing rather than the breath or breathing just

20
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:10,160
to highlight this embodied um

21
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,280
experience of just the body breathing the body knows how to breathe we're just

22
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:23,160
tuning into it so that's at the core of uh this mindfulness meditation at least

23
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:29,680
uh like in this mindfulness Movement we might say and certainly here at IMC we

24
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:37,879
have that kind of like as the default mindfulness of breathing for some people the breath is not such a good uh object

25
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:43,239
because it's not very neutral in particular if you have asthma or something you might be associations of

26
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:50,599
you know not being able to breathe well or something and in that case we can recommend uh doing mindfulness of sounds

27
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:56,360
just kind of like opening up and just listening to sounds it's surprising that even though

28
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:02,080
we're all sitting here silently there are plenty of sounds there's a outside

29
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,760
inside all this kind of things so that can be an alternative to the

30
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:15,319
breath then on the second week talked about mindfulness of the body recognizing that sometimes the body is

31
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:23,200
uncomfortable in fact if you were to just notice or maybe if there were a video uh

32
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,640
camera on somebody who was just sitting in a chair no audio just a video would

33
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:35,360
notice that they just their post posture you know every few minutes it's just what we do and the reason why is because

34
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,760
there's a little bit of discomfort we don't even notice we just shift our

35
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:46,879
posture but with mindfulness meditation we're for the most part maintaining the

36
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,280
same posture and then we're noticing oh yeah that's uncomfortable you know have

37
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:59,519
it itch or my knee hurts my back is bothering me or something like this and

38
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:06,680
of course of course we don't want you to injure yourself or you know push yourself uh Beyond what's appropriate

39
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:13,439
but there is an opportunity to see if you can learn something about

40
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,799
how what your patterns of behavior are when there's something

41
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:24,680
uncomfortable and to stretch your capacity to be with things that are

42
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,840
uncomfortable turns out that this Human Experience has a lot of uncomfort

43
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:37,919
comfortableness and there's freedom to be found if we don't always have to avoid it but instead we can acknowledge

44
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:46,000
yes this is uncomfortable and not have to run away and not have to make it be different so

45
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,320
that was the second is the breath and then the body and one way they work

46
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,400
together is we have the breath as the anchor and if the body becomes

47
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,919
compelling it I I'm saying knees and back because this is what's very often uh what's

48
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:10,400
uncomfortable when we're starting a meditation practice and we just let go with a breath and be mindful of the body

49
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:18,240
the bodily experience feeling it sensing it tuning into it when it's no longer compelling

50
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,960
we just come back to the breath so in a relaxed easy way breath body breath

51
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,360
breath breath body breath could be something like this

52
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:36,720
third week last week I talked about emotions and recognizing that emotions

53
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,600
are you know a beautiful part of the human experience and sometimes they're troubling

54
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:51,280
too and freedom and this arena is to have the freedom to not be afraid of any

55
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,160
emotional experience to have the confidence that I can feel terrible

56
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:05,599
grief I can feel rage I I can feel Envy I can feel bitterness whatever it might

57
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:10,880
be and so to have this way that okay I can experience them but I don't I won't

58
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:17,680
feel overwhelmed I don't have to act them out I don't have to avoid them instead I can allow them to arise and

59
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,759
pass away and one way that we do that is to

60
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:30,440
tune into the what I like to call the sematic signature for each emotion

61
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:37,919
how does anger feel in the body often like for example there's like

62
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:43,759
heat in the face sometimes there can be like this uh like energy in the

63
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,360
hands sometimes the body leans forward a little bit it's not necessarily the same

64
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,319
for everybody but there's some common things that uh we might recognize with

65
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:00,680
uh each emotion and then to tune into the bodily experence and let all the

66
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,840
thoughts just do what thoughts do they spin around we'll just let them do that

67
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:13,680
and we'll tune into the bodily experience and in this way we are honoring and respecting our

68
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:21,199
emotions taking care of them we're not repressing them we're not pretending they're not there but we're also

69
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:27,080
not uh getting falling into them and being pushed around by them instead

70
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,199
there's a certain amount of dignity like maybe I've blend done plenty of

71
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:40,280
meditation with tears with sadness I've also had tears of immense Joy with uh

72
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:46,199
meditation so to tune into the bodily experience part of the reason to tune

73
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:53,680
into the body is so much more tangible it's just easier to feel bodily

74
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:00,199
experiences Sensations in the body whether it's tightness or tingling or heat or

75
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:07,280
throbbing or the sense of wanting to jump out or sense of wanting to collapse

76
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:13,560
all these things are so much easier to tune into and we often have less um

77
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:21,520
judgment about them so we can hold them like yep sadness feels like

78
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,199
this and to feel it and allow the motion to rise and pass

79
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:33,080
away so this week I'd like to build on all

80
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:38,440
the three preceding weeks and talk about mindfulness of

81
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:46,120
thinking of course thinking is such a big part of our life our

82
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:51,680
experience and there's a reason why it's the fourth week and not the first week

83
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:59,480
there's two primary reasons one is it's not so easy so it helps to have had some

84
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:07,079
uh practice with some mindfulness in general before we turn towards mindfulness of thinking because the

85
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:14,320
usually what happens is we are just maybe like turned towards the thought and off we go we're just lost in the

86
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,600
thought and the planning what the groceries we're going to get or rehearsing that conversation we had

87
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:26,560
earlier that irritated us or whatever it might be whatever it might be so one

88
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,680
reason is just have a little bit more experience with mindfulness before we turn towards mindfulness of

89
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:39,680
thinking and a second is turns out that the body mindfulness of the body is a

90
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,800
tremendous support for mindfulness of thinking

91
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,200
also in some ways this is a false dichotomy but in some ways we can think

92
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:58,600
about we can consider that The Human Experience has the bodily experience the

93
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:05,079
somatic kinesthetic embodied experience and

94
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:11,800
there's the mental experience where there's the thoughts that just do what thoughts do they go

95
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:19,160
around and round try to solve things make things better of course they're a beautiful thing

96
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:26,440
thoughts but I'll I'll touch on to that a little bit later tonight about how mindfulness of the body uh can be a

97
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:36,360
support for mindfulness of thinking but before I do that I want to just

98
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:42,800
uh ask you to imagine something this isn't necessarily a guided meditation

99
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:49,560
but just to imagine that you're sitting on a

100
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:56,680
riverbank I got this from Gil ronto I learned this so many years ago but I just love this so you're sitting on a

101
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:03,560
river bank and the temperature is perfect it's warm

102
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:11,639
you're not too much sun but there's a little bit of [Music] Breeze maybe you just had a very nice

103
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:17,720
lunch so you feel content nowhere you need to

104
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,920
be you're sitting on the riverbank in a way that's really comfortable however whatever way is

105
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:30,279
comfortable for you on a bench or something and you're just just

106
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:38,360
enjoying watching the river go by maybe you hear the

107
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:46,279
birds the waterers just passing by it's lovely it's very

108
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:51,760
nice sense of ease

109
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:58,440
contentment and then you see a big fairy boat and there's a huge party on this

110
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:03,720
boat there's dancing and singing all this loud music there's Buffet tables

111
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:09,959
there's food you can see all these people and before you know it boom you've jumped on this boat and you are

112
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:15,760
at the buffet table singing along dancing and having a great

113
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:22,040
time and you continue to be dancing and singing and but it just starts to get

114
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:28,800
feel a little empty a little bit and then you remember oh right I was sitting

115
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,959
on the river bank and then you go back to the river

116
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:44,279
bank sitting there wow it's not nice to just feel

117
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:49,519
like nothing needs to happen just

118
00:12:53,800 --> 00:13:00,399
peaceful and then a battleship comes you can see the cannon on board and there

119
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:06,880
the soldiers are Marching and there's all kinds of artillery and and there's U

120
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:15,279
people with binoculars looking out and and before you know it boom there you are on this warship and strategizing and

121
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:22,320
all this planning of how we're going to make everything safe and take care or retaliate or whatever needs to be done

122
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,760
and there's so much work to be done on this Battleship and to check all the

123
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:36,560
artillery and make sure everybody knows their orders and then this gets

124
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:43,040
tiring oh yeah I was meditating I was sitting on the river

125
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:50,000
bank and then you find yourself on the river bank [Music]

126
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
again pH

127
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:08,079
just sitting there enjoying

128
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:16,519
it and then you see this poor beat up raft is just barely floating by seems

129
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:23,440
like it's held together with bubble gum and Sho string it's just barely

130
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,920
floating this poor thing it's dilapidated not taken care of

131
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:37,440
and before you know it boom there you are on this raft trying to hold it together and make sure it doesn't uh

132
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:46,040
sink hoping desperately that it'll stay afloat paddling with your

133
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:52,959
hands this poor raft so you're not sure if it's going to make

134
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:59,560
it and this gets exhausting to a certain type of tiredness

135
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:06,839
and you realize oh yeah I was meditating and you find yourself back on

136
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,360
the River

137
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:22,040
Bank probably doesn't take too much imagination to this simile of the boats

138
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:28,480
on the river as often we jump on I'll call

139
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,600
these boats s that are just going by and there's a

140
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,639
way that we jump on them and forget everything else and get completely lost

141
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:45,839
in them and get caught up in whatever is on that boat

142
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:54,040
entertainment anger Revenge poor me poor

143
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:03,959
raft there's a way in which we might have like a have a pattern of jumping on

144
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:11,000
certain kinds of boats might have a pattern of you know

145
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:20,040
preferring to jump on some boats and other boats we just let those go by but the other ones you jump right on

146
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:28,959
them what would it be like to just stay on the river bank and watch the boats go by maybe

147
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:33,959
even be amused by the boats going

148
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:43,680
by turns out that much of our Lives is lived on one of these

149
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:50,240
boats sometimes we don't even remember that the river bank is

150
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:57,759
available to us place of some quiet and contentment

151
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:14,360
so I'm do a guided meditation

152
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:30,320
here taking a meditation posture a posture that has both some

153
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,880
alertness and some

154
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:49,440
ease feeling the pressure against the body or the chair or the cushion is

155
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:57,799
contacting the body we're here

156
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:17,720
feeling the pressure on the back the back side the back of the

157
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:29,679
legs and feeling the feet what they are touching

158
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,399
feeling connected

159
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:59,400
grounded then rest your attention on the sensations of breathing

160
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:10,440
tuning into the experience of breathing

161
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:42,600
feeling the body move as it breathes

162
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:20,200
and when the mind wanders as it's apt to do for now we'll just very simply

163
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:25,799
gently begin again with the sensations of

164
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
breathing

165
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:04,039
e just hanging out with the

166
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:17,799
breath nothing in particular needs to be happening we're just noticing the

167
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:20,639
experience of

168
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,559
breathing for

169
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,799
just coming back to the breath

170
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:25,520
stabilizing quieting the mind and the

171
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,480
body for

172
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,919
and now when you find yourself waking up

173
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:14,200
after being lost in thought just notice is there a category

174
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:21,720
a type of thought is there a type of

175
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:27,600
boat planning remembering

176
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:40,279
entertaining just make a small mental note like a whisper in the

177
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:45,679
mind planning and then come back to the

178
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,440
sensations of breathing

179
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:30,360
we don't have to turn thinking into the enemy or something we have to get rid of

180
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:37,320
for now we'll just note the

181
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:45,159
type of thoughts and come back to the sensations of breathing doesn't matter how many

182
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:48,760
times you do

183
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,360
this e

184
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:43,069
[Music]

185
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,200
in some schools of meditation thinking is like considered more you know something that you

186
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,600
absolutely don't want to do but in this style of meditation it

187
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:13,120
turns out this whole idea this whole notion of distraction doesn't

188
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:21,120
exist instead we just can turn our mindfulness towards whatever is the most

189
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:28,000
compelling whether that's uh emotions bodily thought or the experience of

190
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,080
things in a moment I'll talk more about how to be mindful of thoughts but there's this

191
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:41,240
way in which it's about a shift in our relationship to thinking with meditation we're not

192
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:48,559
making them the enemy nor are we just following them and doing whatever they say like we often

193
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:55,720
are doing during the day instead we're taking a third stance we noticing

194
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:01,840
them and but not getting in involved with them not necessarily believing them

195
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:08,960
not necessarily um following whatever they are saying but instead just maybe like

196
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:16,480
emotions honoring and respecting them and yet keeping a sense of

197
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:23,200
stability not so easy to do this it's uh so often we are identified with our

198
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:30,559
thoughts and we might even feel like well who am I or what does the world even exist if there aren't thoughts or

199
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:36,039
something like this I'll talk about that in a little bit too but before I go there I'd love

200
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:44,240
to hear from some of you either there any questions about what I've said so far or did you notice uh was there like

201
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,880
one type of boat that you liked to jump on more frequently and did you know that

202
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:55,240
about yourself was this new or this whole notion of even the possibility of

203
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:00,919
being on a river bank the bank rather than on a boat or was that a new idea or

204
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:03,679
anything you'd like to

205
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:15,399
share so the boat I realized I was jumping on was like a worrying

206
00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:21,799
boat and um yeah I just find it interesting uh just realizing that but a

207
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:28,760
question that I have is is the point of meditation trying to realize when I'm

208
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:34,320
jumping onto that boat not when I'm meditating like on my day like normal

209
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:40,440
day or on another activity or is it a goal that I should just like focus on

210
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:46,960
while I'm meditating like realizing the thoughts that I'm having and just like come back to the

211
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:53,960
breath it's it's just like that question is it something that I can also like apply on a day-to-day basis or is it

212
00:28:53,960 --> 00:29:01,200
only during meditation yeah yeah thank you this is a great question so I would say meditation is more like a laboratory

213
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,279
in which we can explore and learn things but it's really for our life it's really

214
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:12,559
further our our whole life and part of maybe I would I feel funny kind of

215
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:19,360
saying this word goal but let's say the direction we're going the orientation we're going is for more freedom for more

216
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:25,200
ease in our life and it turns out sometimes we get stuck in thoughts where we're just thinking the same thing over

217
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,279
and over and over again and the 5,000th time we think it's just not helpful or

218
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:35,559
there's a way in which we are always you know planning and feeling like our whole

219
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:42,120
life is just one long to-do list I got to get take care of it and meanwhile our life is passing Us by but we feel like

220
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:47,640
we need to plan so first is to just recognize what we are what we're doing

221
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:52,720
and then meditation helps us helps the mind and the body to recognize oh yeah

222
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:59,360
there's this you working on this simile it's possible to sit on the river Bank

223
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:06,399
while doing our chores while working while doing anything talking to people that we care about getting an argument

224
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:11,480
with people that whatever it is it's possible to be embodied and connected

225
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:17,519
and steady and not being pushed around thank

226
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:24,960
you and I would say maybe that's the freedom is to not avoid and the freedom is to not be pushed around I mean life

227
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,399
is going to bring us what it's going to bring us if we don't get to control the Universe of course wouldn't it be great

228
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:38,399
if we could anybody else have a a comment

229
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:49,080
[Applause] or um for me especially this week it's

230
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:55,000
been election stuff um there's been just been so much

231
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,000
insane stuff on the news um and I feel like I've spent some time this

232
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:08,240
week realizing I'm on that boat and I've also spent some time on this

233
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:13,279
week choosing to be on the boat and choosing to get off but sometimes that's not so

234
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:20,080
conscious for me so I've been having kind of both experiences and if you had to um give

235
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:26,240
kind of like a general tone or mood or attitude or something like this for the boat what would what did you say with

236
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:33,200
the you said election Stu that's more kind of content but is there a is it

237
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,639
uh um with the election or maybe like lots

238
00:31:38,639 --> 00:31:44,679
of things that are on the news um I think there's this feeling

239
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:51,000
like there's something urgent going on that I can't do anything

240
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:58,000
about um so there's definitely like this feeling of a sense of urgency but without anything specific

241
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:05,559
ific it's not necessarily it's not like planning where I can if I'm planning a party I can think about what tasks I'll

242
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:11,880
do to get ready for the party MH whereas with the news it's sort of like there is

243
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:18,200
that urgency but there's not at least for me there's nothing

244
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:25,880
specific that I come up with right in the moment it's more just I kind of just ruminate on in thoughts about what other

245
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:33,039
people are doing and what's happening far away yeah yeah this uh you didn't

246
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:39,039
use this word I'm going to use this word but this feeling of helplessness like wait there's all this stuff going on and

247
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:45,080
what what can I do and it's just happening and all this yeah yeah it's uncomfortable feeling and it really

248
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:52,080
grabs us and as a society we've created these news outlets who are designed to do this so they're very effective right

249
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:57,919
these are not they're not I'll just this is Diana's opinion they are not uh let's

250
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:03,880
just say this they are for-profit businesses so you know let's they're

251
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:12,080
going to do what they need to do to be profitable yeah thank you thank

252
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:20,320
you anybody else have a comment or something they'd like to say or question

253
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:38,039
so maybe I'll talk a little bit about uh like how to thank you how to maybe help us to not

254
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:44,519
get so Swept Away by thoughts and or maybe not to find ourselves um always uh

255
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:50,440
jumping on the same boat or if we do find ourselves jumping on the same boat like what's something that we can

256
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:56,159
do and one is that um

257
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:01,919
usually I don't I don't if I can say 100% of the time but it certainly is my

258
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:08,398
experience and many others is that if there is a certain like this uh uh

259
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:13,480
pressure for thinking this certain sense of I have to think about this there's

260
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:19,480
this maybe maybe even a sense of urgency or a sense of something needs to be done

261
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:26,000
and then we just find ourselves kind of like in this Loop and not really going

262
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,158
anywhere we can just ask ask this very simple question we could just drop in the

263
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:36,839
question is there any motion that's underlined

264
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:44,079
this chances are yes

265
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:52,440
fear sadness that we don't want to feel anger that we don't want to feel

266
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:57,920
these types of things are like underneath and like little volcanoes they're supporting all the thoughts are

267
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,079
happening up here and this is kind of what's uh the emotions are spewing or

268
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:08,280
fueling fueling them let's say that that's kind of what's the energy

269
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:14,480
behind these uh boats and what maybe also kind of propels us to want to

270
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:20,599
be on those boats so one thing if we find ourselves kind of like stuck with our thinking is to just drop in the

271
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:27,680
question is there an emotion underneath this and it's not so much that we AB

272
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,960
abolutely have to find the precise answer at that moment it's the asking of

273
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,720
the question because the asking of the question is this kind of like is turning

274
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:46,520
towards with respect and kind of like an opening up to to listen to or feel into

275
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:51,760
what's happening it's something other than

276
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:58,800
thinking because what the mind would like to tell you is no no no no you have to think about the thoughts

277
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:06,839
and then you just think about thoughts and that's just thinking so it's the way to like it's to

278
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:14,359
shift uh our relationship and to change the experience from being lost in

279
00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:21,880
thought to being more embodied so it might be sadness and maybe just the word or maybe

280
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:28,560
there's a sense of sadness shows up and then we mindfulness

281
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:36,119
of sadness mindfulness like oh yeah there's a lump in my throat pressure behind my

282
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:42,880
eyes shoulders feel heavy and just be with the bodily

283
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:49,000
experience let the content take care of themselves thoughts will just do what thoughts will do we don't have to worry

284
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:56,440
about them but work can be with the emotion that's fueling them because once

285
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:03,760
the emotion it has a chance to be seen and recognized then it'll stop fueling the

286
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:12,560
thoughts so instead of trying to put out a flame instead we're going to just take out you know put the cap on the fire the

287
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:19,560
the gas hose I don't whatever you know what I mean I was thinking about where were

288
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:25,680
those in Kuwait remember when they had those all those they couldn't put the fires out the oil wells it's feels kind

289
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:31,359
of like that where there's just all this Fountain and this fueling coming

290
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:37,280
up so that's one thing to do is if you notice that there's a lot of thinking or

291
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:44,000
certain pressure around the thinking just to uh drop in and to ask is there an emotion underneath here chances are

292
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:52,520
very high it's yes because there's this way that

293
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:58,280
um we can't think our way out of thinking even though that's you know

294
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:04,480
this is our habit it's what we do in the modern world we've all been acculturated

295
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:11,040
this way we've been educated this way probably our professional lives are this way thinking is very

296
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,280
important and we don't need to do it as much as we

297
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:21,520
do in the way that we do thinking is necessary to solve problems there are

298
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:27,079
problems to solve but you know even earlier today I

299
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:33,319
was trying to remember there was something I had to do and I just found myself thinking about okay don't forget don't forget don't forget you know and I

300
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:39,720
just there's this way it was just staying with me staying with me you know like the fourth fifth sixth 20th time I

301
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:47,520
thought about that's probably enough but there's a way in which we just kind of get stuck often in these

302
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:54,400
loops and then you know our life is passing Us by and it's pushing us

303
00:38:54,440 --> 00:39:02,760
around so that's one way to be with the thoughts another way is I uh during that

304
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:10,280
guided meditation encouraged you to maybe you make a little note planning imagining remembering or

305
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:16,599
something like this and there's a way that making a little note can be really

306
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:24,079
helpful because to make a note creates a little bit of Separation there's the one

307
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:30,760
who's making the note and then there's the thinking and that little bit of Separation helps

308
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:37,960
us to um have a little bit more breathing room so to speak so even if you don't think about

309
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:45,119
uh or don't make a note like planning or remembering or whatever it might be you could even use something like oh

310
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:51,640
thoughts and this is sometimes what I I'm doing I'm just saying like thoughts and then just come back to the bodily

311
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:58,359
experience whatever whatever doesn't matter which bodily experience often it's uh can be like

312
00:39:58,359 --> 00:40:04,520
pressure cuz that's the most obvious so pressure on the bottom of the feet or if we're sitting pressure uh against the

313
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:11,480
buttocks or something or another one um say oh thoughts and then maybe turn to

314
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:18,200
sounds and then uh tune into whatever the sounds are maybe turn into the birds

315
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:24,520
the point is to interrupt the momentum of the thinking I mean more thoughts will arise

316
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:30,160
and that's perfectly fine but there's a way in which we want to just not be lost

317
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:35,400
in them and just following one after the other you know from when we wake up

318
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:40,680
until we go to sleep just being pushed around by them so that's a second way is

319
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:46,800
to thinking about the the

320
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:53,839
um oh my gosh I just uh to use a small little note and then to turn towards

321
00:40:53,839 --> 00:41:02,960
either a bodily experience or a sound here's a third way is that uh thinking

322
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:08,200
is uh we might say there has uh two parts to

323
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:14,240
it one is the content the details of exactly what the thoughts are and the

324
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,760
second is the you won't be surprised to hear me say this the experience of

325
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:28,960
thinking and often we don't think about this but the question could be when you

326
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:34,560
think when you have thoughts are they

327
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:44,400
images is it a voice what are

328
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:51,480
thoughts how do you experience them are they all the same like all are

329
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:58,480
all your thoughts like have the same color if they're images or

330
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:06,000
and so this is another way in which we can shift our relationship to them so we're no longer lost in them but instead

331
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,800
we are a little bit separate and we have this Gap and we can see them oh yeah that was a very interesting little short

332
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:18,319
video there just you know remembering something that happened today or oh my

333
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:24,280
gosh that was a the voice of one of my parents yelling at me here I am decades

334
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:31,559
later still hearing this or you know whatever it might be and so that's another way in which we

335
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:38,160
can like honor and respect our thoughts we're not trying to get rid of them we're not saying they're bad we're just

336
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:46,000
no longer being pushed around by them and again we let the content take

337
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,960
care of itself we're looking at the process the

338
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:58,240
experience so one could be is it an image or is it a voice

339
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:03,920
and sometimes for some people not everybody for some people there's a feeling there can be like a little

340
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:09,680
energetic Buzzy feeling like in the body when there's a lot of thinking there's a

341
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:16,880
way in which uh there can be uh maybe pressure or sometimes in the

342
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:23,359
head maybe that's uh obvious or available and maybe

343
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:30,040
not so in this way we don't have to to let go of or you know get rid of our

344
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:36,319
thoughts and we don't have to say oh this is terrible or anything like

345
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:43,400
this instead we're just creating this space and interrupting the

346
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:50,599
momentum and in that space is where more freedom

347
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:57,520
is for me sometimes it feels like um

348
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:02,559
like maybe having been underwater comfortably swimming swimming swimming

349
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:09,119
and and then come up out of the water like oh wow I can hear better out here

350
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:14,520
it's easier to breathe and it's uh I can see further

351
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:20,720
it's kind of like that when the thoughts start like Abate there's a way in which there can be more

352
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:27,480
clarity and you kind of feel like oh yeah that's right I'm here I'm doing this

353
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:33,319
because there's this way in which um that's you know it's kind of funny to

354
00:44:33,319 --> 00:44:38,559
think about it but if we were all to

355
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:45,559
imagine kangaroos in this room tall

356
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:53,119
ones that you know have the small little arms and they're moving and we can just bring a kangaroo

357
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:58,960
to mind I was just doing that like oh but then I'm actually still

358
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:04,760
here the kangaroos aren't here I'm just here and you say well of course Diana

359
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:10,520
but there's a way in which we tend to think that our thoughts are real but

360
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:17,839
they're not they're just thoughts they have no substance

361
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:26,400
whatsoever and you will have another thought you know just a moment whatever you're thinking now so we give them so

362
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:34,640
much auth Authority and we let them Define ourselves and we let them Define

363
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:40,319
others so much suffering associated with that so much

364
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:48,280
suffering so they're useful we need them but we don't have to be pushed around by

365
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:55,000
them so let's do uh another guided meditation

366
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,040
taking a meditation

367
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:21,400
posture and this time let's begin with just

368
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:28,880
three bigger breaths just as a way to tune into the

369
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,640
experience of breathing and to relax

370
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:06,040
then letting the breath return to normal and just letting the body

371
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:12,319
breathe and again we'll stay here for a little bit

372
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:49,160
maybe we'll just take a moment to acknowledge the Brilliance of the

373
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:55,079
thinking mind a lot of

374
00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:01,800
evolution has come to permit us to think whatever it is we're thinking

375
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:06,319
and thinking mind is

376
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:14,680
amazing but we're going to put it aside and just be with the sensations of

377
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:22,839
breathing for now you can pick up your regular thinking in a moment

378
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:58,720
can you settle into the experience of breathing

379
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:24,920
this feeling in the body the movement in the

380
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:29,720
chest movement in the Bell belly

381
00:50:05,799 --> 00:50:10,839
for now we're letting the thinking recede into the

382
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:16,798
background and the sensations of breathing being in the

383
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:29,680
foreground for

384
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:13,520
can you give yourself over to the sensations of

385
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:29,559
breathing e

386
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:19,799
and now if you find that thinking is taking

387
00:52:19,799 --> 00:52:28,000
prominence can turn towards it with calmness deliberately

388
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,760
see it clearly and maybe make a note thinking

389
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:40,480
or planning or remembering whatever it might

390
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:50,599
be and if it persists see if you can look at the

391
00:52:50,599 --> 00:52:57,760
process of thinking letting the content take care

392
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:05,680
of itself is thinking images or a

393
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:22,960
voice if there are images are they in Vivid color they in sepia black and

394
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,960
white

395
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:45,078
if it's a voice whose voice is

396
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:58,440
it what's the tone of The Voice

397
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:19,960
and then returning to the sensations of breathing

398
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:44,119
if there's a certain pressure with the thinking can gently inquire if there's

399
00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:52,480
an emotion that's fueling that thinking underneath it

400
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:24,880
and if they're thinking has quieted down just can return to the sensations of

401
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:30,240
breathing and relaxed easy

402
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:47,640
way might take a little bit more effort or determination to not get swept away

403
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:50,798
in the think in the

404
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:58,240
thoughts

405
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:29,280
for e

406
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:57,849
[Music]

407
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:15,920
so we've spent a lifetime developing this habit this pattern of

408
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:21,760
thinking and primarily we've been concerned with the content but during that guided

409
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:27,240
meditation I asked you to look at the experience of thinking and

410
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:35,200
to look at it maybe or consider it a different way with thoughts or images

411
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:41,599
or maybe you noticed that I don't know maybe i' love to hear from you all was

412
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:46,799
did you notice it was more thoughts or images or both or was it clear was it

413
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:52,760
not clear or anybody like to share

414
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:05,240
thank you yeah I can I can start sharing about my experience so I see a lot of things

415
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:11,000
so I realized that in my case it's images they're colorful

416
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:18,720
um and and one thing that I realized is that when I acknowledged them it was

417
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:25,079
like okay they're still there but yeah they were like pushing it was like if I was like pushing them a little bit away

418
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:30,240
or they were like just pulling away but in one case there was like this very

419
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:38,680
intense thought even though I was acknowledging it it was like still there it was not not leaving and I'm just

420
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:46,920
curious in those cases what would you recommend me to do so what was your so I I call those

421
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:52,440
like sticky thought thought that are a little bit sticky yeah it would like come back or yeah even though I was like

422
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:59,480
yeah I'm thinking like I see you you're there it wouldn't go way and I tried like coming back to my breath and it was

423
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:06,880
still like hanging out there and so what was your relationship to those sticky

424
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:14,920
thoughts so I was feeling uncomfortable I I wanted it to like go away like I had

425
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:22,000
enough of you thank you uh so yeah that's how I was feeling yeah yeah so of

426
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:30,760
course this isn't uncommon when we start to see like all some of the thoughts that we have we have crazy thoughts sometimes we really do and

427
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:36,520
um so sometimes it's helpful right to notice and they do just go away but

428
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:42,599
often there's thoughts that don't that there's they are persisting and then what we notice is if we are like

429
00:59:42,599 --> 00:59:48,359
acknowledging them and uh being present for them we often have an agenda I'm

430
00:59:48,359 --> 00:59:54,760
being present for you so that you'll go away and this kind of so that you'll go away is a way in which we're getting

431
00:59:54,760 --> 01:00:00,559
tangled up with the thoughts and that's that kind of aversion is fueling having

432
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:07,520
just getting tangled up causes them to persist you like this what you resist persist actually turns out to be true

433
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:15,359
yeah so yeah makes sense so part of it is to um is there a way that we can take

434
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:21,160
some of the authority away from the thoughts it's just a thought or a family

435
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:26,920
of 10 bazillion thoughts that you know and is there a way that we can say okay

436
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:33,280
these are thoughts I'm going to have different thoughts in just a few minutes or you know that's so that then our

437
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:40,200
relationship can shift so that we're no longer um resisting them or aversive towards them and then they will um kind

438
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:45,839
of like start to Peter out but this definitely is not easy and it's not fast

439
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:51,079
or quick right we've spent a lifetime of our thoughts you know running the show

440
01:00:51,079 --> 01:00:56,359
essentially and for us to have a different relationship with them takes a little bit of time but I appreciate your

441
01:00:56,359 --> 01:01:03,798
observation it's great oh thank you maybe way back in that corner

442
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:12,520
there um I really appreciate the suggestion to observe the experience of

443
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:19,280
the thought because um I feel like that's a really quick way

444
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:24,680
to help with my own cyclical thought patterns I've noticed that I have

445
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:31,240
thoughts that I'll continue going back too um so I'm just excited to try this

446
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:39,799
exercise that whenever this I I like whenever a sticky thought pattern comes up to um just really take a good look at

447
01:01:39,799 --> 01:01:44,839
it um because sometimes I feel like I'll

448
01:01:44,839 --> 01:01:50,200
want to do like a deep breathing exercise for example to help me get out of that pattern but that's not always

449
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:56,440
accessible to me but I think again like that seems to be an easier Channel mm and then maybe

450
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:01,760
eventually I can get to like a deeper breathing uh practice um if I can first

451
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:07,039
just observe the experience of the thought so thank you for that um and I

452
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:14,440
also just wanted to say that it was super relatable to hear about um uh what she was saying earlier um

453
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:19,920
this lovely woman in front of me about um just like feeling helpless right now

454
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:26,279
that is one of my sticky thought patterns and uh yeah anyway it's more of a

455
01:02:26,279 --> 01:02:31,720
comment but um it's uh yeah it's

456
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:36,960
validating yeah and I would say feeling helpless is one of the like one of the

457
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:42,279
things that humans dislike the most it's just nobody likes this feeling of

458
01:02:42,279 --> 01:02:48,839
helplessness and so very often we're doing anything just so that we don't have to feel so helpless and then you a

459
01:02:48,839 --> 01:02:54,760
lot of unskillful things happen yeah but just to be able to acknowledge like oh yeah here's that helplessness feeling

460
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:59,920
and I don't like it even just to recognize that can just make a big

461
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:07,960
difference actually in one's life this because what we'll do to not feel helplessness is quite something so thank

462
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:15,279
you I actually do have one more I have a question um because I think I I have like some form of add probably like my

463
01:03:15,279 --> 01:03:23,680
thoughts feel like a fever dream sometimes where it's like an image a word like um and it just kind of flashes

464
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:28,960
and I'll jump from thought to thought so um yeah I would love some advice on just

465
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:35,039
how to like slow down that like uh

466
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:42,440
Montage if you will of Randomness well maybe uh a few things

467
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:49,760
maybe to be curious about the randomness is it really random you know maybe there's you know a a a theme but you

468
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:56,480
just not aware of them and then maybe to have some curiosity about an emotion underneath is is there something there

469
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:04,000
that's connecting all of these maybe that's so that's one thing to think about a second is you said that

470
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:10,760
there's images and uh voices maybe have a little bit of curiosity about oh is

471
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:16,680
there often maybe I'll just say the question what types of thoughts are

472
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:23,880
images and what types are thoughts or voices and so to uh that's just a

473
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:29,079
different way to engage with them and again that also kind of like takes the

474
01:04:29,079 --> 01:04:34,799
authority away from them and so maybe it's also can give you some insight like

475
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:41,680
oh that was an image so what is you know whatever you learn about what images are

476
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:49,520
for you they're not the same for everybody or or uh voices are for you so just maybe bring some more curiosity to

477
01:04:50,039 --> 01:04:56,599
that anybody else have some comments or questions

478
01:04:56,599 --> 01:05:01,680
somebody on this side of the room do does anybody have anything you'd like to

479
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:18,880
say you know I have a question on a different topic but it can wait I I'll be back next week so I don't want to

480
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:24,359
disturb the if the topic is okay so we'll see if there's any more about

481
01:05:24,359 --> 01:05:30,319
thinking and what do you think do you have any thoughts about

482
01:05:30,319 --> 01:05:35,400
thinking you have a comment sure

483
01:05:36,279 --> 01:05:41,760
great yeah I just I just think I was very much like the I felt like I kept on

484
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:49,079
going into these random dreams um that in the first meditation I was stuck in

485
01:05:49,079 --> 01:05:57,880
one so when you gave the the thought about just um returning back to breath and

486
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:04,279
and um I did that and I was able to get out of them this time um but I'm curious

487
01:06:04,279 --> 01:06:09,880
next time to try you know is there a feeling behind it is there you know what

488
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:18,839
is the purpose of this dream I have because they just seems super random yeah um so anyway yeah thank you thank

489
01:06:18,839 --> 01:06:25,279
you it's quite something it's quite something when we

490
01:06:25,279 --> 01:06:31,760
start to really look at what's going on in here right it's quite something that's a a big part of what meditation

491
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:38,720
practice I know certainly for me and I actually I know for a lot of people too we just didn't realize we had just been

492
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:44,640
you know living our lives and not really paying attention of course and then when we start to pay attention it can be

493
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:50,520
surprising what's in there yeah thank you

494
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:03,240
so I have a few like concluding words here unless uh somebody wants to ask

495
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:10,760
something more about um so I'll just

496
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:17,760
um say a little bit about uh mindfulness I talked about how um you know we have

497
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:24,880
this breath body emotions thoughts and often if you were to go to a Meditation Retreat they would also kind of in that

498
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:30,440
order with would uh those would be the instructions uh during The Meditation Retreat in the morning and then then the

499
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:37,480
afternoons would be uh derat talks so if you wanted to take uh really build on

500
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:45,599
your mindfulness practice Meditation Retreat of course is a great way to do that not everybody's life situation um

501
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:52,480
permits them or maybe they don't even want to to go to a residential Retreat for a week or so but I think many of you

502
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:58,640
know we have a residential Retreat Center associated with us we have a sister

503
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:03,760
organization uh down in Santa Cruz beautiful location beautiful down there

504
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:09,119
I just love it down there um but we also have at least once

505
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:16,318
a month uh I think uh here on Saturdays a half a day where it says sit walk sit

506
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:23,480
so U some walking meditation they'll give instructions on walking meditation so that is you know ends up being a

507
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:28,600
couple hours and there's something that's really special that can happen if

508
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:33,758
we give the mind and the body a chance to just kind of just uh get more and

509
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:39,719
more quiet it's different than you know here with the shorter meditations and

510
01:08:39,719 --> 01:08:48,040
yeah something different can happen so we have half days on I think one Saturday month as well as uh day longs

511
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:53,560
so you know like from 9 to four um one Saturday a month and those

512
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:58,920
are also sit walk and they have different themes and there'll be different amount of teachings depending

513
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:06,560
on the teacher you could uh look at the description that's uh on our calendar and at IRC Insight Retreat

514
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:15,199
Center are plac out in Santa Cruz we do have some uh 4-day Retreats but most of them are 7 days and we also have some

515
01:09:15,199 --> 01:09:21,238
online 7-Day Retreats and for a lot of people we have hundreds of people

516
01:09:21,239 --> 01:09:27,238
attending these it turns out to be really uh ful and impactful and very

517
01:09:27,239 --> 01:09:35,719
powerful it gets uh it's can be surprising how you can turn your own home into this Meditation Center it just

518
01:09:35,719 --> 01:09:42,520
uh I think it all of us are surprised by how effective and Powerful this um has been with the pandemic you know we just

519
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:48,880
kind of started that so that's one way to do to support this uh mindfulness

520
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:54,400
practice of course you can come here uh to IMC you're welcome to everything IMC

525
01:10:21,719 --> 01:10:29,159
she teaches there's a little bit more give and take well we've been doing give and take here and uh so it's a nice way

526
01:10:29,159 --> 01:10:35,840
to ask a teacher questions and engage with other people meet to other people and just talk about how your practice is

short little essays you can just open it up wherever and read it um they're on

536
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:37,960

540
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:02,360
the isue at hand are just the the cars the books were there like two weeks ago

542
01:12:08,679 --> 01:12:15,080

543
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:24,600
cabinets and uh see uh if they're there but yeah it might might just be the QR cards right now we do uh order um like a
