1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,679
good morning

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:19,520
as we explore punjab price you know wisdom you know

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:27,119
we let awareness illuminate

4
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:34,079
and it reveals everything from the workings of mind and heart

5
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:41,200
to the subtle perceptions through which we construct reality

6
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:50,399
and each time we sit we start over

7
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:01,680
there's an initiation and as i was saying yesterday we can

8
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,159
initiate in a deliberate way

9
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:14,240
we hold the notion that this is engaging with unbiased

10
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:22,320
attention and then that unbiased detention

11
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,600
reveals all the influences all the biases

12
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,840
that arise all these assumptions

13
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:41,520
and there's a delicate art between attending to experience

14
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,759
and not trying to manufacture experience

15
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,560
and maybe let's start with a demonstration of that so i'm going to

16
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:04,240
ring the bell and just listen to the sound

17
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:13,760
and then can you continue to listen as the sound of the bell diminishes

18
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:20,640
and hearing engages whatever else is happening

19
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,840
in the realm of sound

20
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,229
[Music] [Applause]

21
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:59,240
so [Music]

22
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,920
the quality of noticing the quality of a consciousness of

23
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,799
noticing of experiencing

24
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:46,480
each time we start to sit to rediscover that quality of attention

25
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:54,400
starting in a global way without any agenda

26
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:01,840
what's happening now

27
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:20,959
experiencing what's happening rather than manufacturing what's

28
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:34,000
happening and yet bringing attention to god

29
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,840
[Music] attending

30
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,880
and receiving

31
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,680
and then with that delicate attending and receiving experience to

32
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:11,840
attend to the sensations in the body

33
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:20,960
attending to the the qualities

34
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,840
of body that support awakening

35
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:38,720
kind of uprightness

36
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:53,840
in in the body that you are how does uprightness express itself

37
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:09,360
the spine rising connection to the cushion or seat

38
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:17,039
rising the whole way up through the hips the spine

39
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:23,280
lifting up supporting the chest

40
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:34,400
allowing the shoulders to widen and open across the front and across the back

41
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:49,680
coming up through the neck

42
00:06:49,680 --> 00:07:03,840
an enlivening quality of uprightness

43
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:17,840
and in complement to that uprightness letting the body settle

44
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,840
any place where there's tension are holding it up

45
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,840
letting it soften

46
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:45,840
letting the eyes and the muscles of the face soften

47
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:57,359
[Music]

48
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:05,360
maybe noticing any subtle ways the face

49
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:13,840
is holding and letting it soften

50
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:27,840
letting the chest soften and the shoulders

51
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,669
and letting the abdomen soften

52
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:45,359
[Music]

53
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,839
and letting the arms and the hands soften

54
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:12,560
as if to assure the body

55
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,519
that in this attentiveness it will be taken care of

56
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:26,720
this is an engagement that will support

57
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:37,839
the life of being the body of being

58
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:46,080
and with the quality of attention and deliberateness

59
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:57,920
we're not in a hurry to get anywhere each detail is given the time it needs

60
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,880
when we do that it's always a reassuring quality to it

61
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:22,480
and then bringing attention to the breath with that reassurance

62
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,079
exhale in a way that might help you to open and

63
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:42,560
enliven the breath to extend the exhale

64
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:52,959
but can you extend the exhale without tightening the chest or the abdomen

65
00:10:52,959 --> 00:11:01,839
or the face

66
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:09,600
and at the end of the exhale can you just pause for one or two or three seconds

67
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,040
and then allow the inhale

68
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:21,120
and quite deliberately study the influences

69
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,720
of breathing in that way

70
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,200
how does it feel in the body

71
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:43,839
can it invite a subtler kind of release

72
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:56,720
after breathing out and pausing for a few seconds

73
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,560
can you feel the body's impulse to inhale

74
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:10,880
how the inhale has a quality of allowing what is

75
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:25,839
to come forth

76
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:32,720
the exhale can have a quality of releasing

77
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:40,079
letting something that's being held go

78
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,880
in the inhale equality of

79
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,639
receiving opening

80
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:06,560
and just for a few breaths almost in a leisurely fashion in a

81
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:12,560
deliberate fashion extend the exhale

82
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:21,839
pause and allow the inhale

83
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:32,800
attending in a way that's discovering the subtle teachings of the yoga

84
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,839
of breath

85
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:25,360
a deliberate extension of the exhale the pause that

86
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:31,839
quality of allowing receiving the inhale

87
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:07,600
and then deliberately attentively shifting

88
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:19,279
and resuming a natural rhythm of breath for your body but as you do that

89
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:26,560
attending just as carefully just as detailed

90
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:34,320
just as deliberate as you were when the breath was being related to in a

91
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:55,839
extending and opening way now how is the breath being experienced

92
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:17,680
each time we set an invitation to discover

93
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:25,519
the subtler details of the yoga of body and breath

94
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,120
how it can be both enlivening

95
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:47,680
and in a way soothing or reassuring or tapping into something

96
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,839
very fundamental

97
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:59,279
[Music] yes the mind and the heart [Music]

98
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:05,839
a lot of passion

99
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,600
but this being body and being breath

100
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:21,760
adds a marvelous quality of attention in the midst of the passion of mind and

101
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,840
body

102
00:17:51,760 --> 00:18:01,840
in the deliberateness of attending to body and breath

103
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,880
inviting kind of a dwelling

104
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:15,840
dwelling here in simply being

105
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:33,039
and just as listening to the bell the sound of the bell opens

106
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:39,039
not just to the side of the bell but to all songs

107
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:49,200
dwelling in the body breath opening to experiencing it

108
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:57,840
opens to dwelling in all the workings of being

109
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:12,559
it's not a corruption of attention it's the expression of being alive

110
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:25,840
this delicate play between the simplicity of being

111
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:39,840
and the complexity that it dwells within

112
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:08,240
with the support of body breath opening

113
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:21,840
noticing acknowledging all that arises

114
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:31,120
exploring what is it to bring an unbiased simple attention

115
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,840
to what arises

116
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:54,320
noticing the quality of permission

117
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:03,840
to just let it be

118
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,840
so

119
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:09,679
and as the thoughts happen is it possible

120
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,360
to dwell in unbiased attention

121
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,960
or do they conjure up

122
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,280
an intrigue

123
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,120
that dictates what happens

124
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:45,679
so beard that's part of being

125
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:55,840
notice and acknowledge

126
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:12,080
okay can they're in the midst of noticing and

127
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:17,919
acknowledging can there be an opening to that too

128
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:26,880
just as the sound of the bowel opened to all sides

129
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:37,440
still just sounds

130
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:46,080
even though they're labeled signed of a passing car signed of a bird

131
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,840
signed up something in the room

132
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:04,320
the thoughts are inclined to conjure up a version of

133
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:19,840
reality notice acknowledge

134
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:47,840
let it interplay with unbiased attention

135
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:25,759
and if unbiased attention disappears

136
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:34,799
so be it just deliberately leisurely

137
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,519
start over

138
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:57,840
this is the nature of consciousness

139
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,840
oh

140
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:49,840
and when there's a noticing that the mind has conjured up a reality

141
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:55,760
soak it up experience it

142
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:07,919
what's its dominant quality is it an image is it a feeling

143
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:17,840
is it the urgency of its creation

144
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:31,840
invited into awareness

145
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,278
in a moment i'll ring the bell

146
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:55,840
this time three times

147
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:01,919
let the sound wash over your being

148
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:23,840
and listen as the sound becomes all sounds that are present

149
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:41,349
[Music]

150
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:52,219
[Music]

151
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:52,799
sometimes it seems so simple

152
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:01,840
just noticing and not grasping

153
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:12,000
and having a feeling of liberation no just in that moment

154
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:20,399
wow that experience

155
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,279
illustrating and instructing us

156
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,720
on the wisdom of liberation

157
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:40,840
the compassion of liberation and how both are

158
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:56,320
intertwined with how consciousness is being attended to

159
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:01,440
the great gift of having a meditation practice

160
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:08,080
is that each meditation session will invite us

161
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:13,440
to rediscover to dwell

162
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:25,840
in that practice of unbiased awareness and to see what comes forth

163
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:39,840
it creates a version of reality

164
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,240
and it creates a version of reality

165
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:55,039
that's initiated by or conditioned version of reality

166
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:04,840
maybe if we wanted to be smart we could say it's an unconditioned

167
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:12,079
response to a conditioned experience

168
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:23,040
but usually in the process of practice

169
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:28,560
it's more helpful to be naive

170
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:37,760
and then there's a saying that says not knowing

171
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:49,679
creates the intimate experience the intimacy

172
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:56,878
and yet for us simply not knowing

173
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:06,078
can leave us with like some way of connecting of acknowledging

174
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:13,119
of allowing it to be to register

175
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:34,000
once when i was a monk i went to visit another monk and in his

176
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:45,838
little hut his kuti as it's called in thailand he had on the wall a picture of a baby

177
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:53,280
and i i was a little surprised in that setting to see a picture of a

178
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,320
baby and he said to me i want

179
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:05,760
that mind that's that's the mind that i aspire to i don't think he said i

180
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:13,838
want i think more aspirational

181
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:21,760
we come into this world with the capacity to pay attention

182
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:29,359
and one of the enchanting things to my mind and heart about babies is

183
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:38,480
they engage it completely each experience they give themselves to

184
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,838
it completely

185
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:56,640
but we all grow up we all create

186
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:01,920
a much more complex version of reality

187
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,839
and noticing and acknowledging

188
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:17,520
the the ingenuity of it is

189
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:25,280
that it can shift the noticing and acknowledging can shift dependent upon the state of

190
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,880
consciousness the circumstances the stimulation

191
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:41,440
like when we ask what's happening now it's like what's the dominant experience now

192
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:50,480
is it is it a quality of mind that's turbulent or quality of mind

193
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,760
that's deeply settled

194
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:02,880
is it a version of reality that has great authority

195
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,319
within our being

196
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:19,839
we said can we invite any and every experience that happens for us

197
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:32,720
into a state of awareness that sees it for what it is

198
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:38,480
in some ways we could say the process

199
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:47,839
is panya this is prajna the very process

200
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:54,799
of unbiased seeing of the biases of being

201
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:03,839
unconditioned response to conditioned being every process is wisdom

202
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:11,280
and then we could say what's illuminated by the process

203
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:19,839
all the particular details and ways that consciousness takes shape

204
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:31,839
and then the way me the the unique expression

205
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:43,839
of those biases that arise in our individual being

206
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:56,000
and the inquiry of how to learn how to work with

207
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:05,040
our own being in a way that will enable that unbiased attention

208
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:18,400
and out of that the many practices that arise

209
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:28,240
the practice of compassion the practice of patience practice of

210
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:36,640
accepting what is the disciplines of

211
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:52,800
not corrupting or undermining the capacity for awareness

212
00:40:52,800 --> 00:41:01,519
my experience of zen practices that staying close to this

213
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:07,760
unbiased attention to the biases of being

214
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,800
staying close to that exploring that

215
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:22,400
is an important aspect of our practice it's like listening to the bell ring

216
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:34,880
and as we listen to it the sound of the bell opens to all sounds

217
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:45,039
so we attend to with precision to the experience of unbiased awareness

218
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:52,480
and as we do it it opens up to everything

219
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,119
all the ways we be

220
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:09,440
and often in our dedication the complexity of being

221
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:16,560
is deemed to be inappropriate

222
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:21,280
it shouldn't be like this it should be a different way

223
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:36,319
but what if we think of this moment as a momentary culmination

224
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:43,680
of not just our life but of our parents lives too and their parents and their

225
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,279
parents and their parents

226
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:56,640
what if we think this is not just opening to the experience of me

227
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:05,599
this is opening to the experience of this vast web of being

228
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:26,480
and here we are dipping our finger in the ocean of being

229
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:34,319
with this momentary awareness and in doing so

230
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,838
appreciating the uniqueness of the moment

231
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:50,400
and in an utterly mysterious way connecting to well-being

232
00:43:55,839 --> 00:44:03,680
how do we do that is there still a singular self

233
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:09,838
in that experience

234
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:26,160
so this dance between acknowledging okay in this moment

235
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:34,160
this thought is present and it describes it implicates it has

236
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:42,400
inferred within it a version of reality me

237
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,359
my life this place this time

238
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:55,440
and yet it touches all being

239
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,960
so in the language of zen we say

240
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:15,599
this is the great mysterious inquiry in the being this is the coin

241
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:19,839
of being alive

242
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:32,640
like it dislike it love it hate it

243
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:41,119
be grateful for it despise it you know feel deeply connected

244
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:47,838
feel isolated yeah

245
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:54,480
can we sit down in the middle of that

246
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:04,000
and then can we stand up and open to all of it

247
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:20,480
the deliberateness of practice can steady our heart and our mind

248
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:30,240
and not just support us to enter into all of it but also

249
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:39,119
invite a kind of joy in doing so

250
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:49,359
now what to please enjoy yourselves

251
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:56,318
thank you
