1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,519
so hello everyone and welcome to our meditation

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,840
and

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,119
there's an important distinction that we do in mindfulness

4
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:29,119
practice and that is the distinction between

5
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:35,120
the experience we're having and the subjective way in which we know

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:43,600
that experience so the what is known and the knowing

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:50,160
it's probably fair to say that much of the time people are involved

8
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,280
in what they're experiencing and this could include what they're thinking

9
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,680
uh or what we're feeling the emotions we're feeling or the or the um

10
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:10,000
the thoughts we have and any anything any experience any thought any

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,759
that can be the object of attention is what i'm calling the experience

12
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:21,520
and then there's the attention that knows it the awareness that knows it

13
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,560
and and in mindfulness practice that attention that awareness that

14
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:33,520
mindfulness over time becomes stronger at first if you hear a

15
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:41,759
irritating noise outside and before practice you might just be irritated and ready to write a letter to

16
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,040
the mayor of the town that there's something needs to be fixed the noise is so irritating

17
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,159
and and then over time you learn that you can be mindful of it

18
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:58,320
and mindful of the irritation and let go of the irritation mindfulness reactivity let go of the reactivity

19
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:05,840
and over time you learn that you can just be mindful of it there's no reaction just aware of it mindful of it

20
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:14,239
and then you then you might over time notice that your mindfulness your becomes more acute more sensitive more

21
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:20,080
uh able to kind of really stay present in a strong way for the sound

22
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,239
and then as that mindfulness gets stronger then um the mindfulness itself

23
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:33,280
becomes something that's valued the awareness itself becomes valued and recognized oh this is

24
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:40,560
valuable this is important and in fact the awareness of the sound it's still maybe still in

25
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,599
you know an unpleasant sound but that that recedes in importance

26
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,519
you're not denying that it's unpleasant but what seems more important is the fact that you're

27
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,120
aware awareness becomes like a jewel the capacity to be

28
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:04,239
attentive the capacity for being mindful uh becomes like a jewel like a precious

29
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,599
thing it becomes it's almost like a its own experience so

30
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:16,840
rather than awareness only being aware of other experiences awareness itself becomes the

31
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,000
experience and uh and it just feels so that there can be a rightness to that or

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,519
a goodness to that or a joy to that freedom to that in the knowing itself in

33
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:35,519
being aware and over time that awareness begins um

34
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:42,159
free becoming freer of of self of my ideas of being the agent

35
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:47,519
the one who's doing the one who's the victim the one who's the the engager and

36
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,560
it's just like awareness itself kind of it doesn't need so much baggage around

37
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,560
me myself and mine it becomes this kind of kind of thing that is just so

38
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,879
like i kept saying a jewel so there's a whole there's a whole

39
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:10,959
journey that can go in mindfulness practice in our relationship to how mindfulness is

40
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,560
experienced or operates within us at some point

41
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,680
as doesn't somewhere along that line along that journey

42
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:29,040
mindfulness awareness just becomes such a welcome thing to do to be mindful

43
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,080
that there's a wonderful little one word that can be used

44
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,600
that um sometimes can really kind of spark a little delight or joy or

45
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,600
or welcoming or receptivity or really kind of put us in the

46
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,880
present moment in a you know kind of a

47
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,560
wonderful way and that is to say the word yes

48
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,000
whatever you're mindful of say yes

49
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,560
and it isn't that you're saying yes to the experience so much some experiences might be nice

50
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,560
it isn't like you're condoning valuing approving of what the experience is

51
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,759
but rather you're saying yes to that receptivity that welcome quality of

52
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:25,520
awareness that's there to meet that that holds that's aware of it yes

53
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,720
it's this is good to be aware of it yes i can be aware of this

54
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:37,199
yes let me hold this in awareness and this wonderful

55
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,479
little word yes can kind of be a

56
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:49,039
a cleansing agent to cleanse us of our reactivity or

57
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,560
or all the extra baggage we carry along in our relationship to what we're being

58
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,639
mindful of and maybe we'll put you into a place that's more

59
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,639
simplicity and clarity and without being entangled or reactive to

60
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:12,479
what's there just yes to being aware of this so if that's nice for you you could try

61
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:18,000
this today and if it doesn't make sense or it doesn't uh work for you please by all

62
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,360
means don't do it so sitting upright

63
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,360
or sitting in a way that's meditating in a way in a posture that works for you

64
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:36,240
and relaxing your eyes

65
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,080
for some of you it might mean closing your eyes some of you might mean half closing the

66
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:49,840
eyelids and gazing down at a 45 degree angle

67
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,639
and taking maybe three long deep breaths

68
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:26,160
and then letting your breath return to normal and then take three

69
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,000
normal breaths but do it so consciously giving yourself over to those three

70
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
breaths

71
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,960
then on the next exhale relax as much as your body as you can

72
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,439
and the next two breaths do the same

73
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,800
and then settling in to the body's experience of breathing

74
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:34,959
and as you get more settled in here you might say to yourself softly gently

75
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,959
yes to whatever experience

76
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:47,920
arises for you it could be a gentle soft yes

77
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:57,760
to being aware of the in-breath or a yes to being aware of the exhale

78
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,800
rather than resisting anything

79
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:16,240
whatever you become aware of mindful of maybe the mental note can be yes

80
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:23,519
yes to being mindful of it

81
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,279
to receiving it an awareness

82
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:37,320
to your ability your capacity to hold it in awareness

83
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,279
ready

84
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,920
you

85
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:30,480
if you're drifting off in thought keeping up a regular pace of saying yes

86
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:37,040
might cut through your thinking might return you

87
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:44,279
to being aware but do so without

88
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:50,959
self-criticism or disappointment just

89
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:57,720
a wonderful yes to being aware again

90
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,920
you

91
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,280
three

92
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,559
perhaps a yes it also

93
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:09,520
is a reminder to calm the thinking mind

94
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:18,080
yes it's good to bring the thinking mind to rest

95
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:26,360
to a kind of silence that allows for greater awareness

96
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,919
you

97
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,919
you

98
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,919
you

99
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,919
you

100
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,919
you

101
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,320
okay

102
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,799
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

103
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,320
whether you use the word yes or not

104
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:34,320
it's good to be to affirm awareness

105
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:40,159
affirm any moment of mindfulness you have

106
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,440
not actively thinking affirmations

107
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,559
but a deep inner appreciation valuing

108
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:57,760
of being aware and with time that affirmation that

109
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:03,840
appreciation allows awareness to grow

110
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:10,480
which is synonymous with the growth in our capacity

111
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:16,960
to be aware our capacity to hold in awareness

112
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:23,278
any difficulty at all any joy at all

113
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,679
and this and this is one of the keys to freedom

114
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:38,880
is to make lots of room in awareness so awareness has capacity to hold

115
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:46,720
within it the joys and challenges joys and sorrows

116
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,840
of life

117
00:27:53,679 --> 00:28:01,000
to say yes to awareness for each thing that we're aware of

118
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:13,360
helps us to become less and less entangled with what we're aware of

119
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,720
reactive to it afraid or

120
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:24,880
desirous or have expectations or

121
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,880
projections predictions yes

122
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,279
just yes to the simple being aware

123
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:39,200
and then

124
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,120
in the center of that awareness

125
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:55,559
there can be love there can be generosity

126
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,720
there can be care for what we're aware of

127
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:11,600
to relax with into awareness and then allow our care for the world to

128
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:17,600
come forth not as an obligation

129
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:23,520
but in a way that is personal for each of us

130
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:31,360
in our own way to be open in awareness

131
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:39,320
so the joys and sorrows of the world resonate with our good heart

132
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,480
and so that we might be motivated

133
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:54,278
to speak and to act and to think

134
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:59,759
in ways that benefit this world

135
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:08,720
may it be that the practice that we do individually and all of us collectively

136
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:14,000
may it be for the welfare and happiness of all beings

137
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:23,000
may all beings be happy may all beings be free

138
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:31,440
may all beings everywhere have the safety

139
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:37,840
that allows them to discover the goodness of their own hearts

140
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,240
so for this third talk on faith

141
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:11,120
i'd like to attempt to talk about the quality of faith that is akin

142
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:17,840
to love or related to something we might call love or

143
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:24,640
that when we have faith in

144
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:31,360
dharma faith it's because something inside of us

145
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:37,360
resonates with the dharma something inside of us

146
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,559
we recognize something inside of us that is

147
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:47,679
maybe akin or represents the buddha dharma and the

148
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:53,679
sangha the key objects of faith in buddhism

149
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:01,039
there is an intimacy that we develop with ourselves and or an intimacy we develop with the

150
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:09,440
world with the sensitive um tender awareness that we might have

151
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:15,519
and that intimacy can come with a feeling of warmth of

152
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:22,279
joy of deep sense of satisfaction

153
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,720
excuse me excuse me and um

154
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:40,240
and so to um [Music]

155
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:46,399
and it's that it's a love or a joy or a kind of a desire even

156
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:53,600
that's a since ancient times misunderstood that faith is a kind of desire it's a desire to be close to

157
00:33:53,600 --> 00:34:00,399
something it's desire to uh live in close to something that's we

158
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:07,760
have faith in something that we find valuable and if the dharma is found or this intimacy

159
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:13,599
with the dharma is found through meditation then um

160
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:22,638
there's something about the desire to stay close to that the tenderness the intimacy the

161
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:29,040
warmth the joy the the sense of uh well-being

162
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:36,000
that seems to be somehow related to this it's um the faith is more than just a

163
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,320
knowing it's a knowing through experience we know something

164
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,358
because we experience it and um

165
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:52,480
and so uh to love

166
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:58,480
the practice to love in a sense

167
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:04,720
uh the dharma another one way that this expresses

168
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:11,839
itself that faith sometimes takes the form of devotion devotional practices

169
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:18,800
a certain kind of heartfelt um you know a motive

170
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:24,240
wanting to serve wanting to be close to wanting to

171
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:31,119
offer ourselves in some kind of way to the dharma or to the practice

172
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:37,280
in our vipassana inside tradition there's you know very little chanting and very little ritual

173
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:44,560
and people have asked sometimes where's the devotion in this practice and a common answer that

174
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:51,520
as it's given is that mindfulness itself is devotional activity

175
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:56,960
and of course it isn't automatically but as we develop this practice we start

176
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:04,560
feeling that that there's something really religiously or spiritually or sacredly

177
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:11,280
vital or enhanced through mindfulness that mindfulness awareness itself

178
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:18,480
is something to be devoted to something to be um to love to serve

179
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:25,119
to uh to and it's to to dedicate ourselves to with love or

180
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:32,480
care or generosity and and so faith has so many different

181
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:38,480
qualities so many different aspects and and but for some people

182
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:44,000
or some people sometimes there is a quality that's akin to what

183
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:51,599
i'd like to call love today and i think we all know that the word love is very vague and covers a wide range spectrum

184
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:56,880
of what of emotions or feelings and so maybe it's more like a koan more

185
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:02,160
like a question that i'm offering you that if um faith

186
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:07,599
has a quality of love in it or characteristic of love and love is a very and it's very

187
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:13,040
personal how this is is experienced what corresponds in you

188
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:19,119
to what i'm calling love for this warmth um this intimacy this uh

189
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:25,920
this the kind of uh place where we can feel like yes this is home or this is desirable this is

190
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:33,359
satisfying this is something that feels like the the warm warmest and tenderness and

191
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:39,599
forms of dedication love wanting to serve wanting to be generous one to care for

192
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:44,880
maybe it's kind of a caring kind of love you want to care for this thing

193
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,920
so some what what how does it what what do you have in yourself where do you find yourself that might correspond to

194
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:57,200
this to this you might use very different words but maybe if i'm using very broad terms

195
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:05,200
what specifically works for you or if i'm just giving you kind of a rough idea maybe you have something that's

196
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:12,160
somewhat corresponds and you have other words for it and so um

197
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:17,359
and so uh it's a kind of love or faith or dedication devotion

198
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:23,520
where the pull or the desire to practice to live the dharma to live with the

199
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:30,400
precepts and ethically just seems like a love affair seems like more of an expression of something that

200
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:36,960
feels really good and right a rightness to it and

201
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:42,079
and that seems to be embodied or seems to be heartfelt

202
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:48,240
it's not so much a cognitive belief or thought or idea that this is good

203
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:53,760
and it's something that comes from feeling at home in oneself or settled here in the heart

204
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,280
and then the goodness of the heart begins to shine and move forth

205
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:06,480
and for some buddhists this expression of um of what i'm calling today love

206
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:14,400
in relationship to faith is most actively expressed in uh the refuges in what's called going

207
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:20,800
for refuge and um and i love this expression the pali word is to walk to refuge but it

208
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,880
can mean going as well and say me like in english but going for refuge is kind of like a

209
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:33,040
entering into being willing out of one's own free will in a sense

210
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:40,240
to go somewhere to go in a direction and this is the direction to go it go in that which is most

211
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:46,480
meaningful most warm-hearted most uh something that we just feel so

212
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,760
um delighted by or pleased by or

213
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:57,440
inspired by so what i'm pointing to here is that uh

214
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:03,520
faith sometimes has a very strong very strong heartfelt qualities to it

215
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:10,720
and um and it's can be an aspect of the heart

216
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:16,800
and so what does it re what does it take to be close to this to allow for this to happen

217
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,839
and i think that one of the accesses to it is um

218
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:28,240
through um being settled enough having

219
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:36,160
quiet enough not not just less and less distracted less caught up in desires and aversions

220
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:42,240
and really settle down and so that the uh we're really intimate and present

221
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,760
with our direct experience so that maybe this word yes that we use for the

222
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:53,680
meditation is an expression of that love yes

223
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:59,920
to be here an awareness to be here practicing the dharma to be here

224
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:05,760
in this ethical goodness that we feel not that we have not that we

225
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:12,720
impose external ethics moral rules on top of us but we recognize the ethics that comes

226
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:21,599
from a settled clear peaceful heart and yes this is right this is good

227
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:28,880
this is what i love this is where i want to center my life base my life on

228
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:35,440
this this is a a source from which

229
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:42,319
to live my life and what it would be like for you to live your life

230
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:48,400
with a source for that life is love dharma love

231
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:54,319
not erotic love this not not even love for friends

232
00:41:54,319 --> 00:42:01,280
but some kind of deeper existential love some way in which we're not

233
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:07,599
afraid we're not troubled we're not uh

234
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:13,760
anguished by anything but our but all those things that cause anguish

235
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:20,640
and trouble are held in a wonderful capac growing capacity of

236
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:27,200
the heart to hold everything and there's expression in our sin

237
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:32,880
in our inside tradition that ended up a title that sharon salzberg's book

238
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,640
called having a heart as wide as the world

239
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:46,400
so maybe that is one of the purposes of this deep heartfelt faith

240
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,760
is to have a heart that can hold all things those wide as the world

241
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:57,359
and then to care for the world as a as a um

242
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:03,359
to care for the world we live in as a natural expression of that

243
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:09,040
so um thank you

244
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:15,680
and um and uh we'll continue two more talks on

245
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:21,200

246
