1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:11,519
so uh with that reminder for me uh there is a famous story in Buddhism

2
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:19,279
of the Buddha supposedly when he was about six or seven um it was a springtime it was

3
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:28,160
apparently a nice spring day and uh his uh father was uh leading the

4
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,360
ritual first plowing of the season so they were out in the field plowing this

5
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,879
it was kind of a a little bit of a festival maybe like we'll do next week and uh and then um but because everyone

6
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:49,440
was involved in the plowing they they left this little boy alone and he felt safe secure comfortable being there and

7
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:56,320
um and he was under they say a rose apple tree i love it that they remember the tree that he was sitting under so in

8
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,320
the shade watching the the all this happen in front of him and maybe he got

9
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,960
a little bit absorbed in what was happening he felt content and happy it was engaging for his eyes maybe and he

10
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:17,520
was following it and in the process of that he got concentrated and um and entered into a

11
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,720
relatively light samadei but still was a it was an inner

12
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:30,119
state of well-being of unification of being settled and peaceful and uh and that was nice for

13
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:37,920
him until he was about 36 six and uh and then by that time he had

14
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,759
spent years uh practicing as an aesthetic about six seven years trying

15
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,880
to find a way to liberation in the systems of India at the time and none of

16
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:56,399
it worked for him and uh and so one day he was sitting meditating and u probably

17
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,719
because he's the tail end of his aesthetic period he was probably looked pretty emaciated he was kind of extreme

18
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,920
extreme aesthetic of sorts but he was sitting meditating and um he remembered

19
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,800
that experience from about 30 years before and uh and he recognized that

20
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,440
that experience was onward leading that experience was was uh had tastes or

21
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:28,879
flavors of the liberation he was looking for that this that it was pointing to the possibility onward to liberation in

22
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,160
a way that u none of his previous practices he did and none of the uh

23
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,599
somehow showed that to him and uh he got I don't know if he got excited but he

24
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:46,720
got inspired that uh this was uh the way to liberation and that uh this kind of

25
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,319
deep state samadei settled quiet peaceful was not

26
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:58,879
to be feared not you not to be afraid of that this this way of being so when he was 36 he

27
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:04,959
remembered this experience and that was uh kind of his entryway to uh that

28
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:11,840
experience kind of remembering that maybe he felt some of it um by memory and so then he started his path and he

29
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,440
got in got into that state again and then from there built his samadei until

30
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,599
he got strong enough samadei that he was in a good state for his awakening

31
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:31,200
so a childhood experience of well-being of being settled peaceful at home comfortable uh probably not something

32
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:38,080
you strong enough that some of you if you had something like that as a kid occurred to you to tell anyone uh it's

33
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:44,040
just some of you maybe had something like that as a kid and the garden I had under the kitchen

34
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,519
table and uh I put a white sheet over it and made myself a little tent and the

35
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:56,959
beautiful sunlight would come in there i was so safe in the kitchen i think my mom was cooking so nice wonderful sounds

36
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,080
around me that helped me feel kind of cozy and uh and I remember feeling so

37
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:09,439
peaceful so at ease and it was it was a feeling of probably purity or very clean state

38
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:16,799
just underneath the white sheet the white light coming in and me just being so cozy and contented there

39
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:22,040
and um so uh it was an experience that he

40
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:29,040
had once he was enlightened the Buddha started teaching and uh and they say the way

41
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,960
it's classically taught in Buddhism he taught the dharma and the dharma is the

42
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,800
closest thing closest word probably to that corresponds to the English words

43
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,919
religion or spirituality so those are western terms that are

44
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,960
relatively complicated for some of us and some of us avoid one more than the

45
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:57,360
other or some of us are happy to use it and not use it you know it's it's a complicated words the whole word but but

46
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:04,680
the the c the the comparable word in uh in India was dharma

47
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:11,320
dharma and in this and the dharma has many meanings but has two primary

48
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:17,039
meanings it means means the teachings of the Buddha and it means the experience

49
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:23,759
that he's pointing to like the experience he had as a six-year-old per something very personal

50
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:30,400
uh personal process a personal experience something to be experienced for yourself and both those terms for

51
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:37,440
dharma are encapsulated in um a very famous it's part of the liturgy this is chanted by

52
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:46,720
monastics every day where they chant the qualities the characteristics of what the dharma is and begins by saying uh uh

53
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,039
the dharma well taught well spoken by the

54
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:57,440
Buddha is and so uh and then they then they

55
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:07,360
describe it's the dharma the qualities characteristics of this thing called dharma and uh and u so in one way he's

56
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,880
saying the teachings taught by the Buddha is this way but as you hear these

57
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,720
five characteristics it's not just his teachings it's the the the dharma the

58
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,960
inner process the inner connection that we are to have in doing this practice uh

59
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,960
this is what this inner connection is the inner dharma this experience this feeling we're supposed to have so you

60
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:38,319
have you see this play goes back and forth these two meanings and what that represents for me is that uh uh to

61
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:44,479
whatever degree Buddhism is a religion it's a religion that is based on our own

62
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:53,360
personal experience and um so that so those five characteristics are uh the dharma is uh

63
00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:00,880
to uh is uh here and now it's it's here in the present moment the literal

64
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,199
language of it is um uh it's visible here and

65
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:13,240
now so visible you know something you can experience sense and feel for yourself that it's

66
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:19,440
immediate it's not something you wait for in the future you'll get the rewards in a sense there's something about the

67
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:26,160
immediiacy that we can experience here and now it's like now what there's really about is not it's almost like

68
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:36,440
what it's really about is not about time and then it is um uh it is um onward

69
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:41,520
leading meaning that there's something about it that uh that kind of opens a

70
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,919
door or puts you on a trail puts you on a on a road that's onward leading or puts you on a slide there's something

71
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:54,919
there there's a feeling there's something's opening for you there here come this go forward

72
00:07:54,919 --> 00:08:02,199
here and then um it is uh and then now they're using a very

73
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:09,240
colloquial expression for the next characteristic um that literally says

74
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:16,479
hey come and see come and see for yourself um usually people don't they

75
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:24,560
translate a little bit more sophisticatedly they say uh inviting inspection the dharma invites inspection

76
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:31,440
so this onwarding this dharma come and look for yourself there's something about the nature of this experience that

77
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,800
is kind of requesting or inviting you and if

78
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:43,599
this dharma is to be found in yourself then you can imagine it's the heart's request it's the heart's inspiration

79
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:50,240
it's the heart's longing or desire that uh is inviting you come here

80
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,959
deeper deeper into what whatever it is last characteristic of the dharma is

81
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:04,320
that it's to be experienced by the wise and this is a very nice way of speaking about

82
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:11,519
you to be experienced by the wise and um and no it's actually it's more more

83
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:17,839
detailed than that it's to be experiience erenced personally to be personally experienced by the wise so

84
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:24,240
there's very individuals like this is something you can experience um and some things in life

85
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,160
you can only really experience for yourself you can't ask someone else to do it for you and uh and there's

86
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:36,120
something about the movement towards spiritual freedom inner freedom freedom of the heart you can't ask someone else

87
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:41,839
to free their heart so you don't have to you know that doesn't you know I guess

88
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:47,560
it'd be nice for them but it doesn't really do something for you if you you

89
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:55,120
know you know contract it out to someone else to do it for you you know the meditation is really great and uh and

90
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:02,519
I'm going to get take my all my money and I'm going to get it's so great i'm going to pay 10 people to meditate for

91
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:08,080
me so I don't have to you know it's ridiculous you know

92
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:14,920
there's no point meditation is something you're supposed to be experienced for yourself so the same thing with

93
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:20,160
liberation so this personal experience and so as a seven-year-old six-year-old

94
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,680
he experienced something that inspired him when he was older and uh and the in

95
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:32,800
the what's called the word for inspiration in the ancient language means um literally means something like

96
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:39,600
to have a feeling for the purpose or the meaning or the goal that the word is ata

97
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,200
in Pali and some of you know Sanskrit it's ara so it has multiple meanings but

98
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:53,279
um uh ata vda uh which I mean to have a feeling and this vda can be inspired be

99
00:10:53,279 --> 00:11:01,399
aroused but more often it means like a feeling and then uh or a knowing a deep

100
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:08,040
knowing and um and then to be um uh have this

101
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:14,959
dharma inspired in the dharma this dharma feeling this dharma move movement

102
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:23,160
inside the heart and so this kind of inner feeling that we can have and the reason I'm giving this talk

103
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:30,399
today is because yesterday uh we sat under the Buddha tree here

104
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:36,720
uh meaning we we had a dayong retreat here and uh it was really nice to sit

105
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,399
here there were about 45 people meditating and I mean really ever since the pandemic people coming to these

106
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,600
dalongs they seem to sit so well you know they're quiet and intent and

107
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,640
they're very sincere and dedicated and and during this dayong I

108
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:58,240
saw I don't know 16 people for 15inute meetings to talk about their practice

109
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,959
and there was something about every single one of them they had a wide range of things they wanted to talk about but

110
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:10,320
every one of them came with a certain kind of sincerity where they were coming to talk

111
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:17,360
about something that was important and something about them had gathered together in some kind of like they were

112
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,920
connected to something inside some kind of in this is important I'm here to to

113
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,959
share something that's valuable for me even if they were what they were talking about was their suffering their

114
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:34,399
challenges in life it's like there was a kind of a coming together and I was so

115
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:40,000
inspired by this by some kind of inner something inside of them that had

116
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,360
gathered together to to to engage in this in their process of of the dharma

117
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,959
of practice of spirituality of religion and uh and some of them it was

118
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:58,320
more uh you know clear the nature of this gathering together and some of them

119
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,160
clearly had years of meditation practice behind them and it was the years of

120
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:10,639
practice somehow that I could feel the the the accumulated combination of their

121
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:18,560
intentionality their sense of purpose and what they've been doing and for all these years it felt like they're here

122
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:24,880
they might have had a mind that was overactivated and felt like they weren't getting concentrated but I could feel

123
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,079
that there was something here and in some of them uh the best car way I could

124
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:37,600
characterize it to myself and one of them to that person was um uh there was

125
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:44,399
there there was a a contemplative heart contemplative nature inside of them that

126
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:50,360
of a contemplative I think the person got a little bit scared because they associated that becoming a

127
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:57,760
monastic but I I reassured her that's not what I meant and um but there's It's a kind of

128
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:03,399
a um a uh inner sensibility a a kind of

129
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:10,880
faith a kind of sense of being connected something that's really good onward leading something that feels certainly

130
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,920
pleasant in a certain way but exactly how to characterize it for any maybe

131
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:23,199
it's very different for different people but something within that's very peaceful maybe or warm or sense of this

132
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:29,920
is home or this is where some kind of different quality of joy or happiness

133
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:35,600
well-being exists that's very different than uh the joy of winning the

134
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,519
California lot the lottery that's maybe joyful for a little while but that's

135
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:47,839
actually the end of that day celebrating you're probably exhausted and um and uh

136
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:56,880
or crying but um but this deep um and peace

137
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,639
there is something the Buddha called the the greatest happiness is peace so some

138
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:09,040
sense some hint some feeling quality for something inside that's living there and

139
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,880
I've had uh coming down here thinking about this talk today walking down here I was kind of decided I would try to

140
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:21,240
remember the different times in my life where I experienced this kind of thing even before I started

141
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:28,000
meditating and um and so uh you know that I described under the kitchen table

142
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,440
uh I grew up on the water a lot uh next to the water i'm

143
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,920
from Norway and on the coast there and there's uh sometimes being on the fjords

144
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,120
early early in the morning with the water completely still and quiet no wind

145
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:51,120
somehow that just was like that under the under the rose apple tree experience

146
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,160
um knew where that's where I was supposed to be that's where it was peaceful that was things felt full and

147
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:07,040
complete and nothing else had to happen the um um when I was 10 uh I there was

148
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,240
something that's happened on this on the public bus coming home from school it

149
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:20,720
was they had a they had a they had they called it a conductor they had the driver and they had the person who sold the tickets back then this was in Italy

150
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,800
and uh I discovered kind of I'd never thought about it at the time i just kind of did it by instinct but I discovered

151
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:33,199
that if I sat in a certain seat because I lived at the end of the bus line if I sat at the end of the seat the conductor

152
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:38,399
would sit in front of me and uh would take out his ledger and

153
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:47,440
record all the different tickets he sold for that trip you know the round trip one way children old

154
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:54,000
people you know whatever it was he had a whole bunch and he had to keep a log and I would sit over him but look over his

155
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:01,399
shoulder and watch him with his pencil and his uh doing his numbers whatever he did and I would just started feeling so

156
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:06,720
good i just felt and I I wasn't thinking about it i

157
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:14,079
wasn't like grabbing it or wanting more of it it was just like I knew I should do this and then when I stopped going on

158
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:20,240
the bus um it never occurred to me to want that again and it was just it was just almost like instinctual just it was

159
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,918
like the sun rises in the morning i would just go sit there and have this good feeling years later when I started

160
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:31,120
meditating oh that's what I was experiencing that

161
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:37,280
was a wonderful feeling for me of being being at peace being at ease being in

162
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:44,200
myself comfortable even though my life around me was quite um you

163
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:50,400
know I don't know you know I moved around a lot when I was growing up and I

164
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:56,240
was in a new city new language new country uh didn't know anybody and on an

165
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,919
bus where I don't know you know but so it was you know you know in some ways a

166
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:11,520
challenging time but but uh that bus ride was a refuge for me and um and so and then I kind of had

167
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:17,120
begun meditating but then I stopped when I lived with my f friends on their farm

168
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:24,799
and because I was living there for a while they decided they could take a difficult to acquire vacation because

169
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:29,840
they had these cows had to be milked every day so now I could do it feed them

170
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:36,320
feed them milk them and so I was left alone for the first time in my life for five days and didn't see anyone really

171
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:42,080
for the talk to anyone for those five seven days a week

172
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:48,880
and I again I had this feeling that welled up being alone that long time in a beautiful Norwegian kind of rural

173
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:56,480
place with these wonderful girlfriends that I had that I loved so much and caring for

174
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,000
them and and uh and so uh so this wonderful feeling grew up with this time

175
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,799
also with a tremendous clarity of mind like uh it wasn't that I stopped thinking but I started seeing every

176
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:14,919
thought like a like a diamond it was just like no matter how bad the thought was it was like

177
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:20,400
wow and um and that also was something I had started in meditation later i

178
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,039
started oh that was kind of a state meditation often people can have on

179
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:31,280
retreat and uh but this was so important that experience well when my friends

180
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,400
came back I lost it when it disappeared but it was so important for me i thought

181
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:44,160
this this was really something to guide a life with this is this I have faith in this is a something I'm inspired by so I

182
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:50,679
had this uh dharma feeling this dharma

183
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:55,919
inspiration around this experience and so then it became my

184
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:03,120
dedication uh to uh to figure out how to answer this question and the question was um

185
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,640
how can I be alone with others i didn't want to be a hermit

186
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:15,039
because that that's what I was alone for this week but uh but I I didn't I wanted to have this experience it felt like

187
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:20,160
this is how to be alive and maybe it's a strange expression for some people to

188
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:26,720
hear you me wanting to be alone with others but there was a best way at 20 that I could somehow understand what I

189
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,640
was trying to do i wanted to be with people connected to people involved in the world but I wanted also to be come

190
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,480
from that place of that clarity and that peace inside so this was an example then of an onward

191
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:45,320
leading in the present moment it was timeless it was to be experienced by someone who was attempting to be

192
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:50,480
wise on his way and um and so all these

193
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:56,559
things were behind me to get interested in Buddhism Buddhist practice meditation

194
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:03,840
it was there as a kind of a reference point or a guide and um and so and then

195
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:12,000
as we practice this kind of inner uh feeling of uh of what the dharma is what

196
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:19,520
this religious experience this contemplative experience this spiritual experience this kind of uh can be can

197
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:25,480
start becoming a clearer reference and a clear sense oh this is important this is

198
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:33,120
valuable and how do I allow this to grow in my life and develop and flower rather

199
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:40,960
than just have it be something I occasionally touch in in meditation or occasionally touch in with by going on retreat uh how can we how how do you

200
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:48,080
live from this deeper sensitivity this deeper feeling this deeper kind of peace

201
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:54,799
that's possible and and each person each of you will have a different way of describing it there's a lot of different

202
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:59,919
ways so I I don't want to use my words and get you believe you're supposed to

203
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:08,000
have it like me but um but uh to have this this uh this

204
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:15,400
dharma feeling this dharma sensibility this dharma this uh uh

205
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:21,520
inspiration and uh and sometimes the Buddha was explicit that it can come

206
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:29,120
from um uh the experience of a variety of things it can come from

207
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,320
uh all of them are considered part of part and parcel of Buddhist practice it

208
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:40,000
can come from living ethically and there's something about uh

209
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,039
ethical integrity that touch it can touch into this place that you feel that now it isn't

210
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:54,159
just like you're making ethical choices through your life but there's a feeling that ethics is arising out of some kind

211
00:22:54,159 --> 00:23:01,360
of deeper feeling of what it's like to have a certain kind of ethical integrity the Buddha said it can come

212
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:07,280
out of generosity there's a way of being generous of being magnanimous being

213
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:14,440
open-handed uh to people and to others and to the world rather than miserly or clinging or

214
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:22,799
hoarding that just kind of something about there's a movement of freedom in opening your hand and giving away and um

215
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:29,919
that in that done well also can give a person someone that dharma feeling that

216
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:36,000
feeling for what the goal is and it's you can see it can maybe feel a little bit more like that for uh generosity

217
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:43,280
because generos generosity is a liberation of things it is a letting go of something so it's a it's a kind of

218
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:49,159
precursor of the deep letting go that uh that uh liberation

219
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:56,480
is and then uh and then in the letting go uh that we begin experiencing at some

220
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:03,760
point a very special uh point arises where the letting go that we do that we

221
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:09,600
experience for ourselves uh gives birth gives rise to a real

222
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:17,000
clear feeling of the goodness of letting go the peace the the warmth the

223
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:25,760
happiness of letting go of the heart not being clenched or contracted or hard or

224
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:35,520
crusted over or armored or something and you could really feel oh look at this this is good um it might be um I mean

225
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:43,039
one metaphor the Buddha used was a open path in a overgrown jungle have you ever

226
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:48,480
tried to go through an overgrown jungle but there's no path it can go slow going

227
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,679
you finally find the path you're even lost you you know where is that path and you're lost and you're going around

228
00:24:53,679 --> 00:25:00,400
you're I've done that and ended up all scratched up and bloody because it was so dense and then

229
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:07,039
finally the open path is there and it just feels like now I'm sailing through it just feels so good like I can just I

230
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:12,799
know where I'm going I'm finally safe I'm know heading home or something where and but now there's you know it's

231
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:18,640
unencumbered to go that way so to have that feeling in your heart and to have

232
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:25,039
it so clear that that that represents this dharma feeling feeling for the

233
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:31,919
dharma or this inspiration this contemplative feeling this spiritual feeling that we have in Buddhism it's a

234
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:40,640
little bit hard for people coming out of western religions to understand this can be a form of religious experience and if

235
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:46,720
uh so much of the religious experience is around a relationship to uh a deity

236
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:52,559
or some something that's outside of you um But it's it might be very comparable

237
00:25:52,559 --> 00:26:00,480
the kind of deep experience it just has a different kind of object of where it's directed and here in the dharma it's um

238
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,880
directed to an experience we're having that then grows and inspires

239
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:11,360
us and the reason one of the reasons why this inspiration is so good is that for

240
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:17,559
the Buddha uh when we kind of really get a feel for it uh it gives rise to

241
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:24,799
joy a joy that doesn't take us away from the present moment puts us into the

242
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:31,919
present more fully and so it supports the practice of mindful presence being really here and

243
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,600
it's a joy that begins setting in motion this onward onwardleading nature of a

244
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,880
certain way a joy that leads to happiness a happiness that leads to a

245
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,320
peace a peace that leads to um um No no

246
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:54,240
it's a it's a gladness that leads to joy a joy that leads to uh tranquility a

247
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:00,159
tranquility that leads to happiness and a happiness that leads to a deep version

248
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:06,000
of this samadei a deep deep version of this uh feeling of being under the rose

249
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,159
apple tree and um and

250
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:17,200
uh so uh it was nice yesterday being here and

251
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:23,679
feeling that there were people who had were expressing in their how they were sitting how they were talking you could

252
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:29,440
feel that their kind of sense of very wonderful sense of purpose that they had

253
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:35,279
for some of them it came from uh ha having something in there that saying

254
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:41,520
this is the path this is what they're doing they practiced long enough you could see that there was this wonderful

255
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:50,240
way in which they were giving the practice a chance meditation practice a chance to really um change them and open

256
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,600
them and reshape reshape themselves in some kind of profound way because of how

257
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:05,440
much they sat and what they dedicated to and what they're allowing to grow and see coming and um so I was inspired and um

258
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:12,840
my hope was to share that inspiration with you coming here today so maybe you

259
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:18,399
have a contemplative heart i think everyone does but maybe we shouldn't

260
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:26,240
maybe there's a better word for you than contemplative heart maybe you have a practice heart and practice orientation maybe you

261
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:35,120
have a a not a liberated heart but maybe you have a liberating heart a heart that

262
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:42,159
wants to be liberated maybe it maybe you like prefer the word love maybe you have a love

263
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:47,200
loving heart and your feeling of what love is it's love that needs nothing

264
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:54,480
that's so deep maybe that's that's the experience we're talking about here for you

265
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:01,120
so um so maybe also this is a nice talk

266
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:08,559
before we celebrate the Buddha's birthday next next uh next week is we're celebrating his

267
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:15,520
birthday his enlightenment and his death all in the same day it just so it's

268
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:24,080
really efficient and we can get back to meditation and do it for

269
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:31,840
ourselves so we have a few minutes and um let's start um by hearing a couple of

270
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:38,720
comments from some of you or questions you might have and maybe it's nice to hear other voices here in the community

271
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:45,559
as we start kind of shifting to a more community-based

272
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,159
process anybody want to share

273
00:29:54,919 --> 00:30:00,600
anything good morning Gil thank you so much for today's talk

274
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:07,840
um Oh sorry thank you so much for today's talk and um my husband and I are

275
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:14,679
also enjoying the Monday through Friday sitting meditations with you

276
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:23,720
um and now at this point in my life I'm really enjoying the peace and

277
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:32,480
calm um but I also wonder I I feel like I have this

278
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:39,399
struggle but I don't know if it's a struggle my best and favorite memories from

279
00:30:39,399 --> 00:30:47,600
childhood are actions and physical um so not peace

280
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:54,000
and calm and maybe some of that was because of my family environment but um

281
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:01,840
the running and jumping off of swing sets and balancing on various things and

282
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:08,919
tumbling and rolling down hills um and so very much a

283
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:14,960
physical experience and so I'm trying to figure out what that means to me it

284
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:21,760
feels like yeah that's being in the moment but it also feels like maybe too

285
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:28,520
activated and not at peace and not calm

286
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,399
so uh fascinating wonderful that you see that i I'm sure that that freedom you

287
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:39,440
felt in action can be a wonderful reference point for this practice and

288
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:46,960
you might try doing walking meditation and seeing if a little bit of it can come alive there and um and yes if it's

289
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:53,519
too much energy involved there can be a feeling of freedom but it doesn't allow the mind to settle enough to start

290
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:59,440
touching the deeper places that need to be touched in this practice deeper places where where more and more of this

291
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:05,519
freedom can be discovered but can only be discovered if if the more activated

292
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:12,320
actions have gotten quiet but I I wouldn't want to dismiss this or say that it's you know you shouldn't have it

293
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:18,799
it might be some way to use it uh to connect to something so you know go

294
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:24,240
tumbling now be before you meditate and then

295
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:31,360
maybe then do walking meditation with it and then sit down and and maybe let things get quieter and see but uh and

296
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:39,440
then in the in deepest um in meditation the deepest deepest places you go in meditation um you could you could very

297
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:47,600
well uh reexperience that level of freedom without any action at all

298
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,760
thank you

299
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:05,279
when I was in seventh grade in San Francisco at a Catholic school and it was very uh warm and all the windows

300
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:11,919
were open and the nun was droning on and on for some 50inute lecture like they

301
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:17,360
used to do but I very distinctly remember I've never told anybody this i

302
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:22,840
very distinctly remember my

303
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:28,960
that the feeling of kind of a leaving the room hearing

304
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:35,919
the outside world come in and then I felt connected to the entire world that

305
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:41,919
the entire world was humming all at the same time with me and

306
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:50,039
I kind of left my ego and it was just this collective world m very nice

307
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:54,320
yeah so so

308
00:33:55,399 --> 00:34:02,320
um so some of you maybe have had experiences like that some of you don't

309
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:08,320
have any memory like that and what you remember is the opposite that some people have had all kinds of very tragic

310
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:15,760
experience very difficult experiences growing up and I don't want to belittle or dismiss that or ignore that that's

311
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,079
some people people's experience and for some people that's why they come to

312
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:26,398
practice and um and I don't know if it's a coincidence

313
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:31,878
uh the uh the Buddha died when he was a baby the Buddha's mother died when he was a

314
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:37,839
baby which any kind of lack of loss is huge so that maybe also was in his

315
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:44,158
psyche as he was kind of finding his way with all this and because he was certainly motivated to try to find an

316
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:49,480
end to suffering so I can I well imagine that he knew suffering well as

317
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:55,520
well and um and so both both are very important for the dharma to be honest

318
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:02,160
about to see to recognize and what the Buddha was trying to teach I believe is

319
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:07,839
that in order to address suffering well it's it's good to uh create a really

320
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:13,920
good state of mind and heart um that prepares you to hold it in a good way be

321
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:21,760
able to hold it in a generous open way without being a victim of your suffering but rather to be a healer of it and find

322
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:28,640
the freedom in in it and so um the the sense of joy and happiness that uh can

323
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:34,800
come with practice um is is in the service of addressing the suffering it's

324
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:41,800
not an escape from it and not some kind of way of just just going around and

325
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:48,960
just you know just pretending everything is just just you know sweet and

326
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:55,839
wonderful and and you can just ignore the suffering of the world the

327
00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:01,359
suffering of the world is being addressed but it's with this finding a a different lens a different approach

328
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:07,560
different way of holding it different capacity to be with it than most people learn on their

329
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:12,960
own so we have still a few minutes before the usual end so if you're a

330
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:21,880
willing to stay for a few minutes and uh it'd be nice to have Yes one more person wants to speak okay

331
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:30,320
thank you so much um I'm Lance and um earlier when you asked us what memory we

332
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:36,160
have of peace um what came up for me was being in my parents' room when I was

333
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:42,720
young with my siblings and we're all just like enjoying our time together you know like we were singing sharing pizza

334
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:50,200
and and that was great and another memory was me hiking alone in the wilderness um and just like looking at

335
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:58,400
the um the mountains h how does one reconcile the sense of peace amongst

336
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:04,240
others or within a community and also like in solitude like what what is

337
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:09,920
between peace in a community like in the family and and what's the other one in the nature yeah like or like um you know

338
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:17,880
like peace um in solitude like say meditating or hiking alone like h how do

339
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:26,240
we what is peace I guess sorry that might be a loaded question

340
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:32,430
so yeah I don't know but [Applause]

341
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:37,520
uh but whatever but uh but I think I I mean I I appreciate this question a lot

342
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:43,760
it seems like coming from an important place in you that uh that the that um uh

343
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:51,280
peace can be experienced is peace is not an issue about who you're with or not with or where you are in the world peace

344
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,720
has to do with the quality and characteristics of your heart and some environments kind of create the

345
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:02,000
conditions that support the peaceful heart and maybe the quality is a little bit different the characteristics is a

346
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,599
little bit different in different situations but the center of focus is not the external world it's to be

347
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:13,680
experienced by the wise personally and so to to start discovering some of the

348
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:19,760
operating principles inside how the mind and body and heart work uh how you lose

349
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,800
the peace how it what supports it so you can begin at finding identifying and

350
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:30,880
living with it as a companion no matter where you go and you take it with you

351
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:38,560
thank you so uh the idea is now if you would turn to uh maybe a couple of people next to

352
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:44,160
you and just look around so that someone's left you're not left alone because everyone turns the other

353
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:49,520
direction by coincidence and and say hello and introduce yourself and then if

354
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:54,880
there's anything from this talk that inspired you um uh maybe share it with

355
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:00,720
uh in a few brief words don't tell a long long story and uh but just you want to hear

356
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:07,359
from others and just say hello and and I'll ring I'll ring a bell
