00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,960
warm greetings to our meditation time together

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,440
and as a way of introducing this meditation

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:22,720
i want to use as an analogy something i witnessed

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,000
some days ago at a local park there were some people who were flying

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,559
remote control airplanes little airplanes in the field

6
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,920
but one of them was a helicopter a little drone helicopter with four

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,920
propellers and i was just kind of it was zipping through the air and

8
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:52,320
flipping around and doing all kinds of things and it was actually kind of hard to follow its

9
00:00:52,320 --> 00:01:01,520
jagged path and it's kind of following it looking around and i felt a little bit discombobulated

10
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:08,400
trying to find it and looking for there it is now it's gone and it was zipping around and then at some

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,840
point it started to return back to

12
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:24,000
you know back where the person was who was controlling it and uh there was a clear spot on the

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,119
ground a little three four inch little disc

14
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:35,840
that it was going to land on and so it started coming in and it was easy to follow it and it kind of zipped back and forth a

15
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,360
little bit over around that disc kind of oh like then it was easy for me to watch and

16
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,399
stay with it and it's and then at some point it came

17
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:53,040
right above the disc slow slow down slow down came right above the disc and it hovered above the disc right

18
00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:00,719
above it and it was kind of delight to kind of feel the delight and joyful to

19
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:07,200
just see it hovering there and it was so much more relaxing for my attention not to be searching for it in the sky

20
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,680
and i was just there just watching it hovers like my mind hovered and it was kind of like a little bit of a thrill to

21
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,800
see it just a few inches above the ground and then it just went straight down on

22
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,560
top of that disc and rested on the ground and something in my mind just

23
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:34,319
rested ah and the kind of thrill a little kind of excitement just having it hover vanished my mind

24
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,840
and i just my mind kind of settled it's almost like my my mind got grounded

25
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,080
oh

26
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,840
so i just see that the zoom folks didn't

27
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:59,840
uh weren't hearing me because i had them to mute on so so those of you

28
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,200
on youtube hopefully you'll be patient with me and i tell this little story

29
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,879
again and then we'll start going going going again

30
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:24,319
so everyone welcome to the meditation

31
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:32,000
and i'd like to begin by a little analogy of what happened a

32
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,480
few days ago in a park where there was a people flying

33
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,879
remote control little airplanes over the field and there was one drone helicopter with

34
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:51,120
four propellers there was zipping around in the sky and it was a curiosity thing for me to see

35
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,680
it but it was very hard to follow was see it for a moment it would zip away and

36
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,120
very jagged trajectory and path and so i was kind of busy my mom was kind of

37
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,480
active busy looking searching it was a lot of work at some point it

38
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,519
started the helicopter started coming back to where it was going to land and then i

39
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,359
could start seeing it again very easily without having to search for it

40
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,560
and then it clearly was a spot in the ground where it was going to land a little around disk

41
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,000
and and i um

42
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:37,120
um and then it was kind of like went back

43
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,840
and forth a little bit looking to be close to that spot above it and it's easy to watch it kind of glide and slide

44
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,520
back and forth it was kind of nice to see it little gentle movements and then it came

45
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,280
to a place just a few inches above the disc and it was completely still

46
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,400
hovering in the air and it was such a pleasure to watch it hovers like

47
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:07,039
it was a little bit of a thrill like just kind of defying gravity just being really still just right there and i felt a certain

48
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,560
kind of joy and delight and my mind got really still like oh what's happening here

49
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,639
just kind of being still with that hovering and then the

50
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:25,759
the um the helicopter just kind of landed on the ground and just was

51
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,600
atlantic got still subtle on the ground and i could feel my mind just get still

52
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:39,199
and the little bit of thrill or kind of the hovering feeling in my mind which was a little bit of energy rested

53
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:45,280
and my mind kind of something in my mind ah and it rested there

54
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,639
so this is an analogy for samadhi for the development of this wonderful thing

55
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:58,639
called samadhi sometimes called concentration some translators

56
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:06,800
translated as serenity and and it's you know if you're if your

57
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,000
mind is a helicopter then sometimes your mind is zipping

58
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,800
around and it's hard to even find it wherever the mind goes it's trajectory is not so clear it jumps around

59
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:26,560
and so you know for a mindfulness practitioner it can be a lot of work kind of like where'd it go now and

60
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,680
finding it and keeping up with it and remembering to look for it and be

61
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,880
present but then as as we start getting settled

62
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,479
more subtle than meditation the mind doesn't flit around so much

63
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,919
doesn't jump around so much and it begins to kind of still not quite in the present moment

64
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:55,120
here but maybe it's with the breathing some it's kind of in the territory and it's kind of a little bit moving back and forth

65
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,560
getting close in and out and sometimes there times i'm not but it doesn't go very far and

66
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,319
you kind of know where the mind is but it's just kind of looking for its landing spot

67
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:13,280
and then at some point it's really there in the present moment here in our experience in our body maybe

68
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,319
with our breathing and it just kind of a little bit hovering and it

69
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:25,039
just feels so good to kind of to have a certain kind of stillness but also to have a certain kind of

70
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:30,880
well maybe i don't know if weightless feeling or hovering feeling of just there but it's

71
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:38,000
kind of a bit of a thrill and it's so nice a little bit wonderful and delightful

72
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,639
and then it's it doesn't go anywhere except it settles further down onto the

73
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:51,280
landing spot and for the mind to land here in the present moment a

74
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,840
landing spot on the ground where it's still peaceful

75
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:03,919
unmoving and then our mind just comes to our deep rest it just rests there it's not searching

76
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:10,479
for anything it's not chasing for anything it's not bouncing around

77
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:19,599
and even the even the delight of finally just kind of being in a spot hovering is ah that settles as it comes

78
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,479
down and just up just here stillness quiet

79
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:32,240
peacefulness and settled here

80
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:40,000
and one of the descriptions of samadhi is a settledness of mind the mind is

81
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,640
settled and the deeper the subtleness is the stiller the mind comes

82
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:54,080
and a stillness that's not just a stillness of a particular spot within us

83
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:01,200
but as if everything is still because the awareness has become still

84
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:09,440
so assuming a meditation posture

85
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:16,399
that can be both your landing spot here in this body

86
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:23,839
and your helicopter your mind here

87
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,000
and if your mind is

88
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:38,160
dashing about after this thought and that thought just know that

89
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,560
you also have the remote control

90
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,839
to direct it back to its landing spot

91
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:01,120
gently lovingly still letting the mind know come back come back home

92
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:07,440
be here this is where rest is this is where safety

93
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:14,480
is don't need to flit around so much

94
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,240
and maybe one of the remote control signals for the mind to

95
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:29,920
settle down is taking a few long slow deep breaths

96
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,120
a deep breath about three quarters full without without any strain in the

97
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:43,519
in-breath and then an exhale that's maybe twice as

98
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:49,040
long as usual again without any strain

99
00:10:52,399 --> 00:11:01,839
and exhale where there's more letting go at the end of the exhale

100
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:15,839
more release at the end of the exhale

101
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:47,279
and then letting your breathing settle down quiet down as if the breathing now can

102
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:57,839
begin landing here in your body

103
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:17,120
as you exhale softening and relaxing the body

104
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:25,519
and part of the relaxing of the muscles is to help the body come to a greater

105
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,240
stillness

106
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,760
as we soften the muscles of the face relax them

107
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:52,880
it's letting go of the activity of tension and holding

108
00:12:52,880 --> 00:13:00,480
on the exhale relaxing the shoulders and if the shoulders are being held up

109
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:07,040
it's activity and action

110
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,399
that interferes with a deep settling into stillness

111
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:24,639
and the same thing with a belly softening relaxing the belly

112
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:32,839
and sometimes there you can feel the greater stillness sometimes not if it's difficult to be

113
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,839
relaxed

114
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:48,160
perhaps or some way to bring the entire body to stillness to relax let go

115
00:13:48,160 --> 00:14:03,839
in the hands the arms the chest the legs

116
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:16,639
and then to begin bringing the mind the awareness

117
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:22,000
home to the landing spot of the body breathing

118
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:34,880
and you might not quite be there yet might be close by you might fly by and come back and

119
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:42,240
circle around close to the breath but not quite there that's okay

120
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:51,519
that's that might be needed to kind of locate the place to land

121
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:04,800
maybe you're with the breathing for a few breaths or half a breath off you go again

122
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:17,760
and rather than being discouraged be encouraged that this is part of the

123
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:27,519
process of coming to landing and you are getting closer

124
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:35,120
maybe less off in the distant sky flitting around coming here

125
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:41,839
to your breathing

126
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:53,199
and maybe for a while you hover over the breath

127
00:15:53,199 --> 00:16:00,160
almost as if the in-breath is a dr upward draft that you catch and

128
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:08,240
kind of hovering in gliding on

129
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,240
and the exhale is kind of a

130
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:23,839
provide support to glide along slide along on the exhale

131
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:19,360
and for the mind to really land in the breathing

132
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,520
the mind needs to become stiller

133
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:31,520
mind needs to be quieter which might be held by relaxing the

134
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:39,520
thinking mind relaxing any muscular tension

135
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:47,840
associated with thinking worrying and wanting

136
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:56,880
tension that might be in the forehead or behind it around the eyes or jaws

137
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:05,679
in a slight leaning forward or pulling being pulled or like pulling back

138
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:18,000
a more subtle relaxation of the body that corresponds to the settling of the

139
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,720
mind it allows the mind to settle and get

140
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,840
quieter

141
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:49,200
and feeling more in the breathing the body breathing

142
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:58,400
and what would it be like for you to be right there with a breathing

143
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:04,399
hovering over it gently quietly

144
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:13,760
putting in just enough energy for your mind your attention

145
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,960
to hover over the in-breaths and out-breaths

146
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:27,679
so the mind is not wandering off and into thought so much but right there

147
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:39,840
breathing in and breathing out

148
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:52,080
and not so much like there's a laser focus like you're in the control tower looking

149
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:59,280
at the breathing but more like the whole body is

150
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:07,840
gently vibrating hovering over the breathing or with the breathing

151
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:21,840
right there breathing in and breathing out

152
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:35,840
they're kind of hovering where there's a stillness and a tranquility not a lot of movement

153
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,840
and then to let the mind

154
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:55,039
land in the breathing to land in the present moment

155
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,880
so that the engine can go off and

156
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:10,480
has deep stillness groundedness

157
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:18,799
safety having landed secure and stable here on the ground of

158
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,919
the body breathing

159
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,200
around the earth

160
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:35,039
wide and expansive and quiet earth

161
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:47,120
where the mind can feel secured enough to be still quiet

162
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:59,840
resting on the body breathing

163
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:42,480
whenever the mind is wandered off lot come back to first hovering with the

164
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:51,279
breath with breathing and then with a relaxation letting go

165
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:59,440
land on the breath land inside of it

166
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:06,799
come to a stillness of mind in the middle of the moving experience

167
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:13,840
of breathing

168
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,839
do

169
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,720
finding a place that of stillness within

170
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,599
and allowing the mind to become still

171
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:31,440
quiet even unmoving

172
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:43,839
together with the inner stillness

173
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,839
so

174
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:25,839
so

175
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,440
and then coming to the end of this sitting

176
00:41:52,560 --> 00:42:00,839
and thinking about how samadhi operates in our interpersonal

177
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:06,240
relationships it is not a concentrated focus

178
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:13,839
on others but rather it's a deep

179
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,839
settledness in ourselves

180
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:27,440
to be deeply settled without any fear

181
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:34,880
agendas without any leaning forward or pulling

182
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:40,400
back without being pushed by desires or

183
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:47,599
pulled by aversion just a deep subtleness

184
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:52,319
and to be with others in this settled way

185
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:02,880
so settled that of course you'll be aware of the other person

186
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:12,079
you don't need to intently focus of course you're open and available and

187
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:18,640
aware of the other and from this subtle place may be of

188
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,599
peaceful place

189
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:34,640
here there can be a kind of deep love and

190
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:43,599
positive regard and offering of good will of safety

191
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:52,000
a deep respect of others because you're not interfering with them

192
00:43:52,000 --> 00:44:00,800
or needing them to be different you're simply settled with them

193
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,000
settled on yourself

194
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:12,960
and this settled samadhi factor

195
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,960
can give a wonderful perspective

196
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:25,440
for how to be with people with care with love with friendliness with good

197
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:32,720
will that is not so much work or an obligation

198
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:37,838
or a transaction

199
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,680
it just is

200
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:54,079
and may it be that our ability to be still in meditation

201
00:44:54,319 --> 00:45:05,280
may it also be for the for the welfare and happiness of others

202
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:12,319
may all beings be happy

203
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:19,119
may all beings be safe

204
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:25,599
may all beings be settled in them on themselves

205
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:36,560
may all beings be nourished by an inner stillness and safety

206
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:47,839
may all beings know inner peace

207
00:45:48,000 --> 00:46:01,839
and may all beings everywhere be free

208
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:06,619
[Music]

209
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:26,720
so the topic of today is the samadhi factor of awakening

210
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:33,359
and tomorrow's topic monday will be

211
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:40,839
equanimity and we are one day behind because of the technological glitch that happened on

212
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:46,000
tuesday and we will

213
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,520
um and then for the youtube we'll be back meeting

214
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:57,280
again at 7 00 am california time tomorrow

215
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:04,640
so samadhi is commonly translated as concentration in english the

216
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:11,200
the prolific translator tenisero tunisirobiku american who lives in san

217
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:18,880
diego he translates it as serenity

218
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:25,839
and so it's a very different feeling between concentration and serenity

219
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:32,880
when it's translated as serenity it then raises the question how is that

220
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:39,040
different than tranquility the factor of awakening that's listed just before

221
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:46,799
samadhi and i see that

222
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:53,119
that samadhi is characterized by stillness

223
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:58,160
serenity for me is characterized so i don't know if the english english word serenity and tranquility

224
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:04,720
are maybe almost complete synonyms of each other but if you look at the pali words the

225
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:10,559
ancient language words that pasadi the word for

226
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:15,760
tranquility i think has more of a connotations of brightness

227
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:23,520
of um of a kind of a bright quality a soft quality a very light

228
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:31,839
feeling the body can feel very light and soft when there's tranquility whereas in samadhi the

229
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:40,319
the the when the primary characteristic could be more a stillness than samadhi

230
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:45,760
there's a very sense of deep stillness things have gotten very still the greater the samadhi the more

231
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:50,880
stillness there is and um and also with with somebody it's a very

232
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:57,280
clear the stillness of it this sometimes can feel very strong there's a strength can be a strength to it at

233
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:03,119
times and the mind has is not distractible mind won't wander away at all just

234
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:08,160
it's like the mind is kind of sometimes there's a feeling people describe as being locked in

235
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:13,920
in somebody it's so strong and the stillness was boom we're locked in and then the mind's not

236
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:20,960
going to move anywhere into anything whereas in tranquility the mind very tranquil and peaceful but it's not

237
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:27,680
really 100 still maybe i associate

238
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:35,359
tranquility as i did mentioned yesterday about with a quiet very peaceful morning lake

239
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:42,480
completely placid and still not a ripple of wind on it and um and the morning you know morning

240
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:49,200
light is just very clear and bright and still very stillness in the air the birds haven't come out yet

241
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:54,319
and um and so this but this body of water it's very flat

242
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:59,440
and um and so so tranquility

243
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:06,240
is you know it's kind of like a body of water and i associate it with much more with a body than the mind

244
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:12,400
somehow and then um in samadhi

245
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:17,760
um at least for me it is it's uh it can be very embodied feeling

246
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:24,160
that comes with it but um it's much more like the stillness of the mind there

247
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:30,319
it's not like a body of water but it's more like the stillness of space

248
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:37,680
and um then where there's you know everything is still in in space

249
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:43,680
space in and of itself is stillness uh kind of and uh and there's but

250
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:50,880
there's space like if you look up at the scott knight at the sky you know space has no boundaries it goes

251
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:56,240
on forever it's you can you don't you can say that space is soft i guess

252
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:01,760
but you know it's not a quality that has softness or lightness as part of it

253
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:08,640
it's more porous or just it's the openness or something so the my

254
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:16,880
and i associate samadhi a little bit more with the mind becoming still and porous open has no boundaries to it

255
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:22,160
and but you know definitely it's landed it's here

256
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:27,599
and then it landed here and then sometimes the place sense of a landing place disappears

257
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:34,319
it's just here but with this openness kind of an openness and it's not exactly

258
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:39,440
embodied body sometimes disappears in deep samadhi

259
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:46,640
so the primary function of samadhi one of the primary functions of

260
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:52,240
tranquility here is to support samadhi and so when the body

261
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:58,480
is tranquil it really supports the mind to become stiller it's kind of like if

262
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:04,559
you try to land that you know drone on top of a moving train

263
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:10,880
that's going along fast it's you know it's a little hard but if the train stops then you can land it on the roof of the

264
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:16,319
train perhaps it's so the same thing if you try to land in a body that's all agitated

265
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:23,920
it's hard for the mind to land and be here so that tranquility supports it creates

266
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:30,160
a nice home and nourishment and support for this uh to be settled to be

267
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:35,839
settled on our experience more than being focused on our experience

268
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:42,960
the idea of of focus in samadhi uh sometimes this idea of one pointedness

269
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:48,319
maybe that's a good metaphor a good good for some people that really works today

270
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:53,920
okay i'm really going to be focused one pointed on something but i think of it this this so-called

271
00:52:53,920 --> 00:53:02,640
one-pointedness as a gathering together so all of ourselves are all of us is centered on something

272
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:09,359
it's being centered on the breathing and so rather than being one pointed

273
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:15,119
with the mind it's coming to rest at the center point of the concentric circles of our life

274
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:20,160
and we're just really right here so with the breath completely with a breath for example if the

275
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:26,000
focus is the breath but there's more feeling of being centered on it than it is being

276
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:33,119
focused on it at least that's how it is for me the buddha said that the nourishment

277
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:39,200
for samadhi is serenity and the word there now is

278
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:44,960
samatha so it's not the same word as samadhi but samata in particular has that i

279
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:52,160
in my rudimentary understanding of poly etymology is that it's um

280
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:57,520
even closer to the city of stillness of landings stan taking a stand where we're

281
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:03,520
really still and quiet so it so it's a kind of serenity of stillness not the serenity of us

282
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:08,559
of um of softness and lightness

283
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:14,480
and um so the nourishment of samadhi is

284
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:22,559
is stillness and that means that uh to be nourish yourself with stillness

285
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:28,400
so to notice the places where the you are still where there is stillness

286
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:34,880
and um and perhaps that's within um there's a woman nearby

287
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:41,680
local woman who wrote a composed this uh she's a mindfulness teacher um and she

288
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:46,880
did a little cd for children called the still quiet place within i love that

289
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:54,400
little title the still quiet place within and so to uh to recognize and find a place of

290
00:54:54,400 --> 00:55:01,119
stillness but not that we're being held still or kind of a trapped being still but

291
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:07,839
something that actually feels nourishing it feels wholesome and if you're able to touch into that

292
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:14,880
inner place of nourishing stillness allow yourself to be nourished by it

293
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:20,160
and this is one of the wonderful characteristics of these teachings of the buddha around meditation

294
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:27,839
it's not just kind of this dreary dry you know focus on the breath and

295
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:35,520
stay with the breath and count the breath just you know zero in on the breath and and like a little technique of

296
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:42,960
you know of i don't know of mental focus

297
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:51,040
it's uh it's a it's a it's a settling into allowing and

298
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:57,680
touching into all kinds of ways in which we feel nourished wholesome feel the

299
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:03,359
wholesomeness of something feels a nourishment of something feel the goodness of something allow

300
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:08,480
ourselves to we're allowed to feel joy we're allowed to feel happiness

301
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:14,000
and one of the characteristics of the the buddhist community in the time of

302
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:19,839
the buddha that apparently was a little bit unusual for the religious circles of his time

303
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:25,599
was that the buddhist disciples were smiling a lot always kind of kind of a

304
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:33,040
joyful group so it's not like it meant to be a grim practice this meditation

305
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:38,160
don't take meditation too seriously meditation is much too important to take

306
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:43,680
seriously because if you take it too seriously i think you kind of like squeeze some of

307
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:50,960
the life out of it and makes it harder to feel the nourishment and the and the wholesomeness and the joy the

308
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:56,559
pleasure of it all not to indulge in those things and not

309
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:01,680
to hold on to them and expect them and huff and puff for it

310
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:07,280
but in the very even in the smallest ways in the course of a day or in the course

311
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:13,359
of meditation you're allowed to tap in and discover the places that feel wholesome

312
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:18,720
places field where there's inner goodness nourishment each of the seven factors has a

313
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:24,720
nourishment for it and so um

314
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:31,440
so what how would it what how does samadhi come about if that's the orientation not this one

315
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:38,319
pointed focus but rather imbibing

316
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:43,520
the nourishment that's here even if it's just like if one percent of yourself

317
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:50,960
feels has this good nourishing quality um then um

318
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:58,319
maybe that's worth a lot more than the five percent of your of who you are that's neurotic but if

319
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:04,400
you give a hundred percent of your attention to your five percent that's neurotic

320
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:10,160
then you're not going to be nourished but if you give a hundred percent of your attention to

321
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:15,920
the one percent that's wholesome then you can be nourished by that and

322
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:21,760
then things begin to relax and open and something like that i don't know

323
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:29,440
what percentage you are of all these things but uh chances are that if you're a regular

324
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:34,839
human being that you probably give more attention to what's not

325
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:41,520
nourishing than to what is nourishing and so sit down meditate in the

326
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:47,280
nourishing stillness the nourishing awareness the nourishing

327
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:53,838
tranquility the nourishing joy the nourishing mindfulness

328
00:58:55,200 --> 00:59:03,920
so samadhi the samadhi factor of awakening and when that it becomes well developed

329
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:11,520
meaning they're well nourished by it supported by it to feel the goodness of it that creates the wonderful conditions

330
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:17,920
for the mind to have equanimity to develop equanimity so it's not enforced equanimity where

331
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:24,079
you hold yourself still but it's an equanimi that comes because there's a feeling of being really

332
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:30,640
settled and at ease and in this nourishing place of stillness

333
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:38,799
so the so the samadhi factor of awakening so until we do equanimity tomorrow

334
00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:44,240
those of you coming back for that you might

335
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:52,640
spend some extra time today seeing if you can become more familiar

336
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:58,960
with whatever capacity whatever ability you have to discover

337
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:04,000
a nourishing inner stillness quiet

338
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:11,040
unwaveringness unagitatedness within and see what it's like to

339
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:15,839
let yourself enjoy it and be nourished

340
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:26,000
may samadhi be a delight for you thank you
