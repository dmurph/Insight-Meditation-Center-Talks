1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:08,440
good morning welcome those of you that are uh watching on YouTube you can see that the

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:14,559
title is poetry of practice 3 those of you who don't know I've uh

3
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:20,720
earlier done two weeks on poetry of practice so I just want to distinguish

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:27,880
that's what this three is for I think uh the two happened in August of 2023 and

5
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:35,000
poetry practice one I think was in in April 2023 but I might have those dates

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,559
wrong so I'm just going to say a few words about this whole idea of poetry

7
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,600
and then we'll get into a guided meditation and that is that there is

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,280
this way in which we can engage with practice that is

9
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,239
uh an emphasis on you know the list the Buddhist list and this certain amount of

10
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:04,080
technique have these 16 steps of H P Sati or there are the 13 types of uh

11
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,560
practices for mindfulness of the body in the Sati patan you know these types of things and

12
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:17,159
especially when we are teaching uh five days it's you know it's tempting for

13
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:23,400
those of us that are in the role of Derma teachers to find uh a list that has five you know it's just a nice

14
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,640
convenient way to do things for five days but which is a perfectly legitimate

15
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,680
way but it kind of then you know gives the sense that maybe the D is all about

16
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:42,119
this formulaic one through five or these lists so that's perfectly legitimate way

17
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:48,320
I love to practice that way I do practice that way and I also practice

18
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,960
another way a way that uh invites maybe another

19
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,240
way of engaging with practice another way that's less with

20
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:07,039
the uh mind and the thinking and more with the

21
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:12,560
heart different way of relating to our experience a different way of relating

22
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,599
to practice we might say a different way of coming

23
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:24,440
home it's a way of recognizing or tuning into something that's a little bit

24
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:30,360
different that our continual grasping of understanding or evaluation

25
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,400
or finding the next moment and where am I in this list or something like that instead there's this way of practicing

26
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,800
we might say with poetry with verse that lets language

27
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:49,680
touch us in a different way guide us in a different way than

28
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,720
these lists so we'll do a little bit of poetry

29
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:02,000
of practice this week so this morning I will going to drop in a verse during our

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,200
guide meditation I'll lead us to settling a little bit then I'll drop in a verse and then during the Dhat um

31
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:16,599
we'll talk about the verse and as it happens um this verse is written like a

32
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:22,680
short story so as I'm saying it it might sound like a short story rather than a

33
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:29,040
poem it's perfectly fine you might say it's a poem because the poet said it's a

34
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,879
poem and um I'll say the name of the poem and

35
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:41,760
the poet at the end okay

36
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,799
so again our meditation

37
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,599
posture feeling into the sense of this

38
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:03,760
moment what is it like to be in this body at this

39
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:11,040
moment putting aside any ideas of how things should be and tuning into how

40
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,040
things

41
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,440
are is there a way way to inhabit the

42
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,520
body bring a sense of aliveness a sense of

43
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,800
presence to the bodily

44
00:04:54,039 --> 00:05:01,240
experience letting go of any ideas of how things ought to be or you want them

45
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:07,560
to be but instead bringing some curiosity and some

46
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,000
engagement to how they are

47
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:46,639
and we set the orientation the

48
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,240
direction of our practice as one of

49
00:05:52,240 --> 00:06:00,919
kindness and okayness can I be okay

50
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:06,039
however you find the body at this

51
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:16,000
moment and you be in a body that perhaps has discomfort or

52
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:23,120
pain can that be okay for this meditation

53
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,560
period e

54
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:17,199
maybe doing a gentle body scan bringing some care and some

55
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:23,800
presence to any areas of the body that feel like they could use some

56
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:31,520
care and presence some warm-heartedness

57
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,479
e e

58
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,800
settling into the sensations of

59
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:47,720
breathing turning into the experience of

60
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,240
breathing inhales and

61
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,360
exhales as if it were okay as if this were

62
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:13,360
sufficient right now just to be with the sensations of

63
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,428
[Music]

64
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,360
breathing e

65
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:31,320
in particular needs to be happening just

66
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:39,600
noticing the experience of inhales feeling this stretch perhaps in

67
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,800
the

68
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:03,600
body and the release of to stretch with the exhales

69
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:03,360
resting knowing a body knows how to

70
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:11,000
breathe we don't have to make it breathe we don't have to change

71
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:20,600
it and we allow the breath to be just as it

72
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
is

73
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
e

74
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
e

75
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
e

76
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

77
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
e

78
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

79
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

80
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,920
e e

81
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:14,120
if we find ourselves lost in thought we don't have to build a story

82
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:19,319
about what it means about us as

83
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:26,160
meditators just very simply gently begin

84
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,840
again with the sensations of breathing

85
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,360
in a relaxed easy

86
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
manner

87
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

88
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,760
e e

89
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:56,640
to drop in this poem absolutely nothing needs to be

90
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:03,880
done just allow the words to be

91
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:11,080
received you don't have to interpret it you don't have to understand it you

92
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:17,000
don't have to remember it what would it be like to just simply

93
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,720
experience it moment after moment after

94
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:32,799
moment I'll talk about it in the dant for now just experience

95
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:45,680
it the poem goes like this maybe I should say it reads like a short

96
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:51,880
[Music] story not much

97
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:58,600
chance completely cut loose from purpose it was a young man riding a bus through

98
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:05,200
North Carolina on the way to somewhere and it began to

99
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:12,240
snow and the bus stopped at a little cafe in the hills and the passengers

100
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,960
entered he sat at the counter with the others he ordered and the food

101
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:24,919
arrived the meal was particularly good and the

102
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:31,559
coffee the waitress was unlike the women he had known she was

103
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:36,720
unaffected there was a natural humor which came from

104
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:45,080
her the fried cook said crazy things the dishwasher and back laugh a good clean

105
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:51,559
Pleasant laugh the young man watched the snow Through the

106
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:57,039
Windows he wanted to stay in that Cafe

107
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:03,200
Forever The Cure ious feeling swam through him that everything was

108
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:09,960
beautiful there that it would always stay beautiful

109
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:15,440
there then the bus driver told the passengers that it was time to board the

110
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:23,039
young man thought I'll just sit here I'll just stay

111
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:30,640
here but then he rose and followed the others into the bus he found his seat and looked at the

112
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:36,640
cafe through the bus window then the bus moved off down a

113
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:44,120
curve downward out of the hills the young man looked straight

114
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:50,080
forward he heard the other passengers speaking of other other things or they

115
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:56,400
were reading or attempting to sleep they had not noticed the

116
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:04,120
magic the young man put his head to one side closed his eyes pretended to

117
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:10,880
sleep there was nothing else to do just to listen to the sound of the

118
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,080
engine the sound of the tires in the

119
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:27,799
snow there was nothing else to do just to listen to the sound of the

120
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:34,999
engine the sound of the tires in the [Music]

121

[Music]

133
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:09,960
but that poem was called Nirvana by Charles

134
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:15,080
Bukowski Nirvana by Charles

135
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:24,039
Bukowski so um welcome welcome for those of you who

136
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:30,559
are joining us late or just joining us here for the Garment or this little

137
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:35,919
talk Jane hersfield who's a well established poet she's a beautiful po

138
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:43,279
she some amazing poems and um she's also a Buddhist practitioner and I love this quote that

139
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:51,960
uh she has she says Science and Mathematics and Engineering exist for answerable

140
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:59,720
questions poems exist for questions that have no answers but still require a

141
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:05,519
response I like this this idea that you know poetry is a way of responding but

142
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:13,519
not in a way like an answer which tends to be you know a I don't know have edges and be really

143
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:20,960
uh like okay this is the answer this is the truth this is how it is next what's the next thing is poems are a response

144
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:26,200
and we might say I'm going to say a response of the heart it's a different

145
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:33,360
part of us that's a resp responding and so one question that we

146
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:39,480
might have it's natural question with this practice with this tradition is

147
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:46,679
this idea of Nirvana or nibana this idea of you know what is it

148
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:52,679
what is it to be awakened what is this about uh Awakening and there's a number

149
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:58,360
of different ways we can understand in P the word is nibbana in Sanskrit the word

150
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:04,159
is nirvana the exact same word two different languages so Charles Bowski is

151
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:10,559
using Nirvana um and in poly and in the poly County

152
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:16,639
it's but so there's different ways we could say to understand this but maybe I

153
00:31:16,639 --> 00:31:21,720
would say what's more important than

154
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:30,440
describing exactly what it is is maybe to uh point to the impact it has on

155
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:35,720
somebody who is experiencing it how are people transformed what is their

156
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:41,720
experience by attaining narana so staying more with

157
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:47,080
the empirical the Practical The Experience rather than getting into

158
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:52,200
metaphysics and philosophical which is just stories right metaphysics and

159
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:59,080
philosophy or just stories that we're telling ourselves in our mind so instead can we point to what's the

160
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:04,960
experience and then you know something that we hear a lot um and read a lot if

161
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:11,200
you explore this idea of uh Nirvana and even in the nibon in the poly Canon it

162
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,320
talks about how it's Indescribable and

163
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:23,880
ineffable so this poem by Charles buosi who let's just say

164
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:29,639
he's not known for being a Buddhist practitioner in fact uh he had a colorful life I don't know all the

165
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:38,039
details of his life but I know enough of it to know that uh he was uh fond of drinking and wasn't known for his uh

166
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:44,200
following the precepts let's just say but you know he wasn't a Buddhist

167
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:52,799
practitioner so notice if you can feel into a theme of this poem like the sense

168
00:32:52,799 --> 00:33:00,360
of it maybe the experience of it if uh as I read it again and then I'll I'll say say a few words so again this this

169
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:05,278
poem is nirvana by Charles

170
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:12,399
Bukowski not much chance completely cut loose from purpose

171
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:18,159
it was a young man riding a bus through North Carolina on the way to

172
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:23,880
somewhere and it began to snow and the bus stopped at a little cafe in the

173
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:29,480
hills and the passengers entered he sat at the counter with the

174
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:36,080
others he ordered and the food arrived the meal was particularly good

175
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:44,720
and the coffee the waitress was unlike the women he had known she was unaffected there

176
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:51,519
was a natural humor which came from her the Fred cook said crazy things the

177
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:58,600
dishwasher and back laughed a good clean Pleasant laugh

178
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:05,120
the young man watched the snow Through the Windows he wanted to stay in that Cafe

179
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:12,040
forever the Curious feeling swam through him that everything was beautiful there

180
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:17,919
that it would always stay beautiful there and the bus driver told the

181
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:23,520
passengers that it was time to board the young man thought I'll just

182
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:30,800
sit here I'll just stay here but then he rose and followed the others

183
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:36,800
into the bus he found his seat and looked at the cafe through the bus

184
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:43,358
window then the bus moved off down a curve downward out of the hills the

185
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:48,760
young man looked straight forward he heard the other passengers

186
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:54,839
speaking of other things or they were reading or attempting to sleep they had

187
00:34:54,839 --> 00:35:02,000
not noticed the magic the young man put his head to one side

188
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,800
closed his eyes pretended to sleep there was nothing else to

189
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:16,920
do just to listen to the sound of the engine the sound of the tires in the

190
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,920
snow I know this poem it touches me there's a so many things that I could

191
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:30,920
say but um one thing you might say is completely ordinary what I don't get

192
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:36,200
it why is this called Nirvana it's just some dude hanging out in a

193
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:44,119
cafe and maybe what if that's exactly what Nirvana is we tend to kind of bring

194
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:50,880
some of these ideas we might have about heaven or some of these other ideas about what it must mean to be awakened

195
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:56,720
but what if it's about having a perfectly ordinary life and being

196
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:02,400
complete content with that ordinary

197
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:09,280
life no wish for things to be otherwise no insistence that things be different

198
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:15,359
no little ningling yeah but I want this I don't want that it should be more like this it shouldn't be less like that

199
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:21,680
instead just being with what is

200
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:28,920
completely just letting things unfold maybe kind of like a bus that's

201
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:35,720
going down the hill that's going here and there just trusting like there there's an unfolding of life there's an

202
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:41,040
unfolding of what's going to happen next without this strong sense of me

203
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:47,400
controlling things without a strong sense of self making things happen and

204
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:54,880
ensuring things that go one way and not the other way instead this uh deep trust

205
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:01,920
this deep intuition this deep sense of things unfolding like I'm using this

206
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:07,680
expression this uh sense of intuition a

207
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:13,319
flow of uh life and allowing the life to

208
00:37:13,319 --> 00:37:19,160
flow with us without a sense of this center of it that has to control

209
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:24,920
everything this Center which is judging this is good this is

210
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:33,040
bad I love this um there's this sentence in here in this

211
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:40,640
poem a curious feeling swam through him that everything was beautiful there that

212
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:49,400
it would always stay beautiful there so this sense of like Beauty and

213
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:54,720
just the ordinary and we all know things are

214
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:02,960
impermanent and yet he's saying that they would always stay beautiful there so pointing to no matter what happens

215
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:08,040
it's beautiful we might use this language

216
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:13,640
this notion of Grace like everything having this this uh beautiful being

217
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:22,200
touched by Grace nothing needs to be

218
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:28,040
different and then I like in the poem he says the young men thought oh just sit

219
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:37,838
here I'll just stay here so he's sitting and staying here in the present

220
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:45,319
moment and just that experience because what comes right after the young man

221
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:51,680
thought I'll just sit here I'll just stay here but then he rose and follow

222
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:59,680
the others onto the bus so the he is in this appreciation this flow with what's

223
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:06,359
actually happening but the physical here is changing he going from the cafe and

224
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:12,119
going in back into the bus and earlier while he was in the

225
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:19,599
cafe he uh was looking out the window at the snow and then he was uh later he's in

226
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:25,240
the bus looking out at the cafe and so the the his perspectives are changing

227
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:30,839
he's in different places and he's looking at things different ways but there's always this we might say this

228
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:36,279
sense of contentment but contentment with

229
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:45,680
beauty and what if that's what Awakening is what if Awakening is this sense of

230
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:52,640
things are as they are and it's like this and it's

231
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:58,800
okay and seeing the beauty of the moments there's this way in which as

232
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:05,560
humans we have this sense of we always want things to be a little bit different we're trying to Tumble into the next

233
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:10,960
moment we're being dismissive of the present moment but what if there is no

234
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:17,079
more agitation no more restlessness no more sense a complete

235
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:26,240
absence of the sense of there needs to be more there needs to be more what if there's none of

236
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:33,000
that it's just this moment and this moment is a sense of perfection sense of

237
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,640
beauty sense of Grace no matter what's

238
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:48,440
happening there's this way that there's we sometimes we talk about Nirvana as

239
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:54,839
the absence of greed hatred and delusion so what this means is this

240
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:59,240
absence of wanting things to be different

241
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:05,079
is uh seeing things clearly changing the perspective whether it's through the bus

242
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:11,119
window or through the window of the cafe looking out whatever it

243
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:20,040
is I'll read this poem one more time again it's Nirvana by Charles

244
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:27,800
Bowski not much chance completely cut loose from purpose

245
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:33,839
he was a young man riding a bus through North Carolina on the way to

249
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:02,280
he had known she was unaffected there was a natural humor which came from her

sleep there was nothing else to do just listen to the sound of the

262
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:30,040
engine the sound of the tire in the

263
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:37,720
snow I'll say this last little sentence there was nothing else

264
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:46,839
to do just to listen to the sound of the engine the sound of the tires in the

265
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:55,240
snow this radical sense of oiness what would it be like for you to

266
00:43:55,240 --> 00:44:03,359
notice and tune into any sense of okayness sense of contentment not uh

267
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:11,720
fireworks and blist out happiness but just a sense of ordinary

268
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:17,599
okayness would it be like for you to tune into that
