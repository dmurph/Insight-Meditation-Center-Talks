1
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:12,240
okay So welcome everybody Welcome from uh from foggy

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,400
Santa Barbara which is our typical spring uh summer weather here Typical

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:26,359
June weather We call it June gloom Hopefully it gets a little bit sunnier in July

4
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,800
there's a you know mental activity in the relationship to uh to seeing and

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,800
having perceptions about the weather just to be noticed

6
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:49,600
So today is the the last day of our week's exploration of what the Buddha described as making up the world the six

7
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,879
sense spheres uh these six pathways through which we meet all the experience

8
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:00,000
of our lives And I've been spending the week with you looking at these because

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,280
um our relationship with them is kind it's like the most basic way that we

10
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,680
create obstacles to the clear seeing that leads um to insight in our practice

11
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:19,439
and it's also the most basic way that we can let go of those obstacles Where do the obstacles arise

12
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,360
they arise in our minds The mind has a mind of course we know

13
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,400
has a really big job in in our life It's in charge of our relationship with all

14
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,840
the other physical senses with our relationship of what makes up our world

15
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,439
It's part of our world It interprets the world for us It guides how we interact

16
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,960
with all the situations and people that we come in contact with in our lives

17
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,159
Without it we could not uh uh function And we know this Of course that's

18
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:59,399
nothing new And we also know that the the mind's activity can get us in

19
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:05,880
trouble The kind of spinning out that the mind can do chewing on some old

20
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:12,560
grievance conceiving elaborate fantasies going down a rabbit hole of judgment and

21
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,920
blame sometimes of ourselves sometimes of others what is called papancha in the

22
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,879
texts probably a word familiar to many of you mental proliferation it's

23
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:32,360
probably the biggest source of duca the biggest source of suffering that we create for ourselves in our

24
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:40,160
lives so attending to the arising of an unhealthy attitude or of some kind of uh

25
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,560
habitual reactivity in the mind before it runs off into this proliferation this

26
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,959
flood of conceiving that can help us avoid so much dooka in our lives and

27
00:02:52,959 --> 00:03:00,800
it's something we can learn to become more skilled at to to catch the beginning of the inclination to stop the

28
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,720
thinking train before its engine gets going You know how energy builds as we

29
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:15,159
start to think about something that has you know that has emotional impact for usually it really it builds and

30
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:22,879
builds So the path of practice in Buddhism could be you know could be characterized as gradually inclining the

31
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:30,319
mind in the direction that gets us out of that trouble the onward leading direction

32
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:37,040
toward what is beautiful toward what is wholesome skillful cusala and away from

33
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:43,200
what is the opposite of those and uh you know every situation in life is made up

34
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,519
of different kinds of of sense contact Remember it is that is our world

35
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,799
So attending to how the mind reacts to different kinds of situations It's a

36
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:01,120
it's a training in learning where the onward leading direction lies It helps

37
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,159
develop the the discernment and the energy we need in order to keep moving

38
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:15,760
in that direction So today I'm going to talk about um the last of the six senses Um

39
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,840
and I and I I want to bring the mental factor of vaydana into the into the mix

40
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:28,800
because vadena accompanies every moment of sense contact that is of course every

41
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,040
moment of life It plays a big part in the arising of feeders and it plays a

42
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:41,638
really big part in how feeders can be abandoned as well

43
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:49,360
So first before I get into that let's uh let's

44
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:02,000
meditate Taking your posture adjusting if if you need

45
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:09,800
to I need to adjust a little bit myself here

46
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,360
just to find that place of uh stability you know

47
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:28,440
balance And there can be ease and uh and alertness as well

48
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:51,360
and doing a little body scan if that's helpful to you Looking for those places where

49
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,680
there's

50
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,880
tension and just uh seeing if they can ease

51
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:08,400
up soften relax a little bit

52
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,400
Maybe using the breath to assist with that

53
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,960
And then letting the breath be the the center of your attention for for a

54
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,199
little while

55
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,960
Just being receptive to the sensations of of

56
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:15,759
breathing not reaching out for them grasping at

57
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:22,080
them We will breathe And the sensations that

58
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:30,240
accompany that breathing they will they will be there They can be known

59
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,000
Just simply Okay

60
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,240
Now if you're if you're feeling relatively settled like to invite you to

61
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:29,680
just open to uh to whatever is arising um in your

62
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:36,600
experience being receptive keeping that receptive uh

63
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:43,000
attitude noticing the arising of sensations of visual images of

64
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,240
[Music] sounds whatever is

65
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,200
arising Just being uh

66
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:10,360
receptive And and we know that

67
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,800
As we said thoughts will arise and emotions will

68
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:21,720
arise A sense of an experience being pleasant or unpleasant will

69
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:28,079
arise Forms of mental activity and we can be present to those

70
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:33,639
in a receptive way as well

71
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,000
And sometimes we will get caught I'll take hold of a thought or

72
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,720
image and and start to expand on

73
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:03,640
it And then we notice and we can let go if that's easy

74
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:09,959
And if you find that difficult you know attend to how the body

75
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:17,519
is when there is thinking with some kind of urgency some kind of uh a needy

76
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:27,920
quality driving it What are the effects you feel in the

77
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:35,160
body are they pleasant are they unpleasant

78
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,959
just invite a relaxed receptive awareness You know like sitting back and

79
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:13,959
watching the stream of sensations and and mental activity that

80
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:22,639
arise This is our world This interplay of physical senses and the

81
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:35,480
mind And every time we get caught in the mental

82
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:43,120
activity takes us away from being present We can recognize that and just

83
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:54,040
see if we can let it go Noticing the effect it has on our state

84
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:03,279
So what's what's going on in the body and what's going on in the

85
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:17,320
mind what's the effect of what's going on in the mind on the body

86
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:31,760
we can just simply know know that know each of those

87
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:40,520
things Now moving into evaluating

88
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,520
analyzing judging

89
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,399
It's all natural It's

90
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:05,880
arising The unfolding of our lives

91
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:20,720
Just see if you can know it simply with

92
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:27,480
easeful energy with with kind awareness

93
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:33,760
And everyone in the world

94
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:43,520
uh has some has these five physical senses in this mind to to work with

95
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:50,080
unless they're in some way injured in one of those

96
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:58,000
areas But this is the the way we all

97
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:05,440
um make our world could perceive and conceive our world all over everywhere

98
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,440
everyone

99
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:20,320
And those of us here we can take those uh those senses those the

100
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:26,760
abilities that are associated with those senses and we can use them in a way that

101
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:34,200
uh that brings some uh goodness into the world

102
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:41,240
that brings kindness and care

103
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:49,278
friendliness wisdom a little bit of

104
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:58,559
spaciousness And I hope we will do that so that we're adding a little bit

105
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:04,240
to the goodness in the world so that all beings

106
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:10,360
may be safe All beings may be

107
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:17,120
happy All beings may be healthy And all beings may have ease in

108
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,960
their lives And all beings everywhere may be

109
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,960
free

110
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:48,720
[Music]

111
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:36,200
Thank you for your practice Thank you for the practice all this

112
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:42,799
week and welcome again And uh today is the the last day

113
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:49,039
of this brief really brief investigation of the of the six sense spheres and the

114
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:56,799
and the fetterss that can arise in relation to them Anytime there's um sense contact

115
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:02,720
any kind of sense contact there's also some kind of mental processing of that

116
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:09,039
contact And what that mental activity begins

117
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:14,640
with is something that I think we're familiar with probably an immediate

118
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:22,120
simple response experiencing the contact as either pleasant unpleasant or

119
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:29,200
neither And that response is called vana in the Buddhist texts And I would

120
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:35,600
imagine you've heard many talks about this uh very simple basic and powerful

121
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:41,320
mental response which is happening constantly in every moment of sense

122
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:46,720
contact which we know in fact is every moment of our lives unless we're

123
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:53,679
unconscious So vadna is not a fetter but it is seen

124
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:59,600
as the trigger for all the mental activity that follows that often follows

125
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:05,919
sense contact you know which includes vets The word va is you know is most

126
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:12,880
often translated into English as feeling tone feeling tone the tone of a feeling

127
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:20,080
Another translation comes from psychology and also from chemistry Veilance you know positive negative or

128
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:25,279
neutral veilance And I I kind of like that one except that positive and

129
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:34,240
negative they kind of they seem to have a little judgment uh um connotations with them And and that's

130
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,919
not what's being pointed to with with va hedonic tone That's another translation

131
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:45,760
but seems a little bit opaque to me Gil has been using the word sensation

132
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,919
lately just pleasant or unpleasant Pleasant or painful

133
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:57,120
sensation And the word vena itself the poly word vena it comes from a root that

134
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:03,679
has meanings of both sensing and knowing Kind of maybe a merging of the two in a

135
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:08,878
way So sometimes instead of pleasant and

136
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:16,079
unpleasant the words used are pleasant and painful which are you know more literally accurate because the the poly

137
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:23,118
words for these two flavors of vadena are suka which which um you're probably

138
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:30,240
remembering from Gil's talks about um samadei can mean happy contented it has

139
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:38,520
a really delightful aspect to it and duka suffering stress stress discomfort

140
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:46,480
unease So suka and duka pleasant and unpleasant pleasant and painful And

141
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,760
there are lots of complex ideas about uh this

142
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,440
this reaction response Uh Bikubodi calls it an

143
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:05,200
affective factor that is in essence very simple And the reason for all the

144
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:10,960
different ways of defining and describing it is that simple though it is it's understood to have a lot of

145
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:17,200
power in driving our thinking and our behavior It's a kind of mental activity

146
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:23,200
and it acts as a bridge between the body and the mind

147
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:28,839
So conditioned on on sensing an experience as either pleasant or

148
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:36,640
unpleasant different mental states and mental activity will arise

149
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:42,079
We hear that often if an experience is um received as either as neither

150
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:48,320
pleasant nor unpleasant then the typical response will be boredom or zoning out

151
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:53,520
And pleasant vadena of course um commonly conditions mental activity in

152
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:59,839
the in the desire realm moving towards something and unpleasant or painful vena

153
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:06,440
conditions the mental activity in some flavor of the aversive

154
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:13,200
realm We don't have conscious control over vena It will arise It's it's

155
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:18,400
natural It will arise but we don't have to obey it And that's a really important

156
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,920
point That's a kind of pivotal point in our practice are practiced with feeders

157
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:29,520
are practiced with all the kinds of mental activity that

158
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:38,079
exist So in every instance of sense contact one of these ways uh of that the

159
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:46,359
contact is felt will arise immediately What feels like simultaneously to me with the contact

160
00:36:46,359 --> 00:36:52,079
itself And if we aren't paying attention especially if the pleasantness or the

161
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:58,960
painfulness are are strong or intense that vena is likely to lead to some kind

162
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:06,880
of reactivity that is to a fetter to a knot and uh this sequence you know this

163
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:12,000
sequence is very famously laid out in the the teachings on the 12 steps of

164
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,440
dependent origination that that the very systematic description in the text of

165
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,560
how dooka arises in us The four middle

166
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:29,680
steps of the 12 in that cycle are the sense spheres sense contact vadena and

167
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:36,960
then some form of craving craving for or craving against we could say dependent

168
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:44,560
on the flavor of the of the vadena And vana is often described as the

169
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:51,160
weakest link in this chain of how uh duca arises If we notice

170
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:57,560
it and then just leave it be This is pleasant this is

171
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:02,960
unpleasant without elaborating we can stop craving and clinging in their

172
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:09,040
tracks The chain is broken and duca doesn't arise

173
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:14,880
So we can use va in the in the same way in practicing uh recognizing fetterss

174
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:22,119
When there's a sensation at one of the sense stores that we sense as pleasant we can know that this is

175
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:27,839
pleasant and it can be possible to go no further I take a piece of chocolate from

176
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:34,880
its wrapper I eat it savoring it and it's very pleasant I recognize this is

177
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:41,599
very pleasant And I stop right there before the desire for another uh piece

178
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:47,920
catches me and gets me eating I have avoided a feder arising And the same can

179
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:53,040
is you know is with unpleasant There's a kind of mental

180
00:38:53,040 --> 00:39:00,800
reactivity happening We can abandon the fetter that has arisen We hear a dog barking close by Perhaps it's kind of

181
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:06,680
loud There's unpleasant vena And then we begin to feel some judgment

182
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:12,000
arising Oh they should keep that dog indoors That dog needs to be trained And

183
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,160
if we're paying attention right there we can notice okay there's a feder rising

184
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:25,680
There's some judgment There's some ill will Notice how it feels in the body maybe And right there I don't want to

185
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:31,920
move into that mind state I prefer to be at ease We abandon the feder

186
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:37,920
And the same is uh uh with what we experience as as

187
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:45,599
pleasant You know I can take that same piece of chocolate from the wrapper I eat it It's pleasant And then my hands

188
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:51,040
start to open the wrapper again and I feel the urgency of desire to have

189
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:57,520
another piece and I stop right there I recognize the feder and I abandon it Or

190
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:06,800
maybe maybe I have another piece and before I recognize the feather or before I'm willing to abandon

191
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:17,440
it So it's possible to notice the notice the vna and not go beyond there And it's

192
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:24,400
and it's and it's possible to just begin to feel the arising of uh of what is

193
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,560
really painful and to maybe stop it right there as

194
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:35,040
well And as we practice in this way you know hopefully we can let that pleasant

195
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:42,000
or unpleasant just be known and left right there And even after the feder is known you know after there is some

196
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,640
aversion or craving present we can recognize the feder that's arisen we can

197
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:54,720
stop right there not let it get the upper hand you know not let it tie us

198
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:01,200
down keep us stuck in desire or aversion Remember the teaching from the

199
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:08,720
Buddha on the gratification the danger and the escape Part of feeling the danger of the fetterss that arise is

200
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:16,079
feeling the dooka in the feder itself Craving aversion delusion denial These

201
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:21,440
are unpleasant mental states They're dooka Becoming more and more sensitive

202
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:27,359
to the duca that is inherent in craving or aversion You know then the the

203
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:32,880
painful vena these mental states uh becomes clearer It helps us to let go of

204
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:38,720
them So va like all mental activity is of

205
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:45,200
course conditioned on past experience It isn't inherent in the experience just

206
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:50,240
like the the mental activity of a feather is not inherent in the in the

207
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:57,359
contact in the sense contact really in a sense I've been talking about va in a way all all week

208
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:03,040
long the knots that arise the fed feathers that the Buddha described all

209
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:08,720
the varieties and relatives of craving or aversion or delusion that present

210
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:14,520
themselves in relation to sense contact They're conditioned by this even more

211
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:20,440
basic immediate sense of pleasant unpleasant or

212
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:25,960
neither They are conditioned And because they are conditioned they can

213
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:31,839
change Our mind and hearts are continually being reconditioned by our

214
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:37,760
lives as we live them Conditioned by everything that we come in contact with

215
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:43,680
Practicing the dharma is one of the conditions that we bring into our lives

216
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:49,200
And practicing the dharma conditions the mind in the direction of freedom of

217
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:55,359
beauty of deep sensitivity So that our minds and hearts are are moving in the

218
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:01,480
direction of freedom of insight of peace

219
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:09,440
The teachings on va in the in the discourse on the foundations of uh of

220
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:15,520
mindfulness satipana suta they distinguish between va that is worldly

221
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:22,160
and unworldly or worldly and spiritual or as the gil has recently translated

222
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:27,520
the words as surface and deep and vana in relation to deep

223
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:35,839
experience is that that's experienced with samadei with the cultivation of beautiful qualities of heart and mind

224
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:45,599
And pleasant vadna in this context it doesn't lead to craving It leads to appreciation to gratitude to meta And un

225
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:51,359
unpleasant vna in this context is more connected with the desire for liberation

226
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:57,480
kind of a you know a kind of painful longing for what is wholesome and

227
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:02,800
free and attending to this deeper vena It can really help guide our practice in

228
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:08,160
a beautiful direction Beautiful direction But that's a whole other topic

229
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:14,160
for another time Today I've only been speaking about vayna

230
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:20,119
um associated with sense contact the the worldly variety of

231
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:26,000
vena It's something to really pay attention to It's got a lot of power in

232
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:34,800
our uh in the activities of our of our mind So u very simple and uh a key place

233
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:41,839
to look So I hope this uh this week's topic

234
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:51,040
has been has been useful to you I've really enjoyed being with you all this week Remember the Buddha's words for it

235
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:57,160
is in this fathoml long body with its perceptions and mind that I describe the

236
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:04,720
world its origin its sessation and the practice leading to its sensation

237
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:12,000
These six sense spheres the physical organs of of sensation their objects and

238
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,160
the mind with all all its myriad activities our

239
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:24,400
world And by attending very carefully to what arises in this world noticing when

240
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:29,760
what arises taking us in the direction of just of becoming a slave to comfort

241
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:36,160
and pleasure or a slave to anger resentment judgments about ourselves and

242
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:42,960
others Noticing that how we relate to what's happening is what's holding us down

243
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:49,359
keeping us from being opening open spacious wise and

244
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:56,920
caring When we attend very carefully in this way uh we don't have to obey those

245
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:03,000
inclinations When we see what is arising in our minds when we are mindful we have

246
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,119
choices Until we see we really don't have a choice our old

247
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:14,880
conditioning way back to latent tendencies will uh choose for us But the

248
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:21,280
dharma gives us choices It shows us a healthier way of relating to what's oper

249
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:27,760
operating in us A healthy way of relating to what's happening on the

250
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:34,319
outside What's happening how we relate to it The dharma dharma practice dharma

251
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:39,560
practice moves us in the direction of what is kusula what is

252
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:47,520
skillful what is kalana what is beautiful what is wise what is conducive

253
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:53,040
to growth the dharma is onward leading my

254
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:57,520
favorite words in the in the dharma

255
00:46:58,839 --> 00:47:05,839
teachings so I'll leave you with that And uh uh next week Kim Ellen will be be

256
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:13,680
with you and uh with all of us And uh I wish you uh I wish you a wise

257
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:19,440
relationship to uh all that is happening in your six sense spaces and much joy

258
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:25,880
coming out of that Thank you for being with me this week
