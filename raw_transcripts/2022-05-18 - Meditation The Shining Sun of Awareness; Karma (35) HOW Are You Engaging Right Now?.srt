[Music]

94
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,480
hello and greetings dear sangha

95
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,320
so

96
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:29,519
so karma karma karma as as action

97
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:34,559
karma's action as these three aspects of action that

98
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:39,880
we've been discussing the past couple of days the

99
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:47,200
intention around it the leading edge what is done the action of the

100
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:55,039
thought speech and body and the trailing edge what is left behind what is created what is

101
00:31:55,039 --> 00:32:04,559
what is made what is made so today i'd like to talk about um

102
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:13,000
what andrew olenski terms where the action is where the action is

103
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:22,080
so so there are um

104
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:27,799
two aspects to every moment's experience

105
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:34,399
one is the content what you're aware of it could be a sound

106
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:40,080
a thought a sensation in fact in buddhism there are

107
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:46,640
six um sense doors as you know you know they're the five senses the usual five

108
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:54,720
senses that we have with with smell and taste and touch and and hearing and seeing those

109
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:01,440
five and then the sixth sense door is the door of the mind so in any moment

110
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,880
you can choose to imagine

111
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:12,720
a beach you can bring to mind uh a

112
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:19,679
maybe a music that you love and play it in in your mind again it's a sound but you can play

113
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:26,480
it or you can um have a thought of say a happy thought or a sad thought you can

114
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:32,000
conjure it up so in the mind door everything can be chosen to be played up

115
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,679
so so there is the object there is the object of awareness there are many

116
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:43,039
objects either physical objects or or seeing hearing tasting objects of the

117
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:51,440
mind which again the mind can access all of those five objects even remembering a touch a sense of sensation you can

118
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:57,440
remember it you can recreate it in the mind or

119
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,880
which is pretty wild right it's pretty awesome being human like we can do all

120
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:09,040
this right recreating all these objects quote on objects of

121
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:16,480
knowing objects of awareness in the mind door in the sixth door

122
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,760
i thought this was pretty cool when i first learned about the sixth

123
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:27,839
mind door a sixth door sixth uh door uh in in um

124
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:32,878
or this in in buddhism whereas you know in western psychology we only have the

125
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:40,000
the five anyway so in every moment's experience there is the object of

126
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:48,480
awareness right which could be through the six cent stores the six cent stores

127
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:55,200
and then there is what our emotional response is

128
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:01,839
towards this object of awareness how we are relating to it how we are engaging with

129
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:08,079
it right so so as discussed as i just mentioned the

130
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:13,280
um objects of awareness um

131
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:20,160
they could be recreated in any moment in the my door

132
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:29,200
and and our mind body apparatus can really you know lurch around from

133
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:35,280
one object of awareness to another object of awareness

134
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:41,200
very quickly um sometimes it will sometimes seemingly

135
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:46,400
not it will right you're thinking about this and then maybe you're meditating you come back and then you're thinking

136
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:53,040
about something else and just so so these two both the object of

137
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,320
awareness and the way we relate to it the way we

138
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:05,119
relate to it our attitude or our reaction etc

139
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:13,839
it's called in in the in the buddhist psychology

140
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,320
this is called sankharas or formations this is called form rupa

141
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:27,280
the objects are called rupa with the five aggregates so those who are familiar with the teaching

142
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:33,040
of the five aggregates and if you're not don't don't be overwhelmed or scared like what five

143
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:40,400
aggregates wait a minute i'm just explaining them to you so stay with me stay with me

144
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:46,880
form is just the object of awareness and and uh also known

145
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:52,000
in pali rupa and then sankharas sankaras are the

146
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,920
aggregates is the aggregate of the way or the mental formations or also called

147
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:05,280
formations the way we relate the way we engage we react

148
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:11,680
in each moment and each moment in each moment these shift and change

149
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:18,320
even though we have this sense of permanence every moment it's a refreshing it's a refreshing because it can change every

150
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:25,440
moment right so so the sankhara is these these reactions these formations these mental

151
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:32,319
formations these the ways we react can shift and change every moment

152
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:42,000
so so what is interesting is that um

153
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:48,160
you know if we were perhaps an automaton a computer my background being in in

154
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:55,520
artificial intelligence you know just knowing just knowing an object is one thing right knowing but the sankhara is

155
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:00,720
the way we react the way we respond the way we

156
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:08,560
relate to an object in fact that's where the action is it's

157
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:15,040
that's where that is um the way we engaged within with an

158
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:21,520
object because just knowing an object oh okay all right yeah this is you know this is a pen okay this is just a pen

159
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,960
um but oh i i love this pen i don't want anyone to

160
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:33,040
take it like ah or oh i hate this pen this reminds me of blah blah blah that's a you know

161
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:40,400
difficult day the way we engage the way the sun car is the way we are responding

162
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,680
engaging with an object either physical object object of the

163
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:53,200
mind that is what shapes and forms the next moment's experience

164
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:58,800
that's how that's how we are shaped and formed

165
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:04,160
so a skillful healthy uh

166
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:09,920
way of relating to an object it shifts it forms us

167
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:16,720
into a more skillful into more a kinder a less deluded

168
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:22,160
um more equanimous person being in the next

169
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:27,680
moment so

170
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:34,400
so we could say that perhaps the harm that comes or the harm that we cause

171
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:40,640
ourselves isn't so much from the objects that we relate to again physical objects

172
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:47,359
i'm talking about the objects of the six cent stores not so much from the objects but the way

173
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:53,760
we relate to the experience the way we engage with the experience that's how

174
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,960
that's where the karma is shaped is through our experience

175
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:06,160
is how our next moment's experience is shaped and our next moments of

176
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:12,318
experience and who we become and who we are and how we show up in the world

177
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:20,079
so this is quite profound actually to see this in

178
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:27,119
buddhist psychology this teaching of karma which is this this way we engage and how

179
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:32,240
we engage that shapes and forms who we become who we are

180
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:38,240
because that's also what um western psychology and neuroscience

181
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,480
also not surprisingly

182
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:49,520
supports suggests you know it's not so much the moment's experience but but

183
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:54,800
those emotional memories those emotions that really fix

184
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:00,240
uh something in place some memory of something

185
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:05,520
becomes fixed in place because of the emotional engagement because of the

186
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:12,319
emotion that has been ignited that has come alive as we have engaged with

187
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:19,520
something that has occurred with an object in the six sense doors and you know this to be true

188
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:26,560
for your own experience maybe some moment of experience became really

189
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:33,040
etched in your memory in your heart and minds at the moment of experience in the past because

190
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:39,839
of the emotional response you had to it because of the anger you had or because of the love you

191
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:46,640
had or because of whatever happened and that really felt like a formative moment

192
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:52,720
and in fact in in um in a.i in neural networks that's called

193
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:58,480
one-shot learning when there is something so um uh

194
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:05,040
so important so so you know a pattern that's so um we give it so much weight

195
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:10,720
um that it becomes oh it's a one-shot learning is really shapes and forms

196
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:16,560
uh the shapes of the neural networks but again coming back to humans

197
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:24,640
so so the way we engage really that's where uh that's where the action is the moment

198
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:30,960
of anger becomes and and also it shapes the uh it also grows maybe a moment of

199
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:38,800
anger is a thought and then it becomes a striking blow or becomes or becomes a a um

200
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:46,960
or becomes a hurtful comment or becomes a nasty thought and then becomes an action etc etc and then they grow

201
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,760
so

202
00:42:52,640 --> 00:43:00,079
so who we are who we are and and actually andrew odensky says

203
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:05,760
this beautifully who we are and what world we inhabit

204
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:12,000
actually consists of these series of of the series of these emotional responses

205
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,599
unfolding within us

206
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:24,160
so it's actually just these series of emotional responses

207
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:30,799
is who we are and we keep conditioning them for the future

208
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:38,160
so how we hold ourselves right now in this moment how are you holding yourself

209
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:43,359
right now in this moment how are you relating

210
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:50,160
how are you relating to the contents of your experience

211
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:55,520
how are we holding ourselves in this moment

212
00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:01,520
right now is it with greed hatred delusion is it with the opposite generosity

213
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:07,359
with love and with wisdom how we hold ourselves right now right

214
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:12,640
here right here people right now is the key

215
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:21,040
to the next moment so it's not about what we engage with it's

216
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:26,240
how we engage with with the what it's the how

217
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:33,119
it's the how and that is so powerful we have so much

218
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:40,240
power to shift and change the way we engage in this moment in this moment

219
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:46,000
so then sitting on the cushion is important of course

220
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:53,839
is when we really learn and observe and and get to see our reactions with detail and yet

221
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:59,359
the whole day our entire life is our practice because every moment we

222
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:06,640
are shaping and forming our responses our reactions our karma

223
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:13,200
so time has come to an end so i wish you a full day a

224
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:21,040
beautiful a a wise a wholesome karma forming

225
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:27,760
day of practice thank you so much for being here for practicing for your own

226
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:34,960
benefit and the benefit of all beings whose lives yours touches thank you and see you

227
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:39,319
tomorrow be well
