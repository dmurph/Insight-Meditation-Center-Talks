1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:07,560
morning everyone it's great to see you all and

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:15,280
be back with you uh be together again this way morning

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,320
everyone um so uh yesterday I read you a piece of

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,720
the teaching um of that the Buddha gave his

5
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:35,719
son rahula about meditating like the Earth this is another section of that

6
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:43,879
same suta rahula meditate like space for when you

7
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:49,640
meditate like space Pleasant and unpleasant contacts

8
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:56,680
will not occupy your mind and remain just a space is not established

9
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:02,359
anywhere in the same way meditate like

10
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:09,000
space for when you meditate like space Pleasant and unpleasant contacts will

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
not occupy your mind and

12
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:21,479
remain so one way of thinking about mindfulness but awareness is like a big

13
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:27,840
Open Sky and the objects that arise in the mind are like birds or clouds floating

14
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:36,320
by like rain falling or thunder appearing or

15
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,720
lightning sometimes the sky is illuminated by the

16
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:49,360
sun sometimes by the moon or stars all the objects of mind just come

17
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:56,159
and go in that space we can think of awareness like the

18
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,840
vast space in which every one of these objects of Mind occur

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,640
like our Body Sensations that come from the five external

20
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:16,040
senses what we see hear taste smell and

21
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:23,040
touch but we might feel from the internal senses pressure

22
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:30,239
warmth pain position balance all our thoughts and memories

23
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,440
feelings and emotions all our

24
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,319
reactions they all occur within this field of

25
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,720
awareness the key is to allow all objects to come and go to be seen

26
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,920
clearly when they arise but without holding on to them without trying to

27
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,480
keep them or fix them or without pushing them

28
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,760
away it's simp simple way of seeing it as aun Sumo

29
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:10,840
said the spacious mind has room for everything it's like the space in this

30
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,319
room which is never harmed by what comes in and out of the

31
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,840
room so let's

32
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:27,040
sit so taking a comfortable and alert

33
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,760
posture and gently closing your eyes

34
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:41,159
settling into your meditation posture allowing yourself to be centered

35
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,599
on your

36
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,120
body allowing the attention to meander throughout the

37
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,480
body relaxing any tensions that can be relaxed

38
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:08,799
relaxing the face the shoulders the

39
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:14,640
belly whatever tensions you might find whatever

40
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:21,199
Holdings see if they can be relaxed if not you can just soften

41
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,680
around

42
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:37,440
them just connecting intimately with that body relaxing the body

43
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,800
and from within the body you might be aware become aware of your

44
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,600
breathing in the Simplicity of this moment this inhale

45
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:38,160
Hal this exhale knowing you're breathing

46
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,280
in knowing you're breathing

47
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,800
out you might take a few long slow deep

48
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:59,638
breaths and with each inhale connecting more intimately with the moment

49
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:08,400
and with each exhale relaxing a little more deeply into the

50
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:15,960
moment Letting Go settling in

51
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,880
then allowing your breath to return to

52
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:54,319
normal staying close to the breath staying

53
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,560
simple e

54
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:47,960
nothing is needed just here in this

55
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:53,319
body breathing in and breathing

56
00:07:53,440 --> 00:08:02,000
out like a tree with deep roots the branches reaching into the blue Open

57
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,960
Sky allowing The Winds of thoughts emotions Sensations to come and

58
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:17,120
go breathing in and breathing out

59
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:51,040
you can become aware of any sense of space of Stillness in the midst of the

60
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,800
movements of the breath any sense of ease well-being and

61
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:04,079
the Stillness like the clear Open Sky undisturbed by

62
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:08,560
any clouds that drift by

63
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:48,839
resting in a moment allowing whatever appears to

64
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:56,000
disappear just seeing it clearly not adding anything to

65
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,320
it no need to complicate it with IDE or stories about

66
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:16,240
it see if you can be a quanus to whatever

67
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,120
arises not being for or against

68
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,079
it if thoughts arise allow them to be in the background

69
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:41,040
they're not a problem no need to push them away no need to add to them or build on

70
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,800
them just simple thinking in the

71
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,040
background no matter how important it seems it's just a thought that comes and

72
00:10:53,040 --> 00:11:00,519
goes if we don't feed it no matter how complex

73
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:07,200
or or deep or emotion star we can allow them to be

74
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:14,639
simple no need to figure it out but allow each emotion to be simple

75
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:17,560
to come and

76
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:29,160
go just knowing what's here what's obvious

77
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:36,760
no need to chase anything just resting in the moment of

78
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
awareness

79
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160

80
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120

81

e e

92
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,480
if the attention has drifted you can notice

93
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:40,159
it and gently escort it back to the breath welcome at

94
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:48,279
home just returning to the rhythm of breathing in and breathing

95
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
out

96
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640

110
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:31,159
e e

111
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:14,640
I'll ring the bell in a moment when I do might take a couple of

112
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:20,480
slow deep breaths again before opening your eyes

113
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:53,570
[Music]

114
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:28,240
so this morning I'll continue with the theme of knowing and not knowing

115
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:34,840
and reflecting particularly on clear knowing or clear

116
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:41,960
comprehension an infant can be fascinated by the flame of a gas stove

117
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:47,200
and climb up on a chair and burn their hand they can be very present with the

118
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:54,440
flame very aware of the pretty colors but they don't yet have the context that

119
00:29:54,440 --> 00:30:02,159
it's not wise thing to do to stick your hand in a flame this Fuller context is what we call

120
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:09,320
clear knowing or clear comprehension clear comprehension

121
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:16,919
broadens the simple observation of mindfulness into understanding the Fuller context of the

122
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:23,559
moment if we're meditating and maybe we notice our head is feeling warm you know

123
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:30,080
hope warmer warm and much warmer it clear knowing that realizes or hears

124
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:38,159
some fire and we better put it out if um we act towards act out towards

125
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:43,519
someone in Anger yelling at them mindfulness might recognize yelling

126
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:49,679
yelling uh or anger but clear comprehension makes it obvious that it's

127
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:55,279
not in accord with their intentions of equinity and

128
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:04,159
compassion so additionally there are four aspects of clear comprehension that I'll mention you don't have to remember

129
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:09,880
all four but maybe some of them will particularly resonate with

130
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:16,080
you these four aspects of clear comprehension um can apply both to a

131
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:24,519
formal sitting or formal meditation but also to mindfulness in daily life in all aspects of our life

132
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:30,519
it's the same mind that gets caught in meditation or gets caught in the ins and

133
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:36,760
outs of her days so the first one is uh clear

134
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:44,159
comprehension of purpose it ask the question why are we doing what we're

135
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:50,559
doing and for instance in meditation you know we might be seduced into a fantasy

136
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:58,200
and it's a really juicy fantasy and we kind of become aware of it but we don't want to pull away we're enjoying it and

137
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:04,320
clear comprehension recognizes that it's not the purpose of training the mind in

138
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:10,760
meditation to sit here um massaging this

139
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:17,120
fantasy so in daily life maybe our long-term purpose is to be liberated to

140
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:24,159
be free um to open our hearts but our actions may not support a

141
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:29,840
purpose uh for instance these days many many people find themselves regularly

142
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:36,679
Doom scrolling uh unhelpfully in our devices and doom scrolling is when we

143
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:44,320
just go from one piece of news to another even though you may have um already spent half an hour doing

144
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:50,120
it uh or more um you know maybe our purpose is

145
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:56,679
opening the heart and kindness and compassion and yet we find ourselves caught in gossiping about people in a

146
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:03,320
disrespectful way so it can be helpful to take time

147
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:09,360
periodically to reflect on our long-term purpose to use the intelligence of the

148
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:16,559
mind to clearly reflect on our deepest aspirations why are we on the path

149
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:23,240
keeping it close to our lives I often find it helpful to connect

150
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:28,320
with this daily at the beginning of each formal meditation period

151
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:37,440
to remind myself to use it as a reference point in my life are my actions aligned with this

152
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:47,320
purpose really becomes um clear you know if for deepest desperations to be at

153
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:55,360
peace and we're trying to convince someone else of our point of view um and the contractions around that

154
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:00,480
convincing that all that energy of clinging it's not aligned with her

155
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:07,279
deepest aspirations it's not that we don't express our points of view but it's do a

156
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:14,839
hard contract when we do when we're agitated clinging to a

157
00:34:14,839 --> 00:34:20,839
point of view there's no communication going on and recognizing when that happens

158
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:27,358
that this is duka this is suffering and that this process is not

159
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:33,440
alive with intention of being at peace and maybe can allow something

160
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:42,079
within us to relax then the second um clear

161
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:47,480
comprehension aspect is suitability or what do we need to do to

162
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:54,320
accomplish our purpose and even if it's a wise action is it appropriate at this

163
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:00,119
time you know for instance in in a situ ation daily life maybe you need to give

164
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:05,320
constructive criticism to someone um but maybe you don't do it

165
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:13,000
when they just told you their dog died I like to consider what's practical

166
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,280
what are we actually likely to do so in relation to

167
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:23,320
practice um I had a student that was really struggling hard to establish a

168
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:31,240
daily practice he had the idea that meditation happened in the morning sitting in his meditation spot but when

169
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:39,359
he started meditating he didn't have children now he had two very young children at home and time and time again

170
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:47,119
things came up from lack of sleep family needs um and he'd only manage occasional

171
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:53,560
meditation and so we explored what might work for him you know he said he saw that he had

172
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:58,960
to let go of the ideal of sitting in this beautiful meditation area each

173
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:04,200
morning he developed a strong steady practice eventually by meditating at

174
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:09,800
work in his office he was much more easily able to carve out the time there

175
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:17,319
and not be interrupted another of my students found that the best time was to sit in her car

176
00:36:17,319 --> 00:36:23,000
drink her lunch break you know the other things we can

177
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:29,480
do that um in this area is we can set the bar too high um which can sabotage

178
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:36,680
us what's practical what stretches us just a little bit just a little past the

179
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:43,319
edge of our comfort zone where we can grow and some of us said the bar too low

180
00:36:43,319 --> 00:36:49,280
with procrastination so what's practical here how do we move from

181
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:57,000
procrastination to doing a little bit of something a little bit of sitting a little bit

182
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:08,760
and um the third of the clear comprehensions and you know each one of these we could spend the entire time

183
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:17,520
talking about every one of them but I wanted to touch the different areas just a little bit just to stir something in

184
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:26,200
you um so the third one is the domain of practice you know where do we place our

185
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:32,200
energy where do we place our effort in our lives where do we place our

186
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:38,920
time in our daily lives we might ask ourselves where do we get our nourishment to carry out our higher

187
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:47,520
purposes in life if a larger purpose in life is freedom Compassion or peace um do we get

188
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:54,400
nurtured by watching the news um and we see clearly the difference between being

189
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:00,960
informed and the compulsive quality of going for from one thing to another on the

190
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,359
internet you most of us have heard the term monkey mind with the mind just goes

191
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:14,880
from one thing like one thing to another like monkeys jumping from one branch to

192
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:20,319
another maybe instead of the internet we should call it the monkey

193
00:38:20,319 --> 00:38:25,480
net um you know maybe calling a good friend might be more

194
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:32,160
nourishing or going for walk talk or just sitting to

195
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:40,480
meditate and the fourth um uh form of

196
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:49,400
clear comprehension is non delusion this asks how the question how

197
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:54,720
how do we view or experience do we view it from the eyes

198
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:59,440
of attachment or do we view it from the eyes of Dharma

199
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:07,200
for instance um being upset because my computer died the day after the warranty

200
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:14,800
expired would this still be a big deal in my deathbed or maybe we could imagine if

201
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,559
the Buddha had a computer how would the Buddha view

202
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:30,519
it we don't have to take the behaviors of others personally that's a form of non-

203
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:36,640
delusion thinking that their point of view their behaviors are about

204
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:42,680
me and just about their conditions their

205
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:52,240
process in meditation it involves non delusion is

206
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:58,240
opening to the moment just the way it is even if we don't see it clearly

207
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:05,720
you know maybe what we see is confusion but just opening it and ah this is what's here confusion oh this is

208
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:11,040
what here an uncomfortable sensation opening it to just the way it

209
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:18,960
is not the way we want it as we bring mindfulness more deeply

210
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,359
into our daily lives maybe we notice clinging once we're well into the middle

211
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:29,599
of an argument or we find ourselves clinging to a point of view we can

212
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:38,760
recognize it and step back from it that moment of recognition is a moment of non

213
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:47,359
delusion and a moment of Freedom each time we clearly see or

214
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:54,359
clinging and see the suffering it's causing us we can incline to let it go

215
00:40:54,359 --> 00:41:01,400
to see the release of it and we weaken These Chains to bind

216
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:10,200
us the clearly knowing allows us to understand or experience more

217
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:17,760
fully what's needed at the moment but it doesn't mean complicating or experience

218
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:24,640
anymore so hold these categories Loosely it just means seeing clearly if we've

219
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:31,800
complicated our experience which often tend to do with our thinking and ideas

220
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:38,720
what are we adding here that's not helpful and if we find ourselves in

221
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:46,240
moments of feeling disconnected in our lives or cut up in unhelpful ways in the events of Our Lives or events of the

222
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:53,480
world we can view any situation Through The Eyes of the Dharma Through The Eyes of

223
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:59,000
practice Through The Eyes of non clinging

224
00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:11,839
so tomorrow I'll continue the topic with the focus on not

225
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:17,040
knowing today knowing clearly and not knowing and the two complement each

226
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:24,960
other beautifully so may the benefits of her practice

227
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:32,680
together spread out to all corners of the world may all beings be

228
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:39,359
happy may all beings be peaceful and may all beings be

229
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:43,599
free thank you
