1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:15,599
so good morning a good day and welcome to

2
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:22,800
the insight meditation center as a location that is spread around the globe

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:31,599
and so i'm wonderful to be here

4
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,000
and

5
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:45,920
one of the wonderful wonderous experiences that some of us can have is

6
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:53,199
have the occasion to be in a natural environment that brings us a sense of wonder

7
00:00:53,199 --> 00:01:00,399
sometimes it's looking into the night sky and the stars and maybe the full moon and maybe it's

8
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:08,479
looking at a sunset or a sunrise if we're up early maybe it's a particular tree that uh

9
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:15,438
maybe it's leafed out in springtime and it just seems so wondrous and fresh and alive

10
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,439
maybe it's the weather that's something about it even sometimes

11
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:27,840
with great storms it's a kind of a wondrous show of the natural world

12
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:35,438
and it's easy to be distracted from that it's easy to

13
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,159
to be involved in our preoccupations our concerns and some of them are quite important and

14
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,439
of course we're concerned and i saw on the chat i forget the exact

15
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,600
name i apologize for someone who said their son is in surgery and janelle

16
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,960
and i wish your son well and you well and of course you're concerned about your son

17
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:09,200
and in some ways uh it's as natural as the weather and the sunset the sunrise and

18
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:16,720
leafing out of a tree and of course this is what a parent would thoughts and concerns and

19
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:23,120
heart would be about in a situation like that and it itself is a natural phenomenon

20
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,800
but we get sometimes kind of pulled into it and maybe naturally so

21
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,160
that as well but then we don't necessarily see the naturalness of it

22
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:42,160
the the amazing working of the natural world that um has been going on for

23
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:49,200
you know long before there are human beings on this planet and to you know most of you know most of

24
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:57,680
what we who we are is the product of amazing uh shaping of the by the environment and

25
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,959
um of this planet that as it evolved as well

26
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:10,159
all amazing and to sit in this amazement or this wonder

27
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:17,440
or to sit in a sense of the naturalness of it all that rather than seeing things as good

28
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,720
or bad or pure impure or

29
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:30,159
you know or special versus everything else which is not special conceit of me being better and worse

30
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:37,519
than anything there's something about sitting in meditation and appreciating the naturalness of it

31
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:43,040
all naturalness of our thoughts and our feelings our body

32
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:52,000
breathing that can be quite profound and quite liberating just here

33
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,920
and so there's a tendency there's a orientation in buddhist early buddhist meditation and to this

34
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:04,400
day to really see this body as a natural phenomenon

35
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,239
and to see below the layers that we tend to be preoccupied by

36
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:16,079
the layers of our hair you know and how many of us can write a biography

37
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,079
autobiography of our hair all the different ways our hair has been over a lifetime and concerns with it

38
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:29,840
and expenses that we spent around here and you know and

39
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:36,880
and um concerns with it or our skin

40
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:44,320
such a painful and kind of consuming concern of human beings unfortunately in

41
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:51,919
beauty and thing all kinds of things racism the teeth and the eyes and all kinds of

42
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:57,440
you know things that make us self-conscious

43
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,560
but then to see the naturalness of it dropping deeper deeper into the body and greater

44
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,240
intimacy here in this body and the more intimate we become

45
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:16,080
the more we tend to not be not see it or feel it so much in terms of me myself and mine and

46
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,880
self-conscious ways but perhaps it becomes more of a place of naturalness

47
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,800
where there's a freedom from the limited view of self and me and

48
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:37,199
what's in it for me or how it is but rather this naturalness that we are a continuation

49
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,320
of unfolding and evolution of all this

50
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:49,600
millions of years on this planet so to sit this way part of mindfulness

51
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:56,240
of the body this kind of intimacy so to

52
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,960
maybe with the naturalness of this wonderful connection between the mind

53
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:10,319
and the body with our mind we can enter the body with attention

54
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:18,080
and make adjustments in the posture to make our body more suitable

55
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:24,080
for being present and here alert

56
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:35,680
amazing that this connection between the mind and the body is here

57
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:42,560
an amazing natural thing that we can awaken awareness in the body we can

58
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:50,479
direct awareness into the body and to do so and appreciate this body

59
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:56,000
that's breathing a rhythm of breathing that's as natural

60
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,840
as the rhythm of the waves lapping up and down across the sandy shore

61
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,880
and to be aware of this rhythm of breathing

62
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:25,759
a rhythm we we share with so many breathing animals

63
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,840
it's just a naturalness of it all

64
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:39,680
and if you are self-conscious it's possible to step away from

65
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,840
it and recognize that too is a natural thing

66
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:53,120
we're built to have this capacity and the environment sometimes

67
00:07:53,120 --> 00:08:00,319
evokes it but still stepping back and

68
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,599
appreciating the simplicity and naturalness of it all

69
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,960
taking a few long slow deep breaths

70
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:19,919
and those deep inhales feeling and sensing intimacy with

71
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:27,840
more of your body here now

72
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:43,120
and letting the breathing return to normal and perhaps there's a way that the

73
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,120
experience of the body breathing

74
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:56,320
can pull you into an intimacy with the naturalness of this body

75
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:03,839
intimacy where we trust the body itself to breathe

76
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,839
for the heart to beat for the blood to flow

77
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:23,760
relaxing into this body relaxing the face the shoulders and

78
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,160
belly

79
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,880
and becoming aware of how the body experiences itself

80
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:55,680
then wherever it feels most grounding and settling for you into the body maybe supports a quieting

81
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:05,839
of the mind let your intimacy of attention be in that part of the body

82
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:20,399
and breathe maybe with that part of the body through that part

83
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:40,880
and perhaps the naturalness of the body of breathing sensing through the body

84
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:52,800
can support you and help you to let go of thinking or quiet your thinking

85
00:10:52,800 --> 00:11:01,839
so there's more space and allowance and trusting

86
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:15,839
of the body's awareness of itself the body's awareness of breathing

87
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:29,839
deep appreciation the naturalness

88
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:38,640
we are one more expression of the vast world of nature that we live

89
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,839
in we're part of

90
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,840
as we come to the end of this meditation

91
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:01,520
it's possible to consider that in this body of ours

92
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:12,000
flows our life flows our lived life

93
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:21,120
flows what animates us and motivates us

94
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:27,200
and that at any given moment this river of life within us

95
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:36,480
can take one of three tributaries or one of three different forks in the

96
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:45,760
in the river and if we flow through life blindly

97
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:52,000
then we take the fork maybe that has the strongest current

98
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:03,600
but if we are attentive and aware see

99
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:10,000
perhaps we can naturally easily of course

100
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:16,000
take the river that's most beneficial

101
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,919
most nourishing or supportive

102
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:30,720
one river is that that

103
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,840
has in it

104
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:45,840
degrees of hostility or greed conversion clinging

105
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,158
and now there is one that's just neutral about everything

106
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:01,039
no greed no hostility no aversion no attachment just okay everything's

107
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:07,200
just kind of allowed to go in uninterested way

108
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:16,640
and the third stream natural stream lives in us as well

109
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:24,799
is that of good will love kindness

110
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,640
a simple ordinary natural caringness for the welfare and happiness

111
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:36,960
of ourselves and of others a tenderness of

112
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:45,919
caring and if you can see these three streams

113
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:52,640
inside of you maybe you don't have to be pulled by the

114
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,840
strongest current

115
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,200
but you can allow yourself to float in the current

116
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:09,840
of kindness and love and care generosity

117
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,200
the wholesome current

118
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:27,120
and if that is at all available as the end of the sitting even as a hint intimation of that

119
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:33,200
wholesome river you might end this sitting with words of

120
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:39,200
dedication words of aspiration

121
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,480
that this meditation

122
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:55,039
supports the wholesome and the desire to for the welfare and

123
00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:03,120
happiness of all beings may all beings be happy

124
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,600
may all beings be safe

125
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:19,840
may all beings be peaceful and may all beings everywhere be free

126
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:47,840
thank you

127
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,840
um

128
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:10,559
so continuing with the discussion of the

129
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:15,840
exercises or the practices related to mindfulness of the body

130
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:21,360
as discussed in the discourse sometimes called the discourse on the four foundations of

131
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:30,320
mindfulness this for establishments of mindfulness and the next one is um

132
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:39,279
has a uh analogy or a simile for it or a um

133
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:45,279
an example of something that is evocative of what were what we're practicing here and

134
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:50,559
orientation for a particular practice on mindfulness of the body

135
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:55,600
and um and so i'm going to read you that

136
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:02,000
simile example that one practices what we're going to

137
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,079
talk about later just as though there was a bag

138
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:13,520
with an opening on both ends i don't know what that means but you know certainly

139
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:19,200
makes me think of the human body which has these two openings things come in and things come out these two openings

140
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:25,040
so i don't know if it's evocative of that or whether it's just a kind of bag that they used to have in the

141
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:30,638
ancient world just as though there were a bag with an

142
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:36,960
opening in both ends full of many sorts of grain

143
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:45,358
such as hill rice red rice beans peas millet and white rice

144
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:52,158
a person with good eyes were to open it and review it thus look upon it in this

145
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:58,720
way this is hill rice this is red rice

146
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:04,800
these are beans these are peas this is millet and this is white rice

147
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:12,560
so i've seen bags and bowls of mixed beans and

148
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:19,920
you know red beans and pinto beans and white beans and all kinds of beautiful beans

149
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,839
and there's a kind of dry beans usually and there's a kind of beauty to it or

150
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:31,680
kind of simplicity to it and it's kind of a delight and sometimes i've been put my hands through them and

151
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:37,440
kind of just let the hand and they just walk kind of roll off my hands and just appreciating

152
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,880
and sometimes that each different kind of being stands out and highlight you know if you look at it you can see

153
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:49,200
it each distinctly and you can also see the collection and all the different modelly

154
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,400
of colors and shapes that are there so this uh

155
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:00,079
image here of this bag full of different kinds of rice different colored rice different kinds of beans

156
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:06,800
millet all these things there's clarity you can see each one but there's a a collection of

157
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,800
different things that we're seeing there and kind of a kind of a specialness and seeing of it all and

158
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:19,680
and maybe also kind of an amazement that this natural world produces this wide

159
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:28,079
range of different seeds that that become human food and and that they dry nicely

160
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:33,599
and store and and are available to cook at a later time and to

161
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:40,000
feed us and and um and uh and people who are you know close

162
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:46,480
to the land working land farmers um you know see the seeds also as seeds that can be planted for next

163
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:51,760
year's crop and then amazement of you know built into these seeds is

164
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:58,480
or kind of is this sense of this a capacity to um to sprout and grow and develop

165
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:04,000
into plants into flowers into more seeds and this cycle that continues

166
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,680
naturally and easily and probably for most of us if we looked

167
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:16,560
at this bag of different things you know you might have our preferences of which to eat but uh maybe you know just seeing it it

168
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:21,839
doesn't lend itself to um you know too much of a greed or

169
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:29,119
attachment or an aversion to any particular seed um the um unless maybe we're allergic to

170
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:34,400
some of it but but um you know it's just um there's a kind of

171
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:40,240
marvel and naturalness and ease a beauty of sorts there but it also is not something we easily

172
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:45,760
get attached to or the seeing of it then

173
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:51,200
and it isn't that we start looking at the different seeds and say well that one's a

174
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:57,119
that one's really a superior seed that's a more beautiful seed oh that's a terrible seed you know how

175
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:03,119
could nature make a seed with that kind of that kind of shape and color and

176
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:09,280
and but it was kind of like everything is kind of seen in this natural way this is how it is

177
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:15,119
and there's a kind of maybe an appreciation maybe a kind of marvel and at it but

178
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:22,000
also not a lot of pull to be attached or a lot of pull to to be aversive to it in any kind of way

179
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:29,119
so the naturalness of it but the you know so that's how i see this simile that uh

180
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:37,599
when the text says just as this and then the exercise itself is to

181
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:44,720
rev the translation is to review it can mean to visualize for oneself

182
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,760
or to bring to mind for oneself as maybe sitting in meditation

183
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:55,520
uh 31 parts of the body and this 31 parts of the body that

184
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:00,880
sometimes there's 32 if we add another piece

185
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:08,480
the brain is not included so some people add the brain and have 32 parts is a classic and still to this day a

186
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:14,480
regular meditation practice taught in in in southeast asian buddhism and

187
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:20,880
theravadan buddhism i've known people that when they get ordained as a monastic this is the first meditation practice

188
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:26,240
they're taught and so it takes memorizing these 31 32

189
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:31,520
parts of the body and so just the fact that you're memorized and can recite them and

190
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:37,119
and then review them visualize them for yourself requires concentration and focus

191
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:42,640
that um that maybe it's a kind of an exercise of memorization and focus

192
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:48,240
that's easier than something like breathing where you don't have to memorize that you're breathing and it doesn't require

193
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:55,280
this higher order attention or functioning of the mind to stay focused as memorization does and so it's a way

194
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:02,320
of training the mind to be present and it's present for them for something that's very important for human beings

195
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:08,240
and central to who we are our body and um and to be aware of these

196
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:13,520
different parts of the body with the same naturalness and and i

197
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:19,280
don't know if detachment non-attachment is the right language but the

198
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:24,480
absence of attachment absence of aversion but a marvel and just watching the

199
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:30,079
naturalness of these beings and seeds same thing just being with the body that way

200
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:37,119
and this for some of us human beings is a radically different way to relate to our body

201
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:45,359
uh human beings maybe because of social conditioning maybe because it's built into our almost our dna to

202
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:52,880
do this are very concerned about our attractiveness and our non-attractiveness and and

203
00:40:52,880 --> 00:41:00,560
we spend an ordinary amount of time some people with caring for that and some people spend a lot of money uh

204
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:06,160
concerned with their physicality and how they look some people spend an ordinary amount of time being

205
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:12,400
critical embarrassed or shamed for some part of their body and how they are and there's a kind of a higher order

206
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:17,599
self-consciousness and evaluation that a lot of it's learned from our society

207
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:22,640
you know there are trends social trends and what kind of body types are

208
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:29,520
considered attractive or appropriate or not appropriate or something like that and then we buy into these social

209
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:35,440
constructs and ideas and and there's a tremendous amount of pain that goes along with it

210
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:41,599
and and distress around you know this completely natural thing like we don't

211
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:47,680
see the beans being upset about being a certain kind of seed certain kind of shape is different shape they're just

212
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:53,200
they're they're allowed to be who they are the trees around have all kinds of same species

213
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:59,359
tree kind of all kinds of different shapes and generally we don't look and say you know that's a not appropriate shape to have

214
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:06,319
that brand shouldn't be coming out in that angle it's just like all part of the natural world so

215
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:12,560
so how to shift our attention from this more complicated socially conditioned

216
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:18,079
way to be concerned our body kind of from a kind of an image based

217
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:24,560
you know external image and how would we project ourselves into others to a very different way of being with a

218
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:30,240
body i think it's uh where we're not inclined to look at ourselves or

219
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:36,480
others as in physical terms as being better or worse than anyone uh there's

220
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:42,480
no hierarchy no uh judgments of people just oh this is also you see it in a kind of

221
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,520
naturalness and ease of all the different ways it can be

222
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:54,160
and so this exercise begins with the four or five of the external things that

223
00:42:54,160 --> 00:43:00,319
we human beings tend to be most concerned with and maybe when they start getting a teenager

224
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:08,160
or you know that's when this self-consciousness around looks becomes more and more market sometimes earlier sometimes later

225
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,520
depending on the social situations we're in and what is valued and

226
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:21,920
all this and so so the text goes like this

227
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:29,520
a practitioner reviews or visualizes considers this body

228
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:35,119
from the soles of the feet a body up from the soles of the feet

229
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:41,440
down to the down from the here the top of the hair so anyway considers his whole body in both

230
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,400
directions kind of reviews it visualizes it

231
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:56,960
in this way in this body there are head ears body hairs

232
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:02,640
nails teeth and skin how many of you have been preoccupied

233
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:09,599
with those things maybe you've been spending a lot of money to adjust them and fix them so they're this way or that way or

234
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:16,400
or upset and embarrassed or ashamed or shy about you know this and you know our society

235
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:23,359
creates a tremendous amount of suffering and imposes it we project concerns like just this skin color for example i mean it's

236
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:28,400
heartbreaking what we do around this

237
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:35,280
and but here just being reviewed visualized considered like we would look

238
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:41,200
at this bag of beans just not negative not positive but

239
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:47,119
but maybe a dry bag of seeds the seeds themselves

240
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:53,040
because they're dried are unappetizing and so

241
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:59,119
not not ready for us they're just there but they have their value and importance

242
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:05,440
so it starts with these external then it gets more and more deeper inside maybe the first two places which we're

243
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,640
kind of neutral about um imagine the ancient world people didn't have a really clear sense of what

244
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:16,160
these organs were these things were so then it goes on

245
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:23,040
flesh sinews bones bone marrow kidneys

246
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:30,319
heart liver diaphragm spleen lungs intestines mesentery

247
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:35,839
so these are all you know if any of you have ever had a chance to look inside of the human body

248
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:41,520
i've done that going to cadaver labs and there can be kind of an amazing

249
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:50,000
beauty to it all or but also it's not a beauty that's exactly attractive or or aversive it's kind of like just

250
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,280
wow it's like looking into the grand canyon and wow that's quite something it's a

251
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:02,560
natural marvel to see it then it goes on to things that maybe

252
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:09,359
some of us you know would consider a little bit unclean unattractive maybe a little bit repulsive repulsed

253
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:16,079
even so it goes from what we would maybe be attracted to or maybe to what we may be most

254
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:23,680
commonly repulsed by some of us the contents of the stomach feces

255
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:30,560
bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears

256
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:38,720
grease spittle snot oil of the joints and urine

257
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:43,920
so in some ways what what way can we look at all these different parts of the

258
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:51,599
body equally what stands what approach can we

259
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:59,200
visualize get focused review step by step to get concentrated have the mind become still and they free

260
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:06,640
the mind from its reactivity for or against these different parts of the body

261
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:13,760
to the degree to which the body is a preoccupation our own body other people's bodies our preoccupation

262
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:19,359
for lust and whatever we might have is there some way the appropriate and

263
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:25,680
freeing way beneficial way to see all these different parts of the body

264
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:30,720
the ones that we're attracted to the ones were repulsed by or not

265
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:38,240
and to find a a an equality to dwell a place of maybe i

266
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:44,800
don't know if neutrality is the right word it seems maybe too passive but um maybe a kind of

267
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:50,559
appreciation with no attachment and no aversion

268
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:55,839
just oh it's the naturalness of it that frees us from the social conditioning

269
00:47:55,839 --> 00:48:03,920
frees us from the self-consciousness frees us from the preoccupation settles us and allows us to be settled

270
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:11,760
and intimately connected to this amazing naturalness this natural wonder marvel

271
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:19,520
of who we are and physically free of attachment and aversion

272
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:27,359
if we go inside and feel our body from the inside out that's what the body really appreciates

273
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:33,200
i think our body appreciates that best just being allowed to be the body

274
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:38,240
without the overlay of all the projections and

275
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:43,920
values and and ideas that the mind lays on top of it

276
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:51,760
to allow the naturalness and maybe the natural beauty of who we are be that which radiates from the inside

277
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:57,040
out freeing ourselves from the particular

278
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:02,400
constructs of a particular society and times that we're part of

279
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:09,680
and that way our body our hearts from the inside out will sing

280
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:17,839
we'll just sing and be it's play it song of its own naturalness and be free

281
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:26,559
so um thank you and then we'll continue this series

282
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:31,839
tomorrow thank you very much
