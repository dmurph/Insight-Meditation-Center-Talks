1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:07,400
good morning everyone and welcome and uh ended up on the

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:13,040
schedule for today kind of late just yesterday afternoon I think some of you

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,240
might be here expecting tens and chokey she'll uh there was a I made a

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:28,240
scheduling mistake and she'll come on the 16th and if you don't know her she's a wonderful uh former totha nun um she's

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,920
uh I've known her for 30 years and uh she

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,520
um uh is before she was a a nun she was deeply involved with an agency in Santa

7
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:46,280
Cruz uh working with a County Legal Services and neighborhoods with conflict

8
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:52,199
resolution training people in conflict resolution and she's a master at this kind of wonderful art that's so

9
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:59,079
important for us all and then uh she did lots of serious practices at thebet and N I think she

10
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:04,320
did two of the three threeyear Retreats that they do and uh kind of solitary

11
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:11,400
Retreats and she kind of did a lot of uh uh practice and study with compassion so

12
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:21,520
between conflict resolution and compassion you're you're not going to go wrong she's a she's a really so so um

13
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,520
little bit sorry she's not here for you today but she'll be here in two

14
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:35,439
weeks and um and I'll be at the IRC this next week

15
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:41,159
and then the following Sunday is my son's graduation from college so um so

16
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:49,880
then I'll be back the following week on the 23rd and I want to mention that because um I pretty sure I'm going to have a

17
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:55,040
special meeting after the Dharma talk that day maybe both on maybe on zoom and

18
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,159
on uh here live for people who want to come to it um we were approached a few

19
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:07,360
weeks ago by the leadership at Hidden Villa for those of you who don't know

20
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:13,840
Hidden Villa it's a nature preserve and farm uh in the middle of Silicon Valley

21
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,640
kind of it's up against the mouth Los elos Hills there and uh of el el

22
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,480
Monon behind the Community College that's there going back up into the hills beautiful place to go visit and

23
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:34,640
hike and and before we had our own Retreat Center we did uh Retreats there for 10 years some sometimes as many as

24
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,760
five a year and and um it was just a fantastic place to do

25
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,959
Retreats they have a hostel there so we were approached by the leadership uh

26
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:51,760
there interest in having IMC back there um and uh maybe a partnership with us of

27
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:58,200
sorts so we could have regular use of the Hostile again and um and it comes at the same

28
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,720
time that we've been uh uh kind of a little bit exploding the

29
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:10,200
retreat center and offering Retreats and that the retreat center is fullly scheduled but now we started to offer

30
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,360
Retreats else elsewhere we're called the off-site Retreats renting facilities and

31
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,480
we now have um you 15 PE 14 people I think in our teacher training it's less

32
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,879
than a year left foury year program and we have seven teachers already so we

33
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:32,720
have like 21 teachers able teach Retreats so that's also an

34
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:40,920
explosion and so now suddenly to be offered Hidden Villa as a place where we can do more Retreats is a wonderful gift

35
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:47,360
and uh we haven't worked out all the details but uh there's a long history as I said with hidden villa in many many

36
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,439
ways it's a kind of part of our kind of peninsula family or something of

37
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,519
connections and um but the the real challenge for us biggest challenge of us

38
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:05,079
to be able to do that is um we do everything on a volunteer basis you know everything's offered freely and

39
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:11,640
volunteers and uh all the things we do already we our volunteer base is fairly

40
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:17,440
thin and so to imagine having more volunteers to put on

41
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,759
Retreats at Hidden Villas right you know it's the imagination has a hard time

42
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:29,440
seeing it and it's very important when we do things that we try to do it without any stress that's kind of like our calling

43
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:36,759
card otherwise it all volunteers it doesn't really work so um so I I I thought of having a

44
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:43,440
meeting that day for people who are interested in what we're doing there hiddenville of the option there and and

45
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:50,520
um to talk about the volunteering people are maybe some of you have been there before and uh done Retreats there and

46
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,600
some of you have volunteered there before we did before did Retreats and so

47
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,000
some of them don't necessarily come to IMC anymore they're kind of in the Woodwork they they're on behind the

48
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,240
camera up there um and uh watching on YouTube and things like that so uh we

49
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:13,600
thought we'd have a meeting and see who would come to a a meeting like that to talk about the that possibility and how

50
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,800
to manage to put to put it on before we go back to Hidden Villa and kind of

51
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,680
continue the discussions with them and just explore what that partnership might be like so I thought maybe at 11:30 and

52
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,800
the 23rd we could do that so so we'll announce again I'll put it on the

53
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,080
calendar and on the website but U it's kind of a kind of phenomenally fortunate

54
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,120
thing that coming that's come our way and seems like it just like that to

55
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,800
partner with hidden villa to be able to offer Retreats there and maybe other do other kind of Partnerships with them is

56
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:53,240
a phenomenal thing and uh one of the things also over the last couple of years that I've been

57
00:05:53,240 --> 00:06:02,120
involved in is training people uh in um in in do doing Buddhist Buddhist uh

58
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:09,000
caregiving in relationship to the natural world like we have this Buddhist Eco chapy program and involved in

59
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,440
training a whole bunch of people to be able to do retreats in the wilderness camping Retreats and backpacking

60
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:20,440
Retreats other things and so we have all these the hidden vill is right there in the natural world so we can probably do

61
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:27,240
some pretty creative things there as well

62
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:34,479
so um as for the talk today so this

63
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:40,919
um last week uh gave a series of talks on the uh fundamentals or the

64
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:50,319
foundations or of Buddhist ethics introduction to the Buddhist ethics and um I talked about how part

65
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,919
part of the foundations of it is the is the the the I don't know if I want to

66
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:03,639
call it a principle maybe that diminishes it but uh the principle of non-harming at the center of it the idea

67
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:10,919
of U becoming skilled in learning to recognize what is wholesome what is healthy for us in the heart and to live

68
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:17,120
from that inner psychological health is a foundation for Buddhist

69
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:25,360
ethics that um another one is uh that we're involved in um uh training

70
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,440
ourselves that Buddhist precepts are not U admonitions or Commandments they're

71
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:38,400
trainings that understood you're not going to be perfect at it but we're training ourselves and cultivating developing ourselves to become

72
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:45,639
ethical and um and then as we become more ethical or train train this way

73
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:50,800
then ethics becomes um second nature it becomes our nature it becomes who we are

74
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,919
and the word for Ethics in Buddhism it's often translated to English as ethics is

75
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:01,599
the word CA s i l a and that word uh has

76
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:09,599
two meanings it means behavior and then it came over time to mean nature like a character of a person

77
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,840
like something deeper in person's nature is to and so the word some people then

78
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:22,400
have translated as virtuous Behavior virtuous conduct and um and so at some point it

79
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:28,159
becomes a person's natural virtue to be ethical to not cause any harm and it's

80
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:34,240
not something you have to think about doing it's just who you are you're not going to intentionally want to harm

81
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,680
anyone it's just your nature to be that way and that's certainly that's especially the case of those people who

82
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:48,839
mature in this practice to what sometimes is called Enlightenment or realization that um and so if if um

83
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:54,480
anyone you know if everybody hears that you've been hanging out with the Buddhists or doing Buddhist practice and

84
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,200
they ask you how do you know when someone's enlightened uh you now I'll give you an

85
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:08,760
answer that I think is very profound and that is um that um uh you

86
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,800
know when they don't want to harm anybody isn't that a great answer I

87
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:20,200
think it is so so but I wanted so today I wanted to do another piece of this foundation

88
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:27,040
for Buddhist ethics and that is uh Meta Meta is a

89
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:33,440
wonderful word that has been translated many times into English my most common

90
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,880
favorite translation of it is Goodwill uh sometimes I like kindness

91
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:45,600
it's often known in popular Buddhist English speaking circles as loving

92
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,880
kindness and sometimes I really like that word uh some people like the word

93
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:58,680
benevolence so there's all kinds of different ways they they use people use the word and uh and the all the variety

94
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:05,600
of translations we have speaks to the idea that meta whatever it is is not one

95
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:12,360
thing um and but it belongs to a family of attitudes of emotions which have to

96
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:20,640
do with which one hand can be called our social emotions or positive social emotions or attitudes or maybe more

97
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:26,560
maybe a little bit more kind of precisely the caregiving emotions the

98
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:33,120
emotions of care rather than caregiving may be motions of care where care has two

99
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:40,720
meanings care means you want to support someone help someone some care for someone that way but to care also means

100
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,079
that you uh something is important and so to to have emotions of

101
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:51,279
care is also emotions to have respect for other people to see appreciate them

102
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:56,760
and value them to Value people because that you care about them and it has this

103
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:02,600
kind caregiving kind of attitude too So Meta is in that family of things and

104
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:10,000
rather than thinking it's one thing you take all the whole family of caregiving emotions you can kind of imagine making

105
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,880
a color wheel from them that the color wheel that has no sharp lines between any of the colors and then all the

106
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:22,320
colors is kind of kind of you know kind of gradually fade into each other move

107
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:30,120
into each other and um if you SE in a color wheel sometimes the primary colors stand out kind of more intensely but

108
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:36,560
they don't have any sharp lines between the other Hues of that color and so the

109
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:42,399
same way so so we have this wonderful wheel of potential caregiving emotions

110
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:51,360
that we live live in that sometimes in Buddhism we talk about loving kindness meta karuna compassion appreciative Joy

111
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,360
which is mudita and equinity as a form of

112
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,480
lovea and um but there's others generosity could be could be

113
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:12,160
one um and um so what is this meta in the classic uh language of of Pi meta is

114
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:18,160
a cognate or connected to the word ma which means friend and uh the some of

115
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:25,160
the oldest definitions of meta is uh is

116
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:32,320
um um says it um it is known as meta because it arises in in one's

117
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,639
relationship to a friend so it's kind of some people just like to translated as friend

118
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:45,600
friendliness that meta as a kind of friendliness with the idea that that friendliness uh is a wonderful thing to

119
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:52,720
have warm friendly feelings for a friend and um and uh and then the idea is to

120
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,600
universalize that feeling so everyone's your friend wouldn't that be nice and

121
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:06,680
maybe that's a little bit of a lower bar than saying loving kindness because as soon as you have the word love in

122
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:13,639
it you know it's a high bar and um it's possible to have goodwi

123
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:20,320
or friendly attitude to people you don't like and I think it's realistic that we

124
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:27,920
have people who somehow doesn't quite work for us there something about them that's quite not you know you know maybe

125
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:33,839
they're aversive and irritating and maybe they're always as cynic and and

126
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:39,320
just kind of like oh you know here we go again and um so it's you don't quite

127
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:45,199
like them but you can still have good will for them you can still have an

128
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:51,839
attitude or friendliness that's genuine that's part of your character your nature that your heart is open to them

129
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:59,560
and care you care for them in spite of the fact that you know well that doesn't kind of work for me how they are so so I

130
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:05,519
don't know if I said that in any way that would offend anyone or trouble anyone but I was trying to say something

131
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:12,680
that that it's nice to lower the bar of what Goodwill could be because then then then it's easier to do it um to think

132
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:18,880
you're supposed to be loving to every single person you see it's a little bit hard to imagine that you know that's a

133
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,600
high bar to attain um so

134
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:30,079
um so in terms of Ethics uh

135
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:36,320
uh I like to think of Buddhist ethics is the Buddhist ethics of friendship the

136
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,519
kind of e way you would be with a good very good friend you I don't think it

137
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:47,519
feels good to think about killing your good friend like that's not you know you're

138
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:54,000
probably actually you know you know willing to sacrifice even your life for some good friend it's the opp feeling

139
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,120
feel opposite feeling might be there uh you're probably not going to steal from your good friend this just would just

140
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:07,120
feel kind of yucky I hope and probably you're not going to uh

141
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:14,040
you know assert yourself in a violent sexual way and a you know dominating way on your friend to hurt them

142
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:20,040
sexually and you probably know doesn't feel good to lie to them and this whole and then the last

143
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:27,480
precept not not getting intoxicated um I've known people who have harmed their friends when they got

144
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:33,000
intoxicated they somehow that just didn't work for for friends family all

145
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,240
kinds of people there's been tremendous harm being created so the idea is you know careful

146
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:48,839
with what you take in so you don't harm anyone so um the the the ethics of

147
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:57,160
friendship is one quality of Buddhist ethics and that I think gives a very different flavor for what ethics is if

148
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:02,399
the primary reference point is some kind of Western puritanical ideas of

149
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:09,720
Commandments and ones that involve punishment and you know completely black and white or you know night and day kind

150
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:15,120
of um um uh you know right and

151
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,639
wrong so um so here's more of this

152
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:30,920
definition um meta is called meta because because uh it is

153
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:39,480
friendly it refers to Tender or watery love watery

154
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:47,160
love the um some people translate this as moist love um but watery I think of like a

155
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:53,079
wonderful container like a bladder something that holds water and it you

156
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:59,360
shake it and the water kind of moves inside or shakes inside and this wonderful resonance in the heart that we

157
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,918
have when something happens and the heart kind of is not frozen and it's uh

158
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:11,798
you know it's it's it's a watery so it kind of responds it's a responsive thing some people have translated this

159
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:19,600
word as a lubricating uh friendship lubricating love lubricating meta lubricated heart

160
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:28,240
and that's a little odd because I think of you know the oil for your car but uh but the um but also I have

161
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,400
this means that uh there's no resistance you know things so your heart is

162
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:40,440
lubricated means that things just flow right through and right in and just available and uh and really well

163
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:46,400
lubricated heart um is like another metaphor is a heart that's so open that

164
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,960
uh things go into it and pass right through they don't get stuck and when

165
00:17:51,960 --> 00:18:00,200
things get stuck then when we get in trouble and um so um so this um

166
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:08,640
so um and then here it says the characteristic of meta is to promote

167
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:15,640
well-being so there's something it's a quality of friendship where we have Good Will and we want well for others that's

168
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:23,039
the characteristic of it as opposed to having love or friendship or someone and is

169
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:29,120
characterized by what they can do for me it's about my well-being that counts what I can get in the relationship

170
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:35,720
there's a there's a this it um it doesn't anyway so to promote the

171
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,960
well-being of the other it its function is to prefer

172
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:47,159
well-being over I guess ill beinging PR there is something to

173
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:55,120
prefer there is a prefer to prefer to have a sense of ease and happiness and joy over

174
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:01,039
unhappiness um its manifestation is the remove removal of

175
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:09,080
annoyance isn't that nice occasionally one one or two of you probably get annoyed and um and so it's

176
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:15,679
such a nice feeling when that annoyance is gone annoyance is kind of an irritant for

177
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:23,400
yourself its proximate cause is seeing the loveliness of others isn't that

178
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:30,720
great what does it take to be able to see the loveliness of other people

179
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:37,679
I know that sometimes that's not available because we're annoyed because we're angry because

180
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:43,520
we're fil filled with the desire we're filled with um delusion we're filled

181
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:50,559
with confusion fear all kinds of things into fear we're so caught up in our agenda and all we have to do so many

182
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:57,640
things over being over busy interferes with friendliness over being over busy

183
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:03,600
interferes with their ability to take in another person so that we see their

184
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:09,559
loveliness wouldn't that be a nice life if you went around seeing loveliness in

185
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:15,880
everyone yes but you got to be realistic we have a lot of things to

186
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:22,080
do what's more important what could be more important

187
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:28,720
than seeing the loveliness in being of beings it succeeds metto succeeds when

188
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:35,200
ill will subsides and it fails when it

189
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:41,960
produces selfish affection I guess self selfless AFF I

190
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:49,559
don't know what that is but selfless affection no selfish selfish is affection it says I guess I was hoping

191
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:57,240
for something different selfish affection and

192
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:04,200
u similar there's another one uh how does one abide with one's

193
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,840
heart accompanied with meta extending outward in One Direction so there's the

194
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:16,760
idea that you can take this attitude and have it feel like it's expansive and extensive in all directions but you can

195
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:22,080
start with One Direction how do I abide with a M mind a heart accompanied with

196
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:28,000
meta extending outward in One Direction just as one would feel friendliness on

197
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:36,640
seeing a barely beloved friend so does one extend loving kindness meta to All

198
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:46,440
Creatures so um so I I like very much that uh we have

199
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:54,919
different English translations of meta so that we don't box her in and think it has to be one thing and what I I uh and

200
00:21:54,919 --> 00:22:00,880
and why it's not a one thing is that the social emotion we have the positive ones

201
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,480
how we have them what they are Depends a lot on other qualities of heart and mind

202
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:12,640
that we have and those shift and change over time so to come to a conclusion

203
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:19,159
today this is what meta is uh might keep you from noticing how it shifts and

204
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:24,720
changes over time and one of the great joys for me or in doing Buddhist

205
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,840
practice now for these decades is to see that my understanding of love my

206
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,919
understanding of friendliness of Goodwill meta karuna all these things um

207
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:42,480
how it lives in me has shifted and change as other uh aspects of this practice Has Changed Me In in different

208
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:48,279
ways so for example um and how practice can CH has

209
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:55,240
changed me so sometimes you sit down to meditate and um I'm

210
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:02,080
preoccupied maybe I'm a little bit uh tense and spinning out in my thoughts

211
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:07,480
and I sit down and part of what mindfulness meditation is is getting out of the

212
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:14,799
way of ourselves so that how we are any given moment has a chance to be seen to

213
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,960
be known and to subtle and uh I've still to this day

214
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:26,640
I've noticed that my mind tricks me and uh and that is I'm involved in some kind

215
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,640
of intense thought and PR occupation and um and I think the the

216
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:38,480
whole world centers around that preoccupation I think this is the way it has to be and I have to fix this and

217
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,799
solve this or this person is so terrible and I have to do something and I'm kind of caught up in this world of

218
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:52,480
something and sometimes it's not interpersonal sometimes it's like um you know like there's not enough time and I

219
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:58,720
have to have I have to clean the house and have the dishes cleaned but I don't have enough time for it how am I going to do this and I'm rushing around trying

220
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:05,080
to do three things at once and and um and the world is in this thought bubble

221
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:10,480
of its own preoccupation so then I sit

222
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,840
down and it's still there but then it gets after a while it

223
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:22,960
gets softer gets quieter the shoulders go down the belly relaxes after a while

224
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,440
even the eyes relax and soften and I notice that my thinking has slowed down

225
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:35,600
and after a while those thoughts have stopped occurring and I'm there just with my breath in a simple way and the

226
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:41,840
pressure and the tension that was kind of compelling that earlier kind of thought is seen and known it's still

227
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:48,000
there but now it's just pressure my mind or somewhere and I just sit breathing with it getting out of the way of it

228
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,720
knowing it and it quiets down and settles and then when I finish the

229
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:59,480
meditation lo and behold I realized wow I was caught in a delusion before I

230
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:05,240
meditated I thought I was living in this thought bubble of that made its own

231
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:11,559
little Universe of what had to happen and what how things were and what things mean and all that but that was in its

232
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:18,640
own little thing that I thought was the truth and now I see it very

233
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:25,399
differently and so what I've learned is sometimes when um I feel like I don't have enough time for things is I'll sit

234
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:31,399
down and meditate for 10 minutes and after 10 minutes I have lots of

235
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:37,640
time it's remarkable who who who who had the true

236
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:43,159
view of reality the Gil who thought they didn't have enough time for things and

237
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:49,279
the one who sees lots of time after meditation is the after meditation one diluted because I'm just forgetting all

238
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:58,360
the list um and um so so things starts

239
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:04,880
settling and changing and my relationship to myself begins to change

240
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,559
so for example there can be um there can be self-criticism sometimes some people have

241
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:18,080
self-hate which is also one of those thought bubbles those little thought worlds we can live in and has its own

242
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:26,440
own authority has its own kind of inner Dynamics and working and uh sometimes

243
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:33,520
um you know they say um you can't solve a problem with the problem itself uh you have to kind of

244
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:39,360
step out of the problem to solve it so you know some something some some things that seem so intense and so important

245
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:47,600
and so true in the mind and how the mind thinks you have to find a way to step out of it to see something different so

246
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:53,559
meditation again can be one of those things there other ways of doing this just spending time at a park going for a

247
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:58,799
walk and being under trees some people being with a friend exercis that some

248
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:05,600
people can just do a little bit with but so some point the the um uh something

249
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:12,240
can shift that self-criticism and it's not we're not operating that's not the operating

250
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:19,640
principle anymore and then there's a different way of experiencing oneself and maybe at first it's just the

251
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:28,840
absence of self-criticism but then with time the tender heart the watery heart uh start

252
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:34,080
to be able to show itself it's been

253
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:41,720
eclipsed and then there can be a feeling of like it's feeling being content being at peace being calm being settled oh

254
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:47,000
it's good to be this way and then it starts becoming easier and easier to

255
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,159
view oneself as one's own friend to have friendship towards oneself to care for

256
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:59,519
oneself to have a positive view of oneself as that process goes deeper and

257
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:04,600
Fuller feeling finding a peace with oneself a contentment with oneself a

258
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:11,279
peace with the present moment a contentment with the present moment there's room for all kinds of uh other

259
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:19,039
positive emotions to arise one of them is a simple Delight a joy in being alive it's one of

260
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:24,799
the great wonderful aspects of meditation sooner or later some

261
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:31,720
sometimes it's later um to have uh the bubbling up of meditative Joy that's

262
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:38,720
there for no reason it isn't like you won the lottery or had the great date or or something

263
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:45,039
it's just because you're alive and you're just so so content and happy and who would have believe that you can be

264
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:51,360
happy without getting something you know getting praise or getting things or you

265
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:59,720
know something Pleasures the in the world but it's phenomenal to feel this

266
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:06,000
then when we we when you're with your friend your friend um you're not coming

267
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,120
to your friend with a need you're not coming with your friend

268
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:18,200
wanting something from your friend it's something wrong with having a need and wanting something from a friend at times

269
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:25,200
but imagine coming without a need and without wanting something from them and

270
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:32,039
feeling friendly for them a friendship that is without need for

271
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:39,200
me that's a g big gift to give someone imagine having love for

272
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:47,360
someone and you have love without a need for someone else imagine having in

273
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:55,000
love a feeling of friendliness of kindness of tenderness that has no

274
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,039
object that just there just like a joy that has has no reason there can be love

275
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:05,519
that has no object in particular it's just a state of kindness a state of

276
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:13,240
love and then your friend comes happens to walk into the middle of that bubble and so you're just loving but

277
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:19,440
it's not like you're like focused on them that you know that you're going to

278
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:27,559
have to get something from them and so loving kindness then creates a very different context for ethics

279
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:33,360
because so for example with uh uh romantic love sexual

280
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:39,240
love uh that usually comes with desire and nothing necessarily wrong

281
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:45,159
with that desire it's how how we live it how we live it is can be tremendously

282
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:50,559
harmful sexual desires we know I'm sure most people here have been harmed by

283
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:58,639
sexual someone's sexual desire once upon a time but the um or have harmed but the

284
00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:05,000
um uh but if uh meta is the reference

285
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:12,600
point for romantic love then there's a reference point that is a kind of a love

286
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:18,760
a friendliness that is free of having to act on a desire it creates a different

287
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:23,880
reference point than desire desires can still be there but there's a whole other

288
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:29,600
attitude that then informs how we go about a relationship reltionship

289
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,679
so um and so but that that meta that has

290
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:40,240
that kind of is free of need free of Desire free of needing to prove

291
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:49,799
ourselves or get anything is a rare thing to have in this world but that is a phenomenal basis for

292
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:55,200
how we live a life of non-harming so part of what we do in

293
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,880
Buddhism is to celebrate our capacity for these

294
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:06,360
wonderful positive social emotions we emphasize the value of learning to

295
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:13,840
recognize them appreciate them when they're there and one one of the ways that we sometimes emphasize

296
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:20,039
this is look for the situations in your life where it's easy to have this look

297
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:25,679
for situation where it's easy to have a friendly attitude easy to have good will

298
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:31,679
that expects nothing in return look for situations where it's easy to be generous to

299
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:39,519
someone or compassionate or some for some people it's more difficult is to um share in

300
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:45,399
their Joy the appreciative joy and their success look where it's

301
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:51,440
easy and then from where it's easy be happy with it appreciate that

302
00:32:51,440 --> 00:33:00,320
you have this capacity value it this is good and then again to expand it to more

303
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:06,399
and more people spread the circle to include not

304
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:12,159
just the people it's easy your family and your friends but start spreading it out to the people who are not your

305
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:19,360
friends not your family to people who are neighbors further away to people who

306
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,799
are you know who are acquaintances what does it take to have

307
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:31,720
this positive Goodwill this meta this uh caregiving concern for the wellbeing of

308
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:36,799
others what does it take to to go out onward and Order make your circle bigger

309
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:42,559
and bigger that's the exercise that Buddhism um uh

310
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:49,360
teaches as a way of universalizing our meta our love our

311
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:57,200
care our compassion and it goes even go so far as how do you cultivate meta for an

312
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:03,639
enemy and there there's no they don't they don't say anything about not having an

313
00:34:03,639 --> 00:34:10,520
enemy somehow I guess they assume that there are there are people always going to be someone who can be an enemy but

314
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:17,960
even an enemy uh which seems like a really high bar that you would have some basic

315
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:23,560
Goodwill basic friendliness to them you might have a lot of caution around them

316
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:29,118
because they're your enemy so it's not like you have to kind of open your doors of your house and you know invite them

317
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:35,200
in but uh there is a kind of healthy Good Will that you can

318
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:41,079
have I remember once uh when uh someone was really angry someone I didn't know

319
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:46,520
very well hardly at all was really angry with me for uh nothing I had done but

320
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:52,720
somehow wanted to blame me for the the event and um and came over and was

321
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:58,880
yelling at me angrily and um and I stood there

322
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:06,839
listening and listening took a while and uh and I thought about where

323
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:12,040
what is the kind thing to do here what you know do I justify myself do I

324
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:18,599
explain myself and explain it away or do I say that he's wrong or what do I do here he gave me a lot of time to think

325
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:24,680
about it so that was

326
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:33,079
nice and um and so he finally stopped and uh with the most Good Will I could

327
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:39,280
have I looked at him and calmly said um you know when you speak that way

328
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:46,079
to me I feel afraid so there was no blame I wasn't like attacking him or just telling him

329
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:53,560
what was the effect it had on me because it was I had some fear but it wasn't like I was Fearless in in situation and

330
00:35:53,560 --> 00:36:01,200
um but that's I said if I say that then I may be taking care of myself but also it's my way of not of having

331
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:08,960
some Goodwill for him some wanting not to criticize him but trying to open the door for some other way and in fact as

332
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:15,599
soon as he heard that he relaxed and he kind of I don't know if he apologize but he relaxed and kind of

333
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:23,359
brought the conversation to a close and left and um and uh

334
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:29,240
so that was my little exercise and trying to trying to find the Good Will

335
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:35,280
and trying to find how to be appropriate to take care of myself in this kind of challenging situation where at least for

336
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:41,640
that moment I I must have been his enemy the way he was talking to

337
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:48,839
me so um so to expand outwards but how do we do that not as I

338
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:54,240
should not as some kind of you know polanish way to kind of go around kind

339
00:36:54,240 --> 00:37:00,760
of kind of seeing everybody this loveliness as if we were in a pretend

340
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:06,480
way and one of the ways is that is to become skilled through mindfulness

341
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:13,599
practice to understand how we um don't do

342
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:19,119
that part of what uh one of the really important principles of Buddhism is that

343
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:27,280
there are Buddhist ideals Like Loving kindness or meta peace equinity calm all kinds of

344
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:34,079
all kind no Buddhism has no shortage of ideals to to to carry as a

345
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:41,920
burden but um but the the way to uh experience these ideals is to is to be

346
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:49,359
mindful to study uh what interferes with them what gets in the

347
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:56,200
way you know I hate people that gets in the way of the love

348
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:03,960
so study the hate find out what's going on uh I I don't have time for people

349
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:11,839
because I need to become wealthy okay so then study that

350
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:17,920
ambition what's going on for you really stay present and meditation mindfulness

351
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:23,079
is one of the Laboratories for a deep taking a deep honest look at ourselves

352
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:30,359
to stop enough to really see what's going on and then we begin working through some of the things that

353
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:37,800
interfere one of the things that uh one of the very powerful things to begin realizing is to understand when we're

354
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:44,280
causing self harm to ourselves by our attitudes if we're spending a lot of

355
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:49,800
time being angry at others um they might not even know we're angry at them but

356
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:57,240
we're certainly harming ourselves uh if um if we're spending a lot of time you

357
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:04,079
know chasing after you know some kind of ambition and uh it's becoming stressful

358
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:11,040
for us and we're closing down to everything else we're being harmed from it and mindfulness creates a higher

359
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:16,800
heightened sensitivity to notice where we harm ourselves by our attitudes our

360
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,839
way of thinking our beliefs our actions the words we have and so as we can

361
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:29,680
seeing that and that settles down remember I talked about just sitting present getting out of the way and

362
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:37,240
seeing what's there but allowing it to settle and settle and quiet then we don't have the thing that

363
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:45,200
interferes with the ideal is no longer there and then what happens

364
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:52,359
then well then you thought you were supposed to be loving it turned out that's not what the situation called for

365
00:39:52,359 --> 00:39:58,000
this situation called for Compassion or this situation called for

366
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,160
celebration or the situation called for simple generosity or the situation called for

367
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:09,520
doing nothing just sometimes it's you know to have you know people in this

368
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:14,760
situation I should leave this person completely alone that would be the best most kindest thing to

369
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:22,760
do so um so this idea of looking at what interferes so that U

370
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:28,800
meta so that we can respond with you know positive social emotions because

371
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:34,359
they are who we are not what we're trying to live up

372
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:42,920
to so friendliness is the basis one of the basis for Buddhist

373
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:50,440
ethics so we have a few minutes left I would love it if um you would take maybe

374
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:56,359
just a couple of minutes to share with another person if anything in this talk

375
00:40:56,359 --> 00:41:03,319
Sparks something in interesting in you uh something that kind of oh that's an interesting idea around this topic of

376
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:08,520
meta and maybe you hadn't heard before maybe you have but it sparked something

377
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:14,440
and maybe if you turn towards maybe maybe you should do you know two one or two people in near you just but look

378
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:21,560
around make sure no one's left alone sitting there like we when everyone included and then just we'll do it about

379
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:27,400
four minutes or so and then I'll ring a bell and we'll come back for a minute here and if you don't want to do this of

380
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:33,200
course you can leave or or just sit

381
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:43,640
[Music] quietly well that sounded

382
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:51,400
like friendly conversations and

383
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:57,400
uh I feel a little apologetic that it gave you so little time for that conversation but you're welcome welcome

384
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:03,200
to stay now and continue there's no hurry to leave this morning I don't think there's a

385
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:08,440
children's program today there is oh there is 11:15 oh I see so yeah so you

386
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:14,520
could welcome to talk for about 15 minutes and then continue the conversations

387
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:19,839
outside and uh so thank you and um may

388
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:26,599
it be that our Reflections and our learnings about meta and all the different all the different forms they

389
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:33,119
can take that uh it helps people that we encounter feel

390
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:38,960
appreciated that we have a world where people are underappreciated and so let all people

391
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:45,240
be appreciated as we go through our day thank you
