1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:10,920
so again warm greetings as I said the electricity was out at home today

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,080
and and uh so it was a slow start and a lot of things

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:23,199
to different things to take care of and figure out to get come down here to

4
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,199
IMC

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,520
so so this is a also continuing this series

6
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:42,960
of introduction to mindfulness meditation and U now we come to

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,320
the week on emotions

8
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,160
and partly the idea in the sequence is that it's easier to be aware of

9
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:01,680
emotions if we are aware of the body the more we can can be embodied in

10
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:08,080
a direct and simple relaxed way the easier it is to get a some wisdom and

11
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,600
clarity about how to be present for emotions without being

12
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:22,119
excessively caught in them or involved in them or troubled by them

13
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:27,320
or and to be aware of the body it can help to be aware of

14
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:34,560
breathing of course breathing doesn't work for everyone as a foundation but the

15
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:42,600
simple uh rhythm of breathing in and out the Simplicity of just breathing

16
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:49,640
with maybe relaxing on the exhale and relaxing on the top of the inhale

17
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:56,000
just so that the breathing is a little bit longer just slightly longer not

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,560
forcefully almost naturally the breathing can be relaxing

19
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:10,000
and kind of settles the nervous system it it uh can be even reassuring at

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,519
times and it's a place to go where we can be present for our life without

21
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:23,959
being caught in our thoughts so for today I want to say that

22
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:29,680
uh what makes mindfulness sacred at least for the way my

23
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:37,480
understand understanding of my approach to this word sacred is when there's no outside

24
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:45,040
nothing is excluded from awareness there's a way in which awareness has space has room has the ability has the

25
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:53,519
wisdom to include everything within it and of course some emotions are quite

26
00:02:53,519 --> 00:03:00,599
difficult but to discover how to include them in a caring way and an open way

27
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:06,799
so that wisdom can arise so that we can

28
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:13,239
see that every emotion is in somehow way connected to

29
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:20,080
something profound within sometimes the emotion might be

30
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,200
maladaptive adapted poorly or to something that's really profound

31
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:34,120
about ourselves and so the simp simple art of just recognizing we're

32
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:42,720
thinking and not being pulled into thoughts is the art of

33
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:49,120
mindfulness and we'll go through this in the course of the week but for today let's keep it

34
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,159
simple recognizing and leaving at that just

35
00:03:55,159 --> 00:04:00,799
recognizing when we're thinking and keeping it super simple just

36
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:07,079
recognizing and then returning to the breathing returning to the

37
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:13,159
body so

38
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:17,720
gently assume meditation

39
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:35,199
posture and to close your

40
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,240
eyes and whatever way is grounding for you here and now in the

41
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,199
body let yourself be grounded if that's the breathing take a

42
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:02,759
few long slow deep breaths if there's a more direct way to the body

43
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,960
than through breathing you might use

44
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:19,199
that and for breathing in deeply relaxing long relaxation as you

45
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,479
exhale

46
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:55,720
letting your breathing return to normal and continue on the

47
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:01,080
exhale relaxing your body

48
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,758
maybe different parts of the

49
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
body

50
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:53,560
relaxing the thinking mind whatever tension or pressure is associated with

51
00:06:54,599 --> 00:07:00,440
thinking physical sensations of pressure tension contra

52
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:07,759
raction tightness on the

53
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:15,520
exhale imagine your mind is like

54
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,720
a waves like a like a surface of a

55
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:28,039
lake and as you ex exhale and relax the waves on the lake flatten

56
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:34,120
out and the way and the lake surface becomes

57
00:07:51,560 --> 00:08:01,319
calm and now in the simplest possible way

58
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:08,240
way the easiest possible way if you're

59
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:17,120
thinking recognizing recognize it as such maybe with a simple word

60
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,960
thinking where how the word is said or imagined in the

61
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,000
mind is easeful matter of

62
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,560
fact their recognition is maybe

63
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:40,000
free of any attitude about thinking or preferences around

64
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,440
thinking opinions about it being there

65
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:54,880
just almost like you're hear a bird singing in the trees

66
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:02,800
nearby you hear or know there are thoughts

67
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:14,199
happening and then Begin Again with your

68
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,360
breathing and the exercise this

69
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:31,879
morning is to discover how simple you can recognize think when you're

70
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:39,200
thinking and then to begin again with your

71
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,240
breathing maybe every exhale you recognize your

72
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,200
thinking and then begin again with the

73
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,959
inhale if thinking is in the background and it's easy to stay with your

74
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:07,480
breathing no need to recognize that you're

75
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,160
thinking only if you lose touch with

76
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,839
breathing or if the thinking

77
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
predominates

can and then to begin again with your

thoughts is simply thinking the content of the

109
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:51,039
thoughts for this this exercise doesn't matter just know that you're

110
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:55,559
thinking whether it's in words or

111
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
images

112
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:22,320
and then bring to mind people in your

113
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:29,320
life maybe people for whom for these few moments

114
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:37,200
you can remember or think about recall with the same

115

Simplicity just simply to know them without any

aversions simply know

119
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:17,200
them and maybe with the idea that this Simplicity of knowing remembering thinking

120
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:26,679
about is a means by which Good Will can

thank

139
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:59,519
you

140

e

141
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,240
so hello and welcome to this Monday

142
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:44,360
morning's introduction to mindfulness meditation we're now on the fourth week

143
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:51,600
to do a to do thinking and um we just had a meditation

144
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,840
before this that I was happy to do I think I arrived

145
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:02,559
a little bit unsettled and uh maybe I spoke a little

146
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:08,320
bit in a confused way at the introduction about what we're doing this

147
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:13,960
week There's was no electricity at home and other issues going on at home so to

148
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:20,480
get down here this morning there were a lot of steps involved and in the

149
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:29,320
dark so um so

150
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:33,000
thinking there's

151
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:44,519
a excuse me so thinking there's not a few meditators

152
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:52,120
who feel challenged by their thinking and uh there's not a few people

153
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:58,640
who are challenged because of their thinking Some people are troubled at the

154
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:05,600
by the fact that they're thinking in meditation and feel like that's wrong and uh kind of trying to bat them

155
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:11,799
away or and some people are not troubled by

156
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:18,240
the fact that they're thinking but they're troubled by the what they're thinking and I think thoughts can

157
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:24,640
sometimes have a huge impact on our mood or state of mind and

158
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:30,960
um so in mindfulness meditation we're looking to become wise about thinking

159
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:37,080
we're not trying to get rid of thinking and we're not trying

160
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:44,320
to um uh judge our thoughts we don't have to be critical of

161
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:53,760
them in a certain way we're trying to understand how to be with thinking that serves us the best

162
00:30:53,760 --> 00:31:01,760
that uh is respectful for ourselves and our thoughts and that uh allows us to Source our

163
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:09,279
thinking in some of the deepest place within and uh this language of sourcing

164
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:16,240
I think it's maybe um an a uh industrial term when you

165
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:21,559
Source material uh you're looking for the material in which to build something

166
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:27,919
or to make something uh the place to make it and um but we can do that with

167
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:33,600
ourselves we thinking we Source our thinking where is the source from which we're

168
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:40,600
thinking and sometimes the source the origin the place of thinking is not

169
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:47,000
really so deeply connected within even though the content of the thoughts

170
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,200
affects all of who we are and it's possible to find a source

171
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,399
within to Source our thinking in some profound place within that if if we

172
00:31:57,399 --> 00:32:02,880
think from that place that um this will have a very different effect on our mood

173
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:11,240
our state of mind and our relationships to this world of ours and so the way to become wise about

174
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:17,840
thinking and included in mindfulness Begins by uh understanding

175
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:24,159
that we're not going to be the enemy of thinking that thinking is part of the

176
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:29,440
what we can be mindful of it isn't that we stay and this is the advantage of the

177
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:36,240
kind of mindfulness practice we're teaching here we're not limiting attention to only breathing some

178
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,600
meditation techniques which are quite effective in some their own way can uh

179
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:48,760
focus is only on a narrow subset of our human experience and sometimes that people use

180
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:56,159
that they get concentrated absorbed in that subset like just the breathing itself but in doing so we're not being

181
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:01,559
inclusive of the full range of what it means to be a human being the full range

182
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:07,440
of human experience and the brance of Buddhist

183
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:13,720
mindfulness practice is that it can be inclusive of everything nothing is

184
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:18,880
outside of its range and as long as we're being mindful

185
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:25,000
of then um there's a place of Freedom we can find Freedom we can find balance

186
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:32,480
equinity wisdom if we're mindful by our anything if the

187
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:38,480
mindfulness is shaped by our emotions shaped by our thinking then we don't

188
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:44,760
find the same degree of freedom and wisdom so it isn't uh so the thinking is

189
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:50,679
not sourced in our emotions our life is not sourced

190
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:57,760
in our thinking but rather we discover a a different way of of

191
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,840
holding our thinking holding our emotions holding our bodily

192
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:10,560
experience and over time as we begin learning about how to be mindful uh there's a it comes a point

193
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:16,320
where we feel and recognize everything that we experience can

194
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:22,200
be held by mindfulness held in Awareness everything is something we can be

195
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:30,240
mindful of and because we we understand that the Act of mindfulness of awareness

196
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:36,960
is kind a certain kind of freedom in and of itself the act of mindfulness is not

197
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:43,800
being entangled or caught or reactive it's just a clear recognition simple

198
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,878
recognition this is what happening and uh I remember when I came

199
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:55,320
to this understanding um that it first it was theoretical the understanding was

200
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:01,680
wow um in theory I could be have this mindfulness that I was learning uh

201
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:08,320
directed or inclusive of everything in my Human Experience and if that's the case then I

202
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:14,839
can be free in all experiences and I became so happy and uh

203
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:20,680
it was kind of like a revelation for me and say wow to be able to have to live

204
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:25,800
without that freedom wow that is that's possible now now I understand what it

205
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:33,440
takes and that gave me a lot of enthusiasm then for really relying on

206
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:39,320
mindfulness having faith in it as opposed to having faith uh in my

207
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:46,680
thoughts in my beliefs I I stopped having faith in in thinking worrisome thoughts about the

208
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:55,720
future I spent a lot of time thinking about how challenging things were going to be in the future for me I I no longer

209
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:01,480
had so much faith in reviewing the past and the resentments I had and that reviewing

210
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:06,520
them and living them was something that had tremendous value which of course I

211
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:14,200
didn't actively think that way but I was behaving that way the mind was that's what it was doing and when I really

212
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:19,560
started to have faith in mindfulness then I began to understand that in

213
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:26,040
contrast to that how I placed my how I invested myself in all these areas of

214
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:32,839
life how how to be how to think what to think about as if those were the important place to

215
00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:40,800
live and and learn to shift it to something else just mindfulness of so

216
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:47,640
so we want to learn how to be mindful of thinking not just to let go of it and

217
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:54,359
part of that is so we can have a different relationship to thoughts uh to hold thoughts lightly and

218
00:36:54,359 --> 00:37:00,040
openly without being caught in them and also because our thinking is just a

219
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:06,040
tip of an iceberg thinking is is a is often very deeply connected to other

220
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:12,839
parts of ourselves and if we're lost in our thoughts caught up in our thoughts or think that navigating and negotiating

221
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:19,079
the world is only through our thinking then we're riding on the tip of that

222
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:26,720
Iceberg and uh and there's a whole big thing uh to explore and to discover um

223
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:34,119
below that tip um and that's when we kind of enter into the kind of a big fullness of who we

224
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:40,359
are and so um one example of this that was I was trying to say earlier but I

225
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:46,079
didn't quite manage is um it's easier to be aware of

226
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:51,839
thinking when you aware when you know how to be present for

227
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:57,560
emotions it's also easier to be aware of emotions if you know how to be aware of things

228
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:04,920
thinking because the two are so deeply intertwined it's so easy it's

229
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:10,640
fascinating to watch how we think certain thoughts and the emotion follows

230
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:18,760
other times we have certain emotions and the thinking gets changed accordingly and so to learn to to how to

231
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:28,760
see these more clearly see that influence back and forth is a way of stepping back and not being in that

232
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:34,280
exchange it's easier to be aware of emotions and also thinking if we're know

233
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:39,560
how to be mindful of the body and the body is a rich area of attention body is

234
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:46,480
not just a Corporal physical event it's deeply connected to our deep

235
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:52,480
life and then it's easier to do all of it in the Simplicity of breathing

236
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,920
breathing is a way of protecting ourselves from being swept away in

237
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:03,520
Endless thoughts that spin and spin and spin

238
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:10,839
so for today the the exercise the suggestion was to

239
00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:17,240
experiment with how simple you could know that you're

240
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:23,640
thinking and simple doesn't mean that you're

241
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:29,400
condoning participating condemning your thoughts it just means you step

242
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:36,319
back almost like you step back two feet two steps and you recogniz oh that is

243
00:39:36,319 --> 00:39:41,839
thinking with the recognition not caught up in the

244
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:49,440
thoughts so we're using kind of a thought to recognize that we're

245
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:55,400
thinking so might seem like a paradox or confusing but the thought of

246
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:00,960
recognition is um is really simple and

247
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:07,640
not sticky not caught in stuck with whatever we're thinking this is a

248
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:13,319
powerful exercise if you can get a hang of it one thing that might help you with

249
00:40:13,319 --> 00:40:19,280
this is if uh you can also begin noticing if you think if you're thinking

250
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:25,319
in words or thinking in images some people do predominantly one or the other

251
00:40:25,319 --> 00:40:30,440
some people do a comb ation of them maybe at different times and

252
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:37,000
um but uh some people have never considered this for themselves and um so

253
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:43,720
but if you can clearly recognize I think more in words and where's the source of those

254
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:50,800
words in the mind where do you have a sense those words are being spoken in the mind and if you have a location then

255
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:56,359
you can step back and oh I'm thinking I'm thinking words if you're mostly

256
00:40:56,359 --> 00:41:01,680
thinking through images where are those being projected maybe a little bit in front of

257
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:06,839
you um but uh and then oh thinking I'm

258
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:12,480
thinking images that's what's happening so as you go

259
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:19,520
along today through your life look for opportunities to in a regular way to

260
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:25,280
recognize thinking and recognize whether you're thinking in words or images and

261
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,599
see if you can how simple you can recognize that you're thinking without

262
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:36,000
being caught in the thinking almost like you've stepped away and looking back

263
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:45,480
without being in in the midst of the fry so thank you very much and

264
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:50,680
um look forward to seeing you being part of this again

265
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:56,079
tomorrow
