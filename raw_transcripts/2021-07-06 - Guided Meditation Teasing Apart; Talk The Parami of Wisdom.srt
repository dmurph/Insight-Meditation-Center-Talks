1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,840
good evening welcome

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:14,320
welcome so of course you guys can't see what I'm seeing here but we're starting

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,039
to get ready for being in person so things are set up here a little bit

4
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:26,000
differently looking forward to when we can practice together and not to worry

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,239
we'll continue with the YouTube recordings and offerings

6
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:39,000
also but I know some of you are local and might like to come to

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,520
IMC but a warm welcome to everybody whether you're local or far

8
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,600
away and whether you're listening to this now or sometime in the

9
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,320
future a warm

10
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:04,920
welcome so we'll start with a little lightly guided meditation

11
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,960
taking our

12
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:22,520
seat and just feeling into what does it feel like right

13
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,479
now to be sitting

14
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:43,439
There maybe globally there's a sense of relief like oh okay I'm just going to be

15
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,720
sitting here for the next little

16
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,880
while or maybe there's some restlessness like really am I really going to sit

17
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:04,640
here for the next little while whatever our experience might be

18
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:12,840
it's all welcome it's all welcome it doesn't have to be one particular way

19
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,680
can be helpful to connect with whatever it is we're sitting

20
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:32,519
on cushion bench

21
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:36,720
chair couch

22
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,959
bed just feeling the pressure against the body

23
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:18,159
and then when we sit and start to settle down a little

24
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:27,680
bit perhaps the breathing becomes noticeable

25
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,400
possible this body breathes of course it

26
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:40,120
does can we in a kind gentle

27
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:47,159
way rest our attention on the sensations of breathing

28
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:26,759
feeling the inhales in the chest or the

29
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:33,120
abdomen per or perhaps feeling the air going in and out of the

30
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,440
nose

31
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:55,440
feeling the expansion the stretching with the

32
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:01,240
inhales for the coolness of the air

33
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:21,520
then of course the inhales are interspersed with

34
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,240
exhales how do they feel

35
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:47,360
you can focus on just one area if you'd like the chest the abdomen or the

36
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,840
nose feeling the opposite of expansion a little bit

37
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:14,360
of deflation maybe even though that doesn't sound very

38
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:21,520
inviting but the air being exchanged and then going

39
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:40,440
out and just feeling this rhythm inhale exhale

40
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:33,000
and when the mind wanders which it naturally will

41
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,520
do just very simply begin again we don't have to make it a problem we don't have

42
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:45,039
to make a story out of it it doesn't have to mean anything in particular it

43
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:54,440
just means we were lost in thought and then we begin again

44
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,080
nothing in particular needs to be

45
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:57,200
happening we're just noticing the experiences of

46
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:08,639
breathing and just allowing the mind to come back when it gets lost in thought

47
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:07,480
and you might notice that there is an

48
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,000
uncomfortable experience uncomfortable

49
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,880
sensation and a relaxed next easy way can

50
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:27,040
we distinguish can we tease

51
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:32,760
apart is there a bodily physical

52
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:41,800
aspect to the uncomfortable situation and is there a mental aspect

53
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:49,519
that is maybe there's a sharp sensation in the

54
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:56,839
knee and the mind is starting to think

55
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:03,600
like make up stories i'll never be able to meditate

56
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,600
with this sensation i'll never be able to go on retreat where they sit longer how do

57
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,720
those people sit longer they must be abnormal or have done it since they were

58
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,320
young and when I was young we didn't sit in a way that was very flexible but

59
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:27,120
there was that person that was in third grade that was so flexible i remember she used to play on the monkey bars all

60
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,839
the time and be doing all these things wow do they still have those at schools these days what would it be like to go

61
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:40,640
play on them i hope they do kids should play outside right here we go so there's

62
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:46,480
kind of like the mental aspect and the physical

63
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,880
aspect can we notice that sometimes the mental aspect leads us

64
00:11:53,880 --> 00:12:02,399
off where I just let us was off into a fantasy but sometimes it might be a I'm

65
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:09,279
damaging my knee i better shift my posture

66
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:15,360
i can't believe this is terrible i'll never be able to do it this is so hard

67
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:24,240
and we're saying things to ourselves that just exacerbating or amplifying the

68
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:32,959
uncomfortableness and to be sure we need to use wisdom and not sit through pain

69
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:39,279
if we feel like we're harming ourselves that is not what this practice is about

70
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,399
but when there is some uncomfortableness can we tease apart can we separate can

71
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,680
we distinguish the bodily experience from

72
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,399
the mental

73
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:05,680
experience and then as best we can to place our awareness on the bodily

74
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,360
experience it's a little bit more

75
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:17,000
steady so moving slower than the

76
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,639
thoughts bodily experience is staying here this moment

77
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:58,680
maybe the uncomfortable experience is some aversion oh I really don't want

78
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,399
this why is this happening

79
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,360
can we tease apart can we distinguish the

80
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:22,279
aversion and often we have aversion to the aversion so our reaction to the

81
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:26,480
experience can we tease those

82
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:34,959
apart and interrupt the aversion train

83
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,759
can we just be with the one version of a

84
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:54,680
version of course you have aversion to aversion it's a natural human response

85
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,440
but we don't have to amplify it

86
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,679
making this distinction between bodily experiences

87
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:29,158
and mental experiences

88
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:38,158
and making the distinction between our reactions and our

89
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:45,399
experiences enables us to see more clearly what is actually

90
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:53,240
happening teasing apart some of the different elements and this way we

91
00:28:53,240 --> 00:29:00,480
can have some more choices about what to do have some more clarity about what

92
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,360
might be the helpful the skillful thing to do going

93
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:14,000
forward so that it might support us and we're also having the ability to

94
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,279
tease apart different elements to see more clearly to distinguish to discern

95
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:26,039
also helps us to help others so that we don't get lost

96
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:31,679
in experiences that some kind sometimes can be

97
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:38,120
overwhelming but instead to maybe pull out the

98
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:43,919
pieces or where we actually have some control or some

99
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:51,559
choices so that in this way our practice of discerning

100
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:58,080
distinguishing can be for the benefit not only for ourselves but for

101
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:07,480
others so may our practice be for the benefit of all beings everywhere

102
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:18,630
[Music]

103
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,679
good evening welcome welcome

104
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:12,799
so tonight I'd like to first extend a really warm welcome to

105
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:20,679
everybody and to continue on the series that I've been doing on the

106
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:27,720
Paramese in the earlier talks I didn't say that much about the parameies in

107
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:33,679
particular and I'll just say a little bit now pammy often gets translated as

108
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:40,320
perfections i like to translate them as perfections of the heart to emphasize that they're

109
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:47,200
not just one more list of things to memorize and they're not just gaining

110
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:55,000
more and more knowledge but to bring all aspects of ourselves including our

111
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:01,519
hearts so p me can means also can mean something that's of really high value

112
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:07,200
like something that has a maybe like a type of wealth an inner type of wealth

113
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:13,399
that we all have but these parameies can be cultivated and be

114
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:19,279
developed and there's a list of 10 of them and interestingly that in this list

115
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:24,799
of 10 there isn't a meditation in particular instead these are things to

116
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:30,679
do in our everyday day lives so it's not just a meditative

117
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:37,320
experiences although that's included but it's um qualities that we bring to all aspects of our

118
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:43,399
lives so the list of 10 is generosity ethical behavior

119
00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:49,360
renunciation wisdom so the fourth one wisdom is what I'd like to talk about tonight

120
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:55,279
and then energy patience truth resolve

121
00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:02,120
loving kindness and equinimity i think we can all agree that these are good

122
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:09,600
qualities to have in our lives whether it's part of your spiritual practice or just part of being a human being a good

123
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:15,840
parent a good friend a good worker whatever it might be

124
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:24,480
so I'd like to just say a little bit about wisdom which as I mentioned is the fourth part of me wisdom is um how often

125
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:31,679
this word pa gets translated also some other translations

126
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:38,880
for pa are insight or discernment and I was thinking about

127
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,880
this idea of wise and we often have the I don't know where this comes from

128
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,960
exactly but we have this um owls are portrayed as

129
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:55,600
wise and when We think about well why are owls you know like historically or

130
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:02,279
why might we say that owls are wise and it's because they have such big

131
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:08,040
eyes like their eyes are like a dominant feature of

132
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:14,398
owls and I think this is really appropriate because wisdom in kind of in the Buddhist sense and the way that

133
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:19,520
we're going to talk about it and explore it and develop is not about just gaining

134
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:27,440
knowledge not about getting those advanced degrees or reading those books or knowing the all the lists it's not

135
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:34,440
about that wisdom is about seeing seeing

136
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:42,320
clearly this is why the connection with owls with the big eyes it's about seeing

137
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:48,480
clearly and to say that wisdom is the fourth part of me that it follows after

138
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:55,398
renunciation and just at a really high level there's a few ways that we can understand

139
00:34:55,399 --> 00:35:01,839
renunciation but one is a simplification like simplifying get rid

140
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:08,240
of the extraneous distractions things that we

141
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:13,359
don't need that are getting in the way getting in the way of our living our

142
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:21,280
best life so one way to think about renunciation is to simplify and to let go of what's

143
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:27,400
not needed another way to think about renunciation as

144
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:34,880
non-addiction joseph Goldstein says this and I kind of like it nonaddiction so that is to notice what

145
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,960
are our habits our habitual behaviors that we're just falling

146
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:45,520
into without thought just because it's what we've always been doing we might

147
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:51,200
have inherited these habits and in particular the Buddha

148
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:58,640
points to to notice our habit of always chasing after sensual pleasures things that taste good that sound good that

149
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:06,599
feel good and somehow kind of insisting that our experience be filled with sensual

150
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:16,000
pleasures and our annoyance when it isn't so renunciation about simplifying

151
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,960
and noticing what habits we have and letting go of those habits that aren't so helpful

152
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:29,280
and we could see then why how renunciation leads to wisdom is that as

153
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:37,359
we start to remove some of the extra that which isn't essential then it

154
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:42,680
be we are able to see more clearly see more clearly our

155
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:47,920
lives see more clearly the direction we're going see more clearly our values

156
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:54,680
what's important to us and see more clearly how all of our

157
00:36:54,680 --> 00:37:03,440
experiences are made up of different elements and that gets us to wisdom

158
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,880
so one way there's a number of ways we can talk about wisdom and one is the

159
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:15,359
capacity the ability the activity of discerning or distinguishing or making

160
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:21,960
um distinctions you know to kind of like tease things

161
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:28,720
apart so for example we might have the experience of of thinking that well it's

162
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:34,280
time to meditate or thinking we should meditate but then also having the idea I feel so

163
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:43,000
antsy like I there's no way I can meditate so but antsy this word is kind of a

164
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,640
vague description and we can might be able to

165
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:54,000
get a little bit quieter or pay a little bit of attention and to see oh yeah this

166
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,560
word antsy restless has different elements to

167
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:04,760
it might have this bodily sensation maybe there's this

168
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:13,920
uh sense of fidgeting fidgeting a lot or there's a sense of like the body i know

169
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:20,880
sometimes when I'm feeling restless or antsy I just find myself standing up like if I'm sitting down or even if I'm

170
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:26,000
get at my desk intending to focus on the task at hand I just find myself standing

171
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:32,240
up and going to do something else or so there's this like this uh energy

172
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:40,400
in the body perhaps kind of like this movement of wanting to move or if not standing up maybe it's felt as uh just

173
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:49,520
um like ping pongs bouncing around so that might be the physical experience

174
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:55,200
but then of course there's these mental elements maybe there's a sense of just

175
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:04,240
being really distracted that is not being able to land on one particular thought or or one particular

176
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:11,200
experience for example the sensations of breathing and then we find ourselves

177
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:18,599
like starting something and then doing this or that and not finishing and going to do that bouncing all over the

178
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:23,640
place either in meditation or in daily

179
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:31,040
life but then if we can pay a little bit more attention even so after the kind of

180
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:36,320
like separating the physical and the mental is there something else that we

181
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:42,000
can see see a little bit more clearly then we can see oh yeah there's

182
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,599
a sense of worried feeling worried about something and that's what's fueling that

183
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:55,119
feeling antsy so when we notice and name the different

184
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:03,200
elements that are happening or that are comprising our experience there can be a sense of relief a sense of like oh okay

185
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:08,560
I'm worried of course I'm worried i have to give this big

186
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:15,680
presentation tomorrow or my loved one is not feeling well or whatever it might be

187
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:23,839
but just being able to tease apart some of the different elements to name them can start to bring

188
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:30,160
some clarity and and start to make it feel a little bit more manageable this is so much about mindfulness practice i

189
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:35,240
think probably many of you already know this but this is we consider as kind of

190
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:42,720
wisdom is this ability to pull things apart and see more

191
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:48,400
clearly because the greater the distinctions we make about what's going

192
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,960
Excuse me here

193
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:12,720
so the greater the distinctions we make about what's going on the more choices we have about how we're going to relate

194
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:19,400
to our experience an example I just gave

195
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:25,040
being worried once we notice we're worried like "Oh okay of course I'm

196
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:31,760
worried." And somehow it takes some of the pressure off that things should be

197
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:40,079
different and then there's something else to distinguish and that is between our experiences with all of its

198
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:46,200
components being antsy and our reaction to that

199
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:51,599
experience our response to it every moment there's two things

200
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:58,119
happening there's what's happening and then there's our response to what's happening and to be able to tease those

201
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:06,000
apart also is one way we might think about wisdom and so there might be something

202
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,760
uncomfortable happening and then in in relationship to that uncomfortable

203
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,560
experience there might be some fear might be some aversion some blame some

204
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:23,040
anger and as long as we're focused on the actual experience we might not be

205
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:29,040
seeing the fear the blame the anger that's happening and to recognize

206
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:36,119
that the experience and the relationship to the experience are two separate

207
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:42,040
things and as I mentioned in the guided meditation it's not uncommon to have

208
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:47,280
aversion to things that are uncomfortable but then to have aversion

209
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:52,839
to the aversion and then to have the aversion that we have aversion to

210
00:42:52,839 --> 00:42:59,000
aversion so wherever we can disrupt that momentum is

211
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:05,440
helpful so just keeping in mind that can we sometimes it's helpful to pay

212
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:12,760
attention to our reaction to the our response to our experience not only our

213
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:18,640
experience so and then that aables enables us to make different choices

214
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:25,599
we're not just being um carried along by the tumbling along by the momentum of

215
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:33,079
what's happening so this ability to make some distinctions to simplify tease things

216
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:38,480
apart is one function of wisdom and it's not only just so that we can see more

217
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:46,400
clearly but to see more clearly allows us to make new choices to respond in

218
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:52,200
different ways and to respond in ways that are

219
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:56,520
helpful and supportive

220
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:04,400
but then there's also another way there's a number of different ways we might understand wisdom what I just

221
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:11,520
described is maybe um the garden variety that um is in our everyday lives

222
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:18,560
whether we're on the cushion or not but the Buddha's teaching is unique

223
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:25,200
amongst the great religions of the world and that it emphasizes wisdom

224
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:31,160
there's a real emphasis on wisdom in this tradition because the Buddha points to

225
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:36,200
ignorance as the deepest root of human

226
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:42,640
suffering whenever there's suffering underneath is ignorance it might be way

227
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:49,920
the ignorance might be really deep in there but underlying all of suffering is ignorance

228
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:56,160
and of course liberation is ultimately dependent on having some wisdom because

229
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:03,839
wisdom counteracts that ignorance so this personal insight into

230
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:09,880
the fundamental truth of things is the opposite of

231
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:16,760
ignorance it's another type of wisdom this personal insight this direct

232
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:24,240
experience it's not um it's not a knowledge about something though having

233
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:32,720
knowledge can help and can be a support and make it more likely that we will appreciate or help

234
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:42,319
create conditions when insights do arise but the wisdom as one way we might

235
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:49,760
think about it is knowledge and vision of things as they are it's commonly um stated that in the sutas and it's this

236
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:55,920
having this direct insight into the characteristics of phenomena the

237
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,838
qualities of all our experiences

238
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:09,440
but we normally assume that uh we understand things as they are i mean

239
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:17,680
what else is there more to see i'm here and there's these objects in front of me and I'm aware of the uh experience and

240
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:26,359
my reactions to the experience i'm aware of my bodily experience and my mental experience what else is there

241
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:34,079
so we normally assume or or believe that we know how things are but the say but

242
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:40,480
Buddhism says that the knowledge that we normally pride ourselves in but knowing

243
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:48,359
how things are is usually conceptual knowledge and or practical technical

244
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:56,200
knowhow different than direct experience different type of like really knowing

245
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:01,520
something i think probably all of us in our lives we

246
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:09,839
understand that people die that pets die but it's not until a loved one dies

247
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:16,839
that you really understand what that means that it takes on a whole different

248
00:47:16,839 --> 00:47:22,880
experience whole different meaning so that's what the Buddha is pointing to

249
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:27,960
here is like the experiential

250
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:35,160
knowledge because for Buddhism this true wisdom true wisdom like the deepest

251
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:41,119
wisdom maybe I should use that word the deepest or don't want to say that some

252
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:48,119
wisdom is untrue but the deepest wisdom is the absence of greed and

253
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:54,520
craving the deepest wisdom Wisdom is the absence of hatred and

254
00:47:54,520 --> 00:48:03,599
anger the absence of pride and conceit or the the deepest wisdom is

255
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:09,359
filled with love and compassion and it's filled with

256
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:15,280
simplicity and contentment and shows up as humility and

257
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:23,119
selflessness so for Buddhism that's kind of the expression of the deepest

258
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:30,240
wisdom and so the Buddhist texts some sometimes describe ignorance as being

259
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:39,920
like a like a mist that clouds over our clear seeing or something that covers or

260
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:47,960
dampens our spiritual lives or makes us see things in distorted ways

261
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:58,040
so ignorance is not um a terrible

262
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:04,720
um it's it's just it's like a covering something that's um obfuscating so that

263
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:09,839
we can't see clearly but with wisdom it's not that we

264
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:15,480
see these great mysterious esoteric uh

265
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:21,680
secrets instead we see the realities of our own lives the reality of our own

266
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:27,599
experience here and now and in fact uh some meditators might

267
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:32,640
think that okay the more mysterious and esoteric their meditative experiences

268
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:38,640
the better and sometimes are led down the wrong path chasing after some

269
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:46,480
meditative experiences but instead that with wisdom

270
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:52,480
we see the real nature of just our own experience the world of day-to-day

271
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:58,359
experiences that usually we aren't seeing

272
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:04,880
um because they not because that they're so difficult to see but because we

273
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:11,359
generally don't want to see them we are constantly um trying to hide

274
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:16,480
them from our view in some way or we're just intentionally not

275
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:22,640
looking at them and so what the part of this of

276
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:28,559
course is what you can imagine for those of you who are familiar with Buddhist teachings i'm talking about the three

277
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:35,520
characteristics of experience the three marks of of experience of all

278
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:43,880
phenomena so the first mark of experience that we can understand with wisdom with this penetrative insight is

279
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:49,400
impermanence ana and pi the second is

280
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:54,839
unsatisfactoriness which is duca in poly and then the third

281
00:50:54,839 --> 00:51:01,359
one not self there's a number sometimes people say nonself no self not self i'll

282
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:06,839
use not self anata is the poly

283
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:13,680
word so I've talking a little bit about these three characteristics that impermanence

284
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:20,319
is the listed first usually it's the gateway it's the door to the other

285
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:27,240
characteristics partly because it's the most evident it's the most obvious you ask anybody on the street do things

286
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:32,400
change do they last forever and everybody's going to say "Of course

287
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:38,559
things change things don't last forever." You might think that some

288
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:45,040
things last forever but they'll recognize that things change we all know this

289
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:51,839
but with um there can be some meditative experiences where there's this understanding of not only that things

290
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:56,960
change and end but that they're inconstant that there's kind of like

291
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:02,040
this flickering this fluttering that they're not as stable they're not as

292
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:07,599
solid as we take them to be they're not as stable they're not as

293
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:12,960
solid they're not as steady as we want them to be so we are kind of like

294
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:18,960
projecting onto them some steadiness because we all want to have

295
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:25,040
this sense of there's a place which can be safe and secure a safe harbor a place

296
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:32,559
where we might rest a place where there's everything is like we have it

297
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:38,079
all figured out in some kind of way and we can just rest

298
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:44,559
there but with reflection we understand that everything

299
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:51,680
that is impermanent cannot be a source of lasting

300
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:59,000
happiness of course things that are changing might be a source of fleeting

301
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:04,640
happiness but they can be a source of lasting happiness therefore they're not

302
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:13,200
really as satisfying as we would like them to be they aren't like a safe landing pad

303
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:20,920
landing spot so whatever is impermanent whatever is changing whatever is not

304
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:25,960
constant is necessarily

305
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:34,000
unsatisfactory and just a little bit not quite right or maybe we might sense it's

306
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,800
flawed in some way or it's defective in some

307
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:45,599
way and whether it's in a subtle way or a gross way it's tangled up with

308
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:52,319
suffering it's bound up with suffering suffering or dissatisfaction

309
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:57,799
two different words we might use for this poly word duka

310
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:04,440
and then when we recognize that all these things that are changing and permanent and are bound up with

311
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:10,480
unsatisfactoriness then we realize they're not worth clinging to they're not worth holding on to

312
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:16,079
because they're not going to be a source of lasting happiness so it's just natural that it

313
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:21,519
just happens that we no longer cling like there's a letting

314
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:28,079
go and then we just we are there's a releasing of the attachment we have to

315
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:34,680
the objects or experiences but there is one subtle

316
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:40,520
attachment that's really subtle that is difficult to let

317
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:47,680
go and that is this clinging to the experiences of body or mind and

318
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:55,839
identifying with them as this is mine this is me this is

319
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:02,160
myself so this is one attachment that's definitely more subtle and doesn't

320
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:09,000
readily get let go of we're always trying to establish some

321
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:16,559
personal permanent identity within ourselves something that we can say "Oh this is my true self this

322
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:25,240
is me i'm like this i'm not like that."

323
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:33,319
But Buddhism says that this uh idea of a self is the lynchpin is the

324
00:55:33,319 --> 00:55:39,880
crux of all the defilements it's kind of what keeps them all in

325
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:46,040
place this idea of mind that gives rise to craving it gives rise

326
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:52,319
to greed selfishness harm

327
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:57,760
this idea of me that gives rise to conceit and pride and always having to

328
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:04,400
bolster it up and protect it and make it look

329
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:12,680
good but the culmination of this of practice like the greatest

330
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:19,760
wisdom is this insight into the selflessness of all experiences the

331
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:26,838
selflessness of all all experiences

332
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:33,760
so this idea of a self I'm talking about selflessness we might say just a little

333
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:38,880
bit what do we this idea of a self we might consider it as maybe similar to an

334
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:46,240
idea of like an ego or a soul and we might we conceive of it as

335
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:53,119
something that's unique and constant and autonomous you know

336
00:56:53,119 --> 00:57:01,040
independent but what's in addition we conceive of the self as being vulnerable and so

337
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:08,640
we're always having to protect it and bolster it and then so often when we

338
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:14,400
hear about these teachings about not not self our initial reactions are mixed or

339
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:19,480
ambivalent because it seems so counter to our experience and it seems counter

340
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:27,559
to common sense and our our gut feeling says well of course there's a self I'm

341
00:57:27,559 --> 00:57:34,240
here so maybe we have this puzzlement or disbelief or discounting whatever it is

342
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:40,160
or discounting any teacher that happens to mention this like what are they talking

343
00:57:40,599 --> 00:57:44,960
about maybe we just think it's just

344
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:54,359
ridiculous but this journey this practice asks for open-mindedness and

345
00:57:54,359 --> 00:58:01,440
humility and maintaining this openness this uh this spirit of

346
00:58:01,559 --> 00:58:07,200
inquiry this wisdom I'm talking about is kind of like this uh teasing apart

347
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:12,799
having this discernment distinguishing so like seeing clearly maybe we can

348
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:22,920
tease apart some of the different elements of um our experience and our idea about the

349
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:30,720
experience the experience and the concept and the label that we're putting on top of it can we distinguish

350
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:37,200
those and and watch for those moments when we categorize what is happening by

351
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:44,839
saying "Oh this is me or that's mine." Or that we succumb to this me

352
00:58:44,839 --> 00:58:49,920
versus the world or us versus them

353
00:58:52,040 --> 00:59:00,000
thinking but this being able to distinguish the the sense of self and to

354
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:06,319
to distinguish between the an experience and the way that we're labeling it the

355
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:11,680
self is subtle it's very subtle and it might take a meditative state before we

356
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:19,720
can see it but wisdom the greatest wisdom is to see

357
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:25,520
that see things clearly not just on the surface layer

358
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:30,640
and not just what um is obvious and

359
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:35,799
easiest and the most comfortable but to

360
00:59:35,799 --> 00:59:43,319
investigate and to ask ourselves is what what is there something underneath

361
00:59:43,319 --> 00:59:49,119
This is there something underneath that's uh promoting the

362
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:56,640
suffering so that our wisdom can maybe shine the light onto

363
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:03,920
some ignorance something that we're not seeing so that the suffering can be

364
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:09,640
released the suffering can go away so

365
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:15,880
wisdom wisdom as the fourth part of me there's so much we could say about

366
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:22,720
wisdom and I'd like to offer today that it's about seeing clearly those things that are obvious as well as

367
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:28,599
investigating with an open mind some of those things that are underneath what's so

368
01:00:28,599 --> 01:00:34,440
obvious so that with wisdom we might find our way with things that are

369
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:42,599
difficult in our lives and in the lives of others so that our practice can be a

370
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:50,040
support for all beings everywhere thank you
