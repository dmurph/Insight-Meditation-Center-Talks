1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:06,319
good evening welcome welcome

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:16,560
wherever you might be whomever you might be a warm welcome

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,000
so we'll do a little bit of a guided meditation

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,480
coming into our meditation posture

5
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,800
in a relaxed easy manner

6
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:48,480
not forcing some stiffness but not being cavalier or casual

7
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:59,840
in terms of half-heartedness maybe is the better word

8
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:14,720
and can we sit whether that's literal or metaphorical

9
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,240
can we sit and know that we're sitting

10
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:41,840
what does this body sitting feel like right now

11
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:04,880
think about the body in just a general sense noticing the posture

12
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,680
noticing the pressure of whatever it is we're sitting on pressure

13
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:23,840
against the body

14
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,720
and maybe noticing a general

15
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,840
mood of the body

16
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:45,200
we could think of this in terms of energy does it feel like there's too much energy restlessness want to go

17
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:55,920
want to do anything except sit here not enough energy getting tired and

18
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:05,760
drowsy or maybe we're like goldilocks there's there's enough it's just

19
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:19,840
right just enough energy

20
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:47,840
and we can also tune into the more specifics about the body

21
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,439
and for this guided meditation

22
00:03:53,439 --> 00:04:01,840
we'll take a particular approach

23
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,760
that is we'll do a scan of the body

24
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:15,840
just noticing where are their pleasant sensations

25
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,639
the pleasantness might be very subtle

26
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,840
maybe the hands are touching something smooth

27
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:37,280
maybe it feels good to be grounded rooted connected to whatever it is

28
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,560
you're sitting on

29
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,520
maybe it feels nice to have this spine upright

30
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,720
i'm kind of jumping all around the body sometimes it's helpful to do a scan

31
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,320
from the top of the head down to the feet

32
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,840
just noticing the pleasant sensations

33
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:06,240
sometimes it's helpful to use a little label pleasant

34
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:21,840
you don't have to do that if it feels too cumbersome but it can be helpful

35
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,360
feeling the smoothness of the breath perhaps as being pleasant

36
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:49,840
maybe there's a little bit of a pleasant sensation with the stretching that happens with breathing

37
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:46,560
and we can do the same type of scan except this time

38
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,520
noticing the unpleasant sensations

39
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,720
maybe there's a knee that's a little uncomfortable

40
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:15,280
we can scan from the top of the head taking our time

41
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:22,720
not in any hurry and going down noticing

42
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:29,520
what's a little bit unpleasant or maybe greatly unpleasant

43
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,518
can we do this in a relaxed easy manner we don't have to

44
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:52,000
fix anything we don't have to make anything happen we're just categorizing

45
00:08:52,560 --> 00:09:09,839
the different sensations experiences

46
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:29,199
can we keep it simple just unpleasant

47
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:35,839
no need to go into the story about how you have to fix it or why it's

48
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:51,839
unpleasant just unpleasant

49
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:52,480
and then can we do this exercise of a body scan one more time

50
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:01,839
noticing what is neither pleasant nor unpleasant

51
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,360
what is neutral

52
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:15,839
these sensations might be very quiet

53
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:32,480
sometimes we might a little bit lost what do you mean neutral

54
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:42,079
earlobes most often are neutral unless they were recently pierced or

55
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,639
elbows

56
00:12:50,240 --> 00:13:06,560
the back of the arms in general without

57
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,600
straining without pushing

58
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:21,839
just noticing neutral sensations

59
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:14,880
and then just open it up to noticing whatever

60
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,160
sensations there are and noticing whether

61
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:28,399
they're pleasant unpleasant or neither pleasant nor unpleasant

62
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,839
neutral

63
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,519
you might feel that as we

64
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,320
gently label our experience sensations pleasant unpleasant or

65
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:01,600
neutral it really simplifies

66
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:09,438
our experience kind of disrupts the momentum of story

67
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:16,880
making or the proliferation of thoughts

68
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,438
just by saying oh this is unpleasant

69
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:32,559
supports the ending of this feeling that it has to be different

70
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:47,840
no it's just unpleasant

71
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:56,480
this simplifying might create some spaciousness

72
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,760
in our experience less busyness

73
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:15,840
in our experience

74
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,279
simplifying our experience

75
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:21,039
just noticing pleasant unpleasant neutral sensations

76
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:28,399
can be a way in which we can kind of settle down it takes a little

77
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:35,679
bit of attention a little bit of quietness to

78
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:44,960
notice the sensations the affective the hedonic quality of the

79
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:51,440
sensations and that way can simplify and

80
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,840
make more spacious our experience

81
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:03,679
and that way our capacity to be with difficult experiences increases as we learn this skill of

82
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:10,840
simplifying them found just too pleasant unpleasant or

83
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:16,640
neutral and this way of increasing our capacity

84
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:22,640
helps us help others so that we might be available

85
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:28,000
[Music] either in the midst of our own difficulties or

86
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,679
more general difficulties that societal difficulties or

87
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:42,720
maybe we could be available for them also for others in this way our practice

88
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:50,799
supports not only ourselves but others so may our practice be for the benefit

89
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:55,840
of all beings everywhere

90
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:09,929
[Music]

91
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,039
good evening good evening

92
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:55,519
and a warm welcome i'm happy to be here to be practicing with you all

93
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:06,799
so tonight i'd like to continue on this topic that i started last week this idea of vadena this polyword

94
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:13,919
that sometimes gets translated as feeling but really you know we tend to think of

95
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:21,200
feeling as emotions doesn't mean emotions it means

96
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,320
the hedonic quality it's not a word that i usually use in my

97
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:32,399
vocabulary hedonic but essentially is it

98
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:38,159
how is it related to pleasure is it pleasant is it unpleasant or is it neither

99
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:44,000
pleasant nor unpleasant i think that i think the word hedonia

100
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:52,880
maybe comes from the greek but hedonism right we often think about so vedana

101
00:31:52,880 --> 00:32:00,000
this pauli word probably the the best translation is hedonic tone

102
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,159
that translation is the best um descriptor but there's something

103
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:12,960
clunky and hedonic tone in my ear it sounds a little bit too much like demonic

104
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:21,600
and i don't want to be talking about demonic tone so vedana

105
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:28,159
vedana this is maybe it's best left untranslated sometimes

106
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:34,159
it's translated also as feeling tone i think that's a little bit better than feeling

107
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:42,480
just because so much in english we start to think sad lonely happy but that's not what

108
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:48,320
vedina is pointing to and last week i talked about how

109
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:54,240
practicing with vader as a way that can really help simplify our experiences

110
00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:01,919
and also about um i talked a little bit about pleasant experiences and how

111
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:08,159
we are often kind of chasing or uh maybe chasing us the right word after

112
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:13,200
pleasant experiences thinking that there will be sources of lasting happiness

113
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:19,440
and of course they aren't and the disappointment that arises with that

114
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:25,279
so some of you may know so i'd like to build on that and maybe flesh out some of the things

115
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:31,760
that i talked about last week so some of you may know that vedana actually shows up quite a number of

116
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:38,320
places in the buddhist teachings but we don't teach about it like those of us that sit

117
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:44,320
in the dharma seat tend not to teach about it that much i'm not exactly sure why

118
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:49,760
except that i will say that i don't know it just uh there isn't as much material in this

119
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:55,440
who does resent as much stories

120
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:02,320
around vedana but i'd like to spend a little time here

121
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:08,960
to talk some more about it some of you might know that i think i mentioned this last week also

122
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:17,040
that vedana is one of the four foundations of mindfulness in the sati patana suta so the discourse

123
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,960
that is most associated with the mindfulness practice that we do today

124
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,000
talks about establishing mindfulness in four different arenas

125
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,599
the first one is the body the in which we often are teaching about the breath and

126
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:41,599
the body the second one is vedana feeling tone hedonic tone the third one is the mind

127
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:46,800
mindfulness of mind and the fourth one is dharmas and

128
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:52,079
that gets translated different ways phenomenon or something like this

129
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:58,720
so we have these four ways in which mindfulness is established or four arenas in which mindfulness might be

130
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:04,560
established and as it happens that both in the spirit rock

131
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:11,200
and ims and irc imc all of these meditation centers when we

132
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:16,560
teach mindfulness we often teach mindfulness in four areas

133
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:23,520
breath body emotions and thoughts so it would be easy to think four

134
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:30,079
foundations of mindfulness in the discourses four areas of mindfulness being taught at

135
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:36,960
these retreat centers by a lot of different dharma teachers but they're not exactly the same

136
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:45,520
right because uh the in the foundations of mindfulness we have vedana but over here we have emotions

137
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:51,040
by saying over here i mean what the dharma teachers are often talking about

138
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:58,079
vedana is non-emotions emotions probably would is that just the

139
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:03,440
in the time of the buddha they categorized their experiences differently and they didn't really have

140
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:10,960
emotions the way that we understand of course they had emotions but they the way they talked about them

141
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,200
and understood them as different than how we do now

142
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:23,040
so i know plenty of people that have been confused about this thinking well there's these four areas in these four foundations but

143
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:29,440
they're not equivalent i'll say that vedina is also

144
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,640
in the 12 lengths of dependent or rising this is also an area in which we don't

145
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:39,760
teach that much about there's a number of reasons for this

146
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:45,119
i'll say for myself personally one is because 12 is a big number

147
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:51,760
to do in a dharma talk to list through 12 things seems you know that's a it's a great

148
00:36:51,760 --> 00:37:00,079
endeavor and it's just i don't think would be helpful or fruitful to go through 12 things

149
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:06,000
but what is helpful is just the principle of dependent arising as opposed to the 12 links

150
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,400
of dependent arising and the principle of dependent arising this not won't be

151
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,680
surprising to anybody here when one thing arises it causes

152
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:23,520
something else to arise when a arises b arises

153
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:31,920
when a goes away b goes away so the principle of dependent arising we teach but not so much the 12 links

154
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:38,079
and also vedina is one of the aggregates another topic that we don't teach that

155
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:45,359
much about maybe this will be a dharma talk that's only about what we don't teach

156
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:50,960
and i won't actually teach you anything i'll just list all the things that we don't teach about

157
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:57,520
i'll just say and the aggregates is which is a clunky translation but

158
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,880
um is one way that we might understand our all of our experiences different

159
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:08,960
components of our experiences so that's just a kind of introduction to

160
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:14,320
say like vedana even though it's really important and

161
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:20,640
can be a really a powerful practice and really supportive for lots of

162
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:26,240
freedom and i'll talk a little bit more about this today despite that it's often not talked about

163
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:31,440
in dharma talks so i talked a little bit about how

164
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,720
vedana is not emotions and it's often

165
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:42,400
we could think about it as hedonic tone but i will say that it arises in

166
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:48,079
response to sense contact what that means is

167
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:55,119
whenever the eye sees a sight when an ear hears a sound that tongue

168
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:02,320
tastes a flavor something like this so sense contact is when the senses have

169
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,839
contact with some object whenever that occurs

170
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:14,800
and the next beat is vedana whenever the eye sees something the next

171
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:20,480
beat is is it pleasant unpleasant or neutral

172
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:27,440
some people will say that neutral takes up like the most the majority of our experiences that we

173
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:34,559
don't notice there's so many things that are just details that we're not paying attention to

174
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:40,720
but this um it maybe i should say i'm talking about sense contact eyes in

175
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,760
sight but also mental events

176
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:53,680
some of you know that in the buddhist tradition that that mind is also a sense sensed or

177
00:39:53,680 --> 00:40:00,160
so every any mental event also can be pleasant unpleasant or neutral

178
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:07,200
and veda vedina arises it's just completely natural we can't stop it it's

179
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:12,319
something that just happens and i would say that it's a combination

180
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:20,240
of some physiological and psychological aspects or whether we

181
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:27,839
ex assign the label pleasant unpleasant or neither to an experience

182
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:33,839
that is it's if we injure ourselves i think probably biologically

183
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:38,960
physiologically that's unpleasant smelling rotting food is unpleasant

184
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:45,200
that's kind of like a biological response being hungry these types of things

185
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:53,760
but there's also a psychological aspect in terms of what mood we're in or what else is happening

186
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,680
maybe one i'll um say that those that know me know that i just am

187
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:06,079
committed to my coffee practice in the morning if we can call it that there's something about

188
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:13,920
a cup of coffee in the morning that i find very pleasant i just yeah i just really enjoy having a

189
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:21,119
cup of coffee in the morning i like the taste i like the temperature i kind of like the ritual of making

190
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:27,440
coffee it's a pleasant experience probably that little bit of caffeine too

191
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,720
has a as a role there and i often will have a second cup of

192
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:38,319
decaf coffee not long after the first cup sometimes you know it's just nice to

193
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:44,800
have a cup of something warm in the mornings even in the summer

194
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:52,160
but a third cup of coffee the coffee tastes bitter it

195
00:41:52,160 --> 00:42:00,079
just doesn't i don't know it's not as pleasant it's the same sense experience right my

196
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:06,160
tongue is having this tasting the same flavors but it's no longer as pleasant it's a little

197
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:12,800
bit unpleasant that third cup of coffee just doesn't i don't know why exactly but so i would

198
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:19,920
say that's kind of pointing towards some of the psychological elements too to vedana

199
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:27,599
so it's not entirely our biological response like you know amoebas of course they move

200
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:33,359
towards pleasant we could say that word pleasant things you know that are nourishing and

201
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:39,440
supportive and away from toxic things i would say that's more biological but

202
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:46,880
we also have this element that we add to it

203
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:53,359
and teasing apart what part is psychological in one part is physiological probably isn't

204
00:42:53,359 --> 00:43:00,560
important but what is important is to notice that the the pleasantness or the

205
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:08,240
unpleasantness or the neutrality does not lie within the coffee

206
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:15,040
it lies within the experiencer it's not inherent to the coffee

207
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:20,560
it's inherent to one who is having that experience to the sensation

208
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:25,200
or maybe i shouldn't say inherent it's associated with

209
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:32,800
sometimes we think that um some things are just always bad they're always unpleasant but

210
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,839
recognizing that you know maybe other people in other conditions

211
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:43,599
might think that they're fine food is a great example different cultures right uh different

212
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:51,760
things with food different what those people who were not raised in america my experience has been

213
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:57,920
do not like peanut butter but those of us who grew up in america love peanut

214
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:06,000
butter i don't know if we love it but you know for me it's associated with childhood and some goodness of some sort

215
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:12,319
so vedana is this the pleasant unpleasant neutral to

216
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:19,839
experiences but i think it's important to recognize that whether something is pleasant or unpleasant does not

217
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:27,440
belong to what were to the object out there it belongs to the experiencer the

218
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:33,520
subject here and so one other way that we might think

219
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:40,079
about veda is because it happens right after a sense contact in the next

220
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:47,200
beat is a way in which what the body is experiencing

221
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:53,280
whether that's a sight or the tactile sensation as i rub my hands

222
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:58,318
together for example it's a little bit warm and pleasant

223
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:04,640
and then in the next beat is the vedina pleasant unpleasant neutral

224
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:11,839
that's a mental event the pleasant unpleasant neutral so vedana in some way is this link

225
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:17,040
between what the body is doing what the body is experiencing

226
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:22,240
and the mental experience it's not the only link but it's a big

227
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:30,839
part of it so in some ways vedana is the intermediary of how the body and the mind are

228
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:36,079
connected and all of us know this right when we're

229
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:42,400
certainly when um there's an unpleasant experience in the

230
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:48,079
body that the mind might start like speeding up and trying to find a solution or

231
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:54,480
something like this or when there's a unpleasant thought in the mind then the

232
00:45:54,480 --> 00:46:00,960
body might um we might have a facial expression that's a frown or

233
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:08,880
a foreign of the brow or something like this so vedana is often the the link

234
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:15,359
maybe if i could use that word i said intermediary kind of like the medium the way in which body and

235
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:22,480
mind are connected and so this can be

236
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:28,319
a key way to understand how if we're going to make this distinction between body and mind

237
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:33,280
like how they really are connected also

238
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:40,960
and so one reason why we might think that the mind likes to do this like that veid in a

239
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:48,720
pleasant unpleasant neutral is because it's a way to categorize our experience

240
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:55,280
it's a way to maybe make sense of and all these things that are arising

241
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:02,640
that we're experiencing at once and of course we only pay attention to a subset of them

242
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:11,280
but the mind uses it vaden as kind of a filtration device not so much paying attention to

243
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:17,440
neutral we know that there's a negativity bias paying more attention to what's unpleasant

244
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,720
because that might be harmful and then paying attention to what's pleasant

245
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:28,800
so it's one of the like initial filtration devices that the mind does

246
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:34,960
and it's perfectly normal it's like beneath consciousness this uh labeling it's not

247
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:41,920
something that we're actively doing and so the goal of practice

248
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:50,880
is not to stop it from happening not to [Music] make it be different but just to notice

249
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:57,599
that things are pleasant unpleasant and neutral to use this as a place where we can bring some mindfulness

250
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:03,599
and i'll unpack this a little bit more here in a moment but i do want to say that when we do

251
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:10,880
notice them there's some things obviously that we'll notice

252
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:18,640
and the buddha talked about them in this passage in the discourses where the burrito says

253
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:24,559
suppose there was a guest house people come from the east the west the

254
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:30,319
north and the south and lodged there aristocrats brahmans merchants and

255
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:37,520
workers lodged there in the same way various feeling tones arise in this body

256
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:43,280
pleasant he's painful we could use that as a other

257
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:49,520
translation and neutral so just in the same way checking in and out of a hotel we could

258
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:54,960
see there's just people coming from all these different ways they check in they check out these types of people that type of

259
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:02,000
people tall people short people people wearing red shirts people wearing blue shirts or whatever it might be right

260
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:09,839
there's different ways we can categorize them so another way we might think of vedana as a way to the mind uses to

261
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:16,720
help make sense or help prioritize our experiences but importantly

262
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:22,400
they come and go they come and go of course they do

263
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:29,200
just like people checking in and out of the hotel we can't control them and there's

264
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:36,720
different types and they come and go so in some ways recognizing when we are

265
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:42,720
noticing vedana will notice that they are arising and

266
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:47,760
passing away and noticing the impermanence of them

267
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:56,000
can really affect our relationship to them because they are ephemeral not only are

268
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:03,920
they coming and going but they're insubstantial they're likened to um bubbles on their

269
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:10,559
on the surface of water when it's raining like in a body of water of course we don't like grab bubbles

270
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:16,400
expecting them to be there vade in us the same way

271
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:22,559
so noticing that they are impermanent coming and going

272
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:28,480
noticing that they're insubstantial there's they're not really tangible there's nothing really there to

273
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:36,160
grab onto just like a bubble then we stop trying to get all tangled

274
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:44,319
up with them we just naturally we don't have to make this happen it just naturally happens that we

275
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:52,559
disengage in some kind of way maybe we're still a little bit engaged but not as much we're not as entangled

276
00:50:52,559 --> 00:51:00,559
and it might be that we completely disengage from them so being mindful of them is a way that

277
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:08,000
we can become a little bit less entangled and why would we want to do that because

278
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,200
in these 12 lengths of dependent arising and probably you know this from your own

279
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:18,400
experience without my having to tell you vadena

280
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:24,640
conditions craving that is pleasant vedana

281
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:30,640
creates the conditions in which there's this leaning forward i want more

282
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:37,599
unpleasant faith in others is pushing away i don't want which is kind of the same

283
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:44,079
right a version is just the slip the flip side of desire a version is desiring something

284
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:50,800
different and then neutral vedana

285
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:58,240
often leads to some boredom or you know not really connecting

286
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:03,359
and then there's often either this boredom which is a form of a version really

287
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:11,839
so in some ways we could think of that as being a type of craving but boredom also kind of um

288
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:18,800
the mind often slips off and wants to go find something entertaining so then it kind of slips into craving so

289
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:24,000
in this way vedana conditions craving so some of you

290
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:31,280
might know the craving that um the pali word is tanha which is also understood as thirst so

291
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:38,240
this type of demanding this type of expectation or i kind of like this word

292
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:46,079
demanding that things be different i want more i want less something like this is

293
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:50,640
push and pull with our experience

294
00:52:52,480 --> 00:53:00,400
and the teachings tell us and our experience shows us

295
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:08,079
that this connection between something that's pleasant and full-blown craving or even

296
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:13,520
mild craving is a place where we can practice why would we want to practice why would

297
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:18,960
we want to get rid of craving maybe you all know this craving leads to

298
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:27,520
dukkha leads to suffering right craving is this maybe suffering is too strong a

299
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:32,800
word sometimes it is but maybe it's just this general dissatisfaction

300
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:40,079
and some i might even go so far as to say craving itself is a certain amount of duca it's a kind

301
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:45,280
of a contraction of i want something just having that feeling

302
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:50,240
is the opposite of a contentment of an ease

303
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:58,079
so a sense contact whether that's what the eye sees or a sound that the ear

304
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:06,960
hears naturally gives rights to vedana pleasant unpleasant neutral

305
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:14,319
veidenai gives rise to craving craving gives rise to dukkha suffering

306
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:21,119
and we can interrupt this momentum this movement with paying attention with

307
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:26,559
vedana this is the place which if we're aware of it

308
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:32,800
we can simplify it and it doesn't lead into craving and i played around with this not too

309
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:38,000
long ago when i had an unfortunate amount of dental work

310
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:46,079
recently and i remember uh thinking to myself this is unpleasant

311
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:52,720
yeah this is unpleasant that'd be being a big fan of a dental work i don't

312
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:58,640
know anybody that is but but just that saying this is unpleasant

313
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:05,040
kind of like calmed down this feeling of i have to get out of here what's happening you know there's this

314
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:12,799
when something is really unpleasant there often it can just grow and grow but just to say

315
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:19,040
this is unpleasant there's a way which could you kind of like let things calm down

316
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:27,440
quiet down and disrupt that movement that momentum to having this feeling like things

317
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:35,520
have to be different get me out of here or whatever it might be whatever it might be

318
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:42,079
it's striking how powerfully conditioned it is that when something is unpleasant

319
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:47,680
to have some of this naturally to have some aversion to want to push it away

320
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:55,440
but it is a habit and it that we can train ourselves

321
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:02,240
to not have it to be as strong and probably all of you have experienced

322
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:07,440
this with a meditation practice that as the mind quiets as the mind gets

323
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:12,720
settled that our capacity to be with things that are either

324
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:21,280
really pleasant some of the joy and happiness that can arise in meditation or some of the what i call body duka

325
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:28,400
some uncomfortableness in the body that might arise our capacity to just hold that

326
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:34,240
and not have it lead into a storyline i got to get out of here i want more of

327
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:39,280
this whatever it might be our capacity to do

328
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:45,280
that increases with practice with meditation

329
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:53,119
as we practice with being noticing a vedana

330
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:59,838
and noticing the subtle vedana and simplifying down to pleasant unpleasant neutral

331
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:07,920
makes it so much easier to be with whatever's arising and then we don't get so tangled up and

332
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:13,599
when we're less tangled up then the intensity of whatever it is that we're

333
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:18,720
experiencing calms down goes a little bit down

334
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:24,880
and it ends up it can be a very helpful cycle which when the less

335
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:29,359
reactive we are the less

336
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:38,079
um i want to use like it the less it promotes whatever that's the less pleasant or

337
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:47,280
less less the problem-ness maybe i could say out of the experience drains out and in fact

338
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:55,200
that vaden i could switch what's unpleasant can become pleasant when the mind is

339
00:57:55,200 --> 00:58:01,920
quiet what's unpleasant can also become pleasant we could play around with this

340
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:09,119
i know on some retreats i've had some plenty of experiences when the mind is

341
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:14,880
quiet i'm just sitting and i remember so clearly this one time having this

342
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:23,040
thought like wow if i weren't meditating this would be painful

343
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:30,799
but instead it just was kind of fascinating experience and just this recognition that

344
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:37,359
it's not painful now it's just a sensation but if i weren't

345
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:43,200
meditating it would a different vedan i would get associated with it

346
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:50,000
and therefore different craving so vedana this can be this really

347
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:56,400
powerful place to practice a because it simplifies things and as part of this simplification

348
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:02,799
it interrupts this momentum towards dukkha this momentum

349
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:09,520
towards unsatisfactoriness so i don't know how many times i said

350
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:15,280
the word vedana quite a few times as opposed to feeling

351
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:20,799
tone or hedonic tone but consider this as a place to practice and

352
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:26,240
in the guided meditation we could do this we could practice just with the bodily experience

353
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:32,880
just noticing is it pleasant unpleasant or neutral and just giving a little

354
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:39,440
label a quick little label and this way we can

355
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:47,119
bring the problem-ness out of our experiences we can simplify it down

356
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:53,200
pleasant unpleasant or neutral and may this be a support for your

357
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:58,839
practice so it can be a support for all beings

358
00:59:58,839 --> 01:00:06,319
everywhere thank you
