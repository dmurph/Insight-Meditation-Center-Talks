1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,759
so hello hello and welcome everyone to happy hour

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:13,019
happy to see you so so for tonight's guided meditation

3
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:21,180
um I'd like to invite us to explore the marriage of meta

4
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:27,740
or love with wisdom love plus wisdom

5
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:33,300
equals equanimity Equanimity is a practice where the

6
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:39,480
Brahma vihara is the cultivations of the heart kindness

7
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:46,920
um compassion joy for Joy of others uh meets wisdom in

8
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,440
fact all the Brahma viharas need the factor of wisdom to be balanced not to

9
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,739
Veer into the extremes for say compassion not to become

10
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,960
um just Agony and pain just feeling the pain of others without the sense of

11
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:10,020
balance um or say wisdom is needed so that meta

12
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:17,700
or love doesn't become attachment or grasping oh I'm going to wish you well so that you're going to really be well

13
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,880
okay are you well yet I've been wishing you well for five minutes or the attachment of I'm going to love you so

14
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:30,720
you love me so wisdom supports the the balance of all the

15
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,060
these practices of the heart and

16
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,579
really the fourth Brahma vihara so the the four Brahma viharas just as a review

17
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:47,820
the four of them as you know them already before practices of the heart the first one being meta loving kindness

18
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,759
second one being compassion karuna third one being vicarious joy happiness or

19
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,860
happiness of others the the fourth one being Equanimity

20
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,219
um really Equanimity is where um

21
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:09,840
wisdom this this sense of of um

22
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,940
clarity not veering into neither falling into

23
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:23,819
nor with with attachment nor pushing away with with aversion

24
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:30,780
um it's so equipoise Equanimity is where wisdom of being with things as they are

25
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:38,220
becomes to full fruition with care with meta with care because if Equanimity

26
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,920
didn't have care in it it would become aloofness it would become like oh yeah

27
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:52,500
things are as they are whatever I don't even care but that's not Equanimity that's aloofness and and sometimes we

28
00:02:52,500 --> 00:03:00,180
can confuse many of us actually do confuse aloofness like oh yeah I'm just being quantums whatever which also can

29
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:07,800
be spiritual bypass watch out for that in your practice with true Equanimity which which holds

30
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:13,739
with mixed space for things as they are so

31
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:21,659
if there are questions that have come up it's okay please sit with the questions uh well as you all know we'll have time

32
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:28,140
for uh Reflections and questions later but I think that's enough for

33
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:35,459
setting the stage for what I want to say and um let's just practice together as I'll

34
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:41,120
have invitations for us to explore the space together so

35
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,680
so let us begin with this land

36
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:53,879
let us land in our bodies on if you need to move at this point

37
00:03:53,879 --> 00:04:00,080
either move your body so that you find comfortable position

38
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:09,379
rolling your shoulders back or need to move from your chair to your cushion

39
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,440
really taking care of the body what does the body need right now to sit

40
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:24,199
to sit comfortably with a sense of brightness

41
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:32,940
or if you're lying down with a sense of integrity could be standing up too not a problem

42
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,880
see if that is what your body needs

43
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:45,440
ah and softening relaxing letting go

44
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:53,719
Let It Go I think of the shoulders

45
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:00,199
letting go of the

46
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:09,680
holding tightness in your back

47
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:19,460
tightness in your forehead in your jaw

48
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,580
tightness in your chest

49
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:58,160
kindness in your abdomen

50
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,660
any tension in the sit bones and the legs feeling grounded

51
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:15,020
connected to the Earth with your feet your sit bones

52
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:22,380
and releasing releasing thoughts all that has come before so much is

53
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:30,620
happened today already or might be happening later today

54
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:36,860
letting go of planning mind remembering mind

55
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:44,280
no problem [Music] they are helpful but not right now

56
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,100
not right now thank you not right now

57
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,620
not now not now

58
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:20,780
not now not now not now

59
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:36,660
and let the breath move through the body let attention let awareness connect with

60
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:43,020
the breath the entirety of the breath the entirety

61
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,638
of the in-breath and the out breath

62
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:56,720
Let each breath empty you

63
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,599
empty empty empty empty empty

64
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:11,039
not with force not fighting content but your devotion with your Devotion to

65
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:19,020
loving the breath just this breath loving it notice Devotion to this breath can empty

66
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:24,900
you without you trying to empty it just happens

67
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:31,160
through loving feeling devoted to this breath

68
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,440
this in breath this out breath

69
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:25,339

70
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:05,760
Letting Go letting go lovingly thank you not now

71
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:14,160
I'm giving my heart to this practice right now I'm giving my complete heart

72
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,220
my devotion just being present in this moment with

73
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,699
this breath

74
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,740
thank you

75
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:03,300
can you imagine that each breath was calming you

76
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:12,079
is this elixir that is calming and settling you

77
00:12:54,779 --> 00:13:01,040
maybe with each breath there is more space in your heart

78
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,860
space in your body

79
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:20,160
as if your body were a fluffy cloud with each breath

80
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,839
feeling more space

81
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:33,609
space molecules [Music]

82
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:52,339
in your heart and your body and your mind and all of your body

83
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:59,040
upper body lower body too feeling lighter

84
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,240
more porous

85
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:12,120
breaths in breaths South breaths don't need to be effortful

86
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,860
let them happen on their own

87
00:14:55,019 --> 00:15:01,560
then your thoughts arise let them be light like a helium balloon

88
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,720
can they float away right now

89
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:13,459
Without a Trace only lightness

90
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,459
space remaining

91
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:12,860
and maybe with this breath and with each breath

92
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:25,279
maybe there is a whisper it's okay it's okay

93
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,860
a sense of expansiveness of it's okay

wisdom of spaciousness a wise a wide perspective

110
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:33,059
grander grander than our usual limited vision

111
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:37,399
that can get fixated tight

112
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:42,539
unbalanced unmoored

113
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:54,440
there is so much more that our vision our perspective can hold

114
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:04,039
or the age breath it's okay it's okay

115

and notice it's okay is kind it's not a Louvre it's kind

117
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:36,500
same way that maybe if a child is

00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:45,960
upset the parent the caretaker has a wise and

119
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:51,240

can you hold the not liking the aversion with equanimity

130
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:28,559
new version can be the child that is upset I don't want to

131
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,360
and you have equanimity

132
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:45,679
spaciousness with the aversion with the resistance

133
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,200
let it be held wisely widely with care

134
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,659
not believing it falling into it not resisting it

135
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:04,820
not adding more aversion to a version

136
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,539
it's okay

137
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,380

145
00:28:56,039 --> 00:29:03,259

146
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,460
not to be bothered by it

by being making space to be with what

155
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:18,019
arises just as it is

156
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:28,340
we cultivate more strength in our heart more courage

157
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:39,860
more stability more care

158
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:53,840
not turning away distracting ourselves

159
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:23,480
as we bring this sitting to her clothes

160
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:33,299
to hold with Equanimity with spaciousness mind like the sky heart

it's okay we've done our best we've showed up

164
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:06,200
trusting trusting that we're planting seeds of stability of care

165
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:14,580
with every moment of staying

166
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:18,020

167
00:34:21,419 --> 00:34:26,658

169
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:41,878
lives to support them the jewel of equanimity

00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:48,919
may all beings everywhere including ourselves be free

171
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:15,559
thanks everyone thanks for your practice

172
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:21,960
ah well I feel more equanimous I don't know about you I feel more calm and

173
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:28,980
peaceful and spacious so we have a few minutes

174
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:36,660
and uh I hope in chat you're welcome to raise your hand your Zoom hand because

175
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:42,540
if it's your physical hand I won't see you there are many of us um

176
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:49,200
you want to share a report of the field practice

177
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:55,260
of what's what arose for you um Michelle I think I actually you're

178
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:00,980
one of the only people I do see in the small strip and I do see your head so please

179
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:09,359
um yeah um I was feeling um a lot of fear about an issue in my

180
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:18,140
life and um so to hold that with care and compassion

181
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:25,260
um is just saying oh it's okay it's okay to feel this

182
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:32,660
I'm making space for this so I I'm my question is I'm not clear on

183
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:38,940
how to hold an intense emotion with care

184
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:43,819
yeah yeah that's a very good question

185
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:50,099
so I'm gonna borrow a page from Gail's Book

186
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:56,400
for a moment because what he likes to say and I love the saying the way he puts it he often says you know let your

187
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:04,200
fear feel safe let your fear feel safe so so the idea is similar here that that

188
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:10,680
you are you know when we have a strong emotion when you brought up fear so let's talk about fear there could be any

189
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:17,460
other emotion fear here um and when it arises there is a sense

190
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:24,980
of of feeling seized up seized up it's it's all there is it's the the entire

191
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:32,640
visual like like the vision you know the visual field if there was a visual fit the entire field of knowing it's like it

192
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,859
becomes contracted that's all there is it's not that the fear is so great it's

193
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:45,000
not that it's that the our space of knowing has contracted right so that's

194
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,220
all we get to know it's like oh my God this is so overwhelming what's gonna happen ah what am I gonna do when

195
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:56,460
they're gonna like Ah that's all we perceive right especially with fear and

196
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:02,880
with all their emotions so so um so instead with this practice what I was

197
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:10,800
pointing to is to first open up have a sense of spaciousness in the in the

198
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:16,680
field of knowing oh yeah the breath oh yeah first you stabilize yes you

199
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:22,020
stabilize you expand the field of knowing and then oh yes there is fear

200
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:29,099
the fear is coming up but fear is is in a way it's being cut to size it's not it

201
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:34,440
doesn't capture everything oh yeah in my life there's also Joy there's also care

202
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:40,380
there's also love there's also this there's also gratitude like there are all these things oh yeah and fear is

203
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:46,560
there too okay all right fear there's a lot of space to hold you and I'm not

204
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:52,079
going to push you away because it's okay you can be here yeah it's all right

205
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:58,740
gratitude can be here fear can be here too and that actually that sense of care

206
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:05,160
that sense of spaciousness and care it changes our relationship to fear fear

207
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:12,599
might still be there it may go away it may not but we're not doing this practice to make the fear go away that

208
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:19,320
is really important we're not doing this practice to make the fear or anything else go go away it's a shift in

209
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:25,820
perspective the other fear can still be there but it doesn't scare you anymore

210
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:32,880
becomes really interesting does that make sense let me show what

211
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:38,880
I'm talking about yes I see yeah you're welcome to unmute or not it's all

212
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,920
good thank you yes that was very uh clear and helpful thank you so much

213
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:50,099
you're so welcome thank you yeah

214
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:56,040
any other questions reflections of what came up for you

215
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:02,400
foreign Sarah

216
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:08,640
there hi hi everyone Hi Sangha

217
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:13,980
um so I've been dwelling on this question for a couple of days

218
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:19,820
and it's because I'm I'm a first year teacher this year within a middle school

219
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:28,260
and I have been noticing some very immense gaps from between who I think I

220
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:36,240
am with my loving kindness practice and out in the world and then in the classroom when I lose my patience and I

221
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:43,320
get upset and I do things what that I look back and I'm like how could I have done that that is that doesn't that's

222
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:51,300
not me at all and I'm like kind of struggling with this perceived gap of like my the heart

223
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:56,520
that I know that I have when I sit and when I'm you know

224
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:03,540
like not in stressful situations and then when I am and these uh these very

225
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:08,940
new situations so I was wondering if you could comment on that a little bit those

226
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:15,359
like gaps and being out in the world and this perceived self that that I have

227
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:22,260
yeah yeah yeah thank you Sarah thank you so much for that question and and the

228
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:27,960
the beauty and you know the vulnerability of that question because it's not just you this is this is The

229
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:33,960
Human Condition right this is this is us right we have this intention which is

230
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:40,800
beautiful I hear what you're Sharing kindness goodness and and when you're in

231
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:47,660
a very stressful situation and being a first-year teacher I can only imagine how difficult the situation

232
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:55,440
must be with with youngsters um so so various things various

233
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:01,740
um invitations here so so one is um

234
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:07,820
first to have instead of you didn't say this but just just to um say not to

235
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:14,760
self-flagellate when there's a sense of wow how could I do that oh my goodness I raised my voice and I lost like oh my

236
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:21,359
God that is not helpful it's so instead oh sweetheart you must have been really

237
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:26,700
stressed okay yeah this was hard this was really hard for you this was really

238
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:34,160
hard for you because that if you if you self-flagellate if you kick yourself it becomes harder it really that that Gap

239
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:39,359
acknowledging that Gap becomes harder and and also doing something to support

240
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:45,599
it becomes harder but self with self-compassion actually you take more responsibility just as you have because

241
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:51,660
there is a sense of uh care like oh yeah this is hard like that was a hard day my

242
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:57,480
goodness that was a hard day I was hungry my blood sugar was low and that kid was screaming and the other one's

243
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:04,079
sorry oh sweetheart that was really hard okay all right well it's good that you didn't scream twice you just screamed

244
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:09,240
once okay let's let's just say right so so starting there

245
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:16,260
and then and then um it might be after the fact when you

246
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:21,420
think about the day that after you hold yourself with a lot of kindness and

247
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:26,700
forgiveness okay sweetheart yeah I have this intention and yeah this is what happened it's okay it's all right I'm

248
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:33,240
doing my best if it could have been any different it would have been I'm learning okay settled that's number one

249
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:40,440
and it's huge it's really huge to have that container really set the container

250
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:46,980
of self-compassion first number one number two think okay what happened again with

251
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:53,520
self-compassion okay what happened all right the height of the intention oh wait I was I hungry was I stressed was

252
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:58,980
that just like what was going on like try to get a sense of oh these are the

253
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:04,079
situations that really press my buttons okay so what can I what can I do so so

254
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:09,119
that when the situation so then when it arises maybe you recognize it not after

255
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:15,359
you know first maybe you recognize it after two hours then you recognize it after one hour then you recognize it

256
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:21,180
after 30 minutes then five minutes then at some point you'll recognize it while

257
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:26,579
it's happening well here it is my buttons are being pushed and also with

258
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:32,880
mindfulness of the body that's another thing that you need to strengthen with your practice really be aware because so

259
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:39,119
that so that before you get to that boiling point there's a sense of okay I'm I'm going

260
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:45,119
over the edge okay I know what the signals are my heart starts you know my my heart starts to race and my Palms

261
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:52,020
start to start or whatever it is for you you get to know it before it happens like all right this is time to say time

262
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:57,480
out like okay put your heads on the on the snap time or whatever it is I I need

263
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:03,720
time up right so it can happen little by little but it'll take time and you're

264
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:09,240
not bad you're not wrong it's just a stressful situation you're learning and

265
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:15,380
you'll come through more compassionate and kinder um

266
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:21,980
through the other side and the other side Sarah thanks so much for the question yeah

267
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:30,000
so so the time has come for us to turn our attention to

268
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:37,200
um practicing together care with kindness with Equanimity in small groups

269
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:45,079
breakout groups of size roughly three and um the invitation is to

270
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:51,839
share maybe just one nugget about what what's the ports you to have Equanimity

271
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:57,380
what supports you and what actually challenges you to have Equanimity so

272
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:03,540
inspired by the question that Sarah brought in what supports you and what challenges you so maybe you go around

273
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:09,420
once maybe you talked about what challenges you let's talk about what challenges you first

274
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:16,200
um and then maybe go go around one more time and talk about what supports you

275
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:21,960
um so um and each person will just say one nugget and

276
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:28,980
you'll go around and round a few times hopefully so I am going to create the

277
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:34,079
rooms uh hold on one second having trouble

278
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:39,540
yeah Okay rooms are created okay so take care of each other take care of

279
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:44,960
yourselves and uh here we go

280
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:51,300
okay the rooms are closed everybody's back we have uh well we don't really

281
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:58,740
have any time unless there is a burning um reflection or question just do squeeze

282
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:06,599
in very quickly at the end yeah and somebody typed me a question a typed a question uh Jerry I'll stay and

283
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:13,260
answer afterwards so let's uh let's close let's close thank you all for your

284
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:19,560
practice for showing up for cultivating kindness and and wisdom Equanimity for
