3
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,640
i'd like to invite us to work with the theme that

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,560
i've introduced in the past and tonight again we'll we'll work with it from yet

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:36,160
another angle from another perspective and that is to treat ourselves the way we would treat a

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:42,559
beloved other the way we would treat a beloved other

7
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:49,360
we're often kind to people we're kind and loving to the people we care about

8
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:55,760
we maybe we cook for them with just an additional sense of care kindness

9
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,600
maybe we we are considerate of them oh how are you doing

10
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,200
you know just very very caring very loving of them uh we honor them

11
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,760
we recognize them we you know the way we treat a beloved other with care

12
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:20,240
with love with respect we give them our time we give them our time

13
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,439
we sit and listen unhurriedly we don't go okay are you done yet are you done

14
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,479
being sad now are you done being whatever like okay i gotta go there's a

15
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,759
sense of i'm here for you i care for you your pains are important well your body

16
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,880
is hurting what can i do for you so the sense of care the sense of love

17
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,079
the sense of affection so what if what if we treated

18
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:53,280
ourselves like a beloved other we treated ourselves like a beloved other

19
00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:00,560
and the guided meditation i will invite that perspective and also for our daily life

20
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:07,759
which you know this practice is also for the daily life um what if we brought that same perspective

21
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:13,680
to tonight when we take ourselves to bed

22
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,400
uh when when you are putting yourself to bed what if what if

23
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,959
it were as if you're putting this beloved others imagine you had this child this precious precious child and

24
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:32,160
you're putting them to bed how would you tuck them in how would you perhaps even plant a

25
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,480
little kiss on their forehead or maybe if you're brushing their teeth you wouldn't be doing it like

[Music] up and morgan

196
00:40:54,560 --> 00:41:03,520
please i have a little conflict nikki

197
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:11,119
it's all welcome oh thank you so much i am during that i was so i got so aware of

198
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:18,160
there actually not being a self and that my emotions and my thoughts

199
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:26,240
were just conditioned experiences that were part of nature but weren't

200
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:31,680
a part of a self so i and it was

201
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:37,200
it was not disconcerting but it was

202
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:44,480
like what do i do with that knowing

203
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:49,839
that this is a conditioned experience just the result of causes and

204
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:57,040
conditions and then how do you relate to the the self and the nut

205
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:02,880
yeah yeah yeah great question i'm so glad you brought it in yeah

206
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:09,920
wonderful question how do we bring both of those insights together how do we

207
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:16,640
yes it's it's um it's a both and it's at both end

208
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:21,039
absolutely at both end so

209
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:28,480
so there you know there are so many levels of seeing

210
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:34,800
phenomena reality understanding and one does not negate the other

211
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,839
i think that's the thing i would encourage you when that comes up say oh i see you

212
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:46,400
thank you you know when did not self arise it's like yes but that doesn't negate it's not like it's a that is

213
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:52,000
better than this see that that is where the dichotomy or or a false

214
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,920
understanding can come in that somehow the ultimate reality view is better or

215
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:04,319
super or better place to hang out than the relative reality both have their values

216
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:10,560
both are this just as important and there's a time

217
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:15,920
that's important to to rest in the ultimate and there's a time that's

218
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:23,599
wholesome beautiful important to rest in the relative

219
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:30,319
does that help thank you yes it does thank you yeah thank you morgan that's lovely

220
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:35,599

221
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:41,280

222
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,720
with my arms wrapped around myself very caring that's lovely thank you and one

223
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:53,200
more reflection privately my child self was very upset with me that i haven't been taking good

224
00:43:53,200 --> 00:44:00,880
care of myself i had to hold a lot of her rage during the set yeah yeah and that's okay too

225
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:09,839
thank you for bringing that up because it's all welcome it's all welcome sometimes it is that rage and what i'm

226
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:16,640
actually really touched by in this share is that you held a lot of her rage you you're

227
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:23,040
like oh done with you like oh sweetheart okay yes i i hold you yes you're angry it's okay sweetie it's all right it's

228
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:28,560
okay and that is a part of of re-parenting re-parenting ourselves

229
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:34,720
so thank you for sharing that and thank you for hanging in there with with the rage of the little one

230
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:40,960

232
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:59,040
i just wanted to thank morgan for her uh question because um it helped me to like when i

233
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:07,200
reflect back i feel that um you know i was able to imagine and visualize my child's

234
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:12,640
self but it just didn't hold as much emotional charge as that time and i

235
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:18,400
think the way you spoke about both like i could see what morgan was

236
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:25,200
saying and i can see what you're saying and yeah just you know you know what i'm

237
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:31,200
saying like time has passed and it doesn't feel as charged as yeah it's as

238
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:37,599
as that time yeah you know like a lot of healing has happened yeah which is beautiful also

239
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:42,880
yeah and to hold that with respect and also holding this adult self that is in

240
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:49,599
a different place yeah yeah thank you melissa
