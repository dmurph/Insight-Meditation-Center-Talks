1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,360
good evening again

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,839
good morning good afternoon whenever it

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:06,560
is you're

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,760
listening and a warm welcome

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,360
so today i'd like to talk about a topic

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,080
is

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,000
something that um maybe for some of us

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,680
isn't our favorite topic

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,279
let's say this i know it certainly

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,760
wasn't my favorite topic

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,760
before i actually kind of shied away and

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,040
felt uncomfortable with it and

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,440
maybe even a little bit angry about it

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,480
and

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,360
some kind of way

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,239
and that is to maybe build a little bit

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,160
on what this

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,000
on the guided meditation this idea of

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,360
confidence

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,399
that comes as we the more we practice it

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,680
grows and really can be a support for us

22
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,920
but that's not what was making me angry

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,800
or people shy away from

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,760
but sometimes the word faith is used

25
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,640
rather than the word confidence

26
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,640
sometimes we might also use the word

27
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,920
trust or

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,560
conviction

29
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,000
but i thought i would unpack this a

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,040
little bit for us

31
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,520
and explore and examine and tease apart

32
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,560
some of these different parts or these

33
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,320
different elements of faith

34
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,720
trust confidence conviction

35
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,520
and specifically to say that the topic

36
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,360
of faith can be difficult for some

37
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,280
people because

38
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,479
it's associated with mindless

39
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,000
belief perhaps with this idea

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,759
that we have to proclaim allegiance

41
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,880
to a particular doctrine or creed or

42
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,240
something

43
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,640
and not only do we have to proclaim an

44
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,759
allegiance

45
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,119
but then we will be judged by this judge

46
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,119
ourselves or maybe we're judged by

47
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,640
others

48
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,000
by one's degree of

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,119
compliance or one's degree of

50
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,879
belief or something like this

51
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,319
so when we use faith in a buddhist

52
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,360
context it's

53
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,280
very different from this very different

54
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,080
but it's natural of course that we might

55
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,560
um

56
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,319
have some different associations with

57
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,000
this word

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,200
with the whole concept the whole idea

59
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,760
of faith

60
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,200
but faith is a part of buddhist practice

61
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,160
it's just not

62
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,800
this kind of faith where that's we have

63
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,080
to

64
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,640
pledge an allegiance to a doctrine or

65
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,800
something like that

66
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,000
but um maybe i'll start with this

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,720
little a quote of bef that the buddha

68
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,200
gave

69
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,400
before he was a buddha

70
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,120
so he talks about faith here but clearly

71
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,000
it can't be

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,159
faith in buddhism or faith in

73
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,879
him or something like this because he's

74
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,159
not a buddha yet

75
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,920
when he's saying this and

76
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,200
where it's in the context of

77
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,560
the commenting how the buddha wished

78
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,360
everyone a better life he wanted people

79
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,319
to have a good life

80
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,360
and it was summarized in this verse

81
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,360
faith morality learning intelligence

82
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,760
restraint and justice much good else

83
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,319
wealth possessions partners and children

84
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,760
flocks kin friends colleagues

85
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,760
health beauty and happiness

86
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,400
these things he wished for others that

87
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,040
they might

88
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,560
keep and never lose

89
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,439
so faith is here at this beginning of

90
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,200
this long list

91
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,760
of all these desirable things that

92
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,680
people might have in their life and

93
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,680
he was wishing that everyone might have

94
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,360
this

95
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,599
so clearly faith here isn't um

96
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,439
isn't maybe what we're thinking it might

97
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,439
be instead it's

98
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,479
goes with the possessions partners and

99
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,199
children and health beauty and happiness

100
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,479
so what what is faith and the way that

101
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,040
it's

102
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,360
here and how might we consider it in the

103
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,319
buddhist practice

104
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,759
well i'd like to suggest that faith has

105
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,759
different aspects maybe you won't be

106
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,759
surprised to hear that

107
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,680
and we can consider some of these

108
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,199
different aspects

109
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,880
in one aspect is that it has

110
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,919
a relational practical

111
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,120
cognitive value to it

112
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,320
that is it provides motivation to

113
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,040
do something that it's underlying like

114
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,160
activity or

115
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,520
action it's like a readiness to do

116
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,560
something

117
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,680
with the belief with the confidence

118
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,400
that this thing that you're going to do

119
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
will lead to

120
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,560
go in a particular direction that you'd

121
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,120
like to go

122
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,880
so one aspect of faith is kind of a

123
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,680
mobilizing force as a way to

124
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,800
stir up the energy maybe to

125
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,440
do something because you have a belief

126
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,039
that what you're about to do

127
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,840
will be supportive for you and your

128
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,880
practice

129
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,160
and we can see that um in in one

130
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,280
particular

131
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,520
um quote from the dhammapada

132
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,120
where faith is associated with diligence

133
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,400
and it's uh um

134
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,680
it's contrasted with laziness and

135
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,479
sluggishness

136
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,720
so this um two little verses here in the

137
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,840
dhammapada

138
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,160
says whoever lives focused on the

139
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,360
pleasant

140
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,319
senses unguarded and moderate with food

141
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,319
lazy and sluggish

142
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,280
will be overpowered by mara as a weak

143
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:17,759
tree

144
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,120
is bent in the wind so overpowered by

145
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,600
mara

146
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,080
mara we can understand is this

147
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,919
personification of things that get in

148
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,039
the way of awakening

149
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,800
so being focused on the pleasant senses

150
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,919
unguarded

151
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,960
and moderate with food lazy and sluggish

152
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,600
these are help or help create the

153
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,120
conditions in which

154
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,800
things will hinder will be an obstacle

155
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,919
to greater freedom and then the next

156
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,199
verse

157
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,560
says the opposite whoever lives

158
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,680
focused on the unpleasant so

159
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,199
we're not saying that we have to focus

160
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,880
on the unpleasant all the time

161
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,759
it's just uh countering focused on the

162
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,960
pleasant

163
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,599
so it's this recognition that there's

164
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:08,160
pleasant

165
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,639
and unpleasant and neutral in our

166
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,759
experience

167
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,599
but sometimes we're always only focused

168
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,800
on the pleasant

169
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,360
whoever lives focused on the unpleasant

170
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,120
senses guarded

171
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,319
that means to not always be

172
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,560
if we know that it's the equivalent of

173
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,080
if you know you don't want to eat a lot

174
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,000
of cookies not going down the cookie

175
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,400
aisle in the grocery store

176
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,319
if you know that you really need to

177
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,440
sleep more

178
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,039
it's not starting that movie at

179
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,800
midnight that you're going to watch or

180
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,599
something like this

181
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,960
whoever lives focused on the unpleasant

182
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,400
senses guarded

183
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,560
moderate with food faithful and diligent

184
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,000
will not be overpowered overpowered by

185
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,720
mara

186
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,520
as a stone mountain is unmoved by the

187
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,440
wind

188
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,720
so in this verse faithful and diligent

189
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,520
counters in the earlier verse lazy and

190
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,800
sluggish

191
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,800
so it's this way in which we can

192
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,919
consider faith as a way that

193
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,080
provides some motivation some

194
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,919
inspiration

195
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,960
to act to do something

196
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,479
it's a it's maybe it's a um

197
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,800
aligned maybe with an inspiration has a

198
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,479
heartfeltness

199
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,599
so it's not just an action

200
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,200
because um we feel like we have to do

201
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,760
something to make something unpleasant

202
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,279
go away

203
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,839
but it's more of a feeling like yeah

204
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:48,480
this this

205
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,959
is the direction to go this is the

206
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,480
direction for greater freedom

207
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,480
greater peace greater well-being

208
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,800
so the practical volitional

209
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,120
cognitive aspect of faith

210
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,600
and then another aspect of faith might

211
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,120
be this heartfelt

212
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,519
this emotional affective aspect of faith

213
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,480
that is maybe this feeling of reverence

214
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,200
devotion love esteem

215
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,959
this more of a heartfelt

216
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,600
this um

217
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,200
yeah what is how what is a way to

218
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,080
describe

219
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,600
devotion but not devotion with a sense

220
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:37,920
of

221
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,200
zealots or um

222
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,000
or that's blinded or something like this

223
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,080
but with a real commitment

224
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,399
maybe a warm commitment something like

225
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,360
this

226
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,920
maybe this feelings of confidence that's

227
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,040
coupled

228
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,040
with an attitude of devotion and

229
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,600
commitment

230
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,640
and it's maybe this is like we can think

231
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,600
of a belief

232
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,640
in something

233
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,560
so this heartfelt

234
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,240
confidence a warmth a warm confidence

235
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,079
and we can find um a short

236
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,959
uh little verse that also talks about

237
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:21,360
this

238
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,560
aspect of faith

239
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,120
and this uh verse takes place in the

240
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,040
context there's a number of

241
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,600
brahmins so these are non-buddhist they

242
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,120
aren't the followers of the buddha

243
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,320
instead they're

244
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,959
priests of the dominant religion at the

245
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,880
time

246
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,399
and they go to the buddha and they ask

247
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,920
him questions and

248
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,760
after the buddha answered all their

249
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,680
questions they

250
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,519
were so inspired and touched by what the

251
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,040
buddha had to say

252
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,079
that they became his followers

253
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,000
and one of the brahmanas pinga

254
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,240
he returned from after seeing the buddha

255
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,399
and he told some of the other brahmanas

256
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,519
how wonderful the buddha is and one of

257
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,959
these other brahmanas

258
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,240
said to him but ping pinga

259
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,240
why don't you spend all your time your

260
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,680
every moment with this person gotama

261
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,680
is the clan name of the buddha

262
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,760
and pinga responds this way

263
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,800
my faith joy mind

264
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,519
and mindfulness do not go away from the

265
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,000
teaching

266
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,440
of gotama whatever direction the one of

267
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,040
great wisdom goes

268
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,600
to there is the place i incline

269
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,160
so according to how his heart and his

270
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,839
mind are

271
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,480
inclined towards this direction of the

272
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,079
buddha

273
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,000
even though he's not there all the time

274
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,480
with him like physically there but

275
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,160
has this connection this commitment

276
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,839
we might say this word devotion

277
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,279
so that's another aspect of faith it's

278
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,399
not a devotion that asks us to

279
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,360
get rid of our intellect or our rational

280
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,240
thinking or

281
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,760
unre reasonableness it's not a devotion

282
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,160
that

283
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,000
asks us to give up our

284
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,120
autonomy but it's a warm

285
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,240
hearted commitment that's borne out of a

286
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,560
recognition that there's something

287
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,959
special here

288
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,320
something that's worthwhile

289
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,959
and then how do we know that or how do

290
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,800
we tune into that is maybe the third

291
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,320
aspect of faith

292
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,279
which is more the intellectual cognitive

293
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,120
mental

294
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,720
aspect of faith and this way we might

295
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,880
define faith as provisional knowledge

296
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,000
that is we have this belief that

297
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,639
so maybe it's not so much belief in but

298
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:57,200
belief

299
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,720
that it makes like this belief that this

300
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,760
is true

301
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,000
it makes sense to me it's consistent

302
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,240
with my experience it's consistent with

303
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,000
my understanding

304
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,440
but i don't know it first hand myself

305
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,200
right now

306
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,920
so it's a kind of provisional knowledge

307
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,600
a provisional

308
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,040
understanding that implies a

309
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,839
willingness to accept on trust

310
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,040
certain teaching certain propositions

311
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,839
that

312
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,240
we can't experience for ourselves

313
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,000
directly at this time or we haven't yet

314
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
so this willingness to accept on trust

315
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,440
so it might lack adequate it might

316
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,959
lack adequate evidence at this time but

317
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,480
it isn't irrational it's not

318
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,360
necessarily inconsistent with our

319
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,839
experience

320
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,000
we could see how perhaps there could be

321
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,600
experience that leads that direction

322
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,880
through practice we a big part of

323
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,160
practice is where we

324
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,880
make this transition from belief into

325
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,079
knowledge

326
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,760
maybe you had this certain belief that

327
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,760
meditation practice would be helpful

328
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,360
and would be a support and

329
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,760
use initiated started meditation

330
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,199
practice

331
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,600
through some before you had the first

332
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,639
experience there was something

333
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,800
that supported you encouraged you

334
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,880
and then you did some meditation

335
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,000
practice and

336
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,160
and said yes there is something here

337
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,720
that's valuable

338
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,519
and continued so maybe your confidence

339
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,720
in the practice grew maybe your trust

340
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,480
and the confidence grew

341
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,279
so there's three different aspects of

342
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,959
faith

343
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,760
one is you could use this word practical

344
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,000
but

345
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,760
it's kind of supports action

346
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,040
the second one is an emotional maybe a

347
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,920
heartfelt

348
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,440
commitment or confidence

349
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,519
the third is intellectual like a

350
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,760
provisional knowledge a belief that

351
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,720
something seems reasonable but i don't

352
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,440
have direct

353
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,880
experience yet and when we think about

354
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,199
it

355
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,279
in fact there's so many things that we

356
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,959
have this provisional knowledge for

357
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,959
right

358
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,480
black holes for example like okay

359
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,279
it seems consistent that there might be

360
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,000
this

361
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,199
place and space where gravity pulls so

362
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:37,600
much

363
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,800
that light can't escape but

364
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,040
you know i i'm not a physicist i

365
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,519
don't know this for myself but i'm

366
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,399
trusting that

367
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,639
uh those people that are talking about

368
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,959
it know what they're talking about

369
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,040
seems consistent with what i do

370
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,079
understand about physics

371
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,320
so there's so many things like this

372
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,160
right that we

373
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,320
have this i'm using this expression

374
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,920
provisional knowledge but

375
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,440
there's a little bit of trust we have

376
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,079
trust or or this confidence that what

377
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,519
they're saying makes sense even though

378
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,880
we don't have this direct

379
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,519
experience

380
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,639
so i've been describing a little bit of

381
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,399
some of these aspects about

382
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,360
faith but another way that we can unpack

383
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,399
or examine

384
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,079
or look at faith is well what function

385
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,680
do we see it playing in buddhist

386
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,720
practice what role does it do

387
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,839
how do people use it how is it

388
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,759
supportive and

389
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,560
rather than just describing what it is

390
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,279
how is it

391
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,560
show up in people's lives how does it

392
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,519
affect people

393
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,279
so there's one way it's a little bit

394
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,279
about in the guide meditation

395
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,639
is this recognition that this

396
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,600
confidence that we can gain through

397
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,680
having more and more

398
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,640
experiences can provide

399
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,760
encouragement inspiration

400
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,760
dedication and not in a zealous way not

401
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,240
in an

402
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,280
overt exaggerated way

403
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,600
but in a way that helps us to feel a

404
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,959
certain amount of

405
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,600
reassurance or a certain amount of

406
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,798
contentment

407
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,438
yeah this is this makes sense to me this

408
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,000
is a direction i want to go

409
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,120
my my heart is in here too

410
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,120
it's not just my mind but my heart

411
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,520
so one way that faith shows up

412
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,520
in the buddhist teachings is in a number

413
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,080
of lists

414
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,320
some people are like oh no please not

415
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,640
the lists

416
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,440
i'm one of those people i like the lists

417
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,000
i kind of

418
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,200
enjoy them but uh

419
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,840
one thing that i'll point out i'll share

420
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,000
i

421
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,559
few lists with us

422
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,960
and one of maybe is the obvious one is

423
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,160
um

424
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,640
i did a list of the five faculties of

425
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,039
course faith is the first element

426
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,240
in that list faith energy

427
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,520
mindfulness concentration and wisdom

428
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,000
you'll notice that faith is first and

429
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,039
wisdom is last

430
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,840
so there's maybe two things i'd like to

431
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,880
point out here

432
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,799
faith is not standing by itself

433
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,320
it's with four other elements

434
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,360
so when the buddha talks about to

435
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,600
cultivate and develop

436
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,720
the faculties it doesn't say

437
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,720
cultivate and develop faith by itself

438
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,720
it's with these other qualities

439
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,720
and in the beginning of this talk i give

440
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,320
this long list

441
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,000
of things that the buddha was wishing

442
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,840
for other people

443
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,720
and faith was part of a collection of

444
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,120
positive things

445
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,600
and that's the case this is how faith

446
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,200
always shows up

447
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,080
is part of a group of practices or

448
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,039
qualities

449
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,080
or things that can be cultivated or

450
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,480
developed it does not show up by itself

451
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,720
and very often i think actually every

452
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,240
time it's the

453
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,000
first element in the list which suggests

454
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,480
that it's a starting place

455
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,840
so faith is not the end it's not the

456
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,360
goal of practice it's a support

457
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,320
and it's a place to begin for our

458
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,400
practice

459
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,520
so i'd like to introduce you to

460
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,320
some maybe some other lists that talk

461
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,039
about faith

462
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,000
the five factors that support meditation

463
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,720
it's also called the five factors for

464
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,160
exertion

465
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,919
and sometimes these get translated

466
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,600
these two different ways

467
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,039
the first element is faith the second

468
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,000
element is

469
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,520
health that's defined as being seldom

470
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,159
ill

471
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,960
or afflicted and having an even

472
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,039
digestion

473
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,039
so faith health honesty

474
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,000
honesty here is defined as revealing

475
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,440
themselves as they really

476
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,840
are to their teachers and fellow

477
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,679
practitioners

478
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,799
so completely honestly knowing oneself

479
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,039
and being able to share that with others

480
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,159
who are

481
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,000
wanting to support you in your practice

482
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,120
so faith health honesty for this

483
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,480
energy we um

484
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,840
are familiar with this it's a in

485
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,039
a applying um a little bit of effort

486
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,960
towards abandoning those things that are

487
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,880
unwholesome and cultivating those things

488
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,720
that are wholesome

489
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,760
so a certain also maybe a steadfastness

490
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,159
or perseverance

491
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,760
and then wisdom so here we are again

492
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,840
wisdom is the last one and faith is the

493
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,960
first

494
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,120
these five factors that support

495
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,919
meditation

496
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,919
and faith is one of these elements

497
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,679
and then here's another list don't worry

498
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,039
this the whole talk is not going to be

499
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,280
just filled with list after list

500
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,840
but i wanted to share one more is it

501
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,320
five

502
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,720
qualities that allow a person to live

503
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,280
happily

504
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,159
we all want to live happily and if those

505
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,919
of us who have meditation practice we

506
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,320
want to

507
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,679
have supports for meditation so

508
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,840
five qualities that allow a person to

509
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,559
live happily

510
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,919
it says in the suta if a person has

511
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,919
certain qualities they will live happily

512
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:02,640
without

513
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,120
distress anguish or fever

514
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,039
i think they of course don't mean fever

515
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,559
literally it's more

516
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,799
metaphorically without getting agitated

517
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,400
and

518
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,840
upset about things okay so what are

519
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,000
these five qualities

520
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,480
faith is first conscientiousness

521
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,520
prudence and then here's energy

522
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,240
and wisdom

523
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,480
so this list these um what i'd like to

524
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,840
point out here is that

525
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,280
faith is just a support for our practice

526
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,679
as different elements it's not the

527
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,039
purpose of practice

528
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,159
it's not instead of practice

529
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,720
but instead it's a way to help us find

530
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,360
our way with cultivating wholesome

531
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,440
qualities and abandoning unwholesome

532
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,480
qualities

533
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,840
our way with allowing

534
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,039
wisdom to rise

535
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,960
and then maybe the last way

536
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,280
that i'll look at faith here so first we

537
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,400
talked about there's these different

538
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,679
aspects and

539
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,440
then we talked about what function does

540
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,679
it have and it functions with other

541
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,039
qualities to

542
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,480
be a support for our lives

543
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,480
and then we might ask well is it ever

544
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,480
actually flat out defined

545
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,480
anywhere and the question would

546
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,760
with the answer would be yes sometimes

547
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,200
faith is defined

548
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,880
as a person

549
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,559
as a person of faith a person of faith

550
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,760
is one who places faith in the

551
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,919
enlightenment of the tatakita

552
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,919
places faith in the enlightenment of the

553
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,799
tataugata

554
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,559
many of you know tattogata is how the

555
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,679
buddha speaks of himself

556
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,279
this is faith in the boot and the

557
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,240
enlightenment of the buddha

558
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,760
there's two different ways we can

559
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,360
understand this

560
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,559
one that enlightenment is possible

561
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,919
the enlightenment did happen

562
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,600
or we might have

563
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,720
faith in the buddha's

564
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,600
enlightenment that what he is teaching

565
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,360
is comes from a place of

566
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,919
awakening a place without greed without

567
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,039
hatred and without delusion

568
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,799
so this faith that enlightenment exists

569
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,799
or maybe faith in the buddha as a

570
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,200
teacher

571
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,159
maybe each of us gets to find our own

572
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,559
way with this

573
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,880
and maybe it changes at different stages

574
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,720
in our practice or

575
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,799
different circumstances

576
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,600
but i like to think about this sometimes

577
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,159
that

578
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,840
how both are true the paulie supports uh

579
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,840
interpreting it either way

580
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,919
faith that enlightenment exists

581
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,919
and faith in the buddha as a teacher

582
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,120
this can be a support for us maybe it's

583
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,000
some provisional

584
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,159
knowledge maybe we see there's

585
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,400
it makes sense we can see how we have

586
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,559
more and more freedom and ease with

587
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:40,559
the more we practice maybe there's

588
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:45,600
some some heartfeltness a commitment to

589
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,159
the buddha and his teachings maybe when

590
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:48,640
we take

591
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,039
refuge in the buddha dharma and sangha

592
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,320
there's a heartfeltness

593
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,279
and maybe faith that enlightenment is

594
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,400
possible or

595
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,880
even in the buddhist teachings supports

596
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,440
us

597
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,000
helps us to continue with meditation

598
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,320
practice

599
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,960
continue with uh listening to dharma

600
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,840
talks

601
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,600
so in this way faith i'll have to say

602
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,120
maybe this is one thing that i love

603
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,440
about

604
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,480
studying and practicing together is

605
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,000
there such a depth

606
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,039
here there's so many different ways or

607
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,919
like a richness

608
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,039
it feels um

609
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,000
a certain like juiciness if i'm allowed

610
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,360
to use that kind of language you know

611
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,279
like an aliveness

612
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:43,279
faith it's we're invited to

613
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,720
explore and examine and

614
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,799
investigate these three different

615
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,159
aspects of it

616
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,240
how faith might work with other

617
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,919
qualities other factors

618
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,400
to support awakening support our

619
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,840
meditation practice

620
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,600
and to support living happily

621
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,240
and may our faith be a support for us

622
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,159
so that we can be a support for others

623
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,000
of course we're not just practicing for

624
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,320
ourselves but

625
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,600
for others so that we might make our

626
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,720
communities and

627
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,158
those we come in contact with

628
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,640
a place where people can bring their

629
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,240
best versions of themselves

630
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:35,840
so thank you
