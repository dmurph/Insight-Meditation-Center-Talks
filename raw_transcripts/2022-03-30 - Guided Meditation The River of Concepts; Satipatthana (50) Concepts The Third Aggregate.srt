1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,280
hello from redwood city imc and

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,119
wishing you all well for this day

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:25,039
i want to begin with um teeny teaching

4
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:31,760
if i ask you to evoke an image of a river

5
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:38,000
you might think of a river that you've seen in your life and it would have a particular maybe it

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,600
would be very unique each one of us would have a very you know

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,640
your own image

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,920
if i write the word

9
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,960
river r-i-v-e-r on a piece of paper

10
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:11,640
that word will maybe reside in that paper as long as the paper exists

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,360
if i take watercolors and go out to a river

12
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,479
and paint the letters watercolor color on the

13
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:32,640
surface of the river that

14
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,320
word will not persist very long

15
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,000
even if the water is almost completely still and placid and flat and hard

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,720
hardly you can't see any movement in the river at all because it's so still and you write the words

17
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:01,040
river on it paint it it's not going to stay maybe not even long enough to see the

18
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,200
word so when we

19
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,640
come up with a word river in our mind the image you had of your river that

20
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,959
asked you to do the beginning maybe went away for a few moments as i thought about talked about riding on top of

21
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,160
river but the weak

22
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,239
the idea of river comes into consciousness maybe because i'm talking about it

23
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:36,879
maybe because you see a river talking about a river it comes into consciousness we pull it out of our

24
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:44,080
memory or the particular ways the brain stores the idea of a river someplace

25
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:51,519
but the conscious awareness of river is there as fleetingly in consciousness

26
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,560
as it is on a running str uh running river

27
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,640
almost as much as much it's there the concept of river is there but it'll change and influx and

28
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:09,840
disappear as other things appear into consciousness and it doesn't reside in consciousness

29
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,879
very long unless we're obsessed by the idea river

30
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:20,080
and we can't stop thinking about river then the idea

31
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,080
maybe persists and it might seem like we're always thinking about river but even then

32
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,519
it's probably not all the time you might be making sentences about a river

33
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:38,480
like oh my river is the best river and the word river

34
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,319
just there is part of the stream in the moment the river the concept of rivers there

35
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:49,920
in the background there might be some other kind of feeling or sense that their

36
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:56,640
memory of this is what i'm talking about but the concept the idea the word for

37
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,319
river is fleeting and simple so this analogy is important to

38
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,599
understand the buddha's teachings on sanya

39
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:13,760
usually translated as perception but it it refers to

40
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,680
the simplest conceptual recognition of

41
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,360
anything at all so river door

42
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:32,560
person whatever it might be there is usually it's one word that conceptually kind of recognizes or

43
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:40,800
identifies this is what the object of attention is the object of seeing or hearing or something

44
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,600
and um and and uh in the practice of vipassana

45
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:54,160
as the practice settles down uh we're beginning to appreciate the fleetingness

46
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:01,680
of the concepts that we live our life by the fleeting is not in terms of how they stay in memory or stay kind of

47
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,280
persist as something that we can tap into but but the actual

48
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,560
coming into full consciousness there's just a moment of recognition a door

49
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,800
river person and that that that is there just for fleeting it's

50
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,199
like the river of consciousness it appears for a moment on it and then consciousness keeps flowing and it

51
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:31,120
dissolves it might return might return frequently so we think it's continuous

52
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:37,360
but it comes and goes this is important because many one of

53
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,199
the areas of clinging and of suffering is we cling to our concepts we cling to

54
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:49,759
ideas even the idea of suffering is uh is a something we can cling to hold on

55
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:55,280
to and we can cling to clinging the idea of

56
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:01,120
clinging oh it's important to cling as practice deepens we become aware of

57
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,120
the uh the fluidity the changeable nature the dissolving nature of concepts

58
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,960
as they appear in the mind they have some reality to them

59
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,960
so for example if i feel an itch the itch might persist for a few seconds

60
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:26,560
but the concept itch is that very fleeting it flows in and flows out it flows in and there's a

61
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,160
question should i scratch and there's a question is what should i do about it or

62
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,840
then i'm looking at something else and then i come back to it but the concept

63
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,960
is and so in this particular foundation of mindfulness what we're looking at today

64
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,800
is the fleeting nature of simple concepts as they appear

65
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:56,319
not as as they are relevant they might be relevant continuously but as they appear in the mind

66
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:04,720
so breathing in the concept of an inhale the concept itself is a fleeting moment

67
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,639
that maybe is repeated the exhale the body

68
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:17,120
posture attention itself so as we get into this meditation perhaps

69
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:24,000
this can become a little bit relevant so

70
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,160
assuming a meditation posture

71
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,520
and sitting in a way taking a posture that expresses both alertness

72
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,840
and relaxation and each of those words is a concept

73
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:59,280
taking a posture alertness relaxation

74
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,720
all these concepts flow through as we speak and we hear

75
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,120
then we respond to

76
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:17,280
and though saying of each word the existence of the word being spoken

77
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:25,560
is brief the word dissolves in the river of time

78
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,960
gently closing your eyes

79
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:38,760
and settling in feeling your whole body sitting here

80
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,800
and taking a deep breath in

81
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,320
and relaxing on the exhale

82
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:17,360
and breathing normally on the exhale continue to relax in the

83
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:25,640
body settling in to this body

84
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,279
then settling into your breathing

85
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:10,079
and as you breathe there are ever so simple concepts that

86
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:17,320
appear that recognizing recognizes what's happening as we're breathing

87
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,680
those concepts might be verbal with a thought

88
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:32,160
they might be quieter and seemingly without words but still a recognition

89
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,440
that the inhale is an inhale exhale and exhale

90
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:44,320
for the recognition of beginning to inhale ending the exhale

91
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,720
movement pressure release

92
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:57,120
mindfulness builds on the simple recognition of what's happening

93
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,680
as it's happening

94
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,120
in any kind any thought mental idea concept

95
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:17,839
of breathing as useful as it might be

96
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:26,040
is fleeting it appears and it disappears

97
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:55,680
and if you're involved in thinking you're probably involved in a different

98
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:02,639
river being swept away and thinking about things that are not here

99
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,120
and now

100
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,240
if you're in commentary about here now you're probably removed from your

101
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,880
experience

102
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,680
to enter into the direct experience

103
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:34,720
and very relaxedly openly know the experience experience the experience

104
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,000
is to practice mindfulness

105
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:01,279
and to know the fleeting nature of the individual

106
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,360
concepts as they appear in the mind

107
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:18,560
is a means to begin to relax the grip we have on our thoughts and ideas

108
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,360
leaving them alone

109
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,840
even distracted thoughts are made up of individual concepts that are fleeting

110
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:20,880
that appear and disappear what happens if you tune into the

111
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:27,720
fleeting nature of concepts ideas thoughts

112
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:09,559
each word and a thought disappears almost as soon as it's spoken

113
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,720
and as we come to the end of the sitting

114
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:23,519
if we can appreciate the fleeting nature of individual concepts and ideas

115
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,760
then we can appreciate the concepts which are useful

116
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:38,159
but at the same time not let them be a barrier for

117
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:45,360
perceiving and seeing what's here in particular

118
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,640
when we're not stuck in ideas of how people are

119
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:57,039
we can maybe take in and register or see and feel and

120
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:04,640
sense people in a deeper way in a fresh way

121
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,799
freedom from being stuck in concepts

122
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,080
allows for more clear seeing of others

123
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,880
clear feeling of them with our hearts

124
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:32,000
we don't then come with our preconceived ideas

125
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:41,440
when we meet other people well we might come with preconceived ideas but we don't linger in them we see

126
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,679
them pass

127
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:54,640
we can see with fresh eyes it may it be that our ability to see

128
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:00,880
feed others freshly with fresh eyes fresh heart fresh mind

129
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,559
lets us be a clean channel

130
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:18,799
for care and goodwill for basic friendship and friendliness

131
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:25,679
maybe this practice clears the channels of communication

132
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:31,679
of perception of connection

133
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:37,520
so we see people kind of anew and fresh and fully

134
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:44,320
in their humanity in a way that maybe we respect and

135
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:50,480
revere others just for being human and being alive

136
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:58,799
and in this clear clean channel of connection

137
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:04,480
may it carry out into the world or are well wishing

138
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:11,679
for the world may all beings

139
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:18,398
be happy may all beings

140
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,720
be safe may all beings

141
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:32,399
be peaceful may all beings be free

142
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,120
and may we live in a way that contributes to that possibility for others

143
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,960
may we be an agent for peace

144
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,120
and happiness

145
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:53,859
[Music]

146
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,599
[Music]

147
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,080
i'll be back in a moment

148
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:53,440
so yeah so the recorder that we have we can i can turn it on and off up here once

149
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:59,279
but once i turned it off i in order to be able to turn on again i have to go

150
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:05,600
over to the recording station we have and push button there

151
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,120
so hopefully that will be fixed soon

152
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,360
so

153
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:27,679
we're in the fourth foundation of mindfulness looking at the mindfulness of the five

154
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,799
usually called five aggregates of clinging or the five

155
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:39,440
groups of clinging the five divisions of how we take our whole experience as human

156
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:45,120
beings and and and cling

157
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:53,840
and so the buddha divides clinging when we cling to almost anything we're actually clinging to these five areas

158
00:33:53,840 --> 00:34:01,279
and it's not quite uh just you know who we are but it also has to do with anything at

159
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:07,840
all they can kind of fit into this these categories

160
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:14,480
the refrain of the satiputana sutta that we talked about many weeks ago which is the direction in which the

161
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:20,800
mindfulness practice is going comes to a place where we see the

162
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:27,760
the inconstant nature of our experience the flow of experience the appearing and

163
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:34,000
disappearing of experience and in this repetition of emphasis over and

164
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:41,760
over again the rising and passive experience is uh an alternative to being stuck

165
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:47,040
alternative to being caught up in some thought or idea or concept or feeling or anything

166
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:54,079
it's an alternative to clinging and so you know if you're in a if the river

167
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:59,280
is flowing and you want to stop the river you grab it or you put up your hand to block it

168
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:05,200
it doesn't work the river just keeps flowing but the stress of trying to hold the river back

169
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:12,320
remains in our hands as we start to block it but if we can appreciate that what the river does is it flows

170
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:19,760
then we might allow ourselves to be carried if it's a nice river safe river be to be floated along in the

171
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:25,760
current of the river and we can go far and we can make it to the eventually maybe to the great

172
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:31,520
peaceful ocean and um and so the same thing with uh our

173
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:37,680
experiences is much more fluid and and uh and changeable and

174
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:43,040
and uh then our concepts

175
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:50,000
uh tell us concepts ideas when we cling to them hold on to them or we are obsessed by

176
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:57,200
them we it gives a kind of sense of continuity a kind of constancy to what we think is there what we think is

177
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:02,720
going on so that we can we think we can cling it works to cling

178
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:08,079
but we see that these concepts these ideas are part of the river of change

179
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:15,440
then we can learn to float on them which means we don't reject the concepts but we see their fluid

180
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:21,520
in constant nature they're they're so in this uh

181
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:28,240
uh the five aggregates the five heaps five groups groupings

182
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:34,359
is um there is um the third one is sannya

183
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:40,560
s-a-n-n-a and it's um usually translated into english as

184
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:46,560
perception but i don't know i don't think that's a appropriate translation

185
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,800
i think perception seems to imply too much

186
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:57,920
non-conceptual perception seeing hearing tasting

187
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:04,960
that we we perceive at these different scent stores the word sanya has a meaning of to mark

188
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:10,400
something to to label it and

189
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:17,359
and so it's the simple concept we have of things there there are things that we uh we

190
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:23,119
might see that we don't have any concept for we might not even have a word for him we say it's something

191
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:28,800
just something and some of these concepts are very fluid and changeable

192
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:34,079
a i have here this wonderful bowl through the bell

193
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:41,359
and we call it a bell but um if i didn't have any uh bowls to eat my breakfast with this

194
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:48,480
will make a perfect uh bowl rather than amusing it as a bell and becomes a bone because my breakfast bowl

195
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:54,880
and or my soup bowl or something or it might be that i don't need the

196
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,920
bell anymore but i have a lot of pens and it becomes a pen holder and they

197
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:07,200
stick in there or it becomes some other holder that what this uh what this object is

198
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,240
is changeable and uh it can be a flower pot and

199
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:18,480
depend and we could label it by its function often and so

200
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:23,760
the concept we have so some things is functional and the function can change and so the

201
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:29,440
label changes and this points to the idea that the concepts are fluid and changeable and

202
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:36,400
they're not absolute they are um relative and provisional and

203
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,920
situational and the same thing with our ideas of

204
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,520
safety the ideas of well-being and happiness and suffering

205
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:53,839
there these ideas as they appear as ideas as concepts are simple concepts

206
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:58,960
that then we get caught in and we get involved in associations and complicated

207
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:05,920
stories and ideas about them to be mindful of sanya of these

208
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:12,720
simple conceptual concepts i prefer to translate sanya's concepts

209
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:18,000
these simple concepts gives us the vantage point

210
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:26,160
to be wise about how we get swept away in the more complicated ideas we have

211
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:32,800
and so as practice deepens um we start seeing that all the concepts

212
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:39,040
we have in as concepts as ideas as the as the

213
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:46,640
recognizing function of the mind is there very very briefly

214
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:52,160
and then it appears again and again so um

215
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:57,760
like even if i if i say make up the sentence i am speaking words

216
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:05,280
then those words each of those is a concept i

217
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:11,839
am speaking words uh just like we can speed read and we it

218
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:17,440
all kind of blurs together into one large concept or one you know we understand the meaning overall

219
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,640
but if we step back and see or feel or recognize that each

220
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:28,960
individuality of each of those words before we string them together and make it into a larger meaning

221
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:34,960
i am speaking words and they can't go around in ordinary

222
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:40,400
life paying attention to this kind of detail of concepts all the time

223
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:48,240
it's just not efficient it's efficient to kind of string words together in a sentence and just get the meaning right away

224
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:54,079
but as meditation quiets and we can still learn and in meditation

225
00:40:54,079 --> 00:41:00,319
then there are times when we see the exquisite uh exquisite uh

226
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:06,640
appearance of a concept like uh sometimes at the end of meditation

227
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:13,040
when i open my eyes before i have a concept there's a seeing but

228
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:18,960
there isn't quite the recognition there's a shape a color there's something

229
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:25,280
kind of briefly and then i can feel or see or recognize that my mind

230
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,960
then makes makes a concept not that like right now i'm looking at my laptop a

231
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,560
laptop and um the um

232
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:43,920
and uh and that little gap between what i would call perception just kind of taking in this the data the sense

233
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,359
data the site objects without the concept and then

234
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:56,480
recognizing the overlay of the concept on top of it so i might see a bell like this

235
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:01,760
and i just you know as i pointed out this doesn't have to be a bell it can be a bowl it could be a pen holder it could

236
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:07,920
be all kinds of things flower pot and it's so because all those things are not

237
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:13,680
inherent in the object it's possible to see the object without

238
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:18,880
the label and then see the label arise

239
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:25,440
and in the mind the thought arise bell and it can be exquisite to see that

240
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:30,560
rather than just having it on automatic pilot and see the brilliance of the mind that

241
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:38,880
makes these concepts and see it arise without any clinging or holding on or grasping or any kind of extra baggage

242
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:45,760
just a bell bull and um and so in deep meditation and

243
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:52,480
quiet still meditation then this is where the exquisiteness gets more and more special

244
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:59,200
where so many we're down at the kind of a primary primal kind of level of experience

245
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:05,520
and we kind of see the arising the beginning of this complicated worlds we live in

246
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:11,200
but we're not seduced by the complicated world we're able to kind of see it as

247
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:18,079
just the arising of a concept that gives birth to other concepts and ideas and we can just stay there watching it

248
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:24,400
appear and dissolve and come and go and it can be a little bit like as

249
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:30,880
delightful as sitting on the riverbank watching the river go by maybe spending many long periods of time

250
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,920
just watching the flow of the current little waves the flow

251
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:42,800
and it's just something very relaxing and nice to see that so the same thing is possible to see that current

252
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:47,839
the river of concepts as they appear and in mindfulness practice we're using

253
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:53,200
little bit this these concepts to help us stay present

254
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:58,480
and that's you the the idea of a mental label where we add a little didn't we we

255
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,680
repeat the concept maybe the original concept is almost subconscious

256
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:09,680
as it appears or but then we use a mental note to recognize

257
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:15,520
river for looking at the river in as we're breathing in out towards a breathing out

258
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:21,040
warmth if we feel warm restless if you feel restless

259
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:27,680
and it's a way of kind of using that little bit more emphatic note it's a little bit more

260
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:34,400
uh intentional note it's a way of staying in the flow of the present moment being right there being

261
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:41,599
right there being right there with it letting it just flow and move through as it does

262
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,760
so um and as we do so

263
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:54,960
we begin letting go of clinging and as we let go of clinging in a deeper and deeper way then at some point this flow

264
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:00,079
of experience doesn't get limited by the particular groupings of the five

265
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:05,359
aggregates but rather it becomes because that itself is a concept each of these

266
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:11,280
five aggregates are concepts that the mind has produced which is what the buddha says

267
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:18,720
and that the those concepts begin to dissolve because there are secondary concepts there are more abstract concepts

268
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:23,839
and they dissolve and then at some point the awareness doesn't become so selective

269
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:30,800
one aspect of our experience but it becomes more panoramic where awareness just here and present in

270
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,839
a panoramic way and and we just in the flow of experience

271
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:40,480
without grouping them into these five groups

272
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:49,200
so you might today as you go about your day

273
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:55,680
maybe [Music] see if you can notice

274
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:00,960
the arising of concepts and the provisional nature of them they

275
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:07,520
the fluid nature of them and what would sometimes say the empty nature of them there

276
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:13,520
and um and uh or notice the opposite notice how they

277
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:19,280
seems the concepts are so solid and real and important and it has to be this way

278
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:24,400
um what we add to it that to this simplicity of just these

279
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:31,520
like simple concepts that appear in the mind so thank you very much

280
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:36,680
and continue tomorrow
