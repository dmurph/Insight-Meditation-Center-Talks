1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:07,120
good evening Welcome I'm Hillilary and I'm sitting in

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:13,599
for Diana this evening Is there anybody who's here for the first

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,560
time oh yes Welcome Welcome

4
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:25,560
So I'm going to talk tonight about

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,199
something which sounds a little strange at first but hopefully by the end of the

6
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,280
talk it will make more sense It's called changing poison into

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:46,960
medicine So Nagarjuna a Mahayana Buddhist teacher

8
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:54,480
from the 2 century in India likened the Buddha's teachings to

9
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:02,000
a great physician who can change poison into

10
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:10,320
medicine So each of us finds our way to the dharma for different reasons

11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:17,759
But often it is suffering Is there anybody who came here because you feel some sense of

12
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:24,600
suffering you just feel free to raise your hand It may not be everyone

13
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:34,040
Um there's something inside of many of us that keeps us from a a sense of uh

14
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:42,920
well-being It might be physical emotional or psychological

15
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:49,560
um pain which we might try to fight

16
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,680
against or tried to get rid of Has anybody tried to fight against their

17
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,880
suffering or get rid of it i got to root that out I have

18
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,680
definitely But unfortunately it only causes more suffering because we're at

19
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,280
war with ourselves Whatever we resist persists

20
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,160
That is a a saying that you'll probably hear in the

21
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:26,239
dharma So uh so the suffering leads us to the dharma

22
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,480
for medicine So the Buddha went in search of medicine

23
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:39,400
when he couldn't bear knowing that people became

24
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:46,840
ill and they grew old and

25
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:53,120
died So he left his palatial life Um you

26
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,400
would think he would have no suffering but he did And so he he left the palace

27
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:06,040
and he went out in search of wisdom some

28
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:13,040
medicine And he started off with practicing very aesthetic practices He

29
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,959
um at one point was eating so little that he

30
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,560
almost starved himself to death They say that you could he could touch the front

31
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,920
of his belly to his back There was nothing in

32
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:38,959
between And it was not until a young woman Sudata came along and found him

33
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,200
and nourished him with some really uh rich

34
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:51,760
porridge And he realized ah that's not the way

35
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:58,720
right to cause more suffering for myself more pain physically right and that

36
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:06,040
helped to put him on this path of enlightenment this middle way

37
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:12,560
Um so in this path on this path to

38
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:19,919
enlightenment he finally sat down underneath the bodhic tree and he

39
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:25,639
said I'm going to sit here until I achieve enlightenment And then

40
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:31,040
Mara came along and bombarded him with

41
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:41,240
all kinds of frightening and tempting things There were demons and uh raging

42
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,440
storms and there were beautiful dancing

43
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:52,800
girls and he met them all with

44
00:04:52,840 --> 00:05:00,400
equinimity And as these armies let loose a barrage of arrows it is said in the

45
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:07,199
sutas that they fell all around the Buddhas Buddha like flower

46
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:14,320
petals So he showed us a path to change poison

47
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,520
into medicine Whatever came at him he

48
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:28,840
was able to transmute it Whatever pain and sorrow and

49
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:35,560
fear he transmuted into beautiful qualities of

50
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:44,960
compassion and patience acceptance kindness wisdom

51
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:52,360
So the first step in transmuting poison into medicine is to turn towards the

52
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:59,360
pain Does anybody feel that's counterintuitive it feel it felt like

53
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,919
that to me at first right turning towards the pain really that's going to

54
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:11,759
help So most of us spend much of our lives until we get to the dharma We

55
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,840
spend our lives running away from ignoring

56
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:25,759
repressing this this pain and we say "I'm okay." And we get

57
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:33,520
busy with other things Has anybody said that oh yeah I'm okay

58
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:42,400
Yeah But if we we just ignore it if we try to repress these these feelings they

59
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:49,479
don't go away right they just go underground into our

60
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:58,600
subconscious and they cause unease and they undermine our best intentions

61
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:05,919
Do you ever feel sometimes that there's this like inner part of you that's always

62
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:11,000
trying to get in your way or try to

63
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,160
uh just impede your progress and you're like why what what's in there why who is

64
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,240
that why are they why is that part of me doing that

65
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:28,800
so there's a Tibetan story about Millera

66
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:37,479
who lived around 1,200 years ago and he was filled with a poisonous

67
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:43,880
rage Um and he he actually murdered many people out of

68
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:49,240
revenge for his family's stolen wealth

69
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:56,639
And after a while eventually comes to the dharma and he begin the message

70
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:04,000
begins to penetrate and he turned his life around And I'm going to read you a story

71
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,520
about how one day he went into a cave seeking

72
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:16,960
firewood One day the Tibetan teacher Millera left his cave to gather firewood

73
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,599
When he returned he found that his cave had been taken over by

74
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:28,080
demons There were demons everywhere His first thought upon seeing

75
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:36,159
them was "I have got to get rid of them." He lunges towards them chasing

76
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:43,279
after them trying forcefully to get them out of his cave but the demons are

77
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:49,760
completely unfaced In fact the more he chases them the more

78
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:57,760
comfortable and settled in they seem to be Realizing that his efforts to run

79
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,320
them out have failed miserably Millera opts for a new

80
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:11,440
approach and decides to teach them the dharma If chasing them out won't work then

81
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,680
maybe hearing the teachings will change their minds and get them to

82
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:23,760
go Seems like a good idea So he takes his seat and begins teaching about

83
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:32,720
existence and non-existence compassion and kindness the nature of impermanence

84
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:41,000
After a while he looks around and he realizes that all the demons are still

85
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,720
there They simply stare at him with their huge bulging eyes Not a single one

86
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:56,760
is leaving At this point Valera lets out a deep breath of

87
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:03,360
surrender knowing now that these demons will not be manipulated into leaving and

88
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:11,600
that maybe he has something to learn from them He looks deeply into the eyes of

89
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:19,040
each demon and bows saying "It looks like we're going to be here together."

90
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:29,480
I open myself to whatever you have to teach me In that moment all the demons but one

91
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:36,959
disappear One huge and especially fierce demon with flaring nostrils and dripping

92
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:44,519
fangs is still there So Millera lets go even

93
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:52,079
further Stepping over to the largest demon He offers himself completely

94
00:10:52,079 --> 00:11:00,440
holding nothing back Eat me if you wish He places his head in the demon's

95
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:10,959
mouth And at that moment that largest demon bows low and dissolves into space

96
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:20,920
So Joseph Campbell was a famous mythologist

97
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:26,519
and he said "The cave you fear to

98
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:33,000
enter holds the treasure that you seek."

99
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:41,440
So the dharma teaches us that whatever we run from pursues us and whatever we turn towards

100
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:49,200
transforms us So we practice accepting what is true

101
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,519
in the moment and that may be I am in

102
00:11:54,519 --> 00:12:05,079
pain Right i am in anguish I am so sad or I am so

103
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:10,120
angry Right whatever that is

104
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:16,760
true for you When we turn towards

105
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:22,440
it the pain is finally heard It is seen

106
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,800
felt and it can breathe a sigh of relief

107
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:36,079
Finally someone cares I'm no longer abandoned no longer

108
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:42,120
alone There's a contemporary poet Naria Wahed writes "Feel

109
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:50,800
it That thing you don't want to feel feel it and be free."

110
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:57,440
So the first step in transmuting poison into medicine is to turn towards the

111
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:03,760
pain Acknowledge that it is here Allow the feeling to be felt seen

112
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:11,920
and heard And to hold it in loving awareness with compassion And part of what is so

113
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:17,760
helpful about the teachings of the dharma is to learn that we have inside

114
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:25,440
of us an awareness that can be aware of the thoughts the feelings that sensations

115
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:31,279
that arise within us But our awareness is not those things

116
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:39,360
There's a space that we can create between what we think we feel we sense

117
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:47,440
and this awareness So that is the first step

118
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,839
turning towards and then the second step is to notice when we're shooting the

119
00:13:53,839 --> 00:14:00,040
second arrow and stop Right so the first arrow is the

120
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:08,279
pain of whatever might be happening to us that causes us this feeling of

121
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:16,839
suffering The second and subsequent arrows are the ones we inflict upon

122
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:22,639
ourselves as we heap on thoughts that are unkind

123
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:31,399
If we suffer a misfortune we make a mistake we often say hateful things to

124
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:37,920
ourselves Has anybody done that here said really unkind things to yourself

125
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,279
you would never say to someone else because it would be so devastating And

126
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:49,720
yet so often we do that all the time within our own minds

127
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,519
So it's these second arrows that are optional We can choose to turn these

128
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:05,279
arrows into flowers by befriending whatever inner

129
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:11,000
demons arise within us Khalil Gabbron

130
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:21,000
wrote "And God said love your enemy and I obeyed and loved

131
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:28,440
myself." I'm going to read that one more time I think that's so profound God said "Love your

132
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:34,839
enemy." And I obeyed and loved myself

133
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:45,000
So like ancient alchemists who endeavor to transmute these base uh elements into

134
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,440
gold that's the alchemy of our practice We turn poison into medicine

135
00:15:52,440 --> 00:16:00,959
by turning pain from suffering into wisdom and

136
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:08,000
compassion And so how do we do this how do we put our heads inside the

137
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,040
mouth of our demons and transform them so there's an ancient Tibetan

138
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:21,199
Buddhist practice called Chud that was developed by an 11th

139
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:26,720
century female Buddhist teacher named Machi Gladron

140
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:34,959
And chud means to cut through And the philosophy of chud sees

141
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:41,399
our inner demons our obsessions our fears our

142
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:48,800
addictions anxieties um sometimes even chronic illness as

143
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:54,399
energies which can be healed by bringing them into the light by meeting them

144
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,920
getting to know them Rather than seeing them as our enemy and

145
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:06,160
fighting against them we turn towards them and nurture them by feeding them

146
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:14,438
what they need So there's a contemporary Buddhist uh Tibetan teacher uh named Sultram

147
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:20,558
Alioni who teaches a five-step process for doing this based on this ancient

148
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:26,000
teaching of Chud and she calls it feeding your demons

149
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:34,480
So in our practice we might substitute uh for for demon we might substitute

150
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:44,200
suffering So our sufferings may be feelings of deep feelings of uh perhaps

151
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:51,240
uh anger frustration or inadequacy or feeling unlovable

152
00:17:51,240 --> 00:18:01,039
or feeling uh just deeply grieved or uh any number of of uh

153
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:08,240
things that can cause us to feel this inner suffering So the practice this five-step practice

154
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:14,000
that she teaches Sa Malonei is to find in the body where we're holding this

155
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:23,480
suffering most strongly And usually it's a feeling It's a strong feeling and then allow it to take on a

156
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:32,000
form so that we can we can visualize it and see it get to know it

157
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,760
And then the third step is discovering what the suffering needs And this is the interesting part

158
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:46,679
by putting yourself in its place So if there's a deep anger maybe your anger

159
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:51,880
demon who's feeling rage about lots of things that are

160
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:59,039
happening you would then in this process and the this step you would then become

161
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:05,480
that anger Try to see it from inside

162
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:12,840
out And then the fourth step is you you ask it what does it want what does it

163
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:18,960
need and then you begin to nourish it to give it what it wants

164
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:26,640
what it needs and see what happens See if it begins to transform So I've done a similar process

165
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,240
with the kids in the Dharma Sprouts program here using a book called An's

166
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:38,520
Anger And here it is And this is An and

167
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:46,080
An's anger demon And so Anne uh he is living with

168
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,760
his grandfather and he knocks over all his blocks and anger and he's sent to

169
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:57,640
his room to be with his anger And lo and

170
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:06,840
behold his anger shows up right it's this fuzzy red fang you know

171
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:12,720
clawed creature and they get to know each other

172
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,760
and they become friends And what we do is we have the kids actually make a

173
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:28,520
puppet that is their anger And then we have them talk to their

174
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:34,080
anger like "How are you oh I'm so mad I

175
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:40,320
want to throw something I want to scream." Right whatever it is let the

176
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:46,760
anger tell you how it's feeling And then after it's gotten that

177
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:52,559
out then you say "What do you need?"

178
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:59,480
And then you listen I need

179
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:08,000
a I need a hug right or I need to go outside and run

180
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:15,679
around or whatever it is right this is a lovely way of teaching the kids that

181
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:25,039
there's this awareness There is anger that is in them and they can have a communication

182
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:30,720
with the singer This anger is not them Right what do we say sometimes we

183
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:38,799
say all the time I am angry Right rather than oh there's anger in me right so we

184
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:44,240
create some space and then we can have a a a communication with this anger and

185
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,600
see what it needs to tell us There's no emotion that is wrong or bad They're all

186
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,880
useful in their own place and time right sometimes we need anger to protect

187
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,440
ourselves So

188
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,960
um we make these puppets and then sometimes the oh in the

189
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:13,679
book Anne's anger actually begins to transmute itself It goes from this

190
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:21,240
really ginormous really scary looking creature to this friendly little guy

191
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:29,440
who's you know there to protect on when needs it right so just imagine having a

192
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,440
relationship with one of your inner demons or one of your inner sufferings

193
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:43,679
So instead of trying to get rid of it or to fight it or run away from it you turn

194
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:49,559
towards it and say "How are you feeling how are you feeling

195
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:56,440
sadness what do you need what do you want?"

196
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:03,679
Um and so what I like to do is just give us a little sample of what this would be

197
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:09,679
like And so I'm just going to lead us in this five-step process just for a few

198
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:17,159
minutes You are welcome to participate in this or you can just tune it out

199
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:24,320
and and just sit quietly If at any time you feel unease and you don't want to

200
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,440
continue with the the practice then just open your eyes and look around and take

201
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:36,480
a breath and um and then just uh it we'll we'll be back uh together after a

202
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:43,640
few minutes So um let me take a sip

203
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:52,240
here So if you'd like to close your eyes you're welcome to do that if you'd rather just have a soft downward gaze Um

204
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,280
and then just start by taking several slower deeper breaths I like to breathe

205
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:03,159
in through my nose and a long slow out breath through the

206
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:11,640
mouth I feel much more letting go when I do that So couple more like that

207
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:27,559
And then just letting your breath find its natural rhythm And just checking in with

208
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:35,360
yourself Is there something present here in you that maybe feels like a suffering

209
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:41,480
maybe it's a a disappointment a

210
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,480
fear sadness

211
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:54,360
something that feels just hard to be with a little bit Don't pick your

212
00:24:54,360 --> 00:25:01,760
worst worst fear but if you can be with it just

213
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:07,880
notice where are you feeling it in your body where is that feeling most

214
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:13,360
strongly often times it can be felt in the chest

215
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:19,840
or the [Music] belly maybe in the face or the

216
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:28,320
shoulders the hands See where that suffering lives in

217
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:39,600
you And then when you feel like you have something in

218
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:47,799
mind some feeling that feels a little hard to be with then visualize

219
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:56,960
this this feeling this emotion this suffering Does it have a size a

220
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:02,039
shape a color

221
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:11,440
and you don't need to make anything happen It's fine if you don't you can't visualize It's no worries If something

222
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:20,440
comes to you then just let it happen You don't have to make anything happen Is there a way that holds itself

223
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:26,720
maybe really upright or hunched over or how does it hold itself

224
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,960
this

225
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:39,360
suffering and what kind of emotion is it

226
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:49,879
exuding maybe it makes a sound

227
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:08,320
And then if you can imagine that this suffering has

228
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:14,158
eyes and you look into the eyes of the

229
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,400
suffering and ask what do

230
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,120
you What do you

231
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:32,400
need what is it that you

232
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:42,919
need and then seeing if you can change places now with that

233
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:46,240
suffering that

234
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:55,240
feeling and see what it says from the inside

235
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:01,640
out Being the suffering what does it need

236
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:17,880
does it just want to be [Music]

237
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:23,679
heard does it need to know that you

238
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,398
care does it need a hug

239
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:35,480
and then imagine switching places again once you've heard from

240
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:42,840
this suffering And then imagine nourishing it with whatever it

241
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:51,159
needs Imagine just feeding that to this this demon

242
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:03,278
and see if anything happens if anything changes anything

243
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:15,600
shifts maybe just in the way that you feel towards this little demon this

244
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,600
suffering

245
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:29,759
And then we'll just give another moment of being

246
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:38,960
with this feeling Seeing what happens when you nourish it with what it

247
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:53,000
needs And then when you're ready just taking a deeper breath in and out

248
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,480
and then opening your eyes

249
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:08,600
So rather than trying to fight

250
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:14,919
with these inner feelings these

251
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:23,080
inner whatever you like to call them whether you call them demons or parts or

252
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:30,360
suffering we can make friends with them and become become more

253
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:35,520
whole The suffering feels seen and heard

254
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:43,559
and [Music] comforted soothed And so these strong

255
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:50,640
feelings are no longer afraid of us that we will reject

256
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:59,120
them we will turn away we will try to repress them or get rid of them

257
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:04,720
And we are no longer afraid of being with

258
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:13,720
them The poison becomes the medicine And what we were fighting to

259
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:20,480
repress can become a friend an ally perhaps a protector when we need

260
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:27,240
them There's a a poem by Rainor Maria

261
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:33,919
Rulka Perhaps the dragons in our lives are princesses who are only waiting to

262
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:39,080
see us act just once with beauty and

263
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:44,760
courage Perhaps everything that frightens us is in its deepest

264
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:51,559
essence something helpless that wants our love

265
00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:01,519
So I would like to invite us to um a

266
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,679
just a little conversation about how was that for

267
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:13,120
you and um are there any questions or

268
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:22,600
reflections and we can pass the microphone

269
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,320
Um thank you for that uh talk and the exercise was interesting

270
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:46,399
Um I think initially it's with the imagery of demons it's easy to like

271
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:51,559
think of it as uh something we're averse to like the

272
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:57,120
aversions Um I and this may be more of a comment but I

273
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:04,080
uh I'm not sure if also we could work with things that we have um the opposite like too much desire for and view that

274
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:09,760
as a demon Yes Do the same exercise So something I'm trying to think of but

275
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:15,600
yeah absolutely right Sometimes we are so

276
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:24,240
desirous It could be food or sex or shopping or you know

277
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:30,799
gambling or something And and often that is something inside of us that is

278
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:36,200
longing to receive something that we're trying to substitute

279
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:41,440
for Right and so oftent times what we're

280
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:48,399
really longing for is connection and love and care and we're not receiving it

281
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:55,200
from the outside world And so we can actually give that

282
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:01,440
to ourselves One of the things I do is I teach mindful self-compassion courses

283
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:09,679
And it's amazing how when we do when we learn to turn our

284
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:18,919
compassion we have towards others towards ourselves how soothing and comforting it can be even like a simple

285
00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:25,520
touch with an intention of kindness even if we make a mistake and instead of

286
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:32,118
saying oh I cannot believe I did that oh I'm so awful I can't believe that

287
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:37,440
instead Oh this hurts I'm so sorry that

288
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,480
this happened and I still love you I still

289
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:48,480
care You're still a worthy human being Right So thank you for that question

290
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,720
That was really very good

291
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:59,240
question Anything else coming up for you

292
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,040
is it oh yeah go

293
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:20,400
ahead Thank you Um I can share my experience through this practice Um it's

294
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:29,599
very nice So my demon at this time is the sadness emotion and I visualize it

295
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:36,480
and I ask it what do you need um it didn't speak but I can feel what

296
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:42,800
it need I really just need that I accept it that I being with her like really

297
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:48,200
accept it and I try to accept it and I feel fear in my

298
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:54,400
heart and um yeah and then I also try to you mentioned like we need to nourish it

299
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:02,800
so like try to give blood to it to nourish it It doesn't want my blood it just want me to accept it

300
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:08,320
That's so beautiful Thank you It's It's very beautiful Thank you so

301
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:15,520
much I love it You're welcome Oh I'm getting chills Yeah because so often what happens is

302
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:24,079
when we're sad we do not want to feel it right that's also true of fear and um we

303
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:29,760
don't want to feel the sadness because it feels so overwhelming right we're afraid we're

304
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,839
just if we go into it we'll never come back out We've got to be strong right that's what we're taught you know stiff

305
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:42,599
upper lip Um and yet the sadness is

306
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:49,640
sad right the sadness is sad The sadness needs to be

307
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:56,440
comforted right so thank you for that

308
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:13,480
Is this something that perhaps you could imagine just doing sometime just on your

309
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:20,000
own and it could be as simple as it doesn't have to be the five steps It

310
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:29,160
could just be the realization that there's a really overwhelming feeling that is causing

311
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:36,480
suffering and you are really trying to run away You're trying to repress it You

312
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:45,560
do not want to feel it And instead can you perhaps turn towards it visualize

313
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:52,839
it and say I see that you are so

314
00:37:52,839 --> 00:37:59,400
upset Can it be here for you can I actually make space for

315
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:06,640
you and can I hold you with some compassion can you imagine doing that

316
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:14,160
that would that be different from what you do now

317
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:24,160
yeah The thing about self-compassion is that I think a lot of us have been led

318
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:32,880
to believe that it is a weakness It will make us weak it will

319
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:39,280
will take away our inner motivation We won't be able to face the world We've

320
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:45,359
got to be strong But what happens is all of these feelings that we've had and often times

321
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:52,119
this begins when we're very young I mean how many of us as children

322
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:59,440
were told when we were crying or upset stop that Did anybody hear that stop it

323
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:06,560
Go to your room Right And or if you're angry yeah go to your room and you know

324
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:13,359
when you can you know gather yourself together whatever then you can come out

325
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:20,000
right so we're taught that all these feelings are not okay So nobody tells us

326
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,720
what to do with them right and so I think we can come to this practice and

327
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:33,400
realize that there's a lot of these untended feelings You know we've stuffed

328
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:39,839
inside And I can tell you I've been practicing for 20 years You can keep

329
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:45,920
stuffing those emotions your whole life and they don't go away They won't go

330
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:52,760
away until oftenimes what happens in our in this practice is that when we

331
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:58,480
sit in in silence and we make space for

332
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:04,240
whatever arises stuff will come up right has

333
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:12,320
anybody found that out like stuff that you buried starts to come up and you're like "Ah what do I do now?" So this is

334
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:19,000
something that you can do you can meet what arises without being so

335
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:26,280
afraid right i mean I I think of all of these feelings as being more like

336
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:31,359
like kids you know that little child in me that was overwhelmed that didn't get

337
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:40,160
what I needed And so now whenever I feel some some sadness or fear or frustration

338
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:46,960
I I just can imagine them as these little these

339
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:54,520
little people who need my support and my help That is that space between our

340
00:40:54,520 --> 00:41:02,079
awareness and the feelings And sometimes the feelings are really really strong

341
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:07,280
right they're very frightening And what we can do if we

342
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:14,319
feel overwhelmed like I cannot deal with you right now we can still be kind right

343
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:20,800
we can still say to the the fear the sadness the anger you know I see you I

344
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:26,720
feel you It's you're not bad It's okay that you're here It makes sense for you

345
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:36,240
to feel this way and I need to go for a walk right now right or I need to go uh

346
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:44,000
do something else right but I will come back to you I will be back for you So

347
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:51,640
those feelings don't feel abandoned from from us right and little by little over

348
00:41:51,640 --> 00:42:00,720
time with with practicing this way we can begin to hold more of these feelings

349
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:08,960
and not be so afraid not feel like we need to run away and then as I said earlier the

350
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:15,560
feelings then are not afraid of us and we're not so afraid of them and we can

351
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:23,000
become we can become friends so we can become allies So I hope that this has been

352
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,720
helpful I hope um and if it hasn't been if it's something that is not useful for

353
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:34,960
you then just completely let it go There's lots of ways to practice This is

354
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:40,319
one that I use and uh it's very helpful for me so I wanted to share it But if

355
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:46,640
it's not helpful for you then let it go and uh find find the things that are

356
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:52,800
really helpful for your practice So I would just like to dedicate the merit of

357
00:42:52,800 --> 00:43:01,319
our time together Um may all beings turn towards their

358
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:06,920
suffering with kindness and compassion

359
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:14,280
And may we practice this self-compassion that

360
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:21,560
will benefit all those that we connect with all those other suffering

361
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:27,200
beings May we meet them with compassion Thank you so much for being

362
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:33,280
here Thank you for your practice And I will stay here for a few more minutes if

363
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:41,200
anybody has anything that they want to share anything they want to ask Thank you for being here

364
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,318
