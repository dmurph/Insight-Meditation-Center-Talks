1
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:11,700
good morning everyone good day hello greetings from uh Insight Meditation

2
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,400
Center I'm very glad to be back here it's been

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:25,920
how long it's been maybe uh six weeks that I've been away and um or so five weeks

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,000
and um

5
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,380
from traveling and teaching and different things and um now I am

6
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:43,559
coming back from inside to retreat center where I just finished teaching a week-long retreat

7
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:48,600
so um a little bit I feel like a beginner

8
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,820
sitting here being away and now use that as a theme

9
00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:01,500
for today the um also maybe it's appropriate to feel like

10
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,840
a beginner and that I Mark today as maybe the

11
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,900
approximately the beginning of the maybe it's next week the beginning of the or

12
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:20,340
finishing this week is finishing three years of these 7 A.M YouTube teachings

13
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:28,740
and next week I guess we begin the fourth year so thank you all for being here

14
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:35,820
and in the theme of being a beginner I think it's useful to consider maybe

15
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:41,400
realize that when we are when we meditate

16
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,560
we mostly meditate as a beginner

17
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,939
that it mostly was like we're starting over or and then sometimes as we get settled and

18
00:01:53,939 --> 00:02:01,140
mature and the practice there are times when we have we course along with some kind of more experienced deeper

19
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,899
meditation but often in the bakeries of life we sit

20
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:14,400
down to meditate and it's kind of like starting over so we're all beginners

21
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:21,120
but the difference between someone who's a beginner or real you know really beginning someone who's an experienced

22
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,900
beginner has done a lot of beginning is that the attitude with which they

23
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:35,220
meditate how they meditate the how they're aware how they

24
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:40,440
concentrate and as people become more experienced

25
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:46,440
experienced they're more relaxed about how and also more dedicated and this

26
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:53,580
combination of being that it calmly dedicated without striving

27
00:02:53,580 --> 00:03:02,099
without judging without bringing all the baggage of Me Myself and mine along when

28
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:08,760
I meditate my experience what's happening I'm doing it wrong I'm doing it right what should

29
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:15,180
it be as people come home or experience they just settle in and are more at ease

30
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:22,080
with being a beginner and uh and just going through the basic

31
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,260
instructions so I'll offer you some of those today

32
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:35,400
so to assume a meditation posture

33
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,099
and uh what's nice with a

34
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:50,340
in being caring and careful about the posture you take that it's a posture that feels

35
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,799
unobstructed somehow we're sitting in such a way that

36
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:01,080
there's no obstructions and that's part of the advantage of the

37
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:06,620
classic posture of the Buddha sitting upright and

38
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:13,080
cross-legged posture is that there's no obstructions in this body no places that

39
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:19,859
are contracted or limited or collapsed

40
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:26,759
sometimes if we sit too comfortably in a couch it might be comfortable

41
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:31,800
but maybe there's a way in which the shoulders and the upper body is kind of

42
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:38,400
curled and curved in such a way that it doesn't

43
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:46,340
really allow kind of obstructs a kind of compresses a little bit the chest and

44
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,759
unobstructed posture

45
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,300
and then to gently close your eyes

46
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:13,800
and without much more ado to take a few moments

47
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:20,720
to recognize to know how you are in your body

48
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:30,479
how you are in your mind and heart and how you know it is important

49
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,860
to know it's simply matter-of-factly

50
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:40,460
to know it without being for or against

51
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,280
and in recognizing how you are now

52
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,600
going into your body feel

53
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:19,979
what that feels like the somatic experience

54
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:25,039
of how you are in your body and your mind and your heart

55
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:39,918
and again how you feel is important to feel it with a radical simplicity

56
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:48,380
not having an agenda or a need imposed on what it feels like

57
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,580
not trying to change anything

58
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:09,419
offering a respectful attention in feeling sensing

59
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:16,740
how you are somatically

60
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,900
and then to

61
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:47,720
relax the body

62
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:57,199
relax the body on the exhale

63
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:12,680
and how you relax is important to relax without trying too hard

64
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:20,880
trying hard at all just relaxing simply matter-of-factly

65
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,520
content in doing so

66
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,918
in whatever way is easy

67
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:18,920
and now maybe taking a few longer deeper inhales

68
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:25,820
gently on the exhale relaxing deeper

69
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:33,660
relaxation that follows it longer in exhale longer exhale

70
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,940
all the way to the end of the exhale

71
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,839
and now letting the breathing return to normal

72
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:18,380
recognizing knowing what it's like for your body to be breathing now

73
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:25,920
and how you know is important being content to know it in whatever way

74
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:32,060
is most obvious no need to

75
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,920
analyze or bore down just the simplest way knowing

76
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,140
what you like for your body to be breathing

77
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:08,399
and then to feel what it's like for the body to be breathing

78
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,279
feeling the somatic experience of breathing

79
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:45,540
and then without much any without any ambition of

80
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:52,279
how well you can do this gently

81
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:56,899
soften and relax the breathing

82
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:04,820
soften the muscles that engage around breathing

83
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:19,220
maybe softening the muscles of the belly

84
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,320
and then to be with your breathing in a simple

85
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:20,480
way resting and breathing

86
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:31,320
and whichever is easiest to help you stay with your breaths helping you quiet your mind

87
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:38,579
stay with the knowing recognizing inhales and exhales

88
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:45,139
or stay resting in the feeling the somatic sensations of breath

89
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:50,000
riding those Sensations

90
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:59,899
and with every exhale quieting the thinking mind

91
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,779
thank you

92
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:44,600
and as we come to the end of the sitting

93
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:54,440
perhaps we're always a beginner in our relationships to other people

94
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:02,840
are always changing we're changing contexts changes

95
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:09,360
foreign and to be a beginner is to

96
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:15,740
be willing to not bring with us

97
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:22,460
the old beliefs associations ideas of who people are

98
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:27,840
but to see them freshly

99
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:35,700
but more important as we become experienced in meditation we learned

100
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:42,900
that the how we're aware is important we learn to be aware without

101
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:49,880
our judgments and preferences and agendas and needs

102
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:57,679
we learn to see others simply and openly

103
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:06,980
with our feelings about them

104
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:16,620
still feeling the way we do but see them to know them

105
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:21,900
without the filter of the feelings feelings are one thing and

106
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,980
seeing is another

107
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,240
and to see freshly

108
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:40,980
without philosophy without cynicism and skepticism

109
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,940
just see

110
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:57,179
and perhaps to see then with kindness

111
00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:04,880
with good will with the friendliness

112
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:15,360
with care to gaze Upon This World kindly

113
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,440
as a beginner

114
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:25,100
may all beings be happy

115
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:34,039
may all beings be safe

116
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,320
may all beings

117
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:47,480
no deep contentment

118
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:59,000
may all beings know that they are respected

119
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,279
may all beings be free

120
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:15,740
and may we contribute to that possibility

121
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:26,549
[Music]

122
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,640
[Music]

123
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:48,120
so hello everyone I'm happy to be back after I've been

124
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:53,340
gone for a while and um

125
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:59,419
I trust that you were well cared for by Our Guest teachers

126
00:30:59,419 --> 00:31:05,940
they're all they're all wonderful teachers and very happy that you're able to that

127
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:12,179
they're able to come and teach and that you were able to hear their teachings

128
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:20,059
and experience their presence and how they are and um

129
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:29,340
and I think that this coming year the it'll be I think starting next week the

130
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:36,539
fourth year that we'd start doing these 7 A.M teachings that they'll be gone more than I have

131
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:42,600
been and um so that we'll have more these guest

132
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:48,419
teachers coming through and some of the same will return and some probably all of them will return at some point and

133
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:56,360
and um and others as well will come along and you could experience a range

134
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,960
so um

135
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:08,760
so at the beginning of the year I started teaching about challenges how to

136
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:15,659
practice with challenges the plan is to continue doing that and thinking about it today I thought

137
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:22,679
well that's what all of Buddhism is Buddhism is how to practice with challenges and overcome cat challenges

138
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:29,279
into Buddhism doesn't use that word at the center of it all but I think that in focusing on it here

139
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:34,860
now and these these this year that um

140
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:40,380
I'm highlighting how practice is certainly useful in everyday life

141
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:45,600
but how it's useful when there's stress when there's anxiety when there's

142
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:52,940
confusion and difficulty and that kind of heightens the level of uh

143
00:32:52,940 --> 00:33:00,059
of a sense of there's a challenge there's a difficulty here and that can be a range it can be the

144
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:05,520
simplest little thing and but it could also be some of the

145
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:11,179
major life challenges that people have that um

146
00:33:11,179 --> 00:33:17,640
sickness old age and death people go through tremendous horrific experiences

147
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:23,880
in their life and how to deal with those is calling him challenges maybe is to make

148
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:30,779
him too too small and but uh but in this this teachings on

149
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:36,659
how to work with challenges is difficulties is you know what to do when

150
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:43,100
things get kind of life gets concentrated

151
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:48,080
so that there's a lot of intensity all at once

152
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:56,880
so what I'd like to do this week is go back to the four foundations of mindfulness the beginning of this series

153
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:03,779
I did this week we did a week on each Foundation of mindfulness and today I'd like to this week I'd like

154
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:10,560
to focus on mindfulness of the body that the body in Buddhism mindfulness to

155
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:18,358
the body has been emphasized tremendously since the time of the Buddha it's such an important part of

156
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:26,280
practice the Buddha even said emphatically in a variety of different ways that there is no maturation in this

157
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:33,500
Dharma practice without mindfulness of the body and in recent decades this will become a

158
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:40,740
tremendous appreciation of the value of the body for

159
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:45,780
healing the psychological healing that um

160
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:52,200
maybe starting in the probably the 50s 1950s

161
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:58,619
and then onwards there were psychologists who were discovering how important it is to really drop into the

162
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:05,880
body feel the body feel the psychology as it's manifested in the body and then more recently it's recognition

163
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:10,920
of how important that is somatic work is for trauma

164
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:16,859
so in Buddhism we have this emphasis on mindfulness of the body and and have it

165
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:22,500
using the body connecting to the body in times of challenges is invaluable

166
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:27,660
then in the four foundations of mindfulness there are

167
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:34,619
um six exercises on mindfulness of the body and uh and so we'll go through five of

168
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:43,320
them this week and the first one is breathing and in times of challenge remember to

169
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:48,480
breathe remember to breathe mindfully in a warily because when we get challenged

170
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:55,800
the breathing tends to get tight or constricted which tends to reinforce attention

171
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:03,180
before a force agitation shutting down even and it might be valuable to kind of for

172
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:08,339
the breathing to stop or slow down to be constricted if in fact we have to get

173
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:14,520
into a fight or have to fight have to run or do something but in many challenges that's not what's

174
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:21,300
needed to happen and what needs to happen many times is to calm down and

175
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:26,520
take a deep look at what's going on so that wisdom can operate the clarity can operate

176
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:32,880
and um and then especially if there's a if there's uh we feel challenged when there's not an immediate challenge

177
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,040
present it's uh the challenge is someplace else in the future or has been

178
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:44,040
or dealing with the repercussions of it and then we can then maybe we can take

179
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:49,380
that time to catch our breath we say come back and breathe

180
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:55,400
and um and so you know take deep breaths exhale

181
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:02,820
it's invaluable simply to do the three breath Journey and that is

182
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:09,540
just maybe close your eyes but just uh uh for three breaths follow be with

183
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:14,820
those three breaths and in everyday life if you go around and if you stop for take those three

184
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:20,160
breath Journey that's enough sometimes to just shift and change a significant

185
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:27,060
amount of how we are how we feel how we see the situation and if you do a three breath Journey

186
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:34,619
once every hour I bet that your whole day will start having a very different flavor

187
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:40,020
so I come back and and check in with my breathing you know regularly kind of a

188
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:46,440
constantly it's it's all these years of practice has become second nature to feel my breath to connect my breath see

189
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:52,740
where the where the constrictions where I'm tight where slapping in the belly what's happening in the chest uh how am

190
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:58,079
I breathing and um and to use the breath as a relaxation

191
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:04,920
so when the Buddha began the Spore foundations of mindfulness he talked about he put breathing at the center of

192
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:10,440
it because it's first so to connect to your breathing

193
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:16,980
and and recognize the breath and then as we begin recognizing

194
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:24,660
breathing then begin feeling he said the whole body I'd like to begin by just feeling

195
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:31,980
the experience of breathing throughout the body wherever breath breathing whatever is influenced or touched by the

196
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:38,339
experience of breathing and to take time to feel the somatic experience of breathing in the body how

197
00:38:38,339 --> 00:38:44,040
is it and then um and then they would have went on to say if after you felt the whole body

198
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:51,300
relax the tension in the body relax the body and this is kind of the beginner

199
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:56,880
practice however so many of you have been practicing for some time and as I said

200
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:03,119
in the guided meditation I think most of us most of the time are

201
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:10,140
practicing as beginners and we sit down and the mind is busy and agitated or spinning around concerned

202
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:16,140
there's maybe we've had a busy day and there's tension in the body and the mind is not settled and calm and immediately

203
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:23,339
gets concentrated so we're kind of like a beginner and and to just appreciate them maybe

204
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:31,020
you know just as a almost like a assumption that mostly we're practicing as beginners and sometimes we are

205
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:38,579
practicing like you know like really getting made deep in meditation but the as being beginners people who

206
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:45,540
are experienced in practice are quite willing to begin again and again be beginners in meditation but what shifted

207
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:51,119
is their attitude one is there's a willingness to be there for that experience not to be fighting

208
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:56,460
it or agitating it or judging I think I'm I'm not doing it right I'm supposed to do it right what's supposed to happen

209
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:03,720
here um there isn't there's a more spaciousness a graciousness with oh

210
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:09,720
um I'm just here practicing beginning exercises it's okay and and not to be

211
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:16,740
I'm not gonna and there's a feeling that the how we're mindful is more important than how deep we go

212
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:21,839
and rather than kind of jumping ahead like leapfrogging ahead into what we

213
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:28,460
want to have happen in some depth of practice it's um is where we take a backward step

214
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:36,599
into recognizing how am I right now how am I feeling and how am I being aware

215
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:42,960
am I being aware with with strain am I being aware with need and wanting

216
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:49,380
and trying to fix something am I judging you am I for or against my experience am

217
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:56,220
I complacent am I you know I'm here but I'm not really you know that interested in meditating

218
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:02,760
and I'm just gonna I meditate every day and I'm just here so I'll just kind of like Daydream or something because I'm

219
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:08,400
not really into it so how how is the mindfulness how are we practicing

220
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:14,220
becomes important for beginners they know that that's an important thing to look at and be with

221
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:19,740
and then as we become aware of how we are in any situation how are we how are

222
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:25,260
we with challenges how are we paying attention to our difficulties and what's

223
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:32,040
going on for us then to breathe in the middle of it you feel and allow yourself to breathe

224
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:40,680
and the rhythm of breathing the massage of breathing maybe taking some deep breaths and exhaling long and deep

225
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:45,839
and then with the breath at the center uh start feeling the whole somatic

226
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:53,880
experience of body as much as it's easily available and relax the body

227
00:41:53,880 --> 00:42:02,880
so these are the three steps that the Buddha offers is kind of beginning practice uh is to recognize what's happening with

228
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:09,599
oneself to feel it to sense it to experience it somatically

229
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:15,260
and then to relax and those three are wonderful little

230
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:22,020
three-step process and as practice unfolds it might seem

231
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:28,859
that first one of those is not really relevant and then no longer necessary you don't

232
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:35,520
need to relax anymore and then it's just recognizing and feeling at some point feeling the experience

233
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:43,220
might feel too much or recognizing the experience might be too much and then the practice gets simpler and simpler

234
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:48,839
so um so when we when you have challenges

235
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:54,420
you might do a few things you might do the threes breath Journey

236
00:42:54,420 --> 00:43:02,400
when you recognize oh I'm challenged now take time and and unless it's less the

237
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:08,280
you know the threat is immediate uh if you know there's some time and

238
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:15,000
space then um take at least a three you know the time

239
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:21,660
for three breaths close your eyes and just kind of be really intimate then follow and connect it to three breaths

240
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:28,859
just three and see what happens the other is to practice these three steps the Buddha talked about

241
00:43:28,859 --> 00:43:36,359
really recognize how you are feel how you are somatically

242
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:45,060
and then relax and that can be done together with breathing and and this is beginner practice

243
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:52,619
and if you are an experienced beginner then you know that how you're practicing

244
00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:57,780
is as important is there and you can feel you can recognize how you're

245
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:03,300
practicing you can feel it somatically how you're practicing if there's strain or tension

246
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:10,200
and you can relax how you're practicing so there's no extra attention involved

247
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:15,900
in the practice that you do so if you should have some challenges

248
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:21,420
today and unless it's immediate threat that needs to be addressed I'd encourage

249
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:29,099
you to uh engage with practice practice in the middle of it it's invaluable to practice

250
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:34,560
and challenges it really strengthes and inspires and and really that's where the

251
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:40,619
kind of a muscle of practice and maturation of practice really starts

252
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:47,280
taking hold so thank you and um

253
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,680
and then we will continue tomorrow
