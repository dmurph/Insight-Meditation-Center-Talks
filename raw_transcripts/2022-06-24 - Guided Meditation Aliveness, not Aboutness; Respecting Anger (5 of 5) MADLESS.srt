1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,759
so hello hello everyone from everywhere and

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,240
now here we come at the end of the week

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:26,720
and i believe that these days that i've been sitting down here i've been feeling fairly

4
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:36,640
you know empty in a nice very nice way i hope that

5
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:45,840
it comes across okay in in this youtube world

6
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,480
the um so

7
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,320
what if we study our thinking and

8
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:08,000
one of the ways to understand is we usually thoughts are usually about something

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,439
so about the meal i'm going to have with about the meal that i just had that wasn't just

10
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:19,200
quite right or the work or a conversation or an event that happened

11
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,799
or about some self-concern or about plans we're making

12
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,799
or about a fantasy we have we think about things

13
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,960
and the world of aboutness is at least one step removed

14
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,200
from the world of aliveness and in some ways the world of aboutness

15
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,399
is maybe a one-dimensional two-dimensional world it's a kind of a virtual reality world that

16
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,680
world of thoughts i love my thoughts mostly

17
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,000
i mean at least i have a very positive relationship to them and um so i don't i don't feel like i

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,280
need to be critical of them but i am aware that they are

19
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,200
about something and if i spend too much time in that world of aboutness

20
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,040
then i become separated from the world of aliveness

21
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,720
and one way of understanding this [Music] meditation is it's a switch

22
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,640
from aboutness to aliveness that we're

23
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,519
not so focused on the world as of aboutness but we're focused on the world the

24
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,840
living world that we can experience and feel and see and touch and know directly

25
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,239
here and now and so this distinction between think thoughts being

26
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:59,519
the world of aboutness maybe helps you to break the enchantment with them

27
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,560
or break the allure or the strong pull into the world of thoughts

28
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,760
and this idea that the alternative in meditation is the world of aliveness

29
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,800
maybe that is a welcoming idea to show up here for

30
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,120
your lived experience of the moment

31
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,840
so assuming a meditation posture

32
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,799
and gently closing your eyes

33
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:58,159
into gently slowly as if you're like you're entering into a

34
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,680
beautiful place a forest or a sacred grove or

35
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:11,760
gently slowly take some deeper breaths

36
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,280
just deep enough that it remains comfortable for you

37
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,120
and maybe in a way that's comfortable taking these deep breaths and then slow

38
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:36,880
long exhale maybe exhaling more than usual

39
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:44,560
and as you exhale let the shoulders relax the belly relax

40
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,080
let your body settle here

41
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:10,280
letting your breathing return to normal to begin meditation with relaxing

42
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,639
is also a way of settling into the lived body

43
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:22,880
the experience of aliveness in the body

44
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,120
so as you exhale you might relax the muscles of your face

45
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:41,280
and maybe the character of aliveness in the face changes as the face relaxes

46
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,000
on the exhale softening the shoulders

47
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,960
and as you do so perhaps the shoulders

48
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,918
expand in their aliveness

49
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,319
the range of feelings

50
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:38,080
softening the belly settling in

51
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,440
letting your belly hang forward and down maybe

52
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:53,360
the belly relaxes the center of gravity settles in the body

53
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:07,039
and then to have a global awareness of the body

54
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,400
meaning a wide broad experience of the body as

55
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,280
is available for you

56
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:40,240
and on the exhale i'm just softening the whole body

57
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:48,759
and softening into the sense of aliveness in the body

58
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,919
and then relaxing into the body breathing in

59
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:48,399
many ways breathing is an animating force for our lived life

60
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,760
and feeling though how the body experiences breathing

61
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,079
settling in

62
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:38,800
and if your mind goes into the world of thoughts maybe think of it as

63
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,880
the world of aboutness maybe even noticing that you're thinking

64
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,600
about something of course

65
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,399
but that's a bit removed from the world of aliveness

66
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,959
here here and now in the body

67
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,600
for these minutes choose aliveness

68
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,399
instead of aboutness

69
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:42,480
it makes a difference if we live in the world of aboutness

70
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:48,960
or the world of aliveness it makes a difference for the emotions

71
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:55,320
that can be present for us

72
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:03,200
some emotions are born from aboutness the thoughts the stories

73
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:09,840
and some emotions arise out of the aliveness

74
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,679
aliveness which has a quality of freedom in it openness

75
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,679
allowing

76
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:33,840
notice the earpoint what arises from your aliveness

77
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,080
not your aboutness

78
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,919
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

79
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,559
to see if you can touch into

80
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:31,039
a place of tender love or good will kindness

81
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:39,279
that doesn't arise out of aboutness that you're thinking yourself into it

82
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:46,840
but maybe someplace deeper in embodied in your

83
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,960
heart an aliveness

84
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:59,799
that comes from being relaxed and open and available for this world

85
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:09,520
and imagine going into the world now

86
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,840
this way

87
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:26,720
maybe imagine going into the world with the equivalent of midas is touch

88
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:35,520
that whatever you touch you meet you touch it with good will

89
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:42,519
with kindness with care

90
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,720
may all beings be happy

91
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:00,240
may all beings be safe

92
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:07,278
may all beings be peaceful

93
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,639
may all beings be free

94
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:35,709
[Music]

95
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:45,278
uh so good morning good day

96
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:54,600
here we are at the in the last talk about anger

97
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:01,600
and anger might arise out of a particular incident

98
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:07,120
in the moment and even if it does if it lasts

99
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:12,399
it has moved from the world of immediacy and aliveness

100
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:18,640
into the world of our memory and thoughts ideas story making in the mind

101
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:25,760
and it turns out that a lot of anger anything that's chronic resentment and

102
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:32,720
irritation has a lot to do with the world of aboutness the world of thinking about

103
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,720
things the storymaking that we do and the more intense and involved we are

104
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:44,640
with anger the more there's a

105
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:51,600
diminishment or a loss that we experience there is a kind of suffering that kind

106
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:57,760
of pain and stress that comes with being angry and there's also the more stronger it is

107
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:03,440
the more there's a preoccupation with some something about something

108
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:11,440
and um and that preoccupation means that we're not available for a wider range of our

109
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:19,039
emotional uh spiritual inner life that um and in our life

110
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:25,679
that um that uh to not be caught up in anything we're we're

111
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:33,440
available for a range of responses a range of empathy a range of uh perception of what's happening

112
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,960
and that gets diminished the more we get preoccupied and the one of the

113
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,640
one way to get preoccupied is around anger and at times it gets quite intense

114
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,320
and it really diminishes our capacity to feel to sense to experience to perceive

115
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:57,200
the world in ourselves as the world of anger tends to get reduced more and more

116
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:03,360
and it gets reduced off into a world of aboutness even if there's a mood

117
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:09,679
that's kind of you know angry irritated hostile mood

118
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:15,919
it's probably being fueled by some background story belief idea that's

119
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:23,519
going on and to have the courage to drop the beliefs the courage to

120
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:29,360
drop the preoccupations the stories in order to be present more fully

121
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:35,840
for the aliveness of our of our life so in this week one of the things i hope

122
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:41,360
that i've conveyed is that anger is a worthwhile

123
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,960
subject for attention for mindfulness and for study

124
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:53,518
that rather than having some blanket policy that anger is bad and we shouldn't be angry

125
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:58,960
we don't need to have that policy because we have a mindfulness practice

126
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:04,480
that can help us find a way through the anger and we can understand what is

127
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:10,080
dysfunctional about anger what is causing our stress for ourselves with anger what is

128
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:15,279
unnecessary what is what diminishes us we can kind of

129
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:22,159
use it as an object of mindfulness to reclaim our freedom our independence our

130
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:28,159
ability not to be caught by it and uh in the process of that we learn a lot

131
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:34,960
and uh so using anger as a as a means a medium

132
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:42,399
for learning about the grievance we have about the about the difficulty that's happening

133
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:48,320
about the the challenge that's somehow rather

134
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:54,000
represented by the anger and by studying it we get to distinguish

135
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:01,360
between um where the where the essence of the the essential part of study is

136
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,399
sometimes we have to study what's happening externally and understand the situation better

137
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:12,240
and sometimes we have to understand ourselves better because that's really the genesis or the

138
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:17,919
the active kind of um center of the anger and that's where

139
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:24,320
it's productive to bring our attention to so as we as i bring this to a conclusion

140
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:30,240
this that topic of anger i would like to offer you an acronym

141
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:36,720
a bit long maybe and uh and the accurate acronym is mad

142
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:44,158
less to be without mad without anger be coming to madlessness madness

143
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:50,000
and if you're looking at this at the youtube now in the underneath the photograph where it says a few

144
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,480
information about imc and the information square i have written out the the um the

145
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,680
acronym so the m is motivation

146
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:08,240
the a is attention d is to diffuse

147
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:13,839
l is to learn e is empathy

148
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:19,119
and s is to have story substitution

149
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:25,680
change the story and then the second s is to speak

150
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:32,960
we don't want to be mindful and resolve our anger and then become silent when the world needs

151
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:39,760
us to speak the situation needs us to speak about what's going on we sometimes diffuse anger

152
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:47,200
so that we can address a real world need so motivation

153
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:53,359
anger itself think of it as a motivational feeling what does it want what is it trying to

154
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:58,720
do what's what's really happening there and we're trying to get rid of something

155
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:04,800
we're trying to change something are we trying to get away from something are we trying to attack someone is there

156
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,839
hostility which is kind of a motivation are we trying to

157
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:17,200
harm someone hurt someone with our words maybe get back at them

158
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:23,359
and or are we trying to change a situation that needs to be changed

159
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:29,440
is it uh or what change are we trying to evoke with anger

160
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:35,920
trying to make happen so to study what is anger about what's its purpose uh what's it and is it really the

161
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:42,880
purpose we we stand behind do we have another motivation that's more valuable for us more important that

162
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:49,920
comes to the surface if we spend time looking at the purpose the motivation of the anger

163
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:56,480
attention is to really bring a lot of attention to this experience of anger

164
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,520
one of the fundamental aspects of mindfulness meditation

165
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:08,720
is mindfulness of the body so bringing attention to the body if we really feel our body when we're

166
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:15,440
angry it tends to dissipate it tends to create some space for it it also it

167
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:22,400
teaches us a lot about how we're involved with the anger that we're contracted and tight and then

168
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,599
leaning forward or pulling back whatever we're doing

169
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:33,040
maybe we notice our fist is clenched so to keep coming back to the body i've

170
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:39,520
been angry in the past where i didn't know what was going on with my body many years ago i was really angry with

171
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:44,880
someone i didn't know it and there was a pause the person had to go away to do something

172
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,920
and so then i noticed my body and i noticed that i was leaning forward

173
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:57,119
and tight and so then i came back into myself and it made a huge difference

174
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:04,400
and so we use attention to notice what's happening here for us and all these different uh practices of

175
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,520
madness all require some use of attention

176
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:15,680
and then to diffuse it to diffuse means to use these terms in terms of not so

177
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:20,720
much to take the fuse away but is to dissipate or to reduce the tension

178
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:27,280
that's there and the less tension there is in anger

179
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:33,040
the wiser will become the less we're under the influence of the anger

180
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:38,320
so to develop and learn skills of diffusion of relaxation of calming

181
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:44,560
breathing deeply relaxing the body taking a posture that's stable and strong that allows

182
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,680
kind of you know a different kind of attention where

183
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:55,280
we're more present in a in a um

184
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:00,560
in in a in a way that we are in charge we were

185
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:05,839
more capable of making wise choices

186
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:11,200
um and then to learn i think this is one of the great uh

187
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,400
principles around anger always when we're angry there's something to learn

188
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,440
and take the time to learn it what's the lesson that's here

189
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,960
and now for many of us i think there's a huge lesson to be learned

190
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,800
within ourselves what is the attachment that triggered the anger what's the place inside the

191
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,920
belief the sense of self what's the history we have what's the

192
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,960
wound we have that's been now touched by the incident around us

193
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:50,000
the unattended unresolved wounds we carry with us and so to learn what's going on sometimes we

194
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,200
will learn outside and one of the things to learn outside is to learn

195
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:02,000
what's going on with the other people what's really happening there many years ago i read about it

196
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,560
that the new york in new york the bus system they

197
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:15,680
gave as kind of a training for bus drivers they showed them a video of

198
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:21,359
of people who get on the bus who are very annoying to

199
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:28,000
bus drivers that they just have behavior which is kind of troublesome difficult

200
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,240
and and they interviewed or described or talked to these people

201
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:39,920
and found out that they had all kinds of personal circumstances very difficult

202
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,599
learning disabilities maybe

203
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:52,560
all kinds of personal challenges that were not obvious on the surface and as soon as the bus drivers began looking

204
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:57,680
at these personal challenges these people had their anger and annoyance to people who

205
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:03,760
were difficult on the bus decreased dramatically that if we take time to learn about who

206
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:09,200
people are maybe there's much less reason to be angry

207
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:16,560
though there might be reasons for compassion and care and having a strong conversation

208
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:24,720
and then to have empathy to care about others to have love to

209
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:29,760
have um kindness to um trying to kind of

210
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:35,359
following up what i just said about learn really get to know people and and

211
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:40,480
understand more deeply what's going on with them when they behave even people pay very difficult

212
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,599
difficulty and but not so much because they deserve it

213
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:51,119
but because it's actually better medicine for each of us for ourselves

214
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:58,079
to have degrees of compassion love kindness then empathy than it is to do the

215
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:03,200
opposite and to be closed and

216
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,280
not

217
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:22,079
many of available anger has to do with some story we're telling ourselves and i've had anger with people and i had the

218
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:28,480
wrong story i had made up a story in which was an interpretation that wasn't really what happened

219
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:34,480
and and so be very careful the stories you tell yourself the fish gets bigger the more they tell

220
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:41,040
the story they say uh what stories are you telling and are are they really accurate

221
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:48,800
check out the story find out say this is what i understand happen and maybe it didn't happen that way

222
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:54,000
and or maybe there's more to it than meets the eye

223
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:59,839
and then speak we talked about this yesterday and as i said earlier

224
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:05,200
mindfulness meditation this buddhist approach to anger is not to make us

225
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:12,560
passive mute silent uninterested and uninvolved with the world and other people most

226
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:17,920
anger is social most anger has to do with people around us especially if it's really

227
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:23,119
really intense and simmers and lasts the anger we have for technology or the

228
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:28,640
weather or something doesn't have the same power as the anger we have with people in

229
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:34,560
social circumstances and and

230
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:42,160
so it implies that sometimes it's very important in the social world to speak and what do we speak how do we speak

231
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:48,800
how do we speak with kindness and clarity and purpose for bringing the welfare of everyone

232
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:54,160
involved and so that i think is one of the principles i'd like to end this

233
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:59,280
discussion on anger the principle that we live a life that

234
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,319
looks for what's best for everyone involved in a situation

235
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:10,240
we don't look at just what's best for ourselves we look at what's best for everyone

236
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:17,359
surprisingly even for the people who've harmed us that uh what's best for them

237
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:23,119
because what's best for ourselves and best for others fits into what's best overall

238
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:29,599
as we create a better society i'd like to end with a a quote from

239
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:36,880
mahakusananda he was kind of like the um mahatma gandhi of

240
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:42,240
of cambodia or i mean it was a after the khmer rouge

241
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:49,920
the genocide there he was the the buddhist leader of cambodia buddhist monk i met him lovely man very peaceful

242
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:56,560
very loving full of smiles and he wrote

243
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:05,520
here i do not question that loving ones of oppressors

244
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:12,079
cambodians loving the khmer rouge may be the most difficult attitude to achieve

245
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:18,319
but it is a law of the universe that retaliation hatred and revenge only

246
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:24,240
continue the cycle and never stop it reconciliation does not mean that we

247
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:29,920
surrender rights and conditions but rather we use love in all our

248
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:35,599
negotiations it means that we see ourselves in the opponent

249
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:40,880
for what is the opponent but being but a being in ignorance

250
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:47,440
and we ourselves are also ignorant of many things therefore only loving kindness and right

251
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,520
mindfulness can free us

252
00:45:53,920 --> 00:46:00,480
so to practice bring anger bring anger under their purview of our

253
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:05,599
practice our mindfulness and maybe we can

254
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:12,000
negotiate with our enemies with love

255
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:18,880
so speak so thank you and i have a few announcements

256
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:26,240
uh one is that uh i'll be away on vacation next week and so my friend and wonderful zen teacher

257

258
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:37,119
and some of you remember paul he came and did a week back last april and april

259
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:43,440
may when i did the zen vipassana kind of retreat and

260
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:50,880
so i'm very happy he's coming and the um

261
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:59,839
tomorrow imc's earth care group has a wonderful teacher named nissera coming to give a dharma talk you

262
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:06,960
have to go into imc's website i think it's listed under what's new and finally

263
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:12,960
i mentioned a couple weeks ago i think that i'm doing a day-long retreat on

264
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:18,000
online on july 9th

265
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,280
and i think it was not so easy to find where to register or the information about it

266
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:30,000
it should be easier now because now it's in on in the what's new section of imc's website much more clearly

267
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:37,119
and eventually it'll be clearly i think on the calendar as well and um but for now it's uh you know in

268
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:44,240
the what's new in the home page so um thank you and i look forward to
