1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:07,759
so hello and good morning having been away for a couple of weeks

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:15,359
that Overlook some of the different settings that have to be created for this YouTube

3
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:21,640
broadcast I'm very happy to be back here and be with you and to continue with

4
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,720
this series on samade and it does feel like a bit of a

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,800
gap between over these two weeks so it might be good to kind

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,520
of um maybe review or start slowly again

7
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,200
this week and um from the very beginning of

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,559
the Samar series I emphasize the that the foundation of it is to First

9
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:57,079
discover first realize or notice how we are that we're not trying to override

10
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:03,960
ourselves we're not trying to bypass ourselves with somebody but in a sense in a certain

11
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,759
kind of way to go through US ourselves and so to discover what's here

12
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:16,400
in our body mind and heart but that that how we discover it

13
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:24,240
is almost more important than what we discover the how is to be at ease to not

14
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,000
judge to not react to have a lightness in the knowing and the Discover

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,159
Discovery and the checking it out not trying to make anything happen

16
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:42,799
or just just see and the how we are mindful the how

17
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,040
we are

18
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:55,560
focusing is so important for somadi if we if we Overlook if we don't

19
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:03,000
notice how we are the how actually makes it can make it either harder or easier

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:12,200
to become deeply settled and by discovering how we

21
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:20,200
are two things are possible one is that we can we can

22
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,440
start um we can calm bring a sense of

23
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,840
calmness Tranquility to how we are so that the

24
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,160
natural process of coming to equilibrium natural process of healing

25
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:45,599
of settling has a chance somebody has a lot to do with um allowing a natural process

26
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,560
of settling to work its way through

27
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,560
us and the other is to um uh to discover

28
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,040
the process of discovery is one of one of the ways to come into a fullness of

29
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,760
being that Samar again is not a bypass but it's you want to really have a

30
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:15,319
fullness atten Global awareness as if all of who we are is included and comes

31
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:24,239
into harmony as we meditate so to assume a meditation

32
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,920
posture and to

33
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:38,120
either lower your gaze relaxing your

34
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:48,040
eyes or closing your eyes and softening the eyes and the eye

35
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,920
sockets and to begin the process of discovery

36
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:07,200
just notice how you are whatever way that appears for

37
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,720
you but being careful for how you discover how you

38
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,600
notice can you notice in an open

39
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:29,199
way can you notice in a way that doesn't make anything a problem

40
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:38,520
as if what you notice can benefit from the Simplicity of how you

41
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,800
know

42
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:00,720
it and if you kind of step back in a sense to have a global

43
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:10,360
awareness of yourself what do you notice how are

44
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:17,440
you and can you be aware of it kindly gently

45
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:26,840
openly the how we're aware so important

46
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:45,479
allowing that part of you that is silent that part of you that's not

47
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:53,680
involved in a lot of thinking and judging to be gently aware globally

48
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,199
aware of yourself

49
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,840
and then

50
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:28,240
to gently take a few longer and deeper

51
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:37,120
breaths not too much but enough to feel it kind of more

52
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,919
full connection to your torso your rib cage

53
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:45,160
your

54
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,560
belly and as you exhale to relax the

55
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:08,680
body to calm to let there be a calming effect through your whole system

56
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,680
letting your breathing return to

57
00:07:52,800 --> 00:08:00,159
normal and continue on the exhale to soften

58
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:14,159
relax while on the inhale you discover you know more

59
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:18,400
fully something about how you

60
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,479
are for

61
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,760
and then again to have a global awareness of your

62
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:21,079
body in whatever way that's easy for you either your attention can just

63
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:28,440
wander around or is as if you have an overview

64
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,360
of the whole thing

65
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:52,160
including an overview of how your mind is your thinking mind as if the thinking mind is part of

66
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:59,320
the whole not pulled away or separated

67
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,760
and as you exhale to let there be a calming of the

68
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,200
thinking

69
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,320
mind for

70
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,120
and then finding your

71
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,240
way to the end of your

72
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,360
exhale as if with the

73
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:34,120
exhale you're being led to the last place deep

74
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:40,000
inside where the exhale you feel the

75
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:48,040
exhale maybe down to the grounding place the settling

76
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:54,000
place from where then the inhale begins

77
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:08,240
in the middle of your whole

78
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:21,240
being let let yourself come to rest at the end of the

79
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:27,120
exhale maybe even having a moment pause before you breathe

80
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,160
in half a moment

81
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:56,839
allowing the inhale to begin rise out of the grounding

82
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:01,120
place the settling place

83
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:05,480
deep within your

84
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,120
torso e

85
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:32,079
for

86
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
for

87
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
for

88
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
for

89
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
for

90
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
for

91
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,760
for for

92
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:35,200
at the end of the exhale a slight

93
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,840
pause and then as you breathe

94
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,320
in

95
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:57,880
feel a growing fullness of your body as you breathe in

96
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:11,159
as if your whole body is participating in the

97
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:22,360
inhale and your whole body is relaxing

98
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,880
settling on the

99
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
exhale

100
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
for

101
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
for

102
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
for

103
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
for

104
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
for

105
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
for

106
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,440
for e

107
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,158
and then as we come to the end of this

108
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:56,000
sitting to feel again your Global being

109
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:09,278
become aware of a global sense of being here in your

110
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:14,600
body and to discover how it's different now than at

111
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,760
the beginning

112
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:40,440
and to expand that Global sense of attention beyond your body into the room

113
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:48,159
you're in location you're in out into the wider

114
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:57,880
world and in the middle of it all continue with breathing

115
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:05,200
as if the breathing begins at that subtle spot grounding place

116
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:13,039
within and expand and the world expands from

117
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:17,639
there and returns there on the

118
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:30,240
exhale and between the exhale and

119
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:35,398
inhale maybe a momentary

120
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:51,279
Stillness and from that Stillness as the breathing inhale

121
00:26:51,279 --> 00:27:00,240
expands so expanding Circles of gazing upon the world

122
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:08,120
kindly Be Be Still inwardly

123
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:13,399
Still and gaze Upon This World

124
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:26,520
kindly how we're aware of the world is as important or more

125
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,840
important than what were aware

126
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:41,919
of to be aware of the world

127
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:52,919
kindly may all beings be happy may all beings be

128
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:59,320
safe may all beings be peaceful

129
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,799
may all beings be

130
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:16,278
free and may all beings be touched by

131
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:25,000
kindness and may our our kindness spread

132
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,559
out into the world

133
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:42,028
[Music]

134
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:48,360
[Music] thank

135
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,080
you e

136
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:57,440
so hello everyone and welcome to this uh ongoing series on

137
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:03,440
Som we had a two two we break as I was

138
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:09,880
mostly at our Retreat Center in Santa Cruz during this time and

139
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:15,480
um and now I'm happy to be back and it's a bit of a gap so I'd like

140
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:21,320
to just a little bit um kind of kind of start

141
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:28,039
over uh with meditation in general but also with especially with samade there's

142
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:35,679
something invaluable about always feeling like you're starting over so that you're not measuring or

143
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:43,320
looking for something or trying to tap into something too

144
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:50,039
quickly so that you sit down to just be with yourself as you are to discover how

145
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:56,039
you are because it's very easy in a life

146
00:30:56,039 --> 00:31:02,880
busy life full life scared life angry

147
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,399
life to view ourselves our world

148
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:17,559
partially to only be connected to part of who we are and to enter into

149
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:24,159
somadi really want to be connected to all of who we are because samadi is a

150
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:30,639
process of unification it's a process of gathering us elv together so that all parts of who

151
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:38,760
we are can be working together in harmony and um and so in the beginning

152
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:45,320
of this series I talked about somadi being a temple and that we're entering the

153
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:52,960
temple and uh we want to bring all of ourselves along and uh and we want to do it

154
00:31:52,960 --> 00:32:00,840
carefully with respect with kindness with a certain kind of of uh humility

155
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,278
or we're not

156
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:12,320
storming a fortress we're not storming and aggressively trying to attain

157
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:21,039
something we're going with respect and care and almost as if Dharma willing the

158
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:26,360
doors of the temple will open and we're bringing all of ourselves

159
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:34,399
along uh just like if you go to a literal to a sacred place all of you goes with you

160
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:40,039
and some sacred places some places that have tremendous Tranquility or peace or

161
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:46,360
sense of inspiration to be there it can actually kind of our whole body kind of

162
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:54,200
can kind of be awakened or tingle or feel inspired and feel included feel the

163
00:32:54,200 --> 00:33:01,159
calm of the place and so this ability to feel our whole

164
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:08,120
body to calm our whole body to settle ourselves the Buddha's instructions

165
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:15,360
for um first foundational instructions beginning instructions in mindfulness

166
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:21,080
and in anapanasati mindfulness of breathing is to

167
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:28,480
um breathe mindfully be present for your breathing feel the whole body

168
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:34,360
and then relax the body calm the body and when we feel the whole body

169
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:40,559
part of what we're feeling is the reactivity the tensions in the body the holding patterns the effect of our

170
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:49,399
karmic actions and um and uh the challenging aspects of our

171
00:33:49,399 --> 00:33:54,799
body one for the Buddha is recommendation is to bring a sense of

172
00:33:54,799 --> 00:34:02,960
calm to it let it bring Tranquility hold it calm it settle it like you would if

173
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:08,720
someone is really agitated dangerously so you might do things that are calming

174
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:18,000
for them so to to uh discover what's here to

175
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:26,919
enter in a calm way into the temple with all of ourselves and to um not be assertive and

176
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:32,240
not be expecting or wanting or pushing to make

177
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:39,599
something happen we have to be diligent in practicing somebody we have to be

178
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:44,638
deliberate there's a deliberateness like this I'm going to be here it's not too

179
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:49,800
casual it's not like oh I'll get around to it I'll just sit here and let something kind of settle by

180
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:57,760
itself um there is a deliberateness this is what I'm here to do

181
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:06,040
and then you might Begin by not trying too hard there is a kind of natural

182
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:13,359
settling that some people can experience if we don't try too much at the beginning maybe for 5 minutes 10 minutes

183
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:18,640
and then as we go further then the deliberateness comes into play more and

184
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:24,880
more okay here I am if we try to early we might be stressing ourselves or being

185
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:32,240
tense and deliberateness is uh um is to kind of Define this is the

186
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:38,240
territory here and now to be here with this experience

187
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:46,240
now and um and then to um steady

188
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:53,000
oneself to steady oneself stabilize oneself in a kind of inner Stillness

189
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:59,160
steady oneself in a kind of still way with the whole full breath coming and

190
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:05,359
going coming and going not fixating on the breath but as

191
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:11,720
if the breath is at the center of the global body the whole body and we're

192
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:20,760
resting there with the breath we're riding the breath we're surfing the breath we're coasting on the

193
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:28,440
breath so we practice and one of the things that can begin happening for some

194
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,640
people is that you feel the benefit of it in your daily

195
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:40,400
life be to to interrupt the normal patterns of thinking and reacting in the

196
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,880
mind the loops we're in around fear or

197
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:52,119
distress or anger with the world and how it is takes a break and we can

198
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:58,200
experience ourselves in a different way and uh that's more calm more centered

199
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:03,920
and not so easily caught in preoccupations and needs and all this

200
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:09,520
and that can make a world of difference and um when the world is in a a

201
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:16,400
difficult state samade is one of the great Protectors of us not to escape it

202
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:23,280
but to be able to be grounded and centered in ourselves so that we can go

203
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:31,440
into the world in a more effective way somadi is a um is a great support for

204
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:39,480
living our life and uh maybe we can live more calmly less reactively maybe from the

205
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:46,000
platform or that from the vantage point of being settled and unified and calm uh

206
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:53,520
we can go into the world more kindly and be more friendly less contentious less ready to

207
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:58,760
argue less ready to see conflict wherever we go

208
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:06,560
but to see wherever we go an opportunity for connection an opportunity for the

209
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:14,680
unification the unity the Gathering Together the connecting uh more and more fully

210
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:21,079
wherever we go whereas samadi is a unification of

211
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:26,319
body and mind right speech for the Buddha a

212
00:38:26,319 --> 00:38:32,680
speech which unifies people that overcomes divisiveness between people

213
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:39,359
and so we see here this parallel between unifying and harmonizing all of who we

214
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:45,160
are when we sit in meditation to not be contentious not

215
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:50,800
be um opposed or not be pushing away any

216
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:58,720
part of ourselves uh with uh how we live in our world to enter the world world to unify

217
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,760
to find connection to see if we could have a

218
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:12,000
warmhearted connection with someone uh rather than a contentious

219
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:20,319
one so Sadi is a great help for how we live our life and how we um go about and

220
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:25,839
for sombody to have its greatest benefit uh it probably it helps to be able to

221
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:33,000
practice every day so I hope that this uh our 7 a.m. sitting here in YouTube uh

222
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:40,119
allows some of you to have that continuity of every day and as we do this series on somat

223
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:45,880
and we get back in the swing a it or at least I get back in the swing of it

224
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:53,520
um that um this might be a good time to start meditating twice a day if you can

225
00:39:53,520 --> 00:40:01,520
and even if it's just 10 minutes the second time or 20 minutes the second time time to have uh one sitting here on

226
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:06,560
YouTube that's guided and but one sitting a day where you really don't

227
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:13,640
it's not guided you're just left with yourself and practicing in silence to whatever comes up and whatever you see

228
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:19,520
so you're developing it's kind of like taking the training wheels off and now you're getting to starting to see for

229
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:24,760
yourself what the experience is what's happening and some of you certainly can

230
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:31,280
practice more than 20 minutes or 10 minutes but maybe you don't and

231
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:36,720
um and uh so maybe you can figure out to

232
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:43,599
um you know to at least add a second sitting of some length that works for you and while as we as we continue for

233
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:51,119
some weeks more on this theme of samade and um to kind of re you know

234
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:56,800
remind you we're kind of uh in the reach the approach stage what's called access

235
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:04,560
concentration approaching a deeper Som so I want to kind of review a little bit and for a

236
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:11,359
few days and to get us warmed up again and then uh we'll kind of uh at least

237
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:16,760
talk about and point you to the possibility of deeper states of

238
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:24,160
concentration and um some of you it'll just be um informative some of you might

239
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:30,760
be familiar and recognize uh these states for yourself s and um and uh it's

240
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:38,400
part of the temple the Temple of samade so thank you very much and

241
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:44,680
um and I look forward to being with you again tomorrow
