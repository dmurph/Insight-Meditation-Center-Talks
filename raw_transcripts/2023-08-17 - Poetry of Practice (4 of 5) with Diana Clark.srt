1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:08,880
okay we'll get started here so I'm continuing on this uh theme of

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,960
The Poetry and practice and part of the power of poetry is that

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,600
it lets us see things in a different way maybe it's like pointing to things

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,900
differently Maybe by using some metaphor or maybe just using a different language

5
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,000
something different than the usual way that we consider things and sometimes

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,059
this perspective is surprising like oh yeah I hadn't thought of it uh this way

7
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:44,520
and maybe there's a little bit of humor to it or maybe there's a little surprise

8
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,620
or maybe there's even a little like oh yeah something that doesn't feel so

9
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,719
comfortable that when we recognize some of the maybe the deeper elements that

10
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:03,000
are getting pointed to and we recognize oh maybe I've just been on the surface but there's something deeper there too

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,060
so there's so many different ways in which another perspective might show up

12
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,340
and poetry helps us I would say and that's part of its power

13
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,619
is to see things from a different perspective it helps us not

14
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:26,180
see things or view things or consider things in the usual way

15
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,939
so today during as I've been doing in the preceding weeks I'll drop in a poem

16
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:38,159
during the guided meditation and I'll unpack the poem and talk about it and

17
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,860
some of the themes and maybe even share some additional poems after the guided

18
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:51,780
meditation Okay so with that as an introduction

19
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,840
we'll take a meditation posture

20
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:07,820
and taking a moment to settle in

21
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:18,959
taking a moment to tune into this experience

22
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,540
of beginning a meditation session

23
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:34,620
I like to begin by noticing the experience of

24
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,239
being in this particular configuration

25
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:47,780
might include one's environment what room you're in what location you're in

26
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:54,260
noticing the sounds

27
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,019
the temperature

28
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:14,060
and then noticing the bodily experience of this particular configuration

29
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:31,080
what is it like at this moment to be here

30
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,159
and now

31
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:10,680
it's made me feeling the sensations and the feet and legs where you're connected touching feeling

32
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,620
the pressure of whatever it is that you're sitting on

33
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:22,740
and feeling this support that it provides

34
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,819
the grounding

35
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,660
feeling the sensations on the buttocks as there's this pressure

36
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:45,139
and support we're grounded connected we're here

37
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:04,080
if you're leaning against a chair or couch or

38
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,560
whatever it might be feeling the pressure against the back

39
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:16,440
and if you're sitting upright feeling the uprightness feeling that support of

40
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:22,919
the spine as it allows the

41
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:27,380
shoulders and arms just hang

42
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:41,460
I often at the beginning will just tuck ever so slightly the chin and

43
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:50,160
maybe push the chin back as a way to have that Be steady and open

44
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:58,800
up this tiny little space in the back of the neck this is a very subtle slight movement

45
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,220
might not even be noticeable if somebody were watching you

46
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:14,960
and in the shoulders be far away from the ears

47
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,699
tuning into the Sensations around the face

48
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:34,220
sometimes there can be some tightness there

49
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:41,720
some tension can we allow it to relax

50
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:19,020
and then allowing the attention to rest on the sensations of

51
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,440
breathing

52
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:08,520
noticing that that body knows how to breathe it's just this natural movement

53
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,198
associated with breathing

54
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,399
noticing the experience of inhales

55
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:15,420
and exhales

56
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:24,540
how are they different can you feel into that answer

57
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:32,339
rather than thinking or figuring it out just notice the feelings of inhales and

58
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,060
exhales

59
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:47,000
the sensations the experience

60
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:44,160
and as the mind wanders it doesn't have to be a problem

61
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:52,740
it's just the next thing that's happening let me very simply gently

62
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:58,040
begin again with the sensations of breathing

63
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:38,240
what would it be like to practice with a sense of openness

64
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:44,660
open to what the experience might be

65
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:51,060
rather than having any particular expectations

66
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:58,399
open curious what is this like

67
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:25,620
foreign

68
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:48,660
very short there's

69
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:54,200
absolutely nothing you need to do with this poem

70
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,820
you don't have to figure it out

71
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:05,780
just allow it to land into your experience

72
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:22,039
the poem goes like this

73
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:35,780
another day walking in circles with an empty bowl

74
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:47,000
leaning on my staff in the middle of the road my whole body shaking with hunger

75
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:53,059
what little strength I had left left me

76
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:02,779
as I was falling to the ground I saw

77
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:09,240
I was the Spoonful of rice and this whole world

78
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:16,760
the bowl you can't miss even if you try

79
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,360
I'll repeat it

80
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:48,860
another day walking in circles with an empty bowl

81
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,900
leaning on my staff in the middle of the road

82
00:19:54,900 --> 00:20:00,059
my whole body shaking with hunger

83
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:05,720
what little strength I had left left me

84
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:12,600
as I was falling to the ground I saw

85
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:18,299
I was the Spoonful of rice and this whole world

86
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:23,340
the bowl you can't miss

87
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,600
even if you try

88
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,980
foreign

89
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,919
foreign

90
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:37,609
[Music]

91
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:24,720
[Music] welcome to uh this morning's

92
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,039
short little talk

93
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:37,100
so again I'm continuing with this theme of poetry I've practiced and this poem

94
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:43,559
includes a surprise I can maybe I'll even just say the

95
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:51,360
biggest shifts in practice are a surprise it's not like there's a certain like we

96
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:57,960
can see a big shift uh coming and then we just inch up upon it and then we know

97
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:04,320
like okay the next moment something big is going to happen or a shift is going to happen it doesn't happen that way

98
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:10,559
and all of us know this right with those of us who have a meditation practice it's often when there's

99
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:17,520
um like maybe drop into a little deeper level or gaining an Insight there's

100
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:24,539
always an element of surprise to that that's just the way the practice is it's

101
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:30,840
not like we could exactly see like oh okay as soon as I meditate for 12 and a half minutes longer something is going

102
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:37,380
to happen but there's a way in which we're always like stealing ourselves or embracing

103
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:43,640
ourselves against surprises so one way that sometimes I think about

104
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:49,500
practice is that this idea of um going up a

105
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:55,740
children's slide you know a little playgrounds they have these slides and that it takes some effort they have to

106
00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:01,620
like walk up to the top of the slide and that's some effort but then you get to

107
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:07,260
the top and you go went off you go like down the slide

108
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:14,220
and so it's not like there's always a complete letting go and it's not like there's always just effort

109
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:22,140
and the difference uh between this uh metaphor this analogy that I'm making up an actual practice is of course that we

110
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:27,299
don't really know when we're at the top of the slide and the sliding down is

111
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:32,700
about to happen so I'll read this poem the same poem

112
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:38,700
that I dropped into the guided meditation and uh maybe I'll unpack it a

113
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:45,600
little bit and we'll see how this is so the poem goes like this

114
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:51,659
another day walking in circles with an empty bowl

115
00:32:51,659 --> 00:33:01,500
meaning on my staff in the middle of the road my whole body shaking with hunger

116
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:07,039
what little strength I had left left me

117
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:12,360
as I was falling to the ground I saw

118
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:18,899
I was the Spoonful of rice and this whole world the bowl

119
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:24,018
you can't miss even if you try

120
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:30,419
so there's lots of different ways we might interpret this poem and I'm offering you some thoughts right this is

121
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:38,460
just one person's ideas I certainly don't want to sit here and say this is the authoritative way I'm just offering

122
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:44,519
some food for thought some things to consider but maybe you have your own

123
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:49,559
interpretation maybe there's a way in which your life experience your practice

124
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:54,779
would point to a different interpretation and for me this is part of what I love

125
00:33:54,779 --> 00:34:00,480
about poetry is that there doesn't have to be one way

126
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,760
we're not necessarily sure exactly what the poet is pointing to and maybe it

127
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:11,280
lands differently for all of us and so for me poetry is like an invitation for

128
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:19,440
us to explore for ourselves okay so this poem The Poet writes

129
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:25,820
another day walking in circles with an empty bowl

130
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:32,398
so as I pointed out a few days ago in this poem this idea of like walking in circles is this idea of like I'm not

131
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:39,480
getting anywhere I just there's maybe some movement happening but there's no sense of

132
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:44,300
going anywhere so this feeling of stuckness

133
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:51,480
we might even imagine that this uh the person in the poem is on an Ohm's

134
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:57,720
round right they uh might be a nun in our monastic who is you know that this is

135
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:03,060
what they would do they'd have like with their own spools and girlfriend Ohm's rounds to see if somebody would put

136
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:10,500
something a meal for them to eat in their own spool so I like that this idea another day so

137
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:15,720
this isn't the first time it has happened so even though it's happened before the

138
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:21,119
first time it happened she didn't completely give up like okay I'm still gonna do this it's

139
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:28,740
kind of like still persevering even though there's this feeling of stuckness or not getting what she wanted

140
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:34,800
so this empty bowl I would say is like pointing to this sense of lack

141
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:41,599
this sense of insufficiency this sense of needing more

142
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:49,980
and maybe for those of us who don't go into arms rounds we might uh I have it think it's

143
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:55,619
pointing to the sense of seeking yeah I I gotta find something

144
00:35:55,619 --> 00:36:01,859
it's something's not quite right I need more I need something in order to feel

145
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:07,440
full in order to feel complete and I think for many of us we come to a

146
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:13,560
spiritual practice because there is this sense of lack and there's then spiritual practice

147
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:20,000
becomes this really strong sense of seeking seeking seeking

148
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:29,099
so the next lines leaning on my staff in the middle of the road my whole body

149
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:35,280
shaking with hunger kind of like this idea of like leaning

150
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:41,220
on a stuff using a cane recognizing that we need support but

151
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:49,140
that not letting that stop us so maybe we can't walk as easily as we once could

152
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:54,720
but that doesn't mean that we completely stopped walking person in this poem is just using the

153
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:01,560
support that's needed it you know sounds like a very skillful wise thing to do

154
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:08,760
and then the problem is saying in the middle of the road so I haven't arrived at her destination but not quite where

155
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:14,339
she started and maybe not quite where she's going so maybe she's in the Miss

156
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:19,920
mix in the midst of crossing over the flood some of you know this expression

157
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:27,060
that's common in Buddhist teachings of like how to cross over the flood like how to get to the other Shore

158
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:32,880
so the poet here rather than using this analogy of crossing the river maybe he's

159
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,579
just crossing a road and she is in the midst of Crossing not quite there yet

160
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:44,099
but maybe it didn't even recognize not quite there yet

161
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:51,839
shaking with hunger yeah right feeling this sense of lack

162
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:57,000
thoroughly it's uncomfortable

163
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:04,619
we do not want to feel this nobody wants to feel this but maybe there's a way in which where

164
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:11,060
there's no longer possible to stop feeling it it becomes like the most

165
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:19,260
dominant experience this real sense of I want something different

166
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:25,280
and maybe there's a sense of possibility that there can be something different

167
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:32,520
and and a poem that I wrote another day and that earlier day in this series there's a sense of trembling like

168
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:37,800
feeling it all through the body and it's a physical visceral experience

169
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:43,380
so it's not so much thoughts and so here that same idea of getting expressed

170
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:50,160
through shaking with Hunger here's like you know really feeling thoroughly that there's

171
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:56,220
something here that's not quite right and that and this wish for it to be

172
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:02,099
right and then a surprise happens

173
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:10,020
kind of just letting go when letting us feel exactly what we don't want to feel none of us want to feel this

174
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:15,060
shaking with Hunger or this trembling or this sense of lack and maybe there's a

175
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:20,520
way that we've been bracing ourselves maybe we've been using this cane this

176
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:26,700
stuff as a way to support ourselves and bolster ourselves to make sure we never

177
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:32,220
feel it but then whatever strength she had left

178
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:38,160
left her so no longer being supported by what

179
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:44,880
once was supporting and it's true that some of us come to this spiritual practice because what was

180
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:51,119
supporting us is no longer available I have a terrible diagnosis or a loved one

181
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:57,300
dies or this like an unexpected change in our life circumstances ending of

182
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:03,320
relationships children leaving for college whatever it might be

183
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:11,240
is what we were using to support us and maybe Define us is no longer there

184
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:23,000
and then the next line in this poem as I was falling to the ground I saw

185
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:30,660
this radical letting go not the usual way not walking not

186
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:38,160
upright not sitting falling to the ground so this literal different perspective is

187
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:44,579
what's being the poet is talking about here literally ladies were falling we see things differently

188
00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:51,359
and it it's certainly disorienting and frightening this is exactly what we don't want and

189
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:58,980
it's a surprise we don't see it coming but this seeing

190
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:05,660
that happens with this big different perspective with this big shift

191
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:11,160
and it's often people report a big shift in their

192
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:17,520
practice these big shifts that happen with practice some people will say this

193
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:24,180
is like life-changing is when there's a shift in perspective

194
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:30,900
so for some people it's literally like going from sitting meditation to a walking meditation I know I've had some

195
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:37,440
big shifts when just something is simple like that or maybe this shift in like just

196
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:44,700
drinking a cup of tea this this moment of something different

197
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:51,540
so it doesn't have to be as radical as falling to the ground but sometimes it feels like that like like what we're

198
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:57,078
used to just the rug gets pulled out from underneath us

199
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:04,099
and it's only under those circumstances where we can see this different perspective

200
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:12,319
so this person says I was the Spoonful of rice

201
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:18,440
she was what she was looking for

202
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:24,000
she had been outside of herself looking for something looking in this case right

203
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,099
maybe on Ohm's round literally but figuratively how often are

204
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:36,619
we looking outside for the world to give us to satisfy this sense of lack

205
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:43,020
she discovers oh I was the Spoonful of rice

206
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:51,660
she was looking for her she was what she was looking for and it's the very Act of seeking that

207
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:56,880
prevents us from seeing because there's so this seeking has this

208
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,339
momentum to it that doesn't allow us to see

209
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:11,780
and she also sees this whole world the ball the whole world is like supporting

210
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:17,220
there's a way in which being held by this bull

211
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:23,579
sometimes we feel like the world is doing anything but supporting us but what would it be like if we considered

212
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:31,619
that actually that everything that's happening in our life is to help us become free

213
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:38,579
is to help us find or so that we no longer have to seek

214
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:44,880
and maybe we have to stop seeking in order to feel this support

215
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:53,480
because inherent in seeking is that we have this insufficiency that we can't see or that we don't have what we want

216
00:43:55,020 --> 00:44:00,020
and then the poem ends you can't miss

217
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:10,700
this encouragement what would it be like to not be seeking

218
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:18,380
what would you do if you knew you would succeed

219
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:26,119
what would you try if you knew you couldn't miss

220
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:33,920
so one more time I'll read this poem

221
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:43,520
another day walking in circles with an empty bowl

222
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:49,859
leaning on my staff in the middle of the road my whole body is shaking with

223
00:44:49,859 --> 00:44:57,740
hunger what little strength I had left left me

224
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:05,880
as I was falling to the ground I saw I was the Spoonful of rice

225
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:12,359
and this whole world a bowl you can't miss

226
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:18,720
even if you try to this poem

227
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:26,520
is by Matty winegast the same poet from the first two days of this week

228
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:32,880
again it's Matty winegast and he's writing in this book the first free

229
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,920
women so I wish you all the wonderful day

230
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,700
thank you
