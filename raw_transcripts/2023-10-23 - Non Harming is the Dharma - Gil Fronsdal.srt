28
00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:00,440
good morning and again welcome come to IMC good morning

29
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:14,680
Gil so I have an announcement to make the um some years ago uh there was

30
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:21,760
a group of people at IMC who formed a subgroup called U the Earth Care Group

31
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:28,920
is it louder not is that good should be louder it feels a little louder and here already oh it's too loud

32
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:35,838
here yeah so is this okay for still it feels a little loud there's a ringing going

33
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:43,440
on so let's see I was going to try to turn up the volume over there do we still hear the

34
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:50,160
ringing so a little bit lower still so how's that now is that good

35
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:57,319
now okay so there is a hearing system devices if this is uh not loud enough

36
00:43:57,319 --> 00:44:05,640
okay good now great so the earthcare group um started

37
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:11,559
to kind of have a group people focused on how in our Buddhist practice we could

38
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:17,920
care for the Earth for the environment for this world of climate change and

39
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:24,599
climate crisis and uh over the years that's grown and I just learned recently that uh they're they're doing some

40
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:31,760
really wonderful things sometimes which is um kind of a speaker series they have a monthly meeting and

41
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:37,680
sometimes those monthly meetings now on Zoom they invite some pretty interesting people who are doing this kind of Earth

42
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:44,400
care kind of work and on the end of the month last Saturday the October 28th

43
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:52,119
they're going to have there's these children in Montana I think it is they're called children um who have are

44
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:59,160
suing the state for uh you know for climate reasons and U it's kind of made national

45
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:05,760
news well they're going to come to the earthcare group to to talk about what they're doing so that was pretty cool I

46
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:11,440
thought so I thought maybe some of you'd like to know and so the information is on the imc's calendar under the Earth

47
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:16,720
Care on that Saturday and probably a zoom link there and so and they're

52
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:49,280
picture so um

53
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:57,440
okay so I'm going to tell you a tale about a monk and

54
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:04,520
um and I want to dedicate the tale to a wonderful monk that I met many years ago

55
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:10,559
named Yanda and uh he was the the the monk

56
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:16,599
responsible for the Burmese temple in back then back in Daily City eventually

57
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:25,520
he moved down and built the temple that's now in um just south of Half Moon Bay and back then um uh the so the soc

58
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:31,720
called Temple was just a small house in Daily City kind a regular looking house in Daily City

59
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:37,480
and and um and when I was going to um go

60
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:45,280
to practice in Burma I heard about this Monk and so I went to to um I called him

61
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:50,680
up and said can I come visit you and he said sure So I think I took some bus and

62
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:58,440
walked some way into the neighborhood into the neighborhood and I knocked on the door the and he he answered the door

63
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:04,839
and the remarkable thing about how he received me I immediately felt like I'd

64
00:47:04,839 --> 00:47:10,359
been his friend for decades like we were like he was like we were like old friend

65
00:47:10,359 --> 00:47:17,960
old friends was the best way I could describe how he received me he never met me and he brought me in and we sat and

66
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:23,839
talked and it was the the kindness and warmth and friendship and friendliness

67
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:31,160
that he offered was kind of standing given that We Were Strangers so the tale is dedicated to

68
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:38,720
yil andand and hopefully he will proof so there was this monk Buddhist

69
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:44,559
monk who was traveling around and he came to a town where um there had never

70
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:51,440
been any Buddhists there before people kind of hardly knew what Buddhism Buddhism was and he stayed there for

71
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:57,280
some for some while some days and and the people in the town kind of liked him

72
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:03,160
and he seemed to be remarkably calm and peaceful and U people felt really safe

73
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:09,160
with him and so actually some people started telling them telling him their life story what was going on with them

74
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:14,480
their challenges and it was just so nice and he didn't seem to have a lot to tell

75
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:19,559
them but they left those encounters with him kind of changed just because he was

76
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:25,119
so so friendly and kind and receptive to

77
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:30,559
what they had to to say so that was nice and uh so then a

78
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:37,160
local professor of religion heard about the Monk and I was interested in Buddhism what is this Buddhism never met

79
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:45,240
the Buddhist before and so there was a chance maybe to learn something about Buddhism so she came to visit him and

80
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:50,640
um and uh you know she wanted to find out what Buddhism is so she asked maybe

81
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:58,480
for her what seemed like the obvious questions she asked him what do you

82
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:09,599
believe and he answered long ago I believed but now I

83
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:16,599
act she was a little confused by this answer doesn't all religions have

84
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:22,559
beliefs and couldn't he just have told her so she asked again a different way

85
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:30,359
what teachings do you rely on long ago I relied on

86
00:49:30,359 --> 00:49:35,760
teachings now I rely on what I

87
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:44,160
know what but of course he was a Buddhist monk right so she let's try

88
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:50,599
again aren't you devoted to the Buddha because the follower of the Buddha right

89
00:49:50,599 --> 00:49:57,480
and aren't you devoted to the Buddha long ago

90
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:05,040
I was devoted to the Buddha but now I am devoted to

91
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:12,160
nonharming but what do you have faith in she said

92
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:18,319
us trying again all the ways in which he understood what religion is what do you have faith

93
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:29,240
in I don't have faith I have confidence in nonharming

94
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:35,318
action but but what is your ultimate

95
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:44,640
truth the end of doing harm ended doing any harm to myself or

96
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:49,720
to others but but

97
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:56,160
but this is nothing like religion in her mind but then you're are left with no

98
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:03,280
desire for Good Life Hereafter many religions that's an important part of their religion but

99
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:10,480
then are you left with no desire for a good life Hereafter I have no

100
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:17,359
desire for a life Hereafter I desire a good life now the

101
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:23,760
rest will take care of itself but but

102
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:31,359
but what is the good life now a life lived without any deliberate

103
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:37,119
Act of body speech or mind that harmed self or

104
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:43,119
others but then she had heard you know in Buddhism you're not supposed to have any desires so she thought she would ask

105
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:48,559
you know finally ask kind of a Buddhist question she did she was so confused by this

106
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:57,480
time do you have no desires no I I

107
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:02,520
desire a world committed to

108
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:10,000
non-harming and he answered her questions so kindly and calmly

109
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,319
and without any sense that she was wrong or any hostility

110
00:52:15,319 --> 00:52:20,960
or she didn't she was left confused didn't fit any of her ideas of

111
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:27,838
what religion is but she left transformed in some way way

112
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:35,000
changed so I offer that tale as a way of

113
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:40,920
suggesting that Buddhism has a radically different orientation than what most people think

114
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:48,040
about as religion and that this idea of non-harming lays at the center of what

115
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:55,040
Buddhism is it maybe as in the ultimate goal to non harm and some people feel

116
00:52:55,040 --> 00:53:01,359
feel feel that's not good enough because religions have ultimate truths ultimate purposes ultimate goals ultimate

117
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:07,920
experiences of Enlightenment wouldn't that be nice to be enlightened what is

118
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:14,480
Enlightenment so transformed so fully transformed that a person will have no

119
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:21,559
deliberate attempts to harm anyone in the world including themselves that's what enlightenment is

120
00:53:21,559 --> 00:53:29,200
but we don't usually say that because I don't think you get so much people don't get so excited by

121
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:38,000
non-harming you know even if you said you know the ultimate goal is to realize the truth oh that gets that seems pretty

122
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,599
good you know or the ultimate ultimate Enlightenment is to

123
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:50,520
you know realize the highest possible human realization of of

124
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:58,079
Liberation you know then I get liberated that's really great isn't it don't you want to be liberated so that's exciting

125
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:03,280
but to realize nonharming that is a

126
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:08,680
transformation it is a Liberation it's a Liberation for doing anything at all

127
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:13,880
that causes harm but but but that's not about

128
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:19,760
me isn't Enlightenment about something for me well you you you stop causing

129
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:28,000
harm to yourself isn't that pretty good you know I don't harm myself that

130
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,119
much I just

131
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:44,040
suffer so then the monk would say well in that case you should look more deeply see

132
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:50,359
what you're doing because the core teachings of Buddhism it's often called the four

133
00:54:50,359 --> 00:54:55,720
noble truths uh it doesn't have the word harm in it it has the word du which is

134
00:54:55,720 --> 00:55:00,760
usually translated to English as suffering it literally means

135
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:07,599
pain but um the causes of that suffering the causes of that pain our activities

136
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:13,480
that what we're focusing on is not what the world does to us but what we do to

137
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:18,920
ourselves so if the world does something unfortunate to us that's unfortunate and

138
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:24,359
that we have to do our best to figure out what to do but if because of that we

139
00:55:24,359 --> 00:55:29,799
now want to hate and because that we want to now harm others because of

140
00:55:29,799 --> 00:55:36,680
that in that momentum we're harming ourselves hate always harms the

141
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:41,880
hater violence intentional violence always harms the one who is violent it

142
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:48,319
can't not because but they're not often we're not paying attention that way so that's why study yourself see what's

143
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:55,000
going on deeply and if you go really deep you also see that the suffering that we can

144
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:01,119
can have some role in changing and transforming is the ones that arise from our own

145
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:06,960
attachments to cling is to harm ourselves and it's not necessarily an

146
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:12,720
ethical thing like so often we think of harming others as being unethical but to

147
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:21,079
um but uh you know being attached is not you know it's not an ethical issue but it is a issue of whether you are happy

148
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:27,000
or whether you suffer and there's a way in which attachment is the uh is the

149
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,839
root way in which we harm ourselves and chances are it's the root for why we harm

150
00:56:32,839 --> 00:56:39,359
others and so uh so but at the heart what i is the Dharma is this non-harming

151
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:44,720
Instinct this movement towards this but is it

152
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:51,880
ultimate shouldn't religion be about ultimate things that uh you know that you can't

153
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:58,599
really know for yourself but you take it on faith because because it comes from your Scriptures it comes from the Buddha

154
00:56:58,599 --> 00:57:05,440
it comes from your teachers you now I know what's ultimate people involved in religion like ultimate

155
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:10,640
things and uh and partly it's because people religious people tend to put a

156
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:16,160
lot of themselves into the religious life there's a kind of a commitment to

157
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:22,880
something that's maybe bigger than themselves or something other and for that level of a commitment people really

158
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:28,640
want to know that it's this is really the best this is really good this is

159
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:35,520
Ultimate in the earliest teachings of the Buddha uh he he he he explicitly was

160
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:41,599
not interested in having ultimate truths so and now this professor is even

161
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:48,880
more confused um that that the pursuit of ultimate truth was a

162
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:56,520
detour what the task was he said was to let go of clinging let go of craving let

163
00:57:56,520 --> 00:58:01,559
go of attachments and uh to have ultimate

164
00:58:01,559 --> 00:58:09,960
truths for some people it's just another attachment it's another detour it's a distraction from doing this deep work

165
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:16,280
but that's not you know just letting go of my attachments I mean that's kind of like isn't that kind of like a small

166
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:21,680
thing isn't that like that's not so how can that be so great and wonderful and

167
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:28,520
ultimate and I don't get real credit among my religious friends when I tell them what

168
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:35,240
well our ultimate is just letting go of clinging that doesn't seem very

169
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:41,680
good so so I think the best thing to do is to grant them that that is not that

170
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:48,680
good it's not that ultimate and uh and

171
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:56,720
however it's that it might not be ultimate might be the greatest thing you can do with your life

172
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:05,280
however it's the fundamental thing we should do in our life it's the beginning

173
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:12,079
of what we should do in our life we should um uh at least live a life of

174
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:17,440
non-harming at least find a way not to cause harm to oursel and

175
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:23,640
others at least do that important work our world will be transformed if we did

176
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:29,960
that we might will be transformed for you do that and once we learn once we

177
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:37,000
discover how to live without causing harm to self and other once we learn to live without

178
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:43,280
clinging and craving once we have that level of

179
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:49,680
Liberation well then if you're still interested in Ultimate truths help

180
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:55,200
yourself please that's good and maybe you'll have some Wonder wonderful ones

181
00:59:55,200 --> 01:00:01,480
that are inspiring and wonderful and poetic and and uh fun to read about and

182
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:06,720
listen to and and be amazed by yes but

183
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:13,839
let's do this first thing and uh and what not a few Buddhists have discovered that doing the

184
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:19,480
Deep work the inner work uh of becoming free in this

185
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:26,160
way is pretty ultimate pretty fantastic the love level of Peace the level of

186
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:32,799
well-being the well level of of safety that that provides is

187
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:38,520
astounding and uh and on the way to there there starts to be becoming an

188
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:46,520
appreciation of how difficult and deep this at work is it's a task of a lifetime to really

189
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:54,000
settle and find and come to what I would like to suggest that what I'd like to believe is a you know a really good

190
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:00,079
fundamental place for all of us to be all of us to begin begin everything

191
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:07,119
from the Buddha said that if you cling and you crave you can't really

192
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:13,400
see what's really true and so if you're in a religion and

193
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:19,079
you're craving and clinging as part of it it might obscure your ability to really understand even what your

194
01:01:19,079 --> 01:01:26,920
religion is talking about and um and some people will say that once we once and there's not

195
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:33,440
Buddhism not the only religion that talks about non- clinging nonattachment and um and a lot of the

196
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:39,400
mystics and Rel and religions of all kinds um the beautiful teachings by a

197
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:45,599
Catholic Mystic named Mr Master E eart is that his name who uh talked

198
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:53,440
explicitly about the value of non-attachment non- clinging in ways that completely would be home in

199
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:59,880
Buddhism and um and uh it's not a surprise because uh

200
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:07,200
the way we can see clearly see something beautiful here in this world is so

201
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:13,920
fantastic when we do this inner work in the teaching in in Buddhism in

202
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:19,480
Mahayana Buddhism in Zen Buddhism is it goes something like this uh when your

203
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:25,400
mind is pure the world is pure when the mind is pure you see the world in a

204
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:30,599
certain kind of Purity and um so this work on your your

205
01:02:30,599 --> 01:02:36,039
own heart your own mind understanding it seeing how it is doing that work of

206
01:02:36,039 --> 01:02:41,440
really recognizing where the harming is how we harm

207
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:47,760
ourselves and um and finding a way not to do it and for many of us part of that

208
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:54,680
work is to deal with all the lawyers in the mind there are some really clever

209
01:02:54,680 --> 01:03:00,039
lawyers in there who will make a really good case

210
01:03:00,039 --> 01:03:06,160
that it's okay to harm sometimes it's to harm other people

211
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:12,240
they deserve it how else am I going to take care of myself what other choice do we

212
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:17,319
have and and uh sometimes the lawyers represent

213
01:03:17,319 --> 01:03:22,760
you of course I have to harm myself I'm such a terrible person you know I

214
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:29,680
deserve it so part of the task in this practice is

215
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:34,920
to question the lawyers but when the lawyers

216
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:41,440
come remember don't harm them receive them as old

217
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:47,400
friends receive them calmly kindly listen to

218
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:53,279
them but don't believe them believe in

219
01:03:53,279 --> 01:04:00,480
non-harming and then finally what I'd like to offer around this thing

220
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:06,880
believing uh many of us believe things that maybe we shouldn't be

221
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:13,599
believing um recently I talked to someone who said

222
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:18,760
that I don't I don't believe I'm capable of doing something that needs to be done

223
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:25,599
I don't think I'm capable that's my belief and um and instead of uh when

224
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:30,960
when you have when that when you that occurs to you change that your language

225
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:36,279
don't say don't say this is what I

226
01:04:36,279 --> 01:04:41,200
believe say this is what I'm

227
01:04:42,359 --> 01:04:48,680
believing and if you want to get extra credit you

228
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:57,000
say for right now this is what I'm believing the difference is huge if you

229
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:02,720
say I believe it's like now it's a solid truthful statement like this is how it

230
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:09,359
is and like who's going to find a way out of that but if it's just an act of

231
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:15,799
believing right now this is what I'm believing then it's not so solid it's

232
01:05:15,799 --> 01:05:22,000
like well it's just right now it's just NE and it's an activity of the

233
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:29,000
mind and the focus on on Buddhism is not so much on belief or at all on belief

234
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:36,119
but rather on the activity the mind is doing and turns out that

235
01:05:36,119 --> 01:05:41,720
believing when there's a belief there's an activity of the Mind

236
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:47,480
happening and that is called believing and now we're all that and

237
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:52,760
that puts the mirror back on the mindfulness back on what's the

238
01:05:52,760 --> 01:06:00,279
nature what's the the quality the characteristic of that act the act of

239
01:06:00,279 --> 01:06:07,720
believing and um so um what do you

240
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:15,440
believe long ago I believed now I act we're always acting there's always

241
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:23,000
action and so um what's the so then um

242
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:28,640
um what teachings do you rely on now long

243
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:34,119
ago I relied on teachings now I rely on what I

244
01:06:34,119 --> 01:06:39,839
know so and what what can you know maybe you don't know ultimate

245
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:46,160
truths but if you pay attention you can know the actions that you're involved in

246
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:51,720
and if the action has to do with thinking then you know oh I'm thinking something I'm thinking about I'm

247
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:56,760
thinking about an ultimate truth I'm thinking that I believe in this this

248
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:02,160
that this is ultimately true the action of thinking is happening

249
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:07,640
and we often Overlook the action because we get caught up in what we're thinking

250
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:12,839
about we Overlook the fact that I'm believing because we're caught in the

251
01:07:12,839 --> 01:07:19,000
belief this is what's true oh now I'm believing this now I'm

252
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:25,680
reacting to this now I'm feeling this now I'm wanting this happen there's

253
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:33,200
always an action so what teachings do you rely on I rely on what I know and what you can

254
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:38,359
know is you can know the activities we're involved in that is a core Central

255
01:07:38,359 --> 01:07:46,799
activity that we mindfulness brings attention to aren't you devoted to the Buddha long

256
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:51,839
ago I was devoted to the Buddha now I am devoted to

257
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:58,000
non-harming once you start tracking the activities of the mind and speech and

258
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:03,799
body then you can start noticing oh this hurts there's an ouch in this there's

259
01:08:03,799 --> 01:08:10,079
harm in this there's harm for me and maybe there's harm for others and then we can

260
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:15,480
question is this how I want to live my life is this the activity that I want to

261
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:22,838
be part of well then the lawyer comes and says it has to be this way there can't be any

262
01:08:22,839 --> 01:08:30,359
other way oh that's a clever

263
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:37,359
lawyer but the lawyer is not the judge who has to decide don't let the

264
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:42,838
lawyers decide but what do you have faith in I

265
01:08:42,839 --> 01:08:48,758
don't have faith I have confidence in non-harming

266
01:08:48,759 --> 01:08:54,480
action what is your ultimate truth the end of doing anything any harm

267
01:08:54,480 --> 01:09:03,199
to myself or others what is the good life now a life

268
01:09:03,199 --> 01:09:09,120
lived without deliberate act any deliberate Act of body speech and mind

269
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:14,278
that harm self or others do you have no

270
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:20,040
desires no I do have desires I desire a world

271
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:26,600
committed to non-harming it's fine to have desires in

272
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:32,040
Buddhism but the desires have to be when then you're

273
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:39,238
Desiring so as you're Desiring desire in a way that doesn't cause harm find a way

274
01:09:39,239 --> 01:09:46,560
to have desires that actually can be nourishing and supportive and helpful for you some desires are actually

275
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:55,159
helpful healing beneficial inspiring and any desire that has to do

276
01:09:55,159 --> 01:10:02,679
with living a life of not causing harm living a life that does the opposite that lives with love and care and

277
01:10:02,679 --> 01:10:10,320
respect for self and others those desires have desire them in ways that

278
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:18,679
are inspiring that that don't cause more harm someone can have the desire to be

279
01:10:18,679 --> 01:10:26,159
non-harming God I I get I have to get on with it here I'm such a lousy person I need to have to desire

280
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:31,560
non-harming you know and not to be the best non-harming person on my

281
01:10:31,719 --> 01:10:39,199
block the very Act of wanting to non-harm is now harming you so we're always looking what in what

282
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:44,719
way am I ining what way what way what way am I

283
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:51,320
acting here what way am I thinking here what way am I intending here is the very

284
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:56,920
way in which I'm intending wanting thinking thinking does that

285
01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:03,760
Inspire this inner beauty of non-harming we're always tracking this

286
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:11,520
looking at it and now over time it has phenomenal results over time it creates

287
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:18,920
so much inner well-being and peace and space and goodness that um maybe you'll be the

288
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:24,120
person the Buddhist so-called Buddhist that goes into a where there's

289
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:31,320
never been any Buddhists and the religious Professor will come to you what do you believe

290
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:37,239
in I believe it's po important

291
01:11:37,239 --> 01:11:41,599
to notice how I'm

292
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:48,120
believing now you understand why that's an important answer I believe it's

293
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:55,159
important to study how I'm believing so that I believe in a way

294
01:11:55,159 --> 01:12:00,880
that doesn't cause any harm does the opposite it's it's nourishing it's supporting

295
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:07,679
it's it's liberating so those are my thoughts for

296
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:13,400
today so um now what do the lawyer

297
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:20,960
say or what questions you have or comments might you have yes

298
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,480
please

299
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:38,560
this topic was spoton for something I'm struggling with right now I realized that I am harming myself

300
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:45,719
through perpetuating suffering over a loss I've experienced so you harm yourself but by perpetuating the

301
01:12:45,719 --> 01:12:55,040
suffering yes and so um I realize it's coming from clinging a

302
01:12:55,040 --> 01:13:01,199
wonderful friendship I had and it's not wonderful at all anymore and I keep clinging to what it

303
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:08,440
was so the Buddha was so wonderful at giving us lists but I don't find a list

304
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:13,760
for how to let go I think that's just the hardest thing for me oh there's a

305
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:18,280
there's a really there a really good list which

306
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:26,560
one it's a list that has only one item in it yeah I need steps I need 12 steps to

307
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:33,560
learn to let go it's repeatedly my biggest okay well then problem well then I'll give you four steps

308
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:39,920
okay be mindful of your body be mindful of your feelings be mindful of your mind

309
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:45,600
States and be mindful of uh the activities of your mind the four

310
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:51,480
foundations of mindfulness so when you when you have the particular suffering that you have um go through the

311
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:57,320
checklist of those four and and if you haven't if you're not really recently familiar with the four foundations of

312
01:13:57,320 --> 01:14:03,360
mindfulness really kind of study them a little bit and uh and then um you know

313
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:09,600
that's a checklist it just it takes a lot of familiarity a lot of mindfulness a lot of looking at it and seeing what's

314
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:15,199
going on here um not analytically but uh what What's the ining what's the

315
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:21,000
activities that are happening now in the body in the the mind in the heart and you have to spend a lot of time just

316
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:27,800
being mindful of it and um um and um and so also remember that mindfulness is

317
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:33,320
also not quite a good word we're we're

318
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:40,080
mindfulness we're doing mindfulness we're practicing the activity of mindfulness and then the question is how

319
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:48,360
are you being mindful are you doing it holding on for dear life are are you holding on are you doing it with with uh

320
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:56,920
greed with aversion to what's happening and uh uh do the mindfulness

321
01:14:56,920 --> 01:15:02,639
sing in a way that feels good I must be missing something because

322
01:15:02,639 --> 01:15:10,239
I'm actually doing a practice so similar I mean it's like almost dad on my coach was taking me through I catch myself I

323
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:17,280
wake up almost every morning with these thoughts so I catch myself oh I wish I had said that or oh

324
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:23,520
it hurt so much when she said this or oh my gosh that was so wonderful when we were friends like that okay it's POS

325
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:29,120
possible but then I stop I look I say oh I'm saying this and then I rub my

326
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:35,040
fingers together I check in with my body my breathing every damn morning it comes

327
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:42,120
back so I don't know you that well in this regard right but I suspect that you're doing all this from the neck

328
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:47,480
up and that uh do it once your belly is really

329
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:57,320
relaxed find a way good posture really find your let your belly be deeply relaxed and then do the work do the

330
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:03,760
practice I will try that from the bottom up rather than the top down yeah yeah I think you're right I'm doing it in as a

331
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:09,239
mental construct I'm going step one step two step three yeah

332
01:16:09,239 --> 01:16:18,440
yeah okay that'll be weird thank you you have go

333
01:16:19,639 --> 01:16:27,639
ahead but let's stay on topic if you have looks like you have an announcement non but it's an announcement right it

334
01:16:27,639 --> 01:16:33,120
might be how about waiting a couple of minutes because I think I think it's better to kind of stay on track a little

335
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:40,800
bit here rather than changing the topic we end with you then we can you give the mic to the

336
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:47,920
person out there in the outer Hall the outer hall and then we can do you after her

337
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:54,000
thank you you have to turn it on the green

338
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:59,360
light light goes on thank you um isn't having

339
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:06,080
expectations of others it's always um harming them and harming yourself and if

340
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:12,320
you have no expectations then you are all alone I think having expectations when

341
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:17,679
there's been I think having uh an expectation when there's been an

342
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:23,159
agreement is reasonable you know so if someone

343
01:17:23,159 --> 01:17:29,360
promises something and you agreed like together like this is what we're going to do I think that's that's that's one

344
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:34,920
of the functions of an of an agreement is now we can expect that something will happen we can trust something will

345
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:40,400
happen in a particular way and then if the agreement is broken we feel kind of

346
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:46,920
hurt but if there has been no agreement between the people then I have to we have to be very

347
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:55,120
very careful about the expectation because then we're projecting something on the situation and um that might not

348
01:17:55,120 --> 01:18:00,800
other people don't agree haven't agreed to we're bringing our values and putting it on other

349
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:06,760
people and um now there might be implicit agreements we have in our

350
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:12,600
society you know like um when the traffic light is red we don't drive

351
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:20,239
through it we have that expectation that that's how we all agree to drive but you never

352
01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:26,480
asked the other driver you promised not the drive you know we kind of have all kinds of

353
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:34,080
sometimes implicit agreements um so I think that when there's an agreement we it's reasonable

354
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:39,199
to have some expectation and then people are accountable to the agreements say I

355
01:18:39,199 --> 01:18:46,719
I expected that what happened what was going on you can you have something you can talk about but expectation for on one for one

356
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:52,199
on oneself and expectations on others uh are also source of a lot of suffering

357
01:18:52,199 --> 01:18:58,360
other people suffer suffer we suffer uh we have standards we hold people ourselves to standards we hold hold

358
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:03,679
other people to that's much higher than they can actually live by and and we can

359
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:10,280
be it can be oppressive it can be harmful to ex to have expectations of self and others which are

360
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:15,679
unreasonable and um and so this is why this this mindfulness where we're

361
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:22,280
looking at how again the not the expects expectations are important to look at

362
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:30,280
but the uh what's going on for you when you're expecting when you have an when you're doing the action of expecting

363
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:36,520
expectation um are you what do you want what are you attached to what are you hoping for what are you afraid

364
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:45,120
of this gives you enough to think about thank you what if it's a kind of complicated

365
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:52,920
situations I'm thinking of an example let's say I have a pond and I have some fish in it and then there's an invasive

366
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:58,280
species that now live in the pond that's killing my fish

367
01:19:58,280 --> 01:20:04,320
so if I don't harm that species of some sort my fish will all

368
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:09,600
die then then what should I do in that case

369
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:15,639
there's all kinds of things first of all I love it when people ask the question I

370
01:20:15,639 --> 01:20:21,480
have this problem invasive fish I don't want to kill them but what can I do that

371
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:27,639
people that ask that question I I I welcome so much this is fantastic that they're asking rather than immediately

372
01:20:27,639 --> 01:20:33,600
go get the poison to kill the fish and then the question well let's think about it maybe let's do some

373
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:38,800
research and find out what we can do and um and maybe there's something can be

374
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:43,840
done maybe there are traps you can put in that can trap the fish and take them

375
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:51,080
where they belong which is maybe expensive but maybe that's nicer than just killing them um so maybe there's

376
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:56,560
something can be done maybe uh the your fish are really small and that's a

377
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:02,480
really big fish and if you take a big net fishing net through the pond you get

378
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:08,920
all the bad fish on one side and the all the small fish stay on the other side of

379
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:14,639
the net and then you can kind of let's figure out what we can do now maybe we maybe that's a good way of living and

380
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:20,400
maybe they can just kind of you know share share the pond together that way

381
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:26,679
or maybe um you realize the reason why the big fish are eating the small ones

382
01:21:26,679 --> 01:21:33,960
is because they're hungry but they actually have in their where they came from they have a preferred

383
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:40,159
diet and so let's get let's bring in the preferred diet and they'll leave the small fish alone so I'm just making up

384
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:45,440
ideas but it's possible by thinking about it and exploring and but sometimes

385
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:53,120
it takes a while sometimes just killing them seems like it takes care of it really quickly but then because you killed them

386
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:58,840
the other your fish now think oh killing is

387
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:05,400
right and so they start killing each other for this slightest little you know they' learned that killing was possible

388
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:12,120
in this Pond and you know you don't know the repercussions that killing has so um

389
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:19,679
and then there's also the it could also be that the um the invasive species was

390
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:26,920
coming like the the the fish the person didn't read the news and didn't read

391
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:34,080
that if you bring in this particular kind of feed it has this fish eggs in it

392
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:39,840
and you have to be really careful oh but it's so much work who cares about doing that and I don't believe in it anyway

393
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:47,080
and and so then there's no preventive work done so if you have the equivalent today

394
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:52,239
of a pond with fish in it think ahead notice what's happening

395
01:22:52,239 --> 01:22:57,400
sit set up a situation so in the future there's not that

396
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:04,520
problem so so if people who want to live a nonharming life they also need to be

397
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:10,960
uh proactive they need to set the conditions in now so that uh so that in

398
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:17,679
5 10 20 years 50 years that um uh there's not any problems and to only

399
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:23,639
look at the present moment uh is very myopic when it comes to living a life of

400
01:23:23,639 --> 01:23:30,120
non-harming so does that give you some ideas yes there was not an ultimate

401
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:34,719
answer it's it's it's a

402
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:44,679
beginning maybe last one thank

403
01:23:44,679 --> 01:23:51,080
you so what I'm thinking about invasive fish and a fish pond I'm thinking about

404
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:57,040
Israel and Gaza and I'm wondering I don't know how to how to think about it and I wonder if

405
01:23:57,040 --> 01:24:03,280
you have any suggestions yes I mean the talk today was partly a response to that without

406
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:08,440
mentioning it explicitly and um and one of the reasons

407
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:13,960
not to mention explicitly is I'll tell you a story about tikn

408
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:20,120
Han uh tikn Han lived in Vietnam during the war between Northern Vietnam and

409
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:25,679
Southern Vietnam he lived right in the area where the conflict was most active

410
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:31,800
battles back and forth and fields nearby and um and he was dedicated to

411
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:39,000
doing it a different way not fighting he was dedicated to non-harming and he had a whole group of

412
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:44,920
monastics and women and men who were out there trying to support everyone both sides of the conflict and offer a

413
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:51,360
different approach to it all and because of that both neither side trusted

414
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:57,719
him the PE because he was supporting the northern Vietnamese you trying to help

415
01:24:57,719 --> 01:25:03,719
them and maybe even offer Medical Care the southern Vietnamese didn't trust him and vice

416
01:25:03,719 --> 01:25:09,960
versa and so the situation in Gaza in Israel is awful there so much

417
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:15,800
pain but and to uh and even so uh to

418
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:21,280
take the middle view the middle way that really wants the best for both

419
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:27,159
sides uh is kind of difficult to say because one way or the other people on either

420
01:25:27,159 --> 01:25:35,000
side gets upset that you don't understand how terrible it is for us and and how much we've been violated and and

421
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:42,080
so how much we've been kind of forgotten by the world or all kinds of things and so um and so I didn't want to talk about

422
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:48,800
it directly and uh and and not talking about it is also very difficult because

423
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:55,320
and then you're ignoring you know and people say you're ignoring my people I don't feel safe and but when there's

424
01:25:55,320 --> 01:26:01,600
both people who feel that way then you know it's a very difficult thing to be

425
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:09,880
in that to have that middle so the middle for me is not being aloof or indifferent but is um having a heart

426
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:16,040
that's really concerned for everyone involved and um and is dedicated to

427
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:21,199
finding best we can way of non-harming

428
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:24,199
without

429
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:33,560
um I don't know without

430
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:45,000
um I don't know without maybe giving the question earlier today without um

431
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:49,159
projecting expectations on what people

432
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:59,719
do thank you so now you can have your

433
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:08,920
announcement know to Gil thank you so very

434
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:16,560
much so in following up of what you had said um one person from the community who's

435
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:22,679
been with you I can't quite hear maybe you hold it up if you hold it up maybe I take the thing but also also when the

436
01:27:22,679 --> 01:27:29,480
mic is better held when it's held horizontally and then close to them M okay uh one person who's helped in the

437
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:35,239
formation of IMC for couple of decades has helped write this up last night a

438
01:27:35,239 --> 01:27:40,520
dear friend I can't I can't really do okay so this is uh been written up by

439
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:46,719
someone who's been involved helping with IMC for a couple of decades and it's just a piece of

440
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:53,199
information if people want to try to help in the non-harming situation

441
01:27:53,199 --> 01:27:59,360
just contacting their Congress person and saying please support an immediate
