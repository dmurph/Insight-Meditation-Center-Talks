1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,839
so i want to continue

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,840
uh my thoughts on

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,559
topic of these two weeks wholesome and

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:13,840
unwholesomeness

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,199
skillfulness and unskillfulness

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,600
and this week i wanted to to continue a

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,400
little bit more

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,439
focus on the unwholesome

9
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,800
next week more the wholesome

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,640
so begin with a story uh so when i was

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,840
27 i was ordained as

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,760
a zen monk then

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,120
and um zen priest

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,960
and um you know it was a big

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,760
turning point in my life to enter into

16
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,960
the religious life and

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,719
as a as a calling as a

18
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,239
something was going to be my my life

19
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,039
and one of the surprises to me from

20
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,199
doing the ceremony the ordination

21
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,760
ceremony

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,680
was that afterwards you know i had a

23
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,119
shaved head i

24
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,040
wore robes and i was now a

25
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,159
much more of a public figure or

26
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,320
someone who people could see that i was

27
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,880
publicly

28
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,080
demonstrating or could see

29
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,280
in my my in how i shaved my head and how

30
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:29,840
i

31
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,079
the clothes i wore that i was dedicated

32
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,079
to this religious life this

33
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,200
dharma life so

34
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,479
um i felt much more accountable to

35
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,000
people

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,520
i felt much more acutely

37
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,399
sensitive to other people's you know

38
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,159
studying me and seeing how i behave and

39
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,759
all that

40
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,000
so i i think as a consequence of this i

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,600
became much more acutely

42
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,280
aware of my own shortcomings

43
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,159
and i had lots of them so so became much

44
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,840
more acutely sensitive to them

45
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,680
but at the same time and this was the

46
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,679
remarkable thing

47
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,120
is that because i had been ordained

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,599
i felt kind of metaphorically or

49
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,440
figuratively or something

50
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,599
that i was now a child of the buddha

51
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,920
and so it was more okay to have the

52
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,840
shortcomings

53
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,879
i was accepted in a sense with them

54
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,640
and this combination i thought was

55
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,000
really precious

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,599
that i became more aware of my

57
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,080
shortcomings and it was more okay to

58
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,519
have them

59
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,480
um in a certain way it didn't mean that

60
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,319
i indulged in them and now i could

61
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,319
had a free reign to kind of act them out

62
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,239
or or just continue

63
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,040
merely going along with my shortcomings

64
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,840
um i had a practice and to look at it

65
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,879
and to work with it

66
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,879
and to find freedom from it with it

67
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,360
and and

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,239
and so i um but this combination of

69
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,000
heightened sensitivity to one's own

70
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,239
shortcomings as a good thing

71
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,080
as a helpful thing at the very same time

72
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,879
uh not to be troubled by it not feel not

73
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,640
be defined by it not

74
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,040
feel somehow belittled by it or

75
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,239
or ashamed of it or anything this is the

76
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,720
way forward in the dharma

77
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,120
and one of the we keep saying that many

78
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,319
of the pasta teachers

79
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,959
when we give talks about the hindrances

80
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,400
the hindrances are five

81
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,799
unwholesome states of mind and wholesome

82
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,360
forms of behavior and thinking

83
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,280
when we get caught in in greed

84
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,400
we get caught in ill will and

85
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,280
caught in sloth and torpor or

86
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,799
restlessness and regrets

87
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,480
and caught in doubt um

88
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,239
the apostle teachers will often say

89
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,959
don't take them personally

90
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,080
don't define yourself by them don't

91
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,640
judge yourself by their presence

92
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,840
it's completely natural for a human mind

93
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,959
to produce hindrances

94
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,360
you know we have millions of years of

95
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,120
evolution behind us

96
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,120
that has shaped us in the way we are and

97
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,239
we can't

98
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,600
undo that in some automatic way

99
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,800
you didn't choose um you know

100
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,240
how many arms and hands you were born

101
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:30,960
with

102
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,000
uh you know you're sitting there kind of

103
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,639
as an embryo forming your body parts and

104
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,280
so

105
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,280
and this this time i'm gonna i think i

106
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,680
want four arms or six arms you know and

107
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,600
i can be much more efficient and do more

108
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,639
things and

109
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,440
that would be a good idea uh we're kind

110
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:47,919
of

111
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,960
our genetics you know

112
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,080
operates in a certain way and and

113
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,000
before we're consciously aware and can

114
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,120
make choices

115
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,759
so much of who we are has been shaped

116
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:00,160
and

117
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,199
by the mon the continuum of the

118
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,479
of the evolution of genetics of

119
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,840
this kind of natural unfolding of our

120
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,120
lives that's

121
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,000
part of the natural world and with that

122
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,360
comes the tendencies

123
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,280
to behave in certain unskillful ways

124
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,639
on wholesome ways on beneficial ways

125
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,400
but uh to see this as part of nature

126
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,759
as opposed to see it as as somehow a sin

127
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,400
or you know a great moral crime that we

128
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,320
should behave this way

129
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,600
um and so to have a willingness

130
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,600
to see clearly to acknowledge

131
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,120
to recognize our shortcomings

132
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,639
if we don't if we think even the word

133
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,520
shortcomings is a little bit judgmental

134
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,360
maybe you could say your foibles

135
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,240
or maybe you just say to recognize our

136
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,520
unwholesome

137
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,319
states of mind a wholesomeness to

138
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,280
recognize or if

139
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,840
even that seems a little judgmental you

140
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,520
could use the translation of

141
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,240
kusala as unskillful well that's

142
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,759
unskillful

143
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,800
and and unskillful

144
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,639
you know can be much more simple

145
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,240
straightforward like oh that wasn't

146
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,440
useful that's not

147
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,440
beneficial that's not a good skill to do

148
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,240
and but somehow or other this

149
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,520
combination of

150
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,280
being willing to acknowledge we have

151
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,199
shortcomings

152
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,800
sometimes be amused sometimes maybe be

153
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,199
a little bit sad that they're there and

154
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:37,840
because

155
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,680
there's a way of causing harm harm to

156
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,600
self and others

157
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,199
and and but not to be

158
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,319
not to carry the weight of them and not

159
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,840
allow yourself to be defined in some

160
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,520
negative way so that they're

161
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,960
you they add more

162
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,880
suffering on top of suffering on top of

163
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,400
suffering

164
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,639
so just to see it as natural and

165
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,160
and then work with it and and be wise

166
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,520
about it and

167
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,360
be very careful not to cause harm with

168
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,639
it

169
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,440
there's a wonderful list of unwholesome

170
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,400
states

171
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,280
in the suttas and the teachings of the

172
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,400
buddha

173
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,680
and in this particular teaching seeing

174
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,520
the presence of these so really

175
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,120
acknowledging them

176
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,960
and then seeing when they're no longer

177
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,360
there when they're somehow definitively

178
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,000
clearly

179
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,199
absent shows us the movement

180
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,199
and the potential of what we're looking

181
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,880
for here in the dharma

182
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,280
we're not looking just to simply accept

183
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,039
our foibles

184
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,960
we're actually looking in the dharma to

185
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,039
to live without them to be free

186
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,319
and this is a radical teaching that

187
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,680
that some people feel is you know

188
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,080
unattainable or unrealistic

189
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,599
but it's phenomenal how much we could

190
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,400
redo the software of our minds and so

191
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:02,960
that

192
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,440
certain tendencies habits that we have

193
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,120
can fall away

194
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,440
it takes practice it takes dedication

195
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,479
it's not going to happen

196
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,440
happen from wishful thinking but to see

197
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:13,840
the

198
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,400
see the presence of these unskillful

199
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,759
states

200
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,280
and then to really experience the

201
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,680
absence of them say wow

202
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,879
this is a possibility and to be inspired

203
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,160
by that and

204
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,479
and this is what inspires me to practice

205
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,440
this possibility of freedom of fresh air

206
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,440
open space of clarity of

207
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,360
freedom this is possible and now that i

208
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,120
have a taste this is what to practice

209
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,360
with so this wonderful list

210
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,200
i think it's a wonderful list about

211
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,640
wholesome states what's

212
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,839
interesting about it is um almost all of

213
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:50,720
them

214
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,720
are social in nature meaning that their

215
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,440
motivations we have that are usually

216
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:57,920
exist

217
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,200
in relationship to other people and so

218
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,959
these are unwholesome states where we

219
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,880
can feel i think many of these as you

220
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,000
hear them

221
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,920
how they are painful for the person who

222
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,440
has them

223
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,720
and they are inflict pain or suffering

224
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,680
or problems

225
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,320
for the people who these are inflicted

226
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:16,720
on

227
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,639
these are you know applied to

228
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,640
so um uh here's a list

229
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,800
of unwholesome states of mind or

230
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,959
unwholesome motivations

231
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,240
so covetousness

232
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,600
coveting the things of other people ill

233
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,640
will

234
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,640
having ill will or hate words towards

235
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,800
others

236
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,160
anger having anger is often directed

237
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,000
towards others

238
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,959
resentment resentment is often directed

239
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,600
towards others

240
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,080
contempt towards others

241
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,000
insolence envy envy is often related to

242
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,760
others

243
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,839
everest so again it's usually

244
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,920
wanting the things of other people maybe

245
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,800
deceit usually we do that in relation to

246
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,079
social situations

247
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,399
can deceive yourself but fraud even more

248
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:18,880
so

249
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,920
in relationship to other people

250
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,000
rivalry conceit

251
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,200
conceit is often formed in rel in

252
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,560
in relationship to others we're better

253
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,880
than others we're worse than others

254
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,720
we want something from others and so

255
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,519
they conceit one status one something

256
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,680
so without other people around maybe

257
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,040
there wouldn't be much reason for

258
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,040
conceit

259
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,839
arrogance same thing arrogance is often

260
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,120
done in relationship to

261
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,720
others and vanity

262
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,240
so maybe vanity is also that way

263
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,839
all these things could be addressed to

264
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,120
oneself perhaps one could

265
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,279
maybe have ill will towards oneself

266
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,720
anger resentment

267
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,320
even contempt and um

268
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,360
could be some deceit towards oneself and

269
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,480
self-deceit to the in rivalry some

270
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,279
people have

271
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,040
inner wars between different sides of

272
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,000
who they are so they can be within us

273
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,240
but uh i want to highlight how much

274
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,040
these are

275
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,160
social emotions and uh

276
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,440
and so this idea that the unwholesome

277
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,560
uh is um is

278
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,480
uh to you know if we want to

279
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,399
contribute to a better society a better

280
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,399
world if we want to contribute to a

281
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,360
world where we don't want to harm others

282
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,279
how useful it is to settle and resolve

283
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,920
these unwholesome states on ourselves as

284
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,880
we do that

285
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,880
we don't experience the self-harm that

286
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,360
all of these create

287
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,519
and i think it's really fantastic

288
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,800
amazing

289
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,680
that it's also a natural thing that we

290
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,720
can resolve

291
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,800
settle undo this for these forces in our

292
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,760
life

293
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,040
and simultaneously it benefits ourselves

294
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,200
and i don't know exactly simultaneously

295
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,560
benefits others or

296
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,959
or benefits others maybe not in the

297
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,079
moment but it will

298
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,279
because we're not going to go around

299
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,240
with these acting on these unhealthy

300
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,120
kind of behaviors

301
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,360
so um bringing it brings motivation

302
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,399
for us hopefully to

303
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,440
look at our unwholesome states to look

304
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,839
at the unsc skillful things we have

305
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,839
greed hatred and delusion in all its

306
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,240
different forms

307
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,200
and in doing so

308
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,560
not doing it unskillfully not doing it

309
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,399
in unwholesome ways

310
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,120
to look at our unwholesome behavior and

311
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,959
thoughts and motivations

312
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,399
in ways that you know

313
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,360
does more the same has ill will in it

314
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,560
that just you know

315
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,440
bad suffering upon suffering the dharma

316
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,240
approach is to see it as natural

317
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,600
and in certain way impersonal to see it

318
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,680
as if you maybe if you'd like you're

319
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,680
you're a child of the buddha your child

320
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,160
of

321
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,600
nature of the world and

322
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,240
and the world's not judging you nature

323
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,160
is not judging you

324
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,920
um you're accepted you're belong here

325
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,040
and so it's so but but please

326
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,279
uh in this deep kind of sense of

327
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,160
acceptance

328
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,600
and not non-criticalness of oneself

329
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,079
be realistic and honest about

330
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,199
shortcomings and

331
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,519
unwholesomeness that we have and in

332
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,959
certain kind of way be inspired by that

333
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,079
wow if i see this in me now it's

334
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,040
possible to be

335
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,120
to work towards freedom without knowing

336
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,720
it there and seeing it clearly

337
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,279
where's the freedom as well and

338
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,480
and so

339
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,560
this is a call to

340
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,839
a loving a peaceful and

341
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,880
very clear recognition

342
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,320
of your foibles

343
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,120
your shortcomings your unwholesome

344
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,160
tendencies

345
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,199
what you do that is not healthy and try

346
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,000
to

347
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,720
see it be with it relate to it in

348
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,560
healthy ways in skillful ways in

349
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,320
wholesome ways

350
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,440
and inspired by the wholesome and that

351
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,519
will be the topic for next week and

352
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,360
we can't really separate these two so

353
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,040
much they'll go back and forth a little

354
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,839
bit but

355
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,440
so next week we'll look at the wholesome

356
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,720
and what i have in mind is to do so more

357
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,839
with the

358
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,079
