1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:09,040
okay so it's 9 25 here or 25 after the hour

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:17,920
and that is our unusual start time for this sunday morning or evening sit

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,119
so let's go ahead and begin with the sit

4
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:29,599
so finding a posture that's upright

5
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:37,680
relaxed settling into your seat

6
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,879
if you're comfortable doing so you can close your eyes

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:51,120
just let the eyes gently be soft

8
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:01,840
and as we bring the attention inward to our inner experience of the body

9
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:11,920
first we may detect the sense of sitting we're sitting in

10
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,520
perhaps an upright posture or perhaps you're lying down that's fine too

11
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:27,040
so just feeling the overall posture of the body

12
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:35,600
maybe feeling the places where your body is touching what it's resting on so your seat against the

13
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,840
cushion your feet against the floor

14
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:51,280
just feeling those contact points and finding some balance so that the

15
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,320
body is sitting with relatively little effort

16
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:04,000
if you're sitting upright you can even rock back and forth a little bit or forward and back a little bit

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,840
just to find a balanced posture

18
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:24,000
just softening so that you're not bracing against that contact point

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:37,040
letting it support you

20
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:43,920
paying a little bit of attention to the posture right when we sit down is a way of

21
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,640
supporting not only the body but also the mind and meditation

22
00:02:50,640 --> 00:03:04,319
we're more stable and relaxed in the body that can be true in the mind too

23
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:10,879
so then it can also help to soften a bit as we settle in

24
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:18,000
so softening the muscles of the face

25
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,120
softening the eyes that tends to get a little tight when

26
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:33,840
we're looking at a screen

27
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:46,239
softening the shoulders

28
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:53,200
letting them drop down a bit maybe imagining the shoulder blades

29
00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:01,840
sliding down the back

30
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,200
bringing some ease to the area of the chest

31
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,840
the arms the hands

32
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:42,880
softening the belly area

33
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,880
also the muscles of the low back

34
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:57,040
just allowing that whole torso area to be supported by the straightness of

35
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,800
the spine and letting everything else hang off of

36
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:15,280
that and then down through the legs

37
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,680
letting the knees and the ankles and the feet

38
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,840
be soft open

39
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,639
allowing the attention to tune in to the natural sensations of

40
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,639
breathing however your breathing now is fine

41
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:07,840
just noticing how that is

42
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:36,800
maybe on the out breath inviting a bit more softening a bit more ease

43
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:43,759
letting the natural release of the out breath carry away any additional tension

44
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,840
that's willing to release

45
00:06:53,520 --> 00:07:00,560
but if any tension seems to be remaining in the body that's fine however the body

46
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:17,840
is right now is fine just include that

47
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:36,880
we may have various things happening in our mind and heart also there may be

48
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,919
emotions present or memories of something that happened

49
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:49,840
just recently in the day we may have various thoughts in the mind

50
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,639
plans

51
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:02,000
these are okay mindfulness is meant to be inclusive

52
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:08,800
so we don't need anything to go away right away

53
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:18,160
but mindfulness is also not entangled with experience

54
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:27,840
so we have some sense that these things are allowed to be there to come and go

55
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:41,839
but we're not involved deeply in them during meditation

56
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:51,200
there's a part of the mind that is independent of the comings and goings of sensation

57
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,760
and thought and seeing if you can connect with that

58
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:09,839
part of the mind that is present but not entangled

59
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,839
uh

60
00:10:50,640 --> 00:11:00,399
if we find that we have become caught up in something in the body or mind

61
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:06,800
when we notice that we're already present again

62
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:16,480
so we're just gently connecting in again with the part of the mind that is present but not entangled allowing experience to

63
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:29,839
flow on in awareness

64
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,920
you

65
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,920
you

66
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,920
you

67
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:45,839
[Music] um

68
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:53,199
we may begin to notice certain qualities of mind that get in the way

69
00:15:53,199 --> 00:16:00,240
of being present but independent of experience

70
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,720
if we want something to be there

71
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:14,880
or if we don't want something to be there both of these are entanglements

72
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:22,800
actually there's a certain

73
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:29,759
attitude toward experience that is the most useful

74
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:37,839
sometimes it's called receptive

75
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,959
sometimes even kind

76
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:54,880
but a certain stance or attitude toward what is arising in passing

77
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:00,079
it helps the mind to be present but not

78
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:10,428
entangled sometimes just a small adjustment is [Music]

79
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:22,959
helpful and when the mind does get caught it's

80
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:29,760
helpful to smile smile with the tendency to

81
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,840
get entangled

82
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,919
you

83
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,919
you

84
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,919
you

85
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,919
you

86
00:26:53,520 --> 00:27:03,120
as we continue to abide with presence and non-entanglement

87
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:09,600
we may begin to get a sense that mindfulness itself is something of a

88
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:15,200
balancer in the mind simply being mindful of how

89
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:23,200
the mind is how the body is there can be adjustments

90
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:32,480
a simple knowing of what needs to be adjusted slightly in order to stay present

91
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:40,880
not really something we need to do but just a sense of how to stay balanced

92
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:48,799
the way we can stay balanced on a bicycle without consciously thinking about it

93
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:54,399
once we have some familiarity with [Music]

94
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,840
writing

95
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,840
uh

96
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,919
you

97
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,919
um and in the last few minutes of this

98
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:58,720
meditation [Music] we may open up a bit

99
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:08,240
perhaps reflect use this kind of gentle presence

100
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,679
without entanglement could this be useful in our daily life

101
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,960
interactions also

102
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,840
we may notice that

103
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:38,240
being unentangled is actually creating the space for us

104
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:44,398
to be more responsive be more caring

105
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,240
in that space love and compassion could come in

106
00:32:52,240 --> 00:33:11,840
more easily than if we were wrapped up in what was going on

107
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,880
sometimes we hear the message that

108
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:33,760
carrying or showing concern

109
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:42,720
must involve entanglement and anxiety and worry

110
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,919
to show that we care

111
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:56,159
but maybe through our meditation we can discover a dimension of caring

112
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:03,679
that comes from this strength of heart

113
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:20,480
of unentangled knowing

114
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:27,118
so it may be that what we've been practicing is directly serving the other people in our

115
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:32,560
lives maybe even beyond two people that we

116
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,839
don't know

117
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:49,200
so we hope that our gentle receptive presence

118
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:56,720
we wish that that brings some ease and peace to those around us

119
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:04,160
and invites stronger presence of love and compassion in our lives

120
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,440
here and beyond

121
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,839
may it be so

122
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:31,020
[Music]

123
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,520
so here in the united states

124
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:11,520
today is called independence day and it's interesting to me

125
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:18,480
that what we celebrate is not actually the day that we did become

126
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:24,960
independent but the day that we intended to become independent

127
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:33,599
by declaring that that was that was our aim and um so there's something special

128
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:41,280
about um directing ourselves toward an aspiration so maybe we can all

129
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:47,440
celebrate our intentions to be free to be caring [Music]

130
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,920
long before they come about necessarily

131
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:59,680
this idea of of independence can be a little bit complex um

132
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:06,240
most of us would like to have certain kinds of choice and agency

133
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:13,880
and determination of our own life but we also like connection

134
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:23,280
interdependence participating in things that are larger than ourselves

135
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,320
and of course in the buddhist teachings

136
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:36,720
we we know that there isn't such a thing as an independent separate

137
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:45,040
being that's considered an insight that we have but at the same time the buddha did talk

138
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:51,920
about a certain kind of independence and the discourses there is this idea of

139
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:57,119
being independent in the dhamma or independent in the dharma

140
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:02,880
and this is actually quite an important idea in the in the suttas in the teachings

141
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:11,680
and it's what i would like to talk about today so let's unpack this term a little bit

142
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:19,920
so as i said it's not that we are going to be independent you know as an individual and it isn't

143
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:25,520
considered a deep insight to understand that really completely that we are not a

144
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:32,640
separate entity operating in a separate world

145
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:38,400
so instead this kind of independence that the buddha was talking about

146
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:44,880
it refers to a very positive transition that people go through whereby

147
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:53,119
the dharma becomes internalized it becomes embedded in the heart to a degree

148
00:38:53,119 --> 00:39:00,960
that the path becomes self-sustaining from the inside if you will so being independent is said

149
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:08,160
to be one of the qualities of a person who has entered the stream of dhamma

150
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:13,280
so they've maybe understood something about how the path works

151
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:20,000
and it's um it's very satisfying this kind of independence is said to be

152
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,760
a reliable form of safety that we can have on the path when the path has become somewhat

153
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:32,880
internalized so i want to talk today about kind of a cluster of qualities

154
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:41,359
that are associated with entering the stream and becoming independent in the dhamma

155
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:48,480
but it's important to know that all of the qualities that we'll talk about today

156
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:54,000
develop somewhat continuously starting from the very beginning of practice

157
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,280
so what i say is relevant for everyone who's doing this practice

158
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:07,040
and also the qualities that i'm going to bring forth today are things that we can emulate always

159
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:12,560
before they become fully internalized we always we're always aspiring towards certain

160
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:18,240
qualities that i'll talk about today

161
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:23,520
so maybe we could see this as kind of a general gathering up of the changes that are

162
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:29,839
happening in our mind and heart as we walk the path what is happening in the mind and the

163
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:38,880
heart as we do this practice so i'll talk about three different areas

164
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:45,599
there are some things that are gained along the path and there are some things that are lost

165
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,960
along the path and we also come to see differently

166
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:56,000
come to see differently along the path and then those three kind of come

167
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:02,960
together to add up to being independent in the dhamma

168
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:09,119
it's also true that these three areas are intertwined and mutually supportive so you'll see

169
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:14,240
how each one kind of contains the others

170
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:22,880
so beginning with what is gained um the first thing that it said that we

171
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:30,720
gain with this entering of the stream is confirmed confidence

172
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:38,800
that's a that's a translation of a term that means more literally confidence based on knowledge so

173
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:44,720
in particular it refers to confidence in the buddha the dhamma and the sangha

174
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:52,640
so the three quality items that we take refuge in maybe early in the practice and so

175
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:59,920
um it really amounts to a very deep form of trust that we develop along the path and again

176
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:05,680
this is kind of incremental it might be that some of you have taken refuge in

177
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:14,079
the buddha dharma and sangha at some point and that's kind of a an initial offering of the heart to these

178
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:21,599
beautiful qualities these beautiful things that we feel are somehow reliable for us

179
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:28,560
and that's maybe it's nice to know that that confidence or trust or

180
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:33,920
placing of the heart just continues to deepen all along the path

181
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:40,960
one way that this plays out in terms of our actual way of being in the world is that

182
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:48,160
we will get less upset about the vagaries of life so the more trust and confirmed

183
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:54,960
confidence or confidence based on knowledge that we have about how the path works and what's

184
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:00,240
really reliable the less we need to

185
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:06,560
get thrown off by the natural changes that happen in life the surprises that

186
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:12,400
continue to happen all along the path we know that we can't know what will happen next

187
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:20,400
in our life but we have trust that if we stay with the path that'll be the best we can do i've had

188
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,520
times when things were a little wild in my life and

189
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:32,079
i could just remember okay but i know i have a path if i just stay present with this bring

190
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:37,760
forth the best qualities that i can that'll be the best it can unfold

191
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:45,119
so we have something to orient around given the changes of life so one thing that we gain more and more

192
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:50,960
is this confirmed confidence confidence based on knowledge

193
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:57,119
and then the second thing that's noted to be gained along the path

194
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:03,680
is excellent ethics so people who live in the stream of dhamma

195
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:10,240
are said to possess the virtues dear to the noble ones unbroken

196
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:16,960
untorn unblemished unmodeled freeing praised by the wise

197
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:23,680
ungrasped leading to concentration that alone is a very interesting list

198
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:30,800
but it um it points toward the internalization of ethical conduct as just a natural way

199
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:36,560
of being and also that it supports the path in that two of the qualities listed were

200
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:43,920
freeing and leading to concentration so we we can see that ethics is just a natural

201
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:51,440
support for walking the path and it deepens and it continues to deepen all along our

202
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:58,240
our practice so then another thing that is gained is

203
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:03,280
generosity and the sutas use such phrases as

204
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:09,040
a person walking the path delights in giving and sharing

205
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:14,800
and this is a natural kind of non-possessiveness that comes about through practice

206
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:20,800
and it again is something that deepens maybe from day one we've started to become a little bit

207
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:25,839
more generous as we uh sit with our own mind our own

208
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:31,040
body as we start to be more mindful in life and it just goes deeper and

209
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:38,800
deeper so this is something we can look forward to gaining more of this beautiful quality

210
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:45,760
and then because it's named in the teachings i'll mention that another quality gained is

211
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:52,000
fearlessness concerning one's death so that's interesting

212
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:58,560
i said we become less and less governed by that subterranean

213
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:05,920
existential anxiety that we can have about the possibility of our own death

214
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:14,960
so it might be that fearlessness about death is something like gaining that is something like losing

215
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:20,880
our fear of death so gains and losses maybe go together so

216
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:26,880
shift then to what is some of the things that are lost along the path you know what are what

217
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:32,560
are we freed from what do we let go of of course we let go of many many things

218
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:39,119
along the path of practice but there are three especially important

219
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:45,599
ones that are singled out as being part of this process of becoming

220
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:51,440
independent in the dhamma and these three are part of a larger list called the

221
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:56,960
ten fetters better is a little bit of an unusual word so

222
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:03,680
a fetter is a a bond or a restriction and they're said to be ten of them but

223
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:08,720
the um the first three are the ones that are really

224
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:16,400
relevant in this case and the first one you know maybe is a little hard to

225
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:21,440
describe sometimes but it's it's often translated as

226
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:27,599
doctrine of self so we lose having a doctrine of self the word literally

227
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:33,760
means existing body view sakaya ditty

228
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:41,040
but you know put into more common language it really just means a firm belief in an unchanging

229
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:48,480
self or entity some kind of a permanent self or permanent inherent

230
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:55,200
qualities and this is you know this is profound of course to deeply investigate this

231
00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:01,520
but i don't think we need to get really wrapped up in it um it's it's

232
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:08,160
something that begins quite soon as we start practicing in that most people can see that as they

233
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:13,680
practice meditation and mindfulness there's a way that they become

234
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:20,559
lighter somehow now once we start practicing there's

235
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:26,400
fairly soon we become less burdened by restrictive ideas of who we need to be

236
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:31,520
we become more able for example when we're in a conversation with our partner

237
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:38,880
to see their point of view to take a pause before we react to

238
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:44,319
maybe give up our you know something we would have grasped at

239
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:50,079
before and be willing to see things from their point of view all of these are

240
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:55,839
our small ways that we're letting go of things that we had identified with before

241
00:48:55,839 --> 00:49:03,520
aspects of our self that we were holding on to as our doctrine of who i am and who i

242
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:09,760
need to be so essentially what we're losing is some rigidity

243
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:15,119
we're losing some rigidity along the path and in particular rigidity around

244
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:21,920
ourselves so i think this is fairly something we can connect with right away

245
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:27,759
and then you know let the let the deeper parts of it unfold as they do

246
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:35,280
and then the second main thing that we lose or let go of one of the other

247
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:41,280
fetters is doubt and this refers specifically

248
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:49,119
to doubt in the buddha's teachings and the path to liberation it takes a lot of forms this doubt can

249
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:55,440
be outright disbelief it can be a lack of confidence in our ability to walk the

250
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:04,400
path or it can be a kind of a subtle uncertainty about what is referred to

251
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:10,480
in the path of liberation and so abandoning this fetter or releasing it

252
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:15,599
is essentially just the counterpart to gaining confirmed confidence in the

253
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:22,000
buddha dhamma and sangha so we see as we walk the path and we get clearer on

254
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:28,240
what's going on we have less and less doubt about the direction that we're going

255
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:33,599
you know even if we can't know as i said before what's going to happen next in our life

256
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:38,960
we have no doubt that the practice and the path will be supportive

257
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:44,559
in meeting whatever comes along and again we can just let that doubt

258
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:50,240
slowly wither away you know to the point where the practice becomes internalized and we

259
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:55,280
essentially have no doubt about the buddha the dharma and the sangha

260
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:02,480
in our life and then the third main thing that we

261
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:10,720
let go of in the process of becoming independent of the dhamma is said to be attachment to precepts

262
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:16,800
and religious practices that's how it's translated usually so that first word is

263
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:24,079
important we're losing our attachment to these things are grasping of them essentially of

264
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:30,400
course a person would not stop following the precepts remember that one of the qualities gained

265
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:36,559
was excellent ethics excellent virtue and respect for ethical conduct so

266
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:42,400
it's not that that really changes but the attachment or the grasping and we

267
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:47,839
don't believe that the precepts alone are sufficient for awakening

268
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:54,800
or that they amount to the only thing that we're striving for on the path and the same is true for

269
00:51:54,800 --> 00:52:02,160
various kinds of religious practices that we would undertake rituals or devotional practices

270
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:09,520
these can of course still be done in fact might be done even more deeply as we walk the path but

271
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:15,839
we don't have the attachment to them that they alone are what brings about liberation

272
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:21,839
or that they alone are the point of what we're doing so they're they're used properly as

273
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:27,520
skillful means so it's interesting if we step back and

274
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:32,960
reflect on these three fetters the the doctrine of self the doubt

275
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:39,599
and the attachment to precepts and religious practices all of those are fetters that are

276
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:46,880
related to our understanding so they have to do with how we see things how we

277
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:54,480
relate to things how we view things how we imbue things with meaning and so entering this entering the stream

278
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:59,920
of dom means releasing some of our key misunderstandings that inhibit walking

279
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:05,200
the path and that's essentially what these three fetters are they're misunderstandings

280
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:10,480
that we walk around with and that we don't maybe you don't even realize are

281
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:17,119
inhibiting our ability to walk the path and so as we release them we become freer and we feel that we are

282
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:22,240
entering into this this stream it's important maybe to

283
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:28,720
say at this point that we're not talking about really an intellectual understanding you know i'm

284
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:35,520
using words and explaining things and talking through things and that's important as we listen to the dharma and take it

285
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:42,960
in but eventually what we find is our understanding is a direct experience

286
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:49,040
it's a an experience that goes deeper than just our cognitive understanding of things

287
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:55,200
being able to repeat lists and so forth so we we take it in in this verbal form

288
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:02,319
but you know please let it enter into your being into your heart so that it becomes a deeper

289
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:08,559
understanding so then that leads naturally into the

290
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:15,119
third area that i wanted to talk about which is that the understanding aspect of independence

291
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:21,040
in the dharma is that we start to see things differently we start to see

292
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:26,079
in less habitual ways than we did at the beginning of the path

293
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:32,800
this is what's meant by the term right view also translated as wise view or maybe

294
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:38,640
appropriate view it's not really a right and wrong kind of thing it's something that we slowly

295
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:45,520
move into the way that we see gets clearer and clearer as we practice

296
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:52,319
and i think this is also something that nearly everyone has experienced no matter how new or

297
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:57,440
old in practice you are so we start to see as soon as we have

298
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:02,720
mindfulness we start to see more clearly what's going on in our body and our mind

299
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:09,359
and so you know all along the path our vision is is getting clearer

300
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:18,880
but in the context we're talking about today the particular understanding that we're

301
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:25,200
that we're talking about is some kind of experiential understanding of what are called the four noble truths

302
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:33,960
and these these pertain to a certain quality of experience called dukkha which is could be translated as

303
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:39,119
unsatisfactoriness it's of course often translated as suffering which

304
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:46,880
might not capture all the aspects of dukkha sometimes i just think of it as offness

305
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:54,559
you know the sense that it's hard to get everything aligned all at once and keep it that way and

306
00:55:54,559 --> 00:56:01,200
there's often a feeling like that's not quite right that's not quite working that of course is something that we made

307
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:09,119
that we're generating in our own mind but this quality of dukkha the buddha identified as very important to

308
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:16,960
look at so these four noble truths are to know that there there is dukkha in life to know

309
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:23,200
that it arises in dependence on craving and clinging there's some

310
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:28,960
wanting that is present if we're feeling dukkha or unsatisfactoriness

311
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:35,920
or suffering and then to know also that it can end and to know that there's a path

312
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:40,880
to ending it so those are the

313
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:48,480
sort of a concise statement of the four truths but what this means practically is that the mind begins to orient

314
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:53,599
towards seeing dukkha seeing the clinging and craving that accompanies it

315
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:59,280
seeing its release and seeing the path to releasing it and that doesn't mean that in every

316
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:06,000
moment we have to rush to try to figure out what all those things are it's more that we just have an

317
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:12,400
orientation toward where's the difficulty the suffering the tension [Music]

318
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:19,359
and where is the release of that how might that be released so

319
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:27,520
this is sort of an orientation to the mind and maybe a second important aspect of

320
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:33,599
understanding that all i'll mention because it's so prominent in this quality of entering the stream

321
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:38,640
is that we start to have genuine uh wisdom around arising and ceasing

322
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:45,040
so there's a statement in the suttas that people often say when they're declaring their

323
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:50,880
independence and what they say is all that is of a nature to arise is

324
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:57,599
also of a nature to cease so i understand people understand that

325
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:03,440
everything comes and goes literally everything and you know how how would somebody know

326
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:08,880
that for sure well it could be that the person has experienced something

327
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:16,480
ceasing at a deep enough level that it makes an impression on their understanding so a lot follows from that

328
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:23,200
simple statement everything that is of a nature to arise there's also a nature to cease

329
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:30,480
it can get a little abstract sounding we're talking about truths and things like that so it's maybe also

330
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:36,960
important to know that as we practice our understanding of truth actually becomes less and less

331
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:42,559
abstract so we start to see that dukkha and the end of dukkha are about this

332
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:49,119
particular experience happening right now just recently i was traveling on an

333
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:56,400
airplane for the first time in a year and a half and i got delayed at my stopover and had to spend a few

334
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:04,000
extra hours and so my mind i noticed it kind of veered toward thinking that the unpleasantness

335
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:09,200
i was experiencing was going to end when i finally got home but then

336
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:15,680
you know it's like okay looking into the future when is this going to be over but then something shifted and i

337
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:20,799
realized that the duka was the suffering that was happening at that exact moment

338
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:26,559
you know my impatience my irritation with bling travel has not changed in a year

339
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:32,079
and a half and it was being added by my mind and so i was actually

340
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:37,839
able to relax right there in the crowded airport it was still unpleasant but i wasn't

341
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:44,720
suffering so there's a way in which these four noble truths become

342
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:50,960
about this moment you know it's not that there is dukkha it's that this is duka or not or this is

343
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:56,640
the end of duka happening right here so we you know we get brought into the

344
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:02,960
present moment really through this practice so happily this turns out to be a much more

345
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:09,440
satisfying way of seeing in our usual way you know to see immediately what's happening in this

346
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:14,480
present moment how it might be released into freedom

347
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:22,160
how it might this experience itself might be the basis for liberation brings a form of joy to have that

348
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:27,440
accessible right there in this exact moment of experience the simple joy of being present

349
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:33,760
with being in touch with what's happening now and the joy of having a wise orientation

350
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:40,240
so this um this kind of present moment wisdom that starts to come in pretty

351
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:45,440
pretty quickly and then grows gets deeper and deeper it provides a subtle but important

352
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:54,160
support for walking the path in our life you know it's going to support us all along the path so seeing accurately

353
01:00:54,160 --> 01:01:00,960
is so important so we have that some good qualities are gained some

354
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:06,559
restrictions are lost fall away and we see more clearly

355
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:12,240
so all of that adds up to a kind of robustness of heart or inner

356
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:18,240
strength that is what the buddha called independence independent in the dharma when it

357
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:23,280
becomes internalized and this is what we're working toward or working too deep in in

358
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:28,480
our practice so i want to consider this

359
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:34,960
stock phrase that is said about this transformation of understanding and it's said about a lay follower named

360
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:41,119
dupali so lest you think this sounds impossible upali was an active community member

361
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:46,480
a busy householder um who was doing a lot of things in the

362
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:51,839
world but nonetheless he listened to the dharma and

363
01:01:51,839 --> 01:02:00,079
add a realization and then the buddha says about him upali saw the dhamma attained the dhamma

364
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:06,480
fathomed the dhamma he crossed beyond doubt did away with perplexity gained

365
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:12,960
intrepidity and became independent of others in the teacher's dispensation

366
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:18,319
so this path is about knowing for ourselves it's about knowing for ourselves what

367
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:24,240
the teachings are referring to and being able to embody them in certain ways that's what

368
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:31,039
it means to become independent in the dhamma and it benefits everyone around us really

369
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:37,839
so there is another teaching that mentions a few things that are sort

370
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:44,319
of specific actions that would be done by a person who is independent in the dhamma and i think that some of

371
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:50,480
them are interesting i'll just name a few so a person like this will instinctively

372
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:57,520
draw back from committing ethical violations and they will immediately report any that they have

373
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:02,720
committed you know they will feel uncomfortable if they know that they have lied a

374
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:08,640
little bit or um maybe accidentally taken something that wasn't theirs

375
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:14,720
they will feel so uncomfortable about that that they will go and find the person that they need to

376
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:21,839
talk to about that it's a very beautiful quality of heart that comes with this excellent ethics

377
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:27,039
and of course very useful for relational life also

378
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:34,000
also a person who's independent in the dhamma will consider practice to be of primary importance in their life

379
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,200
there is a way in which they can't become so busy and over committed that they're no

380
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:47,680
longer able to practice because that will be too important to them also a very beautiful quality and also such a

381
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:53,920
person pays close attention to dharma teachings listening eagerly

382
01:03:53,920 --> 01:04:00,799
said that this person will feel inspired and confident and joyful when the dharma is being taught

383
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:07,680
and they will know that their mind cannot be obsessed to so great a degree that they could not

384
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:13,599
see things as they are i like that one in particular so there's a sort of a

385
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:19,520
non-obsession that comes about through being independent in the dharma it's not that the mind never gets caught

386
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:26,640
up in things um or you know temporarily obsessed but it that gets greatly reduced and essentially that

387
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:32,880
gives us this space to become more flexible so you might consider if you have these

388
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:41,039
ways of being or if there are ways of bringing in more of these ways of being you know being clear about our ethics

389
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:46,240
making practice more primarily important in life

390
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:53,520
listening to the dharma with a heart of joy really taking it in and feeling the goodness of it and also

391
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:59,599
um taking care that our mind is not so obsessed with things um such that we would not be

392
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:05,160
able to see things clearly that's a little bit what we did in the meditation just practice the

393
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:10,720
non-entanglement of the mind so independence is freedom

394
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:17,200
um but it's not freedom to do what we want it's you know just do whatever we want it's it's a sort of a deeper and more

395
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:22,720
profound kind of freedom you know it's the that we're free to be responsive without

396
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:28,079
getting entangled in self-interest or in our own universities

397
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:33,520
free of our past habits such as strong desire and aversion

398
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:38,640
these habits that limit being wise and connected in the moment

399
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:43,680
also freedom to see broadly to see a variety of perspectives

400
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:51,200
and to see beyond our previously limited view of things to have a flexible viewpoint on the

401
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:57,280
world and free to trust the unfolding of life

402
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:04,480
in all of its glory and all of its pain and all of its triumph in all of its reality so this is a

403
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:09,839
transformation of heart that we're doing it's a slow change toward having

404
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:16,799
less and less impedance and suffering in our heart and more and more

405
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:26,400
freedom and flexibility and responsiveness in our life so i want to end with a poem

406
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:34,559
maybe maybe speaks to this the wine in the glass remembers the long

407
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:39,680
days in darkness how it couldn't breathe how it lost its

408
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:46,480
scent of grape and became more grapefruit more green pepper more grass

409
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:54,559
how it lost its harsh taste lost its astringents and became rounder more smooth

410
01:06:54,559 --> 01:07:00,400
more wine i too am changing in these long days

411
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:05,680
i too am converting what i've known into what i will be

412
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:13,280
i too am becoming something i almost don't recognize heady with transformation yet tethered

413
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:19,119
by memory to what it was like to feel trapped what it was like to steep in that

414
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:26,558
darkness to have to learn to trust whatever came next

415
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:34,000
so wishing you all well on this independent

416
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:39,680
stay and may the dhamma embed itself deeply

417
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:52,000
in your heart and bring you freedom in life thank you
