1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:10,480
Welcome to our morning sitting and I want to begin today by

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,320
emphasizing that one of

3
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:23,160
the strong associations people have with Buddhism with the Buddhist

4
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:31,400
teaching is especially in relationship to nonattachment is the idea of letting go

5
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:38,000
let go let go let go some teachers will emphasize and what's remarkable in the

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,480
Buddhist teachings uh he never talks about letting go of anything any person any in the

7
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:53,320
world the emphasis over and over again is to let go of the grasping in the mind

8
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:59,079
the clinging in the mind grasping can be done towards things

9
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:04,640
which are healthy and beneficial for the world and grasping can be done with things that

10
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,240
are unhealthy and harmful to the world but grasping itself is always

11
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,880
harmful to the person who grasps clings attached so when the Buddha emphasized

12
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:25,880
Letting Go Letting Go letting go uh it was uh really Letting Go the

13
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,920
clinging and so in this week that we've been looking at grasping

14
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,680
clinging certainly it helps to see what we're clinging to what we're holding on

15
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:44,560
to but those are a mirror for doing the Deep inner work work of letting

16
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,920
go so for this meditation I'd like to encourage that it be an ongoing

17
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:56,039
meditation On Letting Go not of

18
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:04,640
anything but of the grasping to anything that arises here for this next you know almost 30

19
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:11,360
minutes that stay very relaxed in the present moment I'll guide

20
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,440
you and then at some point whatever it is that you

21
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:25,599
know that's happening in the present whatever you are aware of gently

22
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:33,120
lovingly release any holding to it release any preoccupation with it any

23
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,280
fixation any concern any lingering with it any even

24
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:46,959
interest and curiosity to it just let go let go let go and when you let

25
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,599
go something else will come into awareness let it come into awareness and

26
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:58,920
let go when you let go become aware of whatever is obvious that's Happening

27
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:05,319
Here and Now and know it and let go know it and let

28
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:11,120
go so to assume a meditation

29
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,000
posture and gently closing your

30
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:25,640
eyes the closing the eyes is a beginning process of letting go of concerns with

31
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:31,040
what is seen some people have a lot of attachment

32
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:37,120
to looking and seeing searching with her

33
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:48,760
eyes the eyes closed feeling the body and taking some long slow deep

34
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:05,120
breaths and as you exhale to relax the

35
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:20,880
body relaxing is a form of Letting Go

36
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:27,160
releasing we might be releasing muscular tension but

37
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,960
generally much of the tension we hold in our our

38
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:37,880
body arises from some holding in the

39
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,440
mind letting the breathing return to

40
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,639
normal

41
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:12,320
and as you exhale as you inhale feel the muscles of

42
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,639
your

43
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,800
face and as you exhale relax the muscles of your

44
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:35,199
face as you

45
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:41,280
exhale relax any concerns preoccupations about your

46
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,639
face except for it to

47
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:02,360
relax as you inhale feeling the

48
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:16,319
shoulders on the exhale allowing the shoulders to relax

49
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,680
soften

50
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
settle

51
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
e

52
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:25,960
as you inhale feeling the belly relaxing the belly on the

53
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
exhale

54
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:55,199
on the inhale feeling the whole body the global body

55
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:01,199
in whatever way that's easy

56
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,960
on the exhale relax release the

57
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:19,759
body and letting go of any thoughts or feelings

58
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,479
emotions judgments you have about your

59
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:30,680
body let go

60
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,959
of thinking about your body except to have it

61
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:54,240
relax and then to Center yourself on the body

62
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
breathing

63
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,240
as you feel the body

64
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:17,560

mind

67
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:48,680
relax let [Music] go of your

68
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:06,399
thoughts as if letting go of your thoughts the thoughts can drift away

69
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,760
into the space around

70
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
you

71
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
for

72
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
e

73
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,920
with every exhale releasing the hold of anything

74
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:00,959
you think about like let go of the need to think

75
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,320
about whatever you're thinking

76
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
about

77
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:50,240
as you exhale let go of any attachment for

78
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:57,680
against any emotion that you're feeling let the emotion just be there

79
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:04,399
but let go of your preoccupation with it or judgments of it

80
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,759
or just relax the mind the

81
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
heart

82
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
e

83
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:10,120
whatever comes into awareness whatever you know

84
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:20,440
or let go let go of

85
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:27,720
everything when it's known even let go of the

86
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:35,600
knowing so so that the next moment of knowing can arise fresh and

87
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:44,079
new and that too let go of regardless of what you're aware

88
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:51,800
of release it from the hold of the mind let

89
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:58,040
go let go let

90
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
go

91
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
for

92
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

93
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

94
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

95
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

96
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
for

97
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
for

98
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
for

99
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
for

100
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
for

101
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
for

102
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
for

103
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

104
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,600
can you let go of what's in the

105
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:51,880
mind can you begin to release what's in the

106
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:04,080
heart here every moment of knowing can be a

107
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:12,880
moment of non-grasping or of letting

108
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
go

109
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

110
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

111
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

112
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

113
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

114
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:16,480
every exhale an occasion to let go of what is

115
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:33,640
arisen let nothing stay in the

116
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
mind

117
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

118
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

119
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,679
and then as we come to the end of the

120
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:30,360
sitting to consider how like letting go

121
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:35,880
of desires diversions in relationship to

122
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:42,880
people letting go of our judgments and fears and agendas with

123
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:50,600
people allows us to see them clearly is an act of respect where

124
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:56,039
they're allowed to [Music] be how they

125
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,120
are in our kind

126
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,518
gaze letting

127
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:13,960
go is the windshield wiper for the

128
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:24,279
heart so the heart is UN

129
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:33,159
covered and we can see people with our hearts's Good

130
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:41,360
Will May all beings be

131
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:48,440
happy may all beings be

132
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:54,440
safe may all beings be

133
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:00,039
peaceful may all beings be free

134
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:07,760
free and may they be free of all the projections and agendas

135
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:15,279
and desires that I have no judgments just

136
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:19,159
see with an open

137
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:30,039
[Music] heart

138
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,720
thank

139
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,039
you

140
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,960
e

141
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:53,919
so hello and welcome to this Fifth and last talk on the five bundles of

142
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:59,240
grasping the five bundles of clinging

143
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:06,519
the word for clinging in P is upana and it has an interesting meaning

144
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:12,559
double meaning it means both clinging and

145
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:19,080
fuel the food like the fuel that keeps a fire burning and

146
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:24,919
so clinging is the very fuel for more

147
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:31,720
clinging so as long as we cling it's very hard to get the the uh the

148
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:39,080
fire to stop fire of clinging but we have to somehow

149
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:47,320
stop sooner or later and appreciate the stopping appreciate the moments the

150
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:53,519
minutes the hours where the heart is not caught in the grip of

151
00:31:53,519 --> 00:32:00,240
anything the mind can just move freely lightly

152
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:06,480
fluidly without stopping for anything by getting hung up by it or blocked by it

153
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:12,320
or preoccupied by anything it's a remarkable State of Mind of

154
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:19,200
heart so the last of the five bundles is usually translated into

155
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:27,600
English as Consciousness and uh the poly word is probably more

156
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:33,799
like cognition the problem with translating is

157
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:40,039
consciousness is that uh for one thing we English speakers

158
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:47,399
have very deep-seated kind of assumption about what Consciousness is and philosophers

159
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:53,880
psychologists have been trying for years to figure out what it is as if it is

160
00:32:54,440 --> 00:33:01,320
something in P the word vigana um is not a continuous

161
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:10,039
state of awareness but rather is the individual moments of cognition of just as simplest

162
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:15,679
knowing more simple than recognition so the word

163
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:22,679
recognition and cognition have similar root word cognition in them just like

164
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:28,279
the word SAA in P the third bundle SAA

165
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:33,639
has the same root as Viana so they both have this word

166
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:40,279
knowing in it but the vigana the is the individual moments of

167
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:45,919
cognition so a moment of hearing a moment of seeing a moment of smelling of

168
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:53,799
tasting of touching a moment of knowing a thought an idea whatever it is there's

169
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:59,919
idea that that that the mind is in a sense con conly taking in all this

170
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:09,118
different sense data that coming in from within from without and they're made up of a lot of kind of small moments of

171
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:15,679
cognition maybe some of them are simultaneous maybe there's a lot coming in at once but each of them like you can

172
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:21,358
hear and see and smell maybe at the same time but each is unique

173
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:30,878
discreet and so um but what we tend to do is to uh lump it all together into a

174
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:36,720
gastal into a hole and the analogy of my teacher in Burma like to give was that

175
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:42,560
of um a row a row of ants from a distance seemed like a continuous stream

176
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,599
of black line if you get close you see they're very all these discreet

177
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:54,358
ants or they would take a fire wand and uh talk about it and if you take it in

178
00:34:54,359 --> 00:35:02,160
the dark and and swirl it around fast the eyes will see a continuous circle of

179
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:09,480
flame however that's not really there it's partly a construct of the Mind in the same way as we the old movies that

180
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:18,560
were made up of you know um um you know individual still shots at 16 frames um a

181
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:24,359
second or something eight frames a second would um uh would be

182
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:29,440
reconstructed in the mind as continuous movement of the people in the movie

183
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:37,440
where there's no movement it's just individual shots still shots so um so the mind has this ability

184
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:44,079
to kind of gather things together and hold them all as a whole and thereby Miss some of the

185
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:50,400
individual things so there can be a lot of cons a lot of attachment

186
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,720
to the the the whole of cognition the process of cognition and there's a

187
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:02,599
tendency to take that whole to be um Consciousness a state of being aware and

188
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:08,400
it feels so real so second nature so like that of course it's there but it's

189
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:14,480
not there in any kind of way that you can take your hand and grab it it's like grabbing air you can't end up with you

190
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:21,200
know not holding any of it it just all disappears with the fist closing up and

191
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:29,800
um the uh it has no weight it has no color no shape um and um and it we might

192
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:38,119
understand it to be a a gathering together of all the different ways of perception Works into a kind of a

193
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:44,079
hole that is not really continuous but looks like that just like the

194
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:50,680
movie and um and so cognition it seems so primary to what it means to

195
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:56,720
exist even the momentto moment Co flow of cognition can seem so primary to what

196
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:01,920
it means to be alive that this last bundle is almost

197
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:07,000
the same as being attached to life itself to

198
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:14,960
existing uh there's a clinging a grasping to just exist there's also uh for some people

199
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:20,200
the idea of Consciousness or even just simple cognition would seem to be the

200
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:25,920
very Foundation of who they are nothing is more foundational more core to our

201
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:32,280
identity to Who We Are that of course we're going to cling to it this is we're going to take this as me this is

202
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:38,599
mine and um and uh and so for the Buddha

203
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:44,560
nothing is worth clinging to not any single moment of cognition not the whole

204
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:50,960
process of cognition over time the sense of continuity of a of awareness or Consciousness that can

205
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:58,359
exist nothing is worth clinging to and um but we cling to it we cling to

206
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:03,599
our ideas of what it means to be conscious we cling to the how Consciousness is the core feeling of

207
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:08,680
being alive and being a person we cling to The Refuge of Consciousness some

208
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:14,680
people can get a very beautiful feeling of kind of a wide spatial spacious

209
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:21,040
spacious Consciousness or all abiding Consciousness that um can feel so

210
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:27,960
distinct from the vagaries of Life the particularities of what's challenging our life it seems also

211
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:33,160
transcend the preoccupations of our thinking mind and our emotional heart

212
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:41,079
it's a place of peace and space and freedom and in a sense it is and it's uh

213
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:47,599
quite meaningful for people to have this wonderful sense of unpre accupedo

214
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:55,000
Consciousness that just seems to exist independent of me even for the Buddha that also could be

215
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,079
an object of attachment and any assumption any belief that even the

216
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:06,040
Consciousness is who I am with for the Buddha would be a form of clinging any

217
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:13,520
kind of engaging in it or involvement with it is a kind of preoccupation kind

218
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:18,640
of attachment can be very very subtle in the teachings of the Buddha

219
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:24,359
everything is a everything is an occasion to let go we also let go of

220
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:29,800
Consciousness we don't let go of being aware but we let go of any clinging to

221
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:36,200
being aware and at the deepest stages of meditation it's almost as if

222
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:45,040
Consciousness lets go of itself awareness lets go of itself there's no one doing the letting go it's just let

223
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:53,000
Letting Go Letting Go letting go and to have letting go be so thorough so

224
00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:00,160
complete that uh that we find oursel without any grasping to any of the

225
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:07,400
bundles we don't grasp to appearances we don't grasp to Pleasure and Pain we

226
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:15,000
don't grasp at um our recognitions or ideas of things we don't grasp at our

227
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,880
stories we don't grasp even at the very sense of being of cognition itself that

228
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:26,319
which knows all these things it doesn't mean that these have to

229
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:34,359
disappear but they exist without grasping without clinging they exist

230
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:39,880
freely the ongoing flow

231
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:48,920
of knowing seeing tasting thinking and it's a it's a it's a

232
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:55,480
requires a some people would say it's a deep sense of trust the trust that we

233
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:02,280
don't have to hold on we don't have to assert we don't have to get preoccupied

234
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:07,680
and hold things and be attached we can learn to take care of

235
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:15,119
ourselves without being attached we can learn to get through this life successfully without

236
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:20,400
clinging it doesn't make us a victim it doesn't make us helpless it doesn't mean

237
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:26,359
that we can't plan and set things up for ourselves that means that whatever

238
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:31,839
planning and care and preparations we do for this life that we live we do it with

239
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:40,880
no clinging we do it we hold it lightly we hold it freely we fold it without

240
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:47,880
assertion and therefore without any exhaustion without the Deep weariness

241
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:54,920
that comes from living a life that goes from one clinging to another one attachment to the

242
00:41:54,920 --> 00:42:01,680
next so these are the five bundles and at least in the teachings of the Buddha

243
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:07,119
these are emphasized over and over and over again as the

244
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:12,440
primary things that we get attached to and the primary things we create a self

245
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:20,160
out of and the Buddha's idea is you just let go let go let go and let them let these

246
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:25,960
things operate freely without getting caught by any of

247
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:33,160
it and and um and so in the Buddha's own classic tra teachings on

248
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:38,720
mindfulness the the in the satian the discourse in the four foundations of

249
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:44,240
mindfulness um this is actually one of the

250
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:49,640
um instructions to be able to see clearly

251
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:55,359
the five bundles of clinging and the way to see them the

252
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:02,640
Buddha said Is You see them arising and passing arising and passing you see them

253
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:07,760
as part of the ongoing flow the River of Life that we're

254
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:14,920
in and with that I'll leave you to the river of your life may you flow freely

255
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:20,319
in that River without icing up without grabbing onto the

256
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:28,200
embankment without drowning May you float without any clinging whatsoever

257
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:35,079
and in the Stream of your life so thank you and um very much for

258
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:40,960
this chance to teach about the five bundles and um I look forward to being

259
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:47,319
back on Monday to continue with this introduction to mindfulness uh series

260
00:43:47,319 --> 00:43:53,800
thank you
