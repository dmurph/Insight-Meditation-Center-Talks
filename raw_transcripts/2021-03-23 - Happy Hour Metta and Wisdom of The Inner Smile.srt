1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:07,279
so hello and welcome everyone to happy hour

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:15,599
so for the theme for this practice for us

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,199
this um sitting together um

4
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:28,800
two themes i like to bring in one is the theme of of wisdom

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,120
imbue imbuing meta imbuing uh kindness and kindness imbuing

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,719
awareness which is a theme that those of you on retreat for a week that's

7
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:47,440
one theme from the retreat that the people reported were very um nourishing

8
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,960
different different way of practicing in many ways for many people

9
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,760
so that's one thing i like to bring in because really meta is so it doesn't need to be

10
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,680
different from wisdom practices and with wisdom practices where we pay attention

11
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,799
where we become aware of what's arising what's passing awareness awareness awareness this

12
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,000
awareness can be imbued with

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,280
ah kindness care warmth acceptance

14
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,119
love so many different nuances of meta who are different for different

15
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:36,960
occasions but basically knowing knowing intertwined

16
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:45,360
with ah sense of e sense of care love um so for example when judgmental

17
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,360
thoughts arise knowing them but not pushing them away oh you stop it right now

18
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:59,520
that never works because if you try to to punish yourself if you try to um if you try to um

19
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,360
work with aversion with a version doesn't doesn't really help it just

20
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,640
becomes more conflictual so noticing with ah

21
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:17,440
noticing with being becoming aware with curiosity with acceptance with love

22
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,720
like oh judgmental thought okay let me be curious about this let me

23
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,000
open up to it and understand it a little more so awareness can be impeded with this

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,080
imbued with the spirit of meta spirit of openness acceptance um so

25
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:44,000
that's one theme i like uh to invite us to sit with to explore in the guided meditation and

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,680
um the other theme is we'll be primarily working uh with

27
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:58,480
with ourselves ourselves body thoughts the the realm kind of the internal

28
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:05,680
realm not so much going external with other beings as as we sometimes do in concentric

29
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,519
widening circles of meta but as the buddha said if you search the whole world

30
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:18,720
you won't find any more worthy of your own love

31
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,000
your own care your own affection your own mental

32
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:33,440
so that's all i want to say to set up the framework and let's

33
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,760
do let's get into it together or not do whatever might be appropriate but let's

34
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,879
transition into our practice space

35
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:50,959
so inviting you to shift move if you need to

36
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:59,360
change position if you need to lie down if you need to sit up a little

37
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:06,640
straighter whatever this body needs notice what

38
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:15,120
this body needs right now

39
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:29,840
and arriving arriving and landing

40
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:39,680
greeting creating this body greeting not just the body but also the

41
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,880
space in which the body sitting

42
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,320
is being held becoming aware

43
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,840
of the body

44
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:06,400
earth element body with heaviness weight

45
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:15,360
earth on earth and aware of the air element inside the

46
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,758
breath

47
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,360
that moves through the body

48
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:40,320
while noticing the body grounded stable shifting

49
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:47,120
allowing the shifting of awareness shifting of your weight

50
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,400
ah to be moved down

51
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,840
your sit bones to your legs to your feet

52
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,840
the earth element grounded

53
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:21,840
[Music] stable

54
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:33,280
inviting the whole body to relax your hands your arms your shoulders

55
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,759
let them drop their weight

56
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:50,880
fighting your legs to give their weight to the earth

57
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:03,840
feeling supported

58
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:17,840
dividing your whole trunk your sit bones

59
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:27,759
to let go [Music] to release any tension

60
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,840
that you might be aware of holding

61
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:45,840
the same for the face muscles of the forehead the jaw

62
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:59,840
muscles inside the face

63
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:12,960
inviting them fighting the muscles to release let go

64
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,840
of any tension

65
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
holding

66
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,440
let awareness

67
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:55,839
expand to feel the entire body hold the entire body

68
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,000
with each out breath dropping in

69
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,839
dropping more releasing more tension

70
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:45,440
notice that this body earth alone earth on earth grounded rooted

71
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,839
is breathing it's being breathed

72
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,399
noticing aware of the air moving in and out

73
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,920
on its own

74
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,839
the body being breathed

75
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:37,680
it's not so much that we are breathing consciously let the

76
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:44,720
unconscious parasympathetic nervous system knows how

77
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,399
to do this perfectly well

78
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:15,839
simply relaxing and letting it be known

79
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,839
and as awareness is turned internal

80
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:21,839
intimately knowing the breath the entire in-breath entire opera

81
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:40,000
can the knowing be tinged imbued with friendliness as if you're greeting

82
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:49,839
a friend who's visiting

83
00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:03,680
every moment a new arrival

84
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,040
awareness grieving

85
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,800
knowing with friendliness

86
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:20,560
whatever comes in contact with

87
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,000
whatever is known the breath

88
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,839
sensations

89
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:18,000
and as thoughts arise maybe thoughts of judgment

90
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,199
oh you're not doing this well oh you're getting distracted

91
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:29,040
can awareness meet these visitors too

92
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,120
with openness of heart with friendliness they're just

93
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,839
visitors

94
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:06,399
even if aversion arises not liking wanting to push something away

95
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:15,440
in our bodies and our hearts and can that too be met

96
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:22,480
ah be known

97
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:37,839
with ease the relaxed open friendly attitude

98
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:11,520
if anything arises that's challenging hello challenge

99
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:18,480
hi how are you

100
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:25,360
how's it going or aversion to something stop

101
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:34,240
go away ah and they're wanting to stop go away

102
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:42,639
how are you how do you feel let me know you it's okay

103
00:17:43,120 --> 00:18:01,840
ah i'm open to knowing you with ease with friendliness

104
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:38,559
for some things you don't need to linger some thoughts that can be known oh it's like this

105
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,799
for a moment with friendliness and you can come back to knowing the

106
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:50,320
breath the sensations of the body receiving them

107
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:57,840
receiving the sensations of the breath in the body

108
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:05,919
greeting this friend this breath this one visiting this

109
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:12,240
moment this out breath visiting and now this

110
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,600
one getting to know

111
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:28,480
the entirety of them not just casually but really getting

112
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:36,720
to know them intimately from the moment they arrive

113
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:44,880
till the moment they leave taking care of this serving tea

114
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:53,840
and cookies this breath just this one

115
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,120
you might even experiment with smiling

116
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:12,960
at thoughts

117
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:20,480
especially if they're judgmental genstrom receiving them with a smile

118
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:27,840
and letting them pass greeting them and letting them be on their way

119
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:56,320
we're smiling at the breath receiving it with friendliness

120
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:09,840
smiling is such a powerful tool imbuing awareness with mental

121
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:47,278
but what would happen what may shift or change

122
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,880
if you smiled physically smiled

123
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:01,360
imbuing your perception

124
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,840
the knowing

125
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:18,559
with the friendliness of a smile please try it and if you

126
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:26,080
are hesitant or feel ridiculous try it anyway experiment like a scientist see what

127
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:31,440
happens smiling

128
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:41,600
and whatever arises in the field of experience in this moment whatever it is

129
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:48,000
deceiving receiving them all

130
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:55,840
even if they're a crowd of sorrows ah receiving them with a smile

131
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:03,279
everything sensations body breath thoughts

132
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,000
sounds

133
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,840
emotions

134
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:35,200
it is hypothesize that smiling

135
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:43,120
is an over evolutionary way to offer safety

136
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:48,480
to offer safety and friendliness to signal that to others

137
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:54,799
can we signal that friendliness safety offer it to ourselves

138
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:59,919
to whatever arises this fear of

139
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,840
experience

140
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:56,000
and for the last moments of this practice period

141
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:06,720
holding with appreciation offering safety and care

142
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:17,119
to yourself for having practiced for having showed up

143
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:25,119
even if there was connecting with the practice the practice for one second

144
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:32,960
knowing that you are planting seeds by continuing to show up

145
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:40,160
as best as you're able to so appreciating appreciating this being

146
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:47,359
that is me for showing up and practicing whatever arose

147
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:52,400
or did not arise it's all okay

148
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:59,839
offering safety goodwill and appreciation

149
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:10,640
may all beings be safe may all beings be

150
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:13,839
free

any motion or or tightening um that was that was graded

161
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:41,920
that was that was created in this friendly way with this smiling uh smiling awareness

162
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:49,359
offering safe it actually it released much more easily or quickly just

163
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:54,640

00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:44,720
i think one thing i'm noticing is i guess this baby pertains more to

171
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:50,800
strong emotions for me right now but saying like not now

172
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,880
versus like pushing away or like denying or not feeling the emotion and

173
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:02,720
noticing how i i think a lot of times my version of

174
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:09,839
engaging with the emotion is really like falling into it that empathetic distress

175
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:15,040
and so this like way that it it can actually be okay

176
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:20,720
notice like oh angers here but i'm like you know what i really want to

177
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:30,079
practice meta right now and feel good because i really need it so just like okay not now

178
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:35,280
and i think maybe it's because there's some

179
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:42,079
not kindness towards the anger i'm not sure like hopefully but that maybe makes it possible um

180
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:49,119
so it's kind of like what i've been working with i guess or i noticed today

181
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:57,040
great thanks for sharing that lisa yeah oh brilliant i love how you describe

182
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:02,400
that how you've noticed sometimes in the past falling into falling into difficult

183
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,839
emotions and uh kind of his empathetic distress

184
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:16,160
and here now there being this this wisdom in deciding actually hello visitor anger um

185
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:21,599
i could practice with you i could you know with rain or let you move through the body but right now

186
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:27,599
actually it's wise and i'm going to say not now later right now i'm going to choose to do this

187
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:32,640
because i i want to resource myself i want a resource and i'm kind of

188
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:38,960
tired right now and not visa so brilliant beautiful use of wisdom to know when

189
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:45,520
it's when it's appropriate uh for for challenging emotions for not to

190
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:50,560
arise to say no and and also that's something we discussed this

191
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:56,960
this week and the practice is the four skillful the four wise efforts to know to have

192
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:02,800
the skillfulness for on arisen or or arisen in this case where anger is

193
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:10,880
arisen is coming to to skillfully to say no no to let it to support it

194
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,920
to go away skillful and again what you're describing didn't

195
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,520
sound like aversion to me it wasn't like go away it was like not now i'm gonna come back later we'll work

196
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:27,119
later but now i'm giving myself to this practice brilliant brilliant thanks for sharing

197
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:32,400
that lisa love it nice

198
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:37,920
one reflection uh it has come through chat is easier to stay

199
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:43,040
focused while smiling great what a wonderful realization and please

200
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:50,960
know that that's always available to you if there's difficulty staying focused smile at whatever is

201
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:57,599
coming up it's so easy uh reflection from forest

202
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:04,480
when you said only this breath something in my heart felt really good i would remember that

203
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:10,400
oh lovely thanks for sharing that first only this breath right here

204
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:15,920
and abraham i see your hand whoops uh-oh i tried to ask you to unmute there you

205
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,160
go

206
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:28,800
yeah i'll click you click i'll click you click i i i clicked only once but i can hear

207
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:34,640
you now abraham lovely to hear you here you are hi nikki uh thoughts about the smile and

208
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:40,160
maybe this only works for um extroverts like myself maybe the introverts all know how to do this

209
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:46,240
already but i really resist somebody telling me to smile

210
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:53,280
and i find that if i smile in such a way that nobody can see it it

211
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:59,839
still feels like a really nice smile

212
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:07,200
so i get the benefit without feeling like i'm doing what other teachers telling me to do

213
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:22,960
[Laughter]

214
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:29,839
you crack me up i love how your you're smiling underneath oh you're smiling underneath

215
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:37,200
so i i'm absolutely delighted i have with detail my heart is joyous that the

216
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:45,200

i think the smiling helped this ah thank you for sharing that

226
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:51,760
thank you for sharing that holly that's yeah there's something um evolutionary

227
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:57,680
and biologic biologically about smiling which is about offering safety

228
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:05,280
and really can use this whichever way um works for you offer offering this um

229
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:13,200
to yourself as this the practice and elizabeth says i love the idea of secret smile abraham that's great

230
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:19,680
so so dear ones let's transition to

231
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:27,520
our practice in small groups and community and

232
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:34,720
the invitation is starting with 30 seconds of meta and if you choose to smile at each

233
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:40,319
other or or is it secretly smile that's your choice you can experiment with that and

234
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:47,280
see how that feels in in interactions in on the zoom thing um

235
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:53,760
and if not that's okay just but starting with 30 seconds of meta and then you can share as much or as

236
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:59,040
little as you wish in community this time is very precious as many of you

237
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:06,880
have spoken about the time to a practicing community so so i'm

238
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:12,480
going to in a moment open the rooms

239
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:18,960
and here we go they're open

240
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:24,560

245
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:04,240
it's uh amazes me uh you know when you're in your head and then someone else is talking about

246
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:10,560
their life and just even even seeing people actively listening to what you're saying it's it's one of

247
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:16,880
the most profound things so it's uh there's a lot of profound wisdom in these groups

way of practicing uh imbuing awareness with this kindness with with with

255
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:10,960
with metta with offering safety to what comes up internally as a way of

256
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:17,920
doing meta for ourselves holding ourselves with care offering

257
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:23,119

259
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:38,559

260
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:45,040
i think that the smiling helped um like calm me down

261
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:50,400
and i and my like anxious thoughts were less likely to

262
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:57,520
keep spiraling did that make sense absolutely yeah so i'll keep

263
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:06,720
experimenting and see if that's true yeah it's sounds like a great um
