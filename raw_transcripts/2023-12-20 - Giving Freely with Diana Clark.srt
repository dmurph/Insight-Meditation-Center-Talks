1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:08,240
so I I want to uh start my little talk tonight um sharing this little story

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:15,240
it's kind of like it's such a minor mundane thing but it ended up having a

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,960
big impact on me that even all these years later that I'm remembering so this is when I was a

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,000
retreatant at a retreat at our Retreat Center many of you know right there's a

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,239
retreat center associated with this this is the medit ation Center and then we have a residential Center in Santa Cruz

6
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:40,640
those of you don't know it's about an hour away hour south of here and I was

7
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:47,680
uh sitting in a retreat I have had had a lot of retreat practice I've had a lot of Retreats like you know I know the

8
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:54,320
things to pack and you know what to bring and I kind of like you know know how to get ready for retreat and I show

9
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,519
up and everything's fine for the first day and the second day and then the third I think it was the third day

10
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:06,960
I ran out of dental floss it's such a mundane thing right

11
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,880
but it's easy to do right it's hard to know how much is left in those little uh you know those little containers of

12
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:20,640
dental floss so at um IRC uh they have what they call the yogi

13
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,920
needs closet Yogi is a generic term for a retreatant and this is a place for if

14
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:33,280
you forget something because once you're in the retreat you're in the retreat you're not where you're in silence and

15
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,680
you don't come and go so it's not like you could pop over to the drugstore or grocery store to get something that just

16
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:47,360
doesn't happen so I went to this closet think like okay I hope they have dental flaws

17
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,360
and I looked in there and I was

18
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:58,960
amazed anything that you might need while on retreat was there freely

19
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:05,399
offered tons of dental floss toothbrushes toothpaste Combs they have

20
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,800
a shampoo and soap and conditioner and all the showers they had I made a little list

21
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:17,599
kind of remind me aspirin uterine cough drops tampons like anything you might

22
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:23,599
need just lots and lots of it it's just you just go to the closet and take what

23
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:30,720
you need you don't ask for it you don't tell anybody you just take what you need it's just freely offered

24
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,360
and I remember just feeling like so touched by this like I don't know I felt

25
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,840
like wow this is like some real generosity but also with generosity was

26
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,959
the sense of respect like people like to have these things when they're on retreat but also

27
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:53,840
this respect this idea that um I'm not going to steal everything and then go sell it on the black market and make a

28
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,040
profit or you know something like this or you know do something nefarious with

29
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,840
it or tamper with things in there it was just this closet that you opened up and

30
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:10,120
this there was these shelves and drawers of like just everything you can imagine

31
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,159
that you might need and just the imagination of somebody who took the

32
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:20,799
time to think like okay what might be needed tweezers okay we'll make sure there's some tweezers there that people

33
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:25,959
can borrow and you know hair dryers you like all this kind of

34
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:32,439
stuff so this this uh I immediately felt touched by the generosity but

35
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:39,000
interestingly it made me feel like oh I want to be generous I want other

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,640
people to have this experience this recognition of feeling cared for feeling

37
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:52,840
respected feeling like okay yeah you can be on Retreat and you know have this

38
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:59,239
sense of Simplicity like our lives on Retreat are very simple but it doesn't mean that we

39
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:07,280
don't take care of ourselves in some kind of way so I just there was a little Donna

40
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,720
box so I gave some donations right and it just it touched me I felt like

41
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,120
there's this way that all these things were provided to support my practice

42
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,720
like not my shopping practice but my Dharma practice right to spend the time

43
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,320
there on retreat in a way that would be fruitful and helpful instead of Fring

44
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,560
about not having something that I wanted

45
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,600
so IRC and IMC so this location and uh

46
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:48,039
our location in Santa Cruz they are built on this whole notion of a field of

47
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:54,360
generosity everything here and there is offered

48
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,560
freely what a beautiful thing even though I knew that and I had practiced

49
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:06,039
and this to be the recipient of it and with this dental floss right was a little bit of a different way like oh

50
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:13,360
yeah this is what it feels like to just be able to accept what's being offered

51
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:20,199
freely and so there's this way in which this community here it's not based on

52
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:28,759
Greed it's not based on having to get something or shaming or fear of stinginess or anything like that instead

53
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:36,160
this meditation Central Retreat Center is really offered with open hands with this recognition of the power

54
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,199
of uh different way a different economy economy that comes out of our

55
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:49,800
heart out of appreciation out of a wish oh yeah this is fantastic I want to help make this

56
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:56,319
grow and continue I want to help build this different way of being in the world

57
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:03,680
that others can be and some of you may know that this old notion of

58
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,039
generosity in the Buddhist tradition it's kind of related to this idea of

59
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:17,800
giving freely that is like this way of giving without expecting anything in

60
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,880
return not because we're supposed to not because we feel obliged or we feel a

61
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:30,280
little bit of peer pressure or we feel like uh well it's the tradition I have to you know none of that

62
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:35,919
but out of goodwi out of just wishing others to

63
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:44,680
have benefit maybe out of compassion wishing others to have a diminishment of not the

64
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:50,319
suffering of not being able to floss one's teeth regularly I know I'm going odd and on

65
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,440
about this but there's you know it's to the profound and to the very very

66
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:01,319
mundane so just this wish for the sense of well-being for for somebody

67
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:09,360
else so this idea of like giving freely also means without this concern or this

68
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,360
fear because often when we hear this word generosity kind of like brace

69
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:22,080
ourselves ready for the ask like okay there's going to be this talk about generosity that often there's like so

70
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,560
please give but that's not kind of like the Buddhist way the Buddhist way is just

71
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:33,080
like you know just uh to give if you feel inspired if it supports your

72
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:39,360
practice if you feel you like you want to contribute to the well-being of

73
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:48,280
others and the well-being of yourself I'll talk a little bit more about that then to then to

74
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:55,840
offer offer what makes sense to you what feels like you can offer whether that's

75
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:04,800
time love recognition mind money skills whatever it might

76
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,440
be because there's this way in which often um it's a little bit awkward for

77
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:16,440
teachers to give a talk on generosity but I thought I would because this time of year is when there's a lot of gift

78
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:22,080
exchange not everybody participates in that but there is and so sometime maybe

79
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,680
we are uh operating doing a lot of generosity and I want to talk a little

80
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,800
bit more about it but there's this way when we start to hear about generosity

81
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:38,959
not only are we afraid that there's going to be an ask but we're often

82
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:44,680
afraid of like feeling cornered like like something's expected from

83
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:50,000
us I don't myself don't like that I don't like when there's a certain

84
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,480
expectation so there's this way in which you often like shy away from these type

85
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:03,240
of talk talk about generosity or maybe we even um have these there's this kind

86
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:12,680
of like this cultural um or societal um attitude sometimes like oh I

87
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:20,399
should be more generous we have that feeling maybe or that idea nobody likes this sense of

88
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,720
like oh I should be something that's another reason like we might not like

89
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:31,079
this idea of generosity and maybe there's this sense of like oh if I if

90
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:37,720
I'm start being generous then it's never going to end we all have this experience you donate to one organization and then

91
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:43,200
forever more you were on their mailing list and uh decades later you are still

92
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:53,079
getting requests for more money so right there's this way in which we might really shy away from this uh whole

93
00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:00,560
topic but one thing I want to talk about is is this build on this idea of things

94
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,519
that are freely given is to recognize that sometimes we

95
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:12,959
can view this idea of the notion of generosity as kind of like a

96
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:18,560
transaction maybe like a business action you're like a fee for service type of

97
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,800
thing or fee for getting an object or something like

98
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:33,360
this but the practice here like this Buddhist idea of generosity is to

99
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,320
explore for yourself your own

100
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:49,240
experience what is it like to give with no expectation of any

101
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:55,639
return what is it like to have like a different relationship to there's to

102
00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:01,920
kind of remove that idea of generosity and there's just lots of ways you could

103
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,920
practice this if you felt like you wanted to take this on as a practice there's a number of

104
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,760
organizations that help individuals or communities that need help and so maybe

105
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:21,440
there's a way you could give time service money to those organizations who maybe are helping

106
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,680
others and most likely you will not be the beneficiary of what happens to those

107
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:32,519
other other individuals that are being supported by these

108
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:41,480
organizations soup kitchens places that support environmental efforts or supporting um

109
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,519
like in kind of more impoverished uh communities and with

110
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:52,040
agricultural or farm animals or you know these types of things what is it like to

111
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:57,560
just give for the sake of giving even if you weren't don't get a

112
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:03,680
tax benefit from it or nothing happens because this is tied into that

113
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:11,480
recognition that of course the actions that we do affects our mind and heart of

114
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,560
course it does like how could it not our bodies and minds and hearts and spirit

115
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:22,360
all this kind of stuff are um connected like we're just one being we're not like

116
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,760
these disconnected parts so there's this way in which this

117
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:35,199
kind like this movement of generosity is a way in which there's a

118
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:41,399
can be this sense of abundance actually in that moment when we're

119
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:47,279
giving there's this feeling of maybe even wealth like oh here here this is

120
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:53,760
here I'm offering this this is something that I can give freely and in that

121
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:59,360
moment there's this feel there is not a feeling of lack where there is not not a

122
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:06,240
feeling of insufficiency if so then that's a little bit different than the generosity I'm

123
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:12,519
pointing to I'm pointing to that which is giving freely and the Buddha pointed to this as

124
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:18,040
well it's was part of his um teachings that he often gave to people in the very

125
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:23,160
beginning when of their practice is just this movement of the

126
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:31,720
heart is to kind of like let go this movement of okay to give freely what one

127
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:39,240
can so in the same way when we have this feeling of abundance again maybe like a

128
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,959
mundane example is if we have a garden that's making like way too many

129
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:51,839
zucchini then with like just giving zucchini to all our neighbors or tomatoes or oranges on the tree or

130
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:57,240
lemons or something like this you know here in California we have plenty of us have Gardens and trees that have this

131
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:03,320
and I've been the recipient of many things for many people's Gardens and was just natural like oh here I have all of

132
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,959
this here take some lots of times people bring things here to IMC and leave them

133
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:14,880
just for whomever would like so in the same way when there's a

134
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,639
sense of abundance it's easy to be generous it's fascinating it works the

135
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:26,880
other way around also being generous gives a sense of

136
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:33,720
abundance this turns out to be true for so many of these practices we tend to think it only works in One Direction

137
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,800
abundance generosity but it turns out there's a relationship and so it works

138
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,880
in the other direction too so this giving freely often at that

139
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:53,160
moment there's a moment of a uplift and a moment of feeling good and sense of

140
00:14:53,160 --> 00:15:00,639
well-being and maybe this sense of this wealth or having

141
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:07,120
enough there's also this way if when we're being generous we can pay attention

142
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:14,079
to like what is the experience like at that moment when the generosity maybe in

143
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:21,800
the moment when we think about it and then again when we're actually doing it there's this way that being generous

144
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:28,720
can like loosen up this tightness we have around this

145
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:37,680
self sense this sense of self it's kind of like a vague term can loosen up this

146
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:45,560
sense of like okay I'm there's a center here this substantial core to which

147
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,880
everything is happening and I have to protect it and

148
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:57,880
make it look good and uh bolster it up make it even look better than it I actually think it might be or something

149
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:06,079
like this we have this self that we're trying to really protect and polish and shine up and these types of

150
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:11,480
things but when we are being generous that's not

151
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:17,880
happening there's this way in which when there's this strong sense of self

152
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:24,279
there's then everything out there gets related to this so that's either mine or

153
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:29,759
not mine or um I like that or I don't

154
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,880
like that everything gets reflected you know has regarding this self but when

155
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:41,560
there's generosity there's a sense of oh here I it's just like

156
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:47,800
sharing and this kind of like this loosening up of this tightness this

157
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:54,040
constriction this ball that we often have the sense of in the center is the

158
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:59,399
way to more freedom because if we we to really look

159
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:05,760
at our lives all the difficulties all the anxiety the

160
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:12,558
restlessness the stress the suffering it's all related to this tight

161
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,959
little sense of self that uh we imagine is

162
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:25,520
there you can examine and see if that's true for yourself and so much about practice if

163
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:34,559
not ol of practice is about learning to see oh that self like what is

164
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:40,720
it where is it how is

165
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:48,160
it and you'll discover that it's actually not there it's just a it's a

166
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,480
sense that we have it's a notion that we have but you absolutely do not need to

167
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:58,760
take my word for it this is not a belief you need to adopt this is not I know

168
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:04,320
when I first heard these teachings I thought oh that's weird whatever I like these other teachings and so I'm just

169
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:11,600
going to be the person who likes these teachings but doesn't like that whole not self stuff that's perfectly fine you can put

170
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,760
it to the side I'm just kind of like dropping a seed and maybe an

171
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:22,000
encouragement to sometimes like kind of like look like oh where is that

172
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,080
self that's trying to look good feel

173
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:34,159
good be protected this can be a really powerful practice to sometimes just have this

174
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:39,960
gentle inquiry well where is it because we have this sense of self and there's

175
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:46,400
all these uh interactions that we think you're having relation to

176
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:52,880
this but actually what's happening is just a bunch of

177
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:59,320
experiences that's all turns out but you don't have to take my word

178
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:05,039
for it but generosity when when we're generous there's a less of a sense of me

179
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:10,159
and mine and there's less of a sense of uh

180
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:18,440
this self absorption self-centeredness that we often can fall into like we have to get enough or we

181
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,480
have to be enough somehow but instead when there's

182
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,880
generous there's generosity there's a sense of kindness a sense of

183
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:35,159
care for others maybe for ourselves maybe because we recognize oh that

184
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:43,480
little bit of Freedom that little bit of looseness that happens when we're being generous feels

185
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:49,039
good it's a can be like a uh a breath of fresh air

186
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:56,799
like it's a little bit of unburdening so but of

187
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:03,720
course we have to to pay attention right to how this generosity how we're practicing it right I'm pointing to the

188
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:09,320
generosity that is like freely given I have heard teachings that says

189
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:14,360
like if it doesn't hurt it's not real generosity I'm like oh that's not what

190
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:19,440
I'm pointing to here I'm pointing to the type of

191
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:25,679
generosity that's an uplift in the heart so much about practice can be

192
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:32,360
about this uplift in the heart that's needed just to make life flow a little bit

193
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:39,600
easier and when life flows a little bit easier then we can just naturally kind of do a certain amount of Letting Go

194
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,720
whether that's with physical objects or time there's a way in which it's just

195
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,440
easier to let go and this whole practice is about letting

196
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:57,159
go there's so many things that we're holding on to that we don't even know we're holding on to most of them Notions

197
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:04,120
or ideas or beliefs but this movement is all about letting go so of course generosity is

198
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:10,400
part of the practice but there's a way also that practicing generosity can be an

199
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:17,200
opportunity to learn a little bit about ourselves just to see like oh yeah how

200
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:23,919
does it feel for me when I'm being generous and is it easier or is it

201
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:29,559
different if to be generous with my time versus generous with

202
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:37,080
money like is money easy but I don't want people to take my time or maybe time is easy but I'm not going to give

203
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:43,679
money whatever it is is there something that we can learn about ourselves and maybe have a little bit of an inquiry

204
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,799
what are some of my beliefs about what's important what are some of my beliefs

205
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:54,919
about what's valuable and what's precious or what I um feel like I don't

206
00:21:54,919 --> 00:22:00,520
have enough of or what I what do I feel like I have too much of and can um

207
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:07,720
freely give away so this way in which the practice of generosity not only can allow this

208
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:15,000
uplift of the heart but it can help us maybe see a part of ourselves that we wouldn't see or be sensitive to unless

209
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,279
we were practicing

210
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:27,240
generosity so maybe there's some questions that we can ask ourselves when we're being

211
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:34,320
generous when asking some generosity as a way to support greater understanding as a way to support greater freedom and ease in

212
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:39,600
our life one question

213
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:46,640
is is what I'm doing appropriate or the best

214
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:53,520
way how to be generous at this moment for

215
00:22:53,520 --> 00:23:00,520
example maybe the question is like am do I am I aware of how let's see of what the most generous act might be or the

216
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:07,760
most appropriate an example is maybe there's a way in which um we

217
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:15,000
might be listening to somebody and we think okay this is a generous Act of my time my attention I'm going to listen to

218
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,080
them give them all my attention but then they are complaining and complaining and

219
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:26,320
complaining and complaining about a person a situation an institution right

220
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:33,799
there's no end to things that we can humans can complain about and then we start to notice as this complaining

221
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:39,000
continues this monologue they're getting a little bit more agitated or heated and

222
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:46,520
we're getting a little more agitated and heated so maybe being generous and just

223
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:51,440
listening to them is not the wisest thing to

224
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:59,520
do is there a way that we might realize oh that um there's a time in which we

225
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:07,480
maybe it's appropriate to interrupt in a way that's not rude that's respectful or

226
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:12,919
and this takes skill and is not easy to do but maybe there's a way we can think

227
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:20,760
oh it's so uncomfortable to say anything when somebody's complaining that we just then say well

228
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:26,360
I'm being generous I'm just going to listen to them I'll just say something that I

229
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:33,200
often do I I um will often change the subject not often I almost always change

230
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:40,080
the subject just to something completely different and often that's just

231
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:45,360
seamlessly we go a different direction and it turns out to be okay the skill is

232
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:54,080
finding what subject can seamlessly be used that seems like you know appropriate for that way and and uh

233
00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:01,240
is not you know disrespectful for that person for me how I often I find that I try to

234
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:07,520
just like open up any ideas I try not to like find an idea I try to open up and

235
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:13,440
just relax and then often an idea comes up oh yeah and then I find a way in

236
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,480
which to of like direct the conversation another way with maybe it's my body

237
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:24,000
language too sometimes doing you know maybe not maybe not as obvious as

238
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:33,360
looking at one's watch but shifting one's uh body posture and you know people often can read uh

239
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:39,679
the bodily language that we're doing so I just offer that is maybe that's one way in which what we think is being

240
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,760
generous turns out not to be helpful for either them or for

241
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:53,559
us and so another question we might ask when we are being generous is just to tune into how does it

242
00:25:53,559 --> 00:26:00,039
feel being generous in the body and the mind like literally really is there a

243
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:08,360
sense of openness in the heart in the chest is there a sense of in the belly

244
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:15,120
maybe there's a little bit of relaxation or warmth maybe there's a little bit of

245
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,640
lightness maybe it doesn't feel quite as heavy like the shoulders somehow feel a

246
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:26,399
little bit less like the load they're carrying is less and somehow or maybe

247
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:31,919
there's this non sentimental loving kindness this real

248
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,760
well-wishing this sense of warmth and kind of Radiance like may you be happy

249
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:43,279
like may this my Act of generosity support you and your practice and your

250
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:47,720
life and your family and others that you

251
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:54,080
meet or maybe is there this feeling of

252
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:00,840
depletion or a sense of weakness like okay I have to give this because it's expected or fear like oh what's going to

253
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:07,320
happen what are they going to think if I don't give and then you know that's kind of like more of a tightness or a

254
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:14,080
constriction or maybe we have a feeling of anger or confusion or maybe there's a

255
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:19,200
way in which it just doesn't quite feel

256
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,520
right I would say kind of like the Buddhist generosity is to be giving

257
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:30,440
freely in a way that there's a sense of open and uplift that's accompanied but

258
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:37,960
often it's subtle and so we might have to like just tune into the bodily

259
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:45,399
experience and so when we're being generous from this act of generosity another question we could ask ourselves

260
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:53,399
is like what's happening in the mind we talked about feeling in the body and in the mind what are the beliefs what are

261
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:59,799
the views what are the thought patterns the stories that are accomp happing

262
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:05,240
this do we have can we recognize that when we have

263
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:10,880
these Wishful thoughts in relation to be generosity for example we might have

264
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:18,440
this idea well in exchange for this kind of expecting you know X Y and Z I'm

265
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:23,760
expecting that you'll do this or that you'll stop doing that or you know that you

266
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:30,760
will understand the message that's underlying this gift that I'm giving or something like that so what are some of

267
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:36,080
the thoughts that we have or maybe we have this

268
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:42,000
um feeling like okay I'm being generous but you know I'm really doing this

269
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,480
hesitantly because I have this fear that then you'll just start asking me for

270
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:53,600
more and more and more and you know you'll deplete me and I'll have to say no and that feels uncomfortable so I

271
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:59,399
don't even want to be in that situation so I'm not even going to give in the first place

272
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:06,120
right these are all human things that we experience but what can we learn about

273
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:12,200
ourselves and what are some of the stories or beliefs or views that we've inherited from our family from our

274
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:20,120
culture our society or experiences that we've had and some of them maybe are wise and

275
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:25,720
supportive and maybe some of them aren't maybe some of them are obstacles for our

276
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:33,799
to be able to give freely so this idea of generosity how it's such

277
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:41,600
can be such an important part of practice and I also wanted kind of like name some of the ways in which this can

278
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:48,559
be an awkward topic to talk about how kind of like there's a in our society there's

279
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:54,799
often a um hesitation around to talk about it or even to be

280
00:29:54,799 --> 00:30:02,320
generous I read an article about about recently how um more and more there's

281
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:09,880
when you do a transaction at a restaurant or a store something like I guess mostly at restaurants or eating

282
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:16,240
establishments there's this uh way would you like to leave a tip or like the tip is already put in I've seen this too at

283
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:22,559
a place that I've sometimes go like they already put in the tip and then you have to make an extra effort if you want to

284
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:27,840
change if you want less or more or none so like so some people are less and

285
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:35,159
less generous because they're starting to feel like yeah this is being expected of me so now that I'm expected I don't

286
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:40,279
want to do it so what are some of the thoughts that we have when we're being

287
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:46,320
generous and can we be kind to ourselves when we discover oh yeah maybe I do feel

288
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:55,000
stingy in these areas and but not in that area I think just understanding

289
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,440
ourselves is the beginning of maybe finding more freedom if we

290
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,960
don't recognize this about ourselves then we just go on following our patterns and maybe there's a way in

291
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:14,600
which we can stretch ourselves or honor ourselves in a way that feels uh a way

292
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:20,000
to support our practice support a sense of well-being support a sense of

293
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:28,039
abundance so generosity it's one of the Buddhist practices a key practice and might be

294
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:35,519
happening a lot this time of year so with that I'll open it up for

295
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:41,480
some questions or comments anybody have something they'd

296
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:47,200
like to say we would like for you to

297
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:57,720
use I like to think of Taylor Swift singing That's Rox star seem like

298
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:03,399
this you can't see them into the top into the top of okay thank you well but

299
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:09,399
when I go to Starbucks they want a tip I mean it's always the choice and they make so much money I don't feel any

300
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:15,639
obligation to and how often I go to Starbucks it's a lot I don't feel obligated I mean I do and I don't I feel

301
00:32:15,639 --> 00:32:21,679
a little guilty if I don't leave a tip at the same time they're rolling in dough why should I tip them it doesn't

302
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:27,120
go to the server if it went to the server that would be okay but we don't know where it goes so and you're ask

303
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:34,000
give me this question sure anybody who' like to answer no I think the question is just for you to say oh yeah I don't

304
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,519
this makes me feel uncomfortable oh it does okay that's you are makes you feel

305
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:46,799
uncomfortable but what I like to do is if I see somebody sitting alone I ask if if I could join them because that that

306
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:53,039
really makes me feel good and they feel good as well they and they're surprised

307
00:32:53,039 --> 00:33:00,519
because these days whenever I go to a coffee place or restaurant well casual restaurant people are

308
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:06,559
sitting alone and it well I don't feel obligated I just

309
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:13,080
want to to chat with them and sometimes they say no thank you so that's okay or they're reading a book I interrupt them

310
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:18,600
when they want to talk you just don't know but that kind of generosity I really

311
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:24,159
like it's nice that you ask and you let them say yes or no yeah right okay and

312
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:30,399
it's not an insult if if that's okay you maybe they you know for whatever reason that's why we don't know why the people

313
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:36,600
are there so very nice I like this I didn't ask a question I just told you something so that's all right it's all

314
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:44,480
right sorry thank you Janet anybody else have a comment or

315
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,679
question I just I could just give you the mic

316
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:57,600
please because then people can hear online thank you so much I just did a quick search do

317
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:03,360
Starbucks tips go to employees and the answer I got was yes the answer is yes

318
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:09,760
yes but it's in it's well i' rather give them a dollar bill rather feel

319
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:18,358
free but they're saying that they get a fluffy increase in their paychecks based on the tips oh okay so that was just one

320
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:24,040
quick search well no that's interesting to know because I kind of assume because I'm tapping on the little machine there

321
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:29,200
that it's who knows where it's going that's good to know but I still think

322
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:35,520
I'd rather to give them cash so yeah but this idea of like giving freely so free

323
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:41,919
you know not because it's demanded of us or we're feeling coerced or uh you know

324
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:48,320
or the expectations and just to feel like okay well how does it feel when you're being

325
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:56,560
like giving freely I think that's a a way that we can fold this into just this recognition

326
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:02,640
that you know the our actions the way that we're showing up in the world of course it affects our inner life how we

327
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,839
feel and what's going on in our hearts and

328
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:13,359
Minds does anybody else have a comment

329
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:21,079
or um I remember first learning that at IRC that the Retreats were offered on a

330
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:27,400
donation basis and I thought oh my gosh H how is that going to work and I

331
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:35,240
remember hearing that people said to Gil oh you know that might work in Southeast Asia but it's not going to work here and

332
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:40,240
somehow it does and somehow it does that's

333
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:46,880
right it's quite something it's a beautiful thing and there's uh more and more Retreat centers that have been

334
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:54,359
inspired by IRC they're trying to shift to uh Donna to all donation based so

335
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:58,799
yeah we'll see hopefully it'll work it'll be

336
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,119
aous oh Kevin you Marth as soon as you put it down

337
