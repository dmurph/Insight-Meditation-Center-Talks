5
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,000
right some of you know the words awesome

6
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,879
tell people there's some more front yeah sure yeah if anybody wants to come

7
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,719
forward they got room up front

8
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,680
and and there are also uh kind of these cushions out out just outside the room

9
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,640
if people wanted to grab

10
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:12,080
those well I hope everyone experienced that sit as I did as very quiet that was

11
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,680
a very quiet sit uh I think it was partially partially the carpet partially

12
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:24,720
the carpet uh it's partially all of all of you we're all contributing to silence

13
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,119
together which is rather amazing to have this many people in a room together for half an hour

14
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:36,159
and basically just be quiet together it's a really unique way that humans

15
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,759
don't usually uh we don't usually interact in this way and I mean I'm not

16
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:49,040
super woowoo just because I have the the robes but uh I there is you know coming into a

17
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:56,000
place where this place this hall has been used for meditation and had great

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,479
bicku great monk teachers great nun teachers great lay teachers come and and teach in here with all sorts of people

19
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:11,520
meditating for 25 years or since 2002 2002 okay so this is a great space and

20
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:19,920
uh I feel really uh happy to be here with everyone uh my name is Ajang Kovilo and I

21
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,239
ordained at a monastery in north of Yukaya uh called Abayiri and I'm

22
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:34,360
currently starting a monastery uh I became a monk in 200 well came to the monastery in 2006

23
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:40,080
and I've been a monk since 2010 and currently starting a monastery with my

24
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:46,400
monk brother Ajaniso up in Seattle it's called Clear Mountain Monastery and

25
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,599
usually we're meditating in a gym gy gym

26
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,519
and uh we call it the triple gym because we're Buddhists and uh it has a disco

27
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:04,080
ball and hardwood floors and yeah it's rarely it's it's never been this this

28
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:11,280
quiet uh up there um but yeah my mom actually lives just

29
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,040
uh you know 10 15 minutes down the road in uh Minlo Park so I come to visit her

30
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:24,560
from time to time and I'm very happy to be making this connection with IMC because I secretly want to convert my

31
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,440
mom to Buddhism and even if she wasn't Buddhist I want her to meditate and this is just

32
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,720
such a great kind of this is a great place this is like her she's not

33
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:43,920
Buddhist but this is this would be her Buddhism um basically a group of people who are just curious who want to find

34
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,879
inner peace and want to learn specific strategies for settling the mind

35
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:55,360
so she's come here actually for uh a couple of different events and uh I

36
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:02,720
think it's not going to be too long it's not going to be too long before I've got her coming on the regular maybe

37
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:09,760
um but tonight I actually wanted to talk about um SA this SA gem the SA jewel the

38
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,439
SA as refuge and it's a little bit interesting

39
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:22,960
to talk about in the west I mean you talk about the Buddha as an archetype of these three uh these three gyms these

40
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,800
three refuges the Buddha he was a historical figure satarta Gota he uh

41
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,040
attained enlightenment 2600 or so years ago is you know what we uh believe and

42
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:41,600
there's lots of history to to back that up uh and budau what we were reciting is

43
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:48,240
just the principle of wakefulness of being awake so as we recite that just reminding ourselves that we're not here

44
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,520
to fall asleep our eyes are closed but really are trying to stay awake actually

45
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,840
in a way which is balanced in a way which isn't biased towards chasing after the things we like

46
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,919
and running away for the things we don't like so just wakefulness with balance is is the Buddha is the archetype of the

47
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,840
Buddha is the principle of the Buddha is the mantra of Buddha and Dharma his teachings basically the truth the way

48
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:18,720
things are these are very easy for modern Americans to kind of get behind

49
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,120
why not be awake with compassion why not see the truth it seems like all good

50
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:31,600
things but then you get to the SA and you got people dressed like me And

51
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,639
you know it's something that most of us didn't grow up with and it can seem a bit foreign it can seem very

52
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:45,680
institutional um one of the monks in our tradition uh so all of the monks at the monastery

53
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:52,240
where I ordained were born in America none of them had Buddhist families and

54
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:58,479
were all basically convert Buddhists and um one of the fathers of one of the

55
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:05,680
monks you know is kind of lamenting he's very you know secular person he's kind of lamenting to his monk's son he's like

56
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,080
I can't believe maybe atheists grew up atheist and the father is lamenting he's saying I can't believe you would go and

57
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:19,400
join an organized religion and this monk says "Actually we're not that

58
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,560
organized." So there is this tension and you see somebody wearing a costume like this and

59
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,600
and you think I don't want it you know I've seen Wild Wild Country or whatever

60
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,120
that documentary about Osho is and you think I don't know if I can get within

61
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,360
you know foot you know arms reach of uh somebody in robes like this but yeah I

62
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,440
just thought to uh talk about different types of SA so um roughly speaking I'll

63
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:54,720
talk about four types of SA and then really honing into the latter two so

64
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:02,479
roughly speaking you have the word sa uh s n s a n with a dot over it technically

65
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,919
g h a sa it can just mean a group so you have places in the polycanon which is

66
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:14,639
the teaching basically the Buddhist cannon where you see a group of a mega

67
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:21,759
sunga which is a group of deer or a kaka sunga which is a group of crows so here

68
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:27,440
it's just any group of beings you have a dva sunga that's just a group of

69
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:33,199
celestial beings so that's just the most basic level of of sa just a group of

70
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:40,400
people the second type of sunga is what is really just uh a beautiful aspect

71
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:49,039
mostly of IMC or of spirit rock or of IMS berry center uh is the lay sa so you

72
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:54,800
have a group of people many of whom might not even call themselves Buddhist but all of whom are really looking for

73
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:01,680
peace looking for ways to train the mind and bring some sense of yeah stillness

74
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,520
and solidity into their into their hearts and it really is beautiful i mean

75
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,960
uh I Gil I was kind of in between monasteries before I had actually

76
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:19,039
ordained and I Gil didn't know me from anybody else and IMC already existed and

77
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:25,120
I just found out the Gil's email address or emailed the group email address here

78
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,879
and said I'm kind of struggling uh do I go the path of a monastic or do I stay

79
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:39,200
the path of like a lay Buddhist because I was really committed by that time to a life of meditation and virtue and didn't

80
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:46,320
know me never met me but within 3 days he said "Yeah let's go for a walk." And he makes the time to meet me here and I

81
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,480
think I volunteered to paint a door and I painted that door out there i don't know if it's still uh Don't don't look

82
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,760
too closely uh I didn't I don't know if Well a job I did but uh took the time

83
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,120
and basically walked around the block a couple times and yeah great teacher lay

84
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:12,160
teachers in America are many of them are fabulous um and so this is a lelay sa and but

85
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:18,000
using the word sa in this context of a specifically le sa is somewhat of a

86
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,800
western usage so you go to Thailand you go to Burma you go to Sri Lanka which are the main uh countries of Terravada

87
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:32,040
Buddhism which is roughly the Buddhism of of IMC and Spirit Rock and the tradition I came from a Thai a Thai

88
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:40,000
tradition um and SA is just reserved for the monastic SA so bikus and beunis

89
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,480
people who are uh largely robed in different forms and who've taken on a certain number of precepts that they're

90
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,240
living with for a certain period of time so here in America we've got this lay

91
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:58,880
sana and it really is such a such a support and there are uh groups uh yeah

92
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:06,080
some monastic orders who really take exception to that use of sa and say that the word sa really should just refer to

93
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,640
a monastic sa uh it's inappropriate to use SA with within a lay

94
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:18,560
context but if you've got a a SA of davas a sa of celestial beings a sa of

95
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,240
yeah just any any group I feel it's a very valid use of of the word especially

96
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,560
when in a place like America you don't have that many monastics where you know

97
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:37,200
hopefully not whatever the opposite of an endangered species is whenever the species is like you

98
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,200
growing and taking over um hopefully that's what the SA is um but yeah you've

99
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,959
got this Lelay SA so that's the second type of SA and I'm so happy for all of you who live near here and can come here

100
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:55,120
on a regular basis if this is your first time would encourage you to come back because there's a lot of great teachers

101
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:02,079
who who share the Dharma here and the third type of SA is the monastic SA um

102
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:08,800
the SA of Bikuz who are ordained monks and Bikunis ordained nuns uh who've

103
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,880
dawned what's called dawned the ochre robe and really dedicated their life to

104
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:22,079
keeping certain precepts and really keep our emblematic we're basically flags we

105
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:29,600
are flags for Buddhism we we're always wearing these robes i wear these robes to bed i sleep in some of these robes

106
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,279
and uh we're wearing them all the time we don't take them off when we want to go and break some precepts we're you

107
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:40,880
know keeping them keeping them all the time wearing them all the time and uh

108
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:47,440
it's our lives and we have to a large part in our early years in robes we're just figuring out how to wear the robes

109
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:55,920
and it's it's a good reminder uh because they're not easy this rectangle this outer rectangle is about 9 ft wide by 6

110
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:03,120
feet tall and we just basically roll ourselves up like a soft shell taco and

111
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:10,000
it's not so convenient it's not convenient you're walking around and you have to be mindful it's a it's forced

112
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,079
mindfulness is this roll the roll will often times fall off so you're having to

113
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:21,279
constantly keep some level of bodily mindfulness and really in our tradition

114
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:27,639
the ajanch cha tradition of Thai Buddhism uh really

115
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:33,360
meditation gone to the body meditation which is yolked to the body mindfulness

116
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:41,000
which fills the whole body is really kind of the foundation of our practice and that is inclusive of breath

117
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,600
meditation so we're a symbol the ordained SA for however length of time

118
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,600
in some Buddhist countries like Sri Lanka it is most monks do ordain for

119
00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:00,639
life so uh yeah that's a big commitment in Thailand much less so most monks who

120
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:07,440
ordain in Thailand will disrobe it's almost always a temporary ordination uh

121
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:14,720
the tradition in Thailand so up until maybe 15 or 20 years ago uh it was a

122
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,240
practice for males in Thailand to ordain for some period of 3 months so the

123
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:26,639
majority of Thai men would ordain probably 70 plus% of Thai males have

124
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:32,079
spent some time in robes in a traditional period of time would be three months but that could even be

125
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:37,279
these days it's a lot less you do have people ordaining for a weekend it's lame

126
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:42,320
if there are any Thai people watching it's lame three months it's a good It's a

127
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:49,120
good period to really just figure spend that first month just figuring out how to wear the robe you know um but we do

128
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:57,519
have aside from the robes uh we have all these rules that we're keeping and largely uh it is uh variations and

129
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:04,000
extensions and expansions from what are called the eight precepts so in Buddhism for anyone who doesn't know uh basically

130
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,920
the foundation of Buddhist morality for anyone for someone who's um yeah just

131
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:16,240
curious to take on another level of ethical training and harmlessness in their lives you got the five precepts

132
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:22,000
where which are a voluntary training you can say the this formula I undertake the

133
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,240
precept to refrain from taking the life of any living creature i undertake the precept to refrain from taking that

134
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:34,639
which has not been given i undertake the precept to refrain from sexual misconduct i undertake the precept to

135
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:40,959
refrain from lying i undertake the precept to refrain from consuming intoxicants intoxicating drinks and

136
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:48,360
drugs which lead to carelessness so those are the five precepts and they're a great foundation for an ethical

137
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,760
life but in Buddhist countries you will have people taking on three more these

138
00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:00,240
eight precepts which people will take them on lay people will take them on for short periods of time maybe one day a

139
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:07,680
week or a couple days a month when you just I'm going to up game I'm going to uplevel for this day maybe take on these

140
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:15,279
extra three and if these first three are moral or first five are moral precepts

141
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:20,800
especially those first four really do have a bearing on the degree to which

142
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:26,880
you bring harmlessness into the And the degree to which you're able to give this gift of harmlessness to the

143
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:32,959
people around you this flag that we wear is a symbol for harmlessness even if

144
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:39,760
people have no idea what we are they're not afraid of us the deer at a Bayer

145
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:46,399
they're not afraid of us by there for about almost 30 years now and every 6

146
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:52,880
years or so there'll be a noticeable closening of the deer population they just get closer and

147
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,680
closer at night time you can get within Yeah from me to Nick of you know uh

148
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:06,160
several deer you get that close the deer are just not afraid because they know it's a safe place there's no shooting

149
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:13,440
there's no violence so people take on these eight precepts the next three the renuncient ones are refraining from

150
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:20,079
eating afternoon seventh one is to refrain from uh beautifification and adorement

151
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:26,959
specifically from listening to music or playing music or bodily beautifification

152
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:34,480
and adorement and the last one is refraining from lying on a high or luxurious bed and most of the monk and

153
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:41,440
nuns rules are expansions of those so we have rules like uh monks do not eat

154
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,759
after noon so and we can't store food

155
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:53,600
afternoon and food has to be offered to us so if you were to invite us to your

156
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,199
house you wouldn't have to be afraid that we're going to go into your refrigerator and take all your food

157
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:06,720
because food actually has to be placed into a monk's hand uh or placed into our bowl for us to be able to eat it uh all

158
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,000
your food is safe around monastics

159
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:19,760
um and yeah this entertainment we consciously refrain from entertainment

160
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,839
when you come to a monastery in our tradition we have an active period of uh

161
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,880
seven years in particular where it's like a forced digital detox there's two

162
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:37,360
or three different levels of training when you come in first you live just as a normal leg guest everybody keeps the

163
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:44,559
eight precepts when they're visiting a monastery um and then after that you can request the white robes of a eight

164
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:51,520
preceptor and you're also wearing robes and you kind of at that phase you give up maybe you give up your devices you

165
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:57,200
give up your cell phone and any other device you might have then you take sa

166
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:04,000
after a year which is a novice ordination and then that's when we give up money so renuncience we don't use

167
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,480
money uh literally we don't have a dollar to our name even if we touch

168
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:17,360
money like if you were to try to if if we're going on alms around this happens most monks even though it is a rule most

169
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:24,320
monks and nuns around around the world actually do use money but the Ajan cha tradition very strict with this that we

170
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:31,360
don't even we don't touch money if you tried to touch money to us we'd be like and if we were on alms round and

171
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,720
you tried to put money in our If we were to move from that location

172
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:43,039
then it would be an offense so we actually very kindly say "Actually we can't take money and could you would you

173
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:48,240
be willing to uh take the money back?" And uh we can receive food so if you

174
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:55,200
wanted to make a food offering that's great and we can eat it today before noon um but we can't take money

175
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:06,160
uh so you take that novice precept and then after a year you take uh the monastic the full uh 227 or 311 rules of

176
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:12,720
a monastic and we give up entertainment and when you became become a monk you

177
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,000
give up your old email you're given a new email address and uh yeah basically

178
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,600
you don't have any device I myself didn't have a phone for eight years nine

179
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:29,679
years something like had uh only had my monastery email address and yeah you get

180
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:36,080
a taste and basically there's no cell signal at the monastery in general it's in a valley and couldn't get it if you

181
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,760
wanted it um so forced digital detox and it's great you just get a period of a

182
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:48,559
long period of away to just totally reset and see all the ways that we're pulled in different directions by by our

183
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:53,600
devices and all the notifications so refraining from entertainment from

184
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:59,200
beautifification and lying on a a high or luxurious sleeping place which is

185
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,400
defined as having you can have legs which are eight finger breaths high but

186
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:10,640
above that that's high and a little bit luxurious um and you might think what

187
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,679
what is the point of that what is the point of that um but it's fascinating i

188
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:21,200
mean I haven't I have slept on bit like visiting family my mom thinks it's super

189
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:27,360
weird if I don't if I lie on the floor so sometimes I'll I'll sleep on a bed when I'm at her place but honestly I

190
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:33,440
prefer the floor and it's it might seem weird and quickotic it might seem

191
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:40,559
strange like what is what kind of training is that it just seems arbitrary but it's it's a gateway into more

192
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:46,159
renunciation so you you start lying on just a you know you don't have to go to

193
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:52,000
just lying on a you know uh air mattress most of our huts at the monastery just

194
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,640
have an air mattress and the monks will sleep on that but you can have a you know a thick you can sleep on a mattress

195
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,080
on the ground and you just realize that you actually don't need a bed you don't

196
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:10,159
need a bed a bed takes up so much space in a room it's like all high and what do you even do under there it just collects

197
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:16,000
dust and you realize that you don't need it and things are simpler without it and

198
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,679
when you're used to just sleeping on the floor it's easier to go camping uh you know you can just there's all sorts of

199
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:27,840
benefits that are just knock-on effects that you wouldn't have guessed when you take on this this precept and just you

200
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:33,200
can experiment doing it for uh you know one day a week or one day a month just

201
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,960
today I'm not going to lie on a high bed going to put my mattress on the floor or

202
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,400
experiment not eating afternoon and that does take a while to uh get used to the

203
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:50,280
body but the body does get used to it i haven't eaten solid food afternoon

204
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:55,440
for almost 20 years and I'm doing okay

205
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:03,679
i'm doing okay i got a normal BMI um and yeah so just roughly speaking

206
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,880
these are the value of a renunciate sa and why I bring it up is because you do

207
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,000
have sa who come here monastic sa who come here ajan tenisero does she still

208
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,120
come on a yearly basis sanusa and does she come and teach

209
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:25,400
here maybe I think she has she

210
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:32,960
has I think she was in yeah she's got now she has uh there's two of our great

211
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,960
Bikuni sisters who have a a monastery in Sunnyville and also down in the Santa Cruz Mountains where you can go and

212
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:45,360
visit uh and there's lots of other monastics we have a we have a YouTube channel so after you know eight years of

213
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:52,400
that detox you know kind of somebody gave me a cell phone and then it all went downhill from then but uh but now

214
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:58,559
we have a YouTube channel but it's it's great um we interview great monastic teachers and song teachers we've

215
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:03,720
interviewed Gil um Shila Katherine Joseph Goldstein a lot of great

216
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:08,799
teachers we've got a Zoom group that we meet with um so this is just an

217
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:16,799
encouragement to find SA and if you don't have monastics in your neighborhood then drive down to the next

218
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:22,720
neighborhood and if you live in San Francisco then you can drive down here or if you live wherever you live uh it's

219
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:29,840
worth it's worth the drive to meet um people who are really trying to give their life to the Buddhist teachings in

220
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:35,919
a way which is is visible you know we we can't sneak around you know we

221
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:41,919
don't I don't have I don't own jeans anymore I don't own pants anymore people I couldn't go out and sneak around if I

222
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:48,000
wanted to um and so it really is and um yeah there

223
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,559
are different sas who hold the rules in different ways um but yeah if you can

224
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:59,840
find a sanga bus or bunis who really are keeping you can you can kind of get a

225
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:06,240
feel for someone when you live around them and this person seems like they've got a gravitas to them or they've got

226
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:14,159
yeah they're just living in a way which is a bit different it's a bit of a mirror for uh for our lives my mom um

227
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:19,279
yeah when I come to my mom's house we clean up cuz she's like I own so little

228
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:25,440
i own so little and she owns so much that she just looks at me and she wants to give things away so the last several

229
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:32,640
times I've come today I spent all morning if you see any dust on me it's because we've been cleaning up her bookshelf all morning and just giving

230
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:38,080
things away we take you know multiple boxes to the local thrift stores when I

231
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:44,880
come to visit and so it's just a a good encouragement to and why give away why

232
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:51,039
give away it's not just to deprive yourself but because there is a happiness there is a nikama suka a

233
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:58,640
happiness a joy which comes from renunciation from giving things up from being able to thrive with less the

234
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:05,679
Buddha talked about friends good friends three characteristics of a good friend is that they give what's hard to give

235
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:12,080
they're able to do what's hard to do and they're able to endure that which is hard to endure and you can make yourself

236
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,120
a good friend in those ways when you kind of Yeah just push yourself beyond

237
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:22,400
uh a little bit beyond what you think has to be your level of of comfort and

238
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,919
in Buddhism um you know some people think it's a negative religion ajan

239
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:34,880
Punadama one of our teachers in um in Canada he says people come to me and

240
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:42,720
they say that Buddhism all you talk about is suffering and he says no we also talk about sorrow lamentation pain

241
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:49,840
grief and despair what you got this whole spectrum of teachings um and that that is all true

242
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:56,720
and it is great to have people who don't hopefully are learning to not flinch from yeah the suffering and stress of

243
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:05,679
life but you can also conceive of the Buddhist path one of my favorite dharmapata verses says that if by

244
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:12,960
relinquishing renouncing getting rid of letting go of a lesser happiness a coarser happiness you're able to enter

245
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:20,240
into a more refined happiness a subtler happiness a higher happiness then the wise person will relinquish that lesser

246
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:25,279
happiness that more coarse happiness the happiness which might entail some level

247
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:30,640
of suffering to other people a harmful happiness then the wise person will let

248
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:38,720
go of that lesser happiness having their eyes set on the higher happiness so the whole path is one of letting go of more

249
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,400
and more ajancha our kind of grandfather teacher said when you let go a little

250
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:49,840
bit you get a little bit of peace and when you let go a lot then you get a lot

251
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:55,840
of peace and when you let go completely you get complete peace and that might be

252
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:02,080
a good transition to this fourth type of SA which is the true SA the Arya SA the

253
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:11,360
noble capital N noble capital SA the Arya SA and this is the SA the group of

254
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:18,640
not just monastics but lay monastic male female anyone who has

255
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,799
trained their heart to a level of true awakening to a

256
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:30,960
non backsliding state so in Buddhism we do talk about four levels of enlightenment stream entry once return

257
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:38,880
non- returnturn our huntship but it is starts off as a belief and then it becomes an experience

258
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:45,520
of actually being able to through meditation through stillness through practice to be able to permanently let

259
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,799
go of obstructive mental states to permanently let go of doubt about the

260
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:56,880
path and eventually what an arhant has done they someone who's fully enlightened they've fully let go fully

261
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:03,640
let go of greed anger and delusion the delusion which

262
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:10,720
um doesn't know how a human causes themselves suffering and how to let all

263
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:18,960
of that go so that's the delusion which in our hand has completely transcended they know completely how unhelpful

264
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,360
unhealthy craving leads to suffering and they've just totally dropped that

265
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:30,240
and yeah it is it starts off as a belief and it is part of what's called mundane

266
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,360
right view so transcendent right view is knowing the four noble truths that there

267
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:41,480
is suffering there's a cause there's a sessation and there's a path but transcendent right view is these much

268
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:47,200
more mundane um beliefs about the world so there are

269
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,559
10 of them that the Buddha lists specifically there is what is given what

270
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:59,600
is offered where is sacrificed that is there is benefit of generosity and yeah

271
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,640
that is that's a belief and all of you hopefully all of us have been gathering

272
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:11,760
evidence about the effectiveness of generosity when you give your heart grows and you've seen the generous

273
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:18,320
people in your life and you've seen that their hearts are bright you've seen that they're they tread lightly and the best

274
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:23,760
givers are really many of the best people that we know but it's a belief there is what's given what's offered

275
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,799
what's sacrificed there is fruit and result of good and bad action so this is

276
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:34,000
a belief about karma um that when you do

277
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,840
things which bring harm into the world then they'll you'll receive harmful results and when you act in a way which

278
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:45,760
is harmless is beneficial is um healthy for yourself then you'll receive

279
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:51,440
healthful results and there is mother and father so there is some kind of

280
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:58,880
relationship um yeah that is significant between ourselves and our our parents um

281
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:05,360
and there are there's this world there's the next world there are spontaneously risen beings i won't talk about that

282
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:11,200
right now um basically just suggesting that what we see isn't the

283
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:19,440
whole of the picture there are other realms in traditional Buddhism and that's a belief that um yeah there's

284
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,720
evidence for um but won't talk about that tonight don't worry and the final

285
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,000
one is that there are beings there are beings who through their own practice

286
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,320
have realized the path and teach it so it is possible and this is a belief and

287
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,679
this is a belief and if you've never thought about it then I'm going to say it right now and then you're going to

288
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:49,000
have to think about it and you're going to have to really come down on one side or the other of this because we're all

289
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:55,039
operating in different moments from different defaults is do you believe is

290
00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:00,399
it possible to abandon unh wholesome states and what the Buddha posits is

291
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:06,919
that it is possible to abandon unh wholesome mental states and it is possible to cultivate wholesome mental

292
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:13,000
states and that's a belief and when we're

293
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:20,399
depressed we just can't get ourselves to believe that it's impossible i'm totally dark my my heart is totally dark and

294
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:28,240
there's no way I'm just going to be like this till I die there's just depression has sunk my heart and there's no escape

295
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:34,640
whereas hopefully when we're able to get a bit above the water yeah it is possible to cultivate wholesome mental

296
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:41,919
states and it is possible to abandon unh wholesome mental states that's at the root of any wholesome habit of any

297
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:48,640
helpful habit that you take on and at the root of any unh wholesome habit unhealthy habit that you're giving up

298
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:54,799
and you take a it is a belief and would encourage anybody to Yeah it's just a

299
00:31:54,799 --> 00:32:01,600
nice belief it's a nice belief to have and the next belief is that there are beings it is possible to completely

300
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:08,640
transcend greed anger and delusion and that might be another step do you believe that there are humans who have

301
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:15,159
who just no longer have greed and anger coming up in their hearts

302
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:21,279
and most of us maybe have never met anybody who comes anywhere close to that

303
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:27,519
but the more you stay around centers like this the more you come to monasteries maybe the more you go to um

304
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:35,399
traditional Buddhist country where say like a place like Thailand you've got 300,000 monastics you got 30,000

305
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:41,200
monasteries and yeah I can't know I don't know totally the heart of other

306
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:47,159
people but I do feel like I've met beings who I've

307
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:52,640
met Yeah not just one um but I've met beings who I believe have actually

308
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:58,000
attained this level of the Arya SA who have completely transcended greed anger

309
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,279
and delusion and and that one it's a beautiful belief to have that a human

310
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:08,960
heart can transcend to that level if you hold the belief healthfully

311
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:14,799
you don't want to beat yourself up because we're not there yet we are where we are but just yeah maybe a human heart

312
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:20,320
can come to a place through training of the the mind training of the heart that

313
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:27,120
these mind states just no longer come up if you've ever given up smoking smoking or any other bad habit and if you've

314
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:32,880
done it for decades just the thought never comes up anymore and take that

315
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:39,840
principle to yeah hopefully if you've been meditating for a while the anger that you used to feel so chronically or

316
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:45,279
used to come up So with so much fire hopefully that just comes up less than

317
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:51,440
it did 5 years ago 10 years ago 15 years ago 20 years ago and just extend that

318
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,960
principle that maybe if I keep walking this path that I myself can become part

319
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,559
of this noble this noble sa and it's a it's a cool belief it's

320
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:08,000
not just a healthy and a happy it's a it's a it's a cool belief to have and

321
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,520
yeah hopefully I hope all of you get to meet someone who inspires the faith um

322
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:20,398
living closely with these people or just meeting them you might be able to see like a a radiance or even having met

323
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:27,280
people like this the image of you know in Christian iconography the image of a a halo it

324
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:33,839
just makes sense you meet people who seem to have like a a bright there's some kind of brightness to them or you

325
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:39,560
might there's one teacher who I do feel has this attainment um and it would be

326
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:44,800
like on multiple occasions I get within 20 ft of them and I might not even know

327
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:53,040
that they're you know 20 ft away and automatically like my heart just drops down into this deep place of of

328
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:59,920
mindfulness just knowing if it's a a meditation object like Buddh just buddo the Buddho kind of inner mantra just it

329
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:06,800
just goes on like you know motor hall and um yeah wow that's interesting I

330
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,839
wasn't like that you know 10 seconds ago um so yeah those are the four types of

331
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:19,040
sa and yeah all of us right now this is definitely we've gone beyond just being

332
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:25,800
a herd of deer or a group of crows we're all definitely in this um level of of

333
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:31,119
lea and And I totally encourage you just having community the value of community

334
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:37,920
especially these days when this uh you know pandemic or this pandemic of

335
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:44,880
isolation so many people are isolated finding a place like this where you can find community is great that third level

336
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:52,880
of monastic sa finding the monastics near you especially the inspiring ones and the uninspiring

337
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:59,119
ones I figure out how to deal with them as well um but the inspiring ones draw

338
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:05,680
close and then the noble sa yeah just just look for them and yeah

339
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:13,680
see if your heart can believe in something like that so we'll end the formal talk there and just open things

340
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:20,960
up for for questions we've got just 10 minutes i was hoping we'd have a bit more time than that but um if anybody

341
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:27,720
had any questions or things to to share um yeah please

342
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:36,200
hang on a second i'll bring a microphone thank you

343
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:43,119
it's kind of harder to stay put like initially there is excitement for example you joined in 2006 so you're

344
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:50,720
trying to be part of the practice there's initial excitement there is like a feeling that there's something great

345
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:56,800
going to happen there is some I'm just kidding like nirvana or like or there's

346
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:04,240
like a lot of people talk about lot of things you could achieve or something but what happens is after 2 three years

347
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:10,800
sometimes people how did you endure it because you you might feel you're not making enough progress you're not there

348
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:17,599
or what people are saying is not what you are experiencing and so on yeah you know it's a great it's a great question

349
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:23,280
and um yeah I think this is very common

350
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,880
there's a a phrase which comes up in the the canon about the dharma which says that the dharma the dharma the Buddhist

351
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:35,119
teachings are beautiful in the beginning beautiful in the middle and beautiful in the end and that's great and hopefully

352
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:42,160
you'll keep finding ways that the dharma is inspiring but I was reflecting a few days ago that the SA the SA starts off

353
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:47,839
sometimes if your if your heart is kind of open to it the SA starts off it's beautiful in the beginning you see these

354
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:54,880
monastics and they wear their robes slightly well and you know they know a lot of polywords and you go to a

355
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,359
monastery and everybody's bowing at the same time and it's it's inspiring beautiful in the beginning but then you live with these

356
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:07,119
guys and the smells and the all the other human the humanness of the sauna

357
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:12,480
so it's a little bit less than beautiful in the middle in the middle in the middle you don't know how long that's

358
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:18,400
going to last and many people do disrobe and part of our training and the Buddha laid this out is for your first 5 years

359
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,440
as a monk there's a principle in Christian monasticism called stability

360
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:29,359
you stay at the same monastery or you stay with your teacher for the first 5 years but after that you do you can move

361
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:37,680
around a bit more um but yeah hopefully um yeah you you realize that the SA we

362
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:43,040
are still human most of us the vast vast majority of us have not yet attained to

363
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:48,240
this level of the noble sa yeah we do act out of our greed anger

364
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:56,800
and delusion and those things they're ugly it's ugly whether it's a lay person a monk seeing greed and seeing anger is

365
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:03,920
ugly but it seems a little bit especially ugly if you see someone who's wearing this robe act out of that so you

366
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:10,960
come to a monastery it's easy to get uninspired but if you can stick through that and say they're a human and they're

367
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:18,160
going through whatever they're going through but the robe is still beautiful and us we bow we bow so much we bow so

368
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:23,200
much at a monastery and um yeah it's a good thing to be able to bow to the robe

369
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:30,160
to be be able to bow to the archetype um rather than the individual cuz individual the Buddha said himself like

370
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:37,200
you shouldn't place faith necessarily in any one teacher but

371
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,240
in the SA institution as a whole those beings who the possibility for

372
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:50,640
transcendence so if you can kind of separate mentally in your mind the robes the ideal of both

373
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:57,119
the monastic sa and the arry sa the noble sa in your mind then you can keep hopefully come back to a place where it

374
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:02,240
is beautiful in the end and yeah you can come back and they're

375
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:08,320
flawed humans um but they're still if they're sinc if they're sincere and

376
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:17,280
there are sincere monastics in the world and even if a whole monastery is a bunch of you know lazy and whatever monastics

377
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,960
there are still practicing bikus and bikunis who are practicing rightly in the world so coming back and finding

378
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:28,520
that beauty and yeah so yeah you're welcome yeah

379
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:34,160
please oh yeah fun I just wanted to respond can you

380
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:41,119
hear me I just wanted to respond to him that uh as a college instructor I just

381
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:47,720
trying to connect the situation question which he asked so I started semester with 150 students

382
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:55,839
right and right now I might have 100 or maybe 90 so not everybody graduates

383
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:01,920
right so same with um any I think if you compare this to monastics so many of

384
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:09,119
them might start but some of them will drop and it's okay they might come back later or maybe they won't come it's not

385
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:15,599
for them right yeah so just seeing that not trying to uh finding some perfection

386
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:21,280
in beings is the path that we all have flaws we all are learning and then one

387
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:27,119
day is different than another we might drop today come back tomorrow and maybe

388
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:34,000
day after or maybe never and that's a a lifelong journey and not only this life so many lifetimes we've been here

389
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,000
walking this path thank you Vana yeah and would just put a plug i mean we

390
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:48,560
really do have a vibrant SA we don't yet have land in Seattle but we do have a vibrant online SA um we have weekly Zoom

391
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:53,920
meetings every Sunday night we go through the Maji Minikaya the middle- length Discourses of the Buddha we're on

392
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,280
36 we're doing one a week so that's 152 sutas about 3 years we're on 36 and you

393
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:05,520
can start next week and it's great we've got a group of about 50 people who join every Sunday night and we put out a a

394
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:11,680
video at 5:00 p.m and you can watch and it kind of summarizes the suta and you get on and you know people like Vonda

395
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:19,359
and I are there and Wednesday evenings we also have a zoom session after an interview um so yeah just join and this

396
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:24,880
is fantastic how CM sa clear mountain sa is growing it's like I joined them I

397
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,160
think in 22 but then now we see so many and they don't even have a monastery yet

398
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:37,200
so it's just the power of the dharma and coming through those two beautiful monastics feel like everybody connects

399
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:43,920
with them that's what my personal feeling is and Deborah and the other people who are here we know them right

400
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:49,920
and I don't have any money so I didn't pay her to say that so she volunteered

401
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:56,079
thank you and this might be the last question but

402
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:02,440
uh thank you for an amazing talk it's always inspirational to see people who've uh renounced so much

403
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:10,520
um my question is I often find myself thinking about um how much to renounce

404
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:15,839
um you know like I in in my own life I've noticed cravings that are

405
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:22,240
definitely unhealthy and good to let go of but then there are some cravings like craving for music that I really enjoy

406
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:28,319
and I was very struck when you said that you gave up music for eight years um so

407
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:34,200
I guess my question is did did the Buddha think that it's necessary to enter into the monastic lifestyle to

408
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:40,800
transcend um greed hatred and delusion um yeah to become part of this noble sa

409
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:46,160
um you don't have to become a monastic uh there yeah time of the Buddha you

410
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:54,240
know hundreds of thousands I think the report goes of of lay people who've attained some level of the path and the

411
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:59,720
final level of or the second to last and the last um you do one finally does

412
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:06,440
transcend sensual desire or lust so basically it's almost default

413
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:13,200
monasticism but yeah monastics it's not just the first seven or eight years but we basically have given up music and we

414
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:19,440
do have quite a few former musicians but it's definitely I'd say take so there's

415
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:27,520
a great term in in educational studies called the zone of proximal development and if you're on this end of the zone

416
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:33,599
like if something's too easy for you if you're in fifth grade and somebody gives you you know kindergarten math you're

417
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:39,440
just not learning at all and if you're in fifth grade and somebody gives you advanced calculus for college student

418
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:45,680
that's way beyond you you're just flailing whereas you got this zone of proximal development where you're cutting your teeth and you're really

419
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:53,200
learning and I'd say just experiment you don't want to give so much that life is unnecessarily dooka you're not trying to

420
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:59,359
do it to to elicit depression you know you're you're doing it to make the heart

421
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:07,440
brighter and to realize that you actually need less you can be happy with less um so taking that that measure of

422
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:12,640
of well-being um as a measure for how much you're you're giving up and yeah

423
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:18,720
you can do it just temporarily for a day oh maybe today I can experiment with not listening to music or not eating

424
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:25,200
afternoon or lying on a a mat for the night and see how it goes and if it's inspiring then yeah maybe you can do it

425
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:31,760
again and if it's helpful one of the reasons we give up music is just because we meditate a lot and sometimes you get

426
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:40,160
it like I have if a thought Yeah songs can get in our heads for like a long time a long time yeah

427
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:48,400
well that might be the end of the session and it's really lovely to meet all of you um I brought two sets of

428
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:55,040
books which we published at Clear Mountain which they look almost exactly the same but they are different and um

429
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:00,720
the backs look different but this is every time in the cannon when the Buddha said thus you should train yourself so

430
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:05,760
all of these trainings that someone can take on if you're experimenting with

431
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:11,960
that kind of thing and the second one is all about pamoa which it can be translated as well-being

432
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:19,040
so the Buddha talked about you've heard of Samupata or dependent origination which is the causality of suffering

433
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:25,440
whereas this is the causality of happiness you do certain things and the Buddha gives this image of it's like a

434
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:32,640
cloud a raincloud raining down on the top of a mountain which the rain then fills up the pools up here which then

435
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:38,480
fill over and fill up the pools down here pools pools pools all the way to the great ocean and so too the Buddha

436
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:44,720
said you do things the various clouds are like being generous having a sense

437
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:51,839
of ethics like uh the precepts um listening to dhamma um these are all

438
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:58,319
what water the pools of pomoa of well-being you do this and the Buddha says it's natural you just be generous

439
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:03,760
and it's natural that you have a sense of well-being from well-being it's just natural that that will lead to when the

440
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:08,800
pool fills up it will fill over into the next pool of py or joy which then fills

441
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:14,640
over to pati which is bodily tranquility which fills up and leads to suka or

442
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:21,440
happiness or pleasure which fills up and leads to samadei which leads to concentration to a collected mind a

443
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:28,760
naturally collected mind which then fills up leads to seeing things as they are to dispassion sessation

444
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:34,640
nibbana and it's interesting to note there that people often think once I get

445
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:40,240
my samadei or concentration together once If I learn how to meditate then I'll be happy whereas in this

446
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:47,160
progression you see the Buddha said it's the other way around it's once you get your happiness together then your

447
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:52,880
meditation will fall together it'll fall into place and you'll be able to actually sit and you think about your

448
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:59,760
day i just did a bunch of good stuff i helped my clean bookshelves with my mom and you know whatever it was even though
