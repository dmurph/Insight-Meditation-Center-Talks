1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:09,320
warm greetings from IMC inight meditation center and Redwood

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:15,839
City and I'm delighted to be here with you all many years ago good number of years

3
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:23,240
ago I met um a woman who uh had a career as being a

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:30,000
psychologist and she when she was younger she had done research on um

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,280
early childhood development and her research involved uh for for a couple of years

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,480
involved once a week or so going to visit a new

7
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,399
mother and um who was kind of at home taking care of this new child baby and

8
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,039
toddler and so forth and uh for two years the the

9
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:05,280
researcher went and just sat in the Liv living room quietly didn't have any conversations with the mom and uh and

10
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,080
just watched and took notes on the child and mother interactions and what

11
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:18,080
happened and as part of her study so after two years of doing this uh it was

12
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,680
time to for the researcher to stop that part of the the study and and uh and you

13
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:32,720
know announced that she was leaving or something and uh the researcher was stunned to hear what the mother had to

14
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,360
say uh she hadn't said anything they had they had not having conversations and I

15
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:45,479
guess the researcher was meant to been kind of um a a non-interfering Observer

16
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:52,000
of it all and the mother said that uh the few hours that the researcher spends with

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,240
them were the most important hours of the week for her and uh she felt so much

18
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:05,479
peace she felt so much sense of well-being just having someone in her presence

19
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:13,400
watching and uh I don't have much more to story to say the context of why might

20
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:21,360
have been so profound for the mother certainly mothers sometimes feel isolated in the challenging of raising a

21
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,720
child and um but uh the power of presence the power of observing the

22
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:33,000
power of listening to people is quite profound um I think there's almost like

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,480
a very deep need to uh for especially for people who are for children and

24
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:49,599
maybe for everyone to really be recognized be known um and so meditation is that for

25
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:56,040
ourselves and what would meditation be like if the observation the listening

26
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,879
the presence that we bring to ourselves as we meditate is medicine

27
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:09,040
is a a a form of love a form of caring a

28
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,360
form of respecting and valuing ourselves that we're important enough to really

29
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,440
tune into and be with and I think it's not always easy

30
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:27,200
for us to have that relationship to ourselves we might have that with others but uh too easy it's possible to

31
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,120
Discount oneself too easy to uh focus on other things rather than

32
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:40,640
ourselves sometimes it's easy to be critical of ourselves it's easy to get caught up in Loops of of uh habitual

33
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,239
preoccupations which in some ways uh maybe even take us away from ourselves

34
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:54,680
oddly enough that uh to be caught up in stories and thoughts about ourselves is

35
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:02,120
to be kind of living in abstractions and uh uh but to really be

36
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,200
the Observer to sit in the living room of our hearts and minds and really be

37
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:14,120
there not to interfere but to really see and hear and witness in some

38
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:21,518
profound way what this inner life is like our hearts might need

39
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:27,680
this so to assume a meditation

40
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:37,400
posture that allows us to be comfortable in the living room of our hearts and

41
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,919
Minds so that we can be

42
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:50,320
here to be a witness to see with love with

43
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:58,560
care what is here for us gently closing the

44
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,560
eyes

45
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,800
and beginning directly with just with the eyes closed and feeling and sensing

46
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:21,240
the body being a witness being an

47
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:28,479
observer of what we find here in our body our hearts and our

48
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,479
minds

49
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:41,240
without judgment and without needing to change anything just the power of

50
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,759
observation here

51
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,960
now maybe allowing your attention to roam around your body your heart your

52
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:05,440
mind just check in and recognizing what all is here for

53
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:25,400
us then gently as if it's a

54
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,880
tender quiet gentle

55
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,000
Act of care or love take a few

56
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,639
slower deeper breaths and

57
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,599
longer exhales than

58
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:57,039
usual almost as if the expansion of the chest and the belly as you breathe

59
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,560
in is a greater touching all of how you

60
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:10,280
are and the exhale is a settling and a relaxing into the middle of it

61
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:16,199
all not to let go of anything but find ourselves

62
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:23,080
seated in their living room chair at the middle of it all to be an

63
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,080
observer

64
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
Witness

65
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:51,400
and then letting your breathing return to normal and if you do use your breathing

66
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:58,319
as the that Center place to Center yourself in the middle of it

67
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:05,560
all if it's easy enough imagine that the

68
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,680
body's experience of breathing the sensations of breathing in the

69
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:19,479
body it's almost like it has eyes and ears in the body

70
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:27,400
itself and from the coming and goings of

71
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:31,240
breathing to observe

72
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:42,839
ve the movements of life as they occur in the present

73
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:53,200
moment to listen hear in a deep way sense in a deep

74
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:05,760
way through the Dental movements of breathing in your

75
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,160
body without judgment about anything just

76
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,920
witnessing from The Refuge of

77
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120

for

96
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:02,679
whatever is happening to you now in the present moment consider it something that should

97
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:06,919
be witnessed seen and

98
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:14,039
heard not analyzed or figured out or

99
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:21,720
judged just [Music] seen from the quietest place

100
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
within

101
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
for

102
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159

for

106
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
e

107
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
e

108
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
for

109
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
for

110
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
for

111
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:04,240
e perhaps your awareness can rest

112
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:11,279
within as if sitting in an easy chair in a living room

113
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:17,440
observing all things in the present moment as they

114
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,559
unfold observing with

115
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:30,120
love as if being aware is

116
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,679
love

117
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,080
and then as we come to the end of this

118
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:33,159
sitting there is a way in which we can be seen

119
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:41,799
and heard by others that I can feel as if the seeing and observing is a

120
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:48,080
form of love it can have the same [Music]

121
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,600
warm inspiring impact on

122
00:26:53,799 --> 00:27:01,600
us and to imagine that your ability to with witness the world to hear the world

123
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:10,880
be present for this life around you to imagine that it can be a form of

124
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,880
love an expression of Love A manifestation of

125
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:25,440
love to bring an intentional caring

126
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:31,760
attention to the entire

127
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,559
world near and

128
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,320
far a Love or

129
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:53,960
friendliness that's carried in these words may all beings be

130
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:59,519
happy may all beings be safe

131
00:28:01,399 --> 00:28:10,720
may all beings be peaceful and may all beings be

132
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:21,960
free and just maybe you'll contribute to

133
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:29,919
this in the quality of attention that you are offer the

134
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:38,679
world your attention is that important attention is a vehicle and

135
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:45,080
means by which love appreciation friendliness and

136
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:51,158
respect travel out through our

137
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,399
communities

138
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,960
thank

139
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,320
you

140
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:58,159
this is the fifth talk and final talk on wise listening that's borrowing from the

141
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:04,440
Buddhist criteria for wise speaking

142
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:12,480
to and um and the fifth one is to

143
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:18,519
speak uh with friendliness to speak with speak with mea with loving kindness or

144
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:23,799
Good Will and so if we're listening to listen

145
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:30,279
with love with Good Will with friendliness and it might be

146
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:39,039
easier to listen with Good Will friendliness

147
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:44,279
generosity then it is to speak that way sometimes speaking we don't know what

148
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:49,960
words to say sometimes speaking um maybe can feel a little bit

149
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:56,440
like we're offering ourselves too much to someone else and um maybe the impact we're

150
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:04,440
unsure of if if you walk up to a stranger or you sit down with a stranger on the bus and you say I love you who

151
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:12,240
knows what's going to happen but if you sit there with a stranger on a bus and uh listen to them attentively

152
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,679
with care and with love in the listening it it could get complicated of

153
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:23,440
course but uh it's probably much safer to just listen with respect attentively

154
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:33,320
as if the person is valuable and important as if the person worthy of being known being heard being

155
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:40,120
seen and um I I sus I suspect that there's

156
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:46,320
a kind of a crisis in our society of people not being seen and heard and

157
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,679
respected enough and um and we can do it with our

158
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:58,200
capacity to listen and it is listening is intentional it's different than just

159
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:06,240
hearing and uh sometimes in meditation it's wonderful to kind of just rest in hearing and be so simple and

160
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:13,080
quiet but in our social lives um things get enriched by our

161
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:18,639
intentionality by doing things on purpose and to to listen to someone on

162
00:32:18,639 --> 00:32:23,760
purpose as opposed to not really making any effort to listen and just hear them

163
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:29,919
as if you would hear the traffic outside or the birds outside or something uh

164
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:35,960
there's not much depth in that that way of hearing others but to really turn to

165
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:41,799
someone and hear them out to listen to them on purpose with

166
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:48,519
intentionality to engageing an intentionality can be multifaceted part of the intentionality

167
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:54,720
is to listen to them with appreciation with a sense that it's worthy worth listening to them that what

168
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,880
they have to say is worthwhile to hear and worthwhile to be a witness to this

169
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:05,480
person's life and um and so to

170
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:14,000
listen with with Good Will and to call Meta Goodwill maybe is an

171
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:21,679
easier approach than say listen with love love it gets complicated sometimes

172
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:28,600
with what that means and how high it's kind of like a high bar for people to always love their everyone but even

173
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:34,279
people that we have trouble with challenged by or even don't like sometimes it might be possible to find

174
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:40,600
Good Will wishing them well uh wishing them the opportunity to be heard we

175
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:47,600
hoping that being being that they in being heard and respected and appreciated that maybe it touches

176
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:53,279
something deep inside of them that maybe is beneficial and helpful and maybe the

177
00:33:53,279 --> 00:34:01,440
person as a result won't be as challenging and um so to listen with Good

178
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:07,760
Will and um uh good listening is a form of love

179
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:14,520
is a form of Goodwill is a form of respect and care for others and so how do we do this what

180
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:19,839
what are the means for this um I think it's helpful to think that listening

181
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:24,919
with love listening to Goodwill is not only just having an attitude of good

182
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:30,118
willll but it it's it's what more we bring into the

183
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:36,280
listening the listening can be active we could ask questions as if the person's

184
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:44,200
you want to know more as if the person's valuable enough to find out more what they think what their experience is like

185
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:50,118
um and um but you know caring questions and so just asking

186
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:56,040
questions sometimes um appreciating what they've said and some people it's very

187
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:02,800
rare they get appreciated for what they said and sometimes in group meetings and group situations there's plenty of

188
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:09,079
people who are not appreciated when when they speak some people kind of are recognized

189
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:15,040
as uh easily by others they have a lot bigger presence or have a status in

190
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:20,240
society that maybe gets them in people focus on them and other people don't

191
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:28,400
have that and people sometimes will Overlook them sometimes people will even someone will say something no one will

192
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:35,000
acknowledge it and then a little bit later someone else say the same thing and they're acknowledged but to pay attention are

193
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,680
people being appreciated are people being listened to in meetings in different situations who's not being

194
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:45,880
listened to who's being overlooked um over you know overheard

195
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:53,280
not uh can you listen can you fill in uh the places and meetings and social

196
00:35:53,280 --> 00:36:01,040
situations and fill in for the lack of attention or deep listening that some people all too often

197
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:11,720
experience so this is an active purposeful yes let's listen let's pay attention here the um um the other went

198
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:19,680
away to this active kind of loving uh listening is um uh don't rehearse what

199
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:26,359
you're going to say instead consider what the what the person is saying

200
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:33,119
consider consider it and listen to what's not being said listen to the feelings the emotions behind what they

201
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:38,440
say uh listen to what they might be asking for without it being a question

202
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:45,319
listen what what what's the purpose for which they're saying something and so to be actively involved in listening means

203
00:36:45,319 --> 00:36:51,240
to be considering what people are saying more than considering what you're going to

204
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:57,200
say to listen with love is not to interrupt people

205
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:04,000
to let them speak finished of course sometimes it's appropriate to interrupt sometimes the very game the playfulness

206
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:11,319
of conversations involves kind of a back and forth and interrupting and but that's in context it's it's appropriate

207
00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:21,799
and people you're familiar with but uh you know at times love is not

208
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:27,240
interrupt so uh uh purposeful listening

209
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:32,680
and then we consider what is the purpose for which we're listening for and going and

210
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:38,200
doing and um the um so some of the

211
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:43,520
purposes of these five criteria is it to listen in a timely way

212
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:50,079
listen when it's really important to listen um uh know when to listen in a

213
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:56,800
conversation rather than to keep speaking and saying your opinions U maybe you don't speak all all

214
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:02,800
you can say every time you have something to say some people are kind of have a strong habit of feeling to get

215
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:09,640
things off their chest and get their opinions out there and to be right so to speak in a timely way means to give

216
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:15,880
other people a chance to speak and to hear to listen to what's really true to

217
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:22,599
purposefully look for the truth and that has a lot to do with reviewing ourselves that we're not overlaying judgments and

218
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:28,240
biases on top of what we hear to be able to be clean

219
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:34,560
listener uh to listen in a way that is um uh touches the heart it's kind of

220
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:40,240
related to this idea of listening with love but listen in a way that uh that

221
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:46,000
helps people feel safe or comfortable or or or comfortable around

222
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,040
you and to listen for what's beneficial listening beneficial way listen for a

223
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:59,240
way that supports you and others and then again this last last one maybe is related to that and that is to

224
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:07,839
listen with Good Will so these are all purposes that we choose to live by and there are times

225
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:13,640
when uh when this Buddhist practice of ours calls upon us to live an

226
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:20,960
intentional life a purposeful life and listening is one of those interesting places for that when we appreciate the

227
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:26,200
difference between listening and hearing we can hear without any sense of purpose

228
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:33,640
at all we enrich ourselves if we listen with purpose provided it's for the right

229
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:38,800
purpose provided for a purpose that feels like it comes from the depth of us

230
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:44,119
and supports something that's beautiful and wonderful inside of us to flow and

231
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:51,040
come um kind of on its own uh so we're not straining and stressing

232
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:56,800
to for the purpose it's a purpose that allows something to flower and one of

233
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:03,280
the most beautiful flowerings we can have is uh is

234
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:10,119
love and to live a purposeful life where love is at the center what a great gift

235
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:15,560
it is for our world so

236
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:23,200
listening listening is one of the expressions of

237
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:29,160
love if let love has a language um listening

238
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:39,640
is maybe the grammar for that language or something so um thank you and

239
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:46,720
