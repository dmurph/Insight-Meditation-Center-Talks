8
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:50,340
guided meditation can be very distracting I'll open up later for the reflections after our meditation

thank everyone thanks for your practice

132
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:35,460
so what we did today just a quick review started with

133
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:43,260
feeling the breath while coming to breath and relaxing and receiving the breath as

134
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:49,080
a lullaby yes calming and soothing it's this nourishing of the brethren

135
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:54,960
tuning we start to tune into the breath as as a blessing as something beautiful

136
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,860
and then I invited you to try something we haven't tried here before

137
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:05,940
which is the exploring the joy of not

138
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:11,820
becoming of non-becoming of non-being non-doing non-striving

139
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:20,220
and the way to explore that Joy was to release was to release into non-being if

140
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:25,799
a thought came about I plan to do this and that's like oh sweetheart you don't have to it's all right later I can think

141
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:33,299
about all this stuff and become all I want later but right now what if I just release that and then turn my mind to

142
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:41,520
the Joy to the Delight of non-being wow that can be such a place of ease rest

143
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:48,360
release this place of it's just like the tip of uh like I had this image of I

144
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:53,940
think there's a saying of how many millions or thousands of of angels can

145
00:31:53,940 --> 00:32:00,840
fly on the tip of a uh can dance on the tip of a um uh what is it

146
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:07,440
blunt my mind is blanking um uh um on a small tip of something or other

147
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:15,299
anyway so I had this image of oh yeah so much e so much expansiveness so much rest ahead of a pin that's it thank you

148
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:22,320
all head of a pen support is right there in in uh in chat for me waiting for me on

149
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,960
the head of a pen right there so there's so much ease so much relaxation and

150
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:33,419
peace and the head on this tip of this pin of not becoming not doing just

151
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:38,460
releasing into that so um interesting

152
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:43,860
interesting exploration I hope um I hope you found your way your

153
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:49,140
relationship into it either through this meditation and maybe some

154
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:55,919
other time and of course the the mind the uh the judgments can come like oh

155
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:02,399
you're not doing anything like it's okay sweetie it's all right I'll do I'll do everything like you know the becoming

156
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:07,740
can all happen later but it's so so freeing to explore [Music]

157
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:14,100
um to explore even for a moment if it's accessible like wow the mind can just

158
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:20,700
let go release into non-becoming non-wanting not wanting not becoming not

159
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:26,700
around this this like this samsara this continuously thinking and becoming and

160
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:34,140
wanting it remembers like even for a moment through the past 30 minutes if you felt into that wow

161
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:41,299
that can be such a deep joy release into that so

162
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:48,799
so with that um

163
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:56,700
the invitation to uh to now transition few few will

164
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:01,919
to being with one another in small breakout groups and maybe nothing needs

165
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:07,740
to be said if you're very quiet if you just had oh wow deep release you don't

166
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:14,580
want to become you don't want to become this talking head you don't want to that's perfectly fine what let maybe let

167
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:22,378
that be your guide what if what if we show up with others without this need to

168
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:27,540
say to be to become to to share maybe

169
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:33,780
we'll just show up with peace with Silence with non-becoming

170
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:38,820
that look like I don't know let's explore that maybe there will be a lot

171
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:43,980
of Silence in the rooms and maybe there will be a movement to perhaps to share

172
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:49,440
something from the experience or maybe not it's very free-floating or maybe

173
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:56,398
you'll just sit together with eyes open for the six minutes in silence and that's perfectly fine uh maybe just

174
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:02,700
wishing each other meta wishing yourselves well wishing each other well so let it be really low-key what is this

175
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:08,220
and also notice if there is the desire for becoming for wanting to to impress

176
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:14,520
especially you know if there's a desire to perhaps share and and um or good will

177
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:19,800
just be be with good will I know this these instructions these invitations for

178
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:25,440
the small group sound unusual it's not the usual prompt up discuss this no it's

179
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:31,740
it's actually it's a different way of being with other human beings

180
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:38,099
does that make sense so the invitation is in the small group of roughly size three or four what if

181
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:43,859
you showed up without any desire to be anybody in

182
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:51,900
or show up in any particular way being being with a sense of ease anyway let's let's

183
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:59,180
try that on for size dear practitioner so I'm going to create the breakout rooms

184
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:04,380
and be kind take care of yourselves take care of each other no questioning please

185
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:11,520
this is not a time to ask anybody any questions you want to share from your experience you're welcome too if you

186
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:18,180
want to hold Silence with meta and non-becoming what does the what does the heart and

187
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:24,180
mind feel be curious that's it lead with curiosity not becoming be curious all

188
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:29,400
right the rooms are created I'm going to open them now take care of yourselves

189
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:35,820
take care of each other here we go come back and let's take a couple of

190
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:40,920
Reflections you can type them in chat if you like

191
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:47,460
um it's open now to everyone or to me privately or you can raise your hand if

192
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:55,380
you haven't spoken recently um how this practice was for you what did you discover in the AHA moments or

193
00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:01,760
any um challenges you want to ask about ditto about

194
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:09,480
[Music] um ditto about the small groups Bill asks what is becoming what is on becoming ah

195
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:14,760
non-well non-becoming not on becoming non-becoming but becoming yeah thank you

196
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:21,720
for that question so so in the uh Buddhist teachings there's this idea

197
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:30,960
that that um we we calcify around a want a a this

198
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:36,359
this uh but something that we want to become that for example there's so many

199
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:42,900
different ways to think about this but let's let's relate it so let's say you have this idea you know you have a

200
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:49,740
memory and then all of a sudden you're upset and you're angry and you become you become this angry person you become

201
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:56,160
because of the thought you had or or thing I mentioned a couple of sessions

202
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:01,560
ago the idea of this Hungry Ghost which is again in Buddhist cosmology is this

203
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:08,880
creature that has a huge stomach and Tiny neck and Tiny mouth so it can never be satisfied it's always hungry always

204
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:14,880
greedy so maybe you see something or you're or think about something and you

205
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:20,040
become you become a Hungry Ghost it's becoming it's this always becoming

206
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:28,200
you're always becoming becoming this becoming that and so that's the idea bill of of becoming and taking birth

207
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:33,480
into these unwholesome states of mind which again could be thought of as

208
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:39,540
different uh hell Realms we take birth into these different hell Realms we keep

209
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:46,980
becoming these unhelpful versions of ourselves instead of just not taking the bait not

210
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:52,500
not taking the bait uh Bill asked becoming is related to

211
00:38:52,500 --> 00:39:00,599
Greed and the version then he agreed hey yes yes it is great exactly right yes it is this becoming is

212
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:07,859
related to the three unwholesome Roots uh um greed hatred and confusion which

213
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:13,440
actually the confusion the delusion um it it gives rise to the greed and

214
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:20,400
hatred so that's exactly right through that cycle we keep becoming we'd be taking birth so you can think of it as

215
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,680
multi-life we keep becoming is in the multi-life model if one believed in

216
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:31,560
rebirth you keep becoming becoming because or in in one life model you keep

217
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:37,560
becoming the next moment you become something more it's different different instead of just releasing and being

218
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:43,020
there's a sense of release ease um and releasing into goodness service

219
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:48,060
so that's the teaching there and I appreciate you asking these questions you're welcome

220
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:56,040
Bill excellent questions um I hope it was helpful for others too

221
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:02,700
whenever you sends a direct message that was a beautiful exercise thank you you are so welcome thanks for practicing

222
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:08,940
this yeah and if you want to raise your hand and say more because I don't remember hearing from you uh you're

223
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:14,700
welcome not to put you on spot and the spot but you're welcome to raise your hand Amy Says a group sat quietly

224
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:20,280
without unmuting being with and at random times we just grinned at each

225
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:27,500
other oh this is sweet I love it there's a sweetness to what you shared Amy

226
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:33,660
it's very sweet being with and at random times we just grinned at each other it

227
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:39,060
makes me happy it's very sweet I'm not becoming together yeah

228
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:46,200
it's exactly right well it feels like a rich exploration

229
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:52,020
we've done together the rich exploration that I invite you to to practice it

230
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:58,140
actually not just on the cushion but in daily life when you're about to become

231
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:03,900
something which may not be ideal you don't want to be oh pause do I want to

232
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:09,000
become this or do I want to release into non-becoming release that that

233
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:15,300
tantalizing um thing whatever it is that fish hook into

234
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:23,520
anger and aversion and greed whatever it might be like can I just let go and not become can I let go into contentment in

235
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:29,040
this moment and explore that so thank you all thank you for your
