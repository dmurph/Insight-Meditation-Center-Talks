1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:09,420
so good morning everyone and welcome to IMC and those of you here and those of

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,480
you who might be With Us online

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:22,800
and a few announcements before we start the first is that um

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,680
yesterday I put out on the table the counter where the by the exit a whole

5
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:35,399
stack of the end of the year fundraising letters I don't know how how delighted you are

6
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:42,180
about receiving fundraising letters but if you're delighted enough but receiving it from IMC there's one there

7
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,820
you can you can pick up and I realized this morning that we've

8
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,860
been doing fundraising letters for 25 years end of the year

9
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,960
and the first time we did it was so we could be in the circumstance to buy a

10
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:05,640
place like this building here many years later it was so that we could have a retreat center and take care of

11
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,720
it and so all the kind of building and the kind of growing of imc's

12
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,799
a lot is attributed to those end of the year fundraising letters

13
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,619
anyway so if you want to read what I wrote I wrote the letter you're welcome to take one whether you

14
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:28,920
donate or not and then uh on um

15
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,820
I won't be here next week Max erstein will be here and the next time I'm teaching here at

16
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:41,880
IMC but also you know also online will be a Saturday December 10th now

17
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:50,299
that I guess I'm teaching the 7 A.M that week but um uh I'm here alone then

18
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:56,100
but uh on December 10th I'm doing a day long that's uh offered through Insight

19
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:03,060
Retreat Center there's information for it it's online it's on zoom and it's information is on

20
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:10,380
it about it on the what's new section of the home page of IMC if you're interested in doing a day-long

21
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,819
from home or someplace

22
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:24,420
so to give a talk

23
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:30,360
so imagine that you finally able to bring a friend along to

24
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,520
hear a Dharma talk someplace they've been resisting not wanting to come but you feel like they should

25
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:42,480
really you know learn about the Buddhism or something and so they finally agree to come

26
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:50,280
and the Dharma teachers hits that and starts talking and announces today I'm going to give a talk about

27
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,620
suffering and how important it is to address

28
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,780
suffering and in your mind you're going oh no I

29
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:08,900
finally got my friend here and this is going to be like this they're they're going to be turned off by this

30
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,959
and or imagine another time you bring another friend who finally would link to come but they're kind of cynical about

31
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:23,220
things skeptical and the Dharma teacher starts off by saying today

32
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:29,459
I'm going to talk about happiness and

33
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:34,620
oh no my friend is skeptical about all things

34
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:40,080
about this you know South Sacrament Buddhism can be or spirituality and you know and probably they're going to talk

35
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,200
about loving kindness and my poor friend is not going to never going to come back

36
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:52,260
so I don't know if any of you brought friends today but today I'm going to talk about

37
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:58,040
suffering and happiness

38
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,560
and then some of you go oh no my friend

39
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,580
so um but I want to emphasize how important happiness is for the path of

40
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:18,919
Buddhism Buddhist practice I think that it's underappreciated that it's a path of happiness and that

41
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:24,780
orienting oneself on this path to Buddhism to see what you can do

42
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:31,620
to become a happier person are there reasonable ways that you could Orient yourself and

43
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:37,500
navigate this world so that you're a little bit happier and delighted with

44
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:43,259
life with yourself and there are other ways that you can do the opposite

45
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:48,840
so I know some people might feel that it's very important to become Wealthy by

46
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:55,500
the time you're 29. and so you say well I'll be happy later

47
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:01,139
but this is not the time to be happy well that's you know maybe I don't know

48
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:07,620
what that is about but uh but then you're not really cultivating the factors for this path of Liberation that

49
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:13,639
Buddhism champions which has a lot to do with developing a

50
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:18,660
very significant useful supportive strategic

51
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:25,940
sense of well-being and then with that

52
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:31,380
addressing suffering this isn't this is well known since the

53
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:36,600
time of the Buddha in fact there's a there's a council of the Buddha giving Dharma talks

54
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:44,300
where the first thing he did is he elated and inspired the audience

55
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:52,259
and then he taught them about suffering so both right not one or the other so I

56
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:57,900
wanted to read the description of how the Buddha prepared people

57
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:04,800
so he could talk about suffering when the audience was ready

58
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:14,220
receptive free from the hindrances elated and confident

59
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:20,759
he expounded to them the teaching special to the Buddhas

60
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:26,699
suffering it's a little bit more but that's what you said for now

61
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:33,419
so you know I don't know if I can manage to do that today to all in one Dharma talk

62
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:39,539
to make you ready receptive free of hindrances elated and confident

63
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:46,199
but just the idea that that's kind of what the Buddha did I think that when I was younger in life

64
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:52,620
especially when I came out of Zen practice where it was mostly just about a direct penetration to the truth to

65
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:58,620
emptiness or something I would have thought this was manipulative you know they're kind of playing with

66
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:04,919
people's emotions getting them elated and all that we just want to we want the truth let's just deal with suffering directly

67
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:13,199
or something but I think that it can be helpful and useful and ethical

68
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:19,319
to promote being happy without it being necessarily

69
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:24,780
um you know manipulative or something saccharine

70
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:31,139
and it's important part of the path so why not talk about it and emphasize its importance

71
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:39,900
so then there's also a teaching about meditation practice where at some point in meditation also

72
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:45,900
to address suffering I mean that's kind of the specialty of Buddhism

73
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:53,960
however in meditation there also there's a description letting the meditation practice develop

74
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:01,319
and prepare you for encountering your suffering by going through stages of Happiness of

75
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:10,259
well-being and there's a series of them and it begins by doing something which evokes

76
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:15,680
or having something which evokes your gladness

77
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:22,800
your Delight your kind of a joy and uh and what is it that can be

78
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:29,220
evocative of that one of the things one of the primary one the Buddha talks about is something

79
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:36,120
called sadash Radha in Sanskrit uh usually translated as faith it could

80
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:42,240
also be confidence some people come to Buddhism and they hear about not they hear about suffering

81
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,459
and the importance of it but what they hear more importantly is there's a

82
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:53,640
practice and a path that leads to the end of suffering and they go wow

83
00:08:53,640 --> 00:09:01,019
finally I meet someone who's really talking about suffering as it is without kind of painting it over or talking

84
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:07,080
about something else and and they have a pet they have a

85
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:12,360
practice for it this is inspiring I'm so glad to have found it finally

86
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,760
it's kind of a gladness Wells up other people have a gladness or

87
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:24,600
inspiration kind of I think of as gladness and inspiration being closely related they're inspired

88
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:30,720
I remember meeting people when I was a newer practitioner and seeing as people who had been

89
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:37,260
practicing for a long time and being so inspired by them so wow I've never met

90
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:43,140
someone like this they're seem ordinary enough they don't seem like they're putting on the errors

91
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:51,540
or being you know spiritually high in the clouds but there's something about them that really inspired a kind of

92
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:58,440
peacefulness and Joy or something in myself there's all kinds of ways you know to be

93
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:05,880
inspired one of the things that creates this gladness and joy that perplexed me when

94
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:11,519
I first came across it in Buddhism was the idea that your own ethics could be a

95
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:17,519
source of joy you know because I you know I didn't grow up with much I wasn't particularly

96
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:23,339
unethical but it wasn't like a place you know and it you know I was just a hippie and

97
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:29,399
you know we were kind of antinomian back then you know not not into

98
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:34,680
the hypocrisy of a lot of The Commandments and rules and all that

99
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,620
and um and so what I heard about people who were joyful about their ethics I thought

100
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:46,680
well I thought I kind of found mistrustful and I'd heard that in when I went to

101
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:52,800
Thailand that that's what taravad and Buddhists could have they were so delighted in their following the

102
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,839
precepts gave me misatisfaction and all that

103
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:04,079
and um and then I went to Thailand and I did a long retreat there 10 weeks long

104
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:11,220
and to my surprise about seven weeks into it I felt a kind of

105
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:16,620
strange feeling inside what is this strange feeling

106
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:21,899
and the best I could come up words to describe it I felt a kind of ethical

107
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:28,860
purity wow what is this and it felt kind of delightful to have

108
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:36,240
it there was a joy to it and I thought oh maybe that's what the joy is to feel you know it's not like an

109
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:44,160
evaluation or going through the checklist say well I don't do that I don't do that therefore I should be happy it was the source inside for ethics that

110
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:50,519
was just inspiring to me so um

111
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:56,040
so the so the Buddha talks about this that the idea of something that inspires

112
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:02,579
us inspires gladness and gladness is evaluative in nature you

113
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:09,060
have it's a conceptual oh yeah I have this experience I have this knowledge I've touched into something this is

114
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:16,560
really good and I'm so happy so glad that I've so inspired by this this thing that I've

115
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:22,980
come into contact with foreign then as we're inspired through gladness

116
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:31,260
that's said to create a momentum to practice and when we practice the excitement they

117
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:36,480
add the little bit agitation of gladness begins to dissipate

118
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,540
but the engagement finally now I'm doing it myself it's not just an idea

119
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:48,420
and as we do it there's something about the engagement in meditation at some

120
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:54,660
point that brings something called pity p-i-t-t-i

121
00:12:54,779 --> 00:13:00,899
and uh I like to translate it as Joy some people say Gil that's too

122
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:07,100
sedated or too you know dampening it down it's rapture

123
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:14,160
and then I I like sometimes I just like to call it well-being there's something kind of inner sense of some people call

124
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,380
it a thrill it's a little bit energetic because it comes partly from or very

125
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:26,459
much from starting to get concentrated as we practice and as we get concentrated there's something maybe it releases you know

126
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:33,300
serotonin or something in in our system but the point being that something when when things become harmonized in the

127
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:39,240
mind and a Harmony between the mind and the body and things are kind of working together

128
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:45,839
without any stress so the mind or the heart begins

129
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:51,779
evoking or bringing forth something very different than it can evoke when it's

130
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:57,360
caught up in stressful thoughts and preoccupations and lost in thought

131
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:03,079
it's a kind of a joy it's kind of a miracle that happens this way

132
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:09,720
then as we practice further The Joy being content with it happy with

133
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:16,920
it being able to kind of put aside so many of the preoccupations we have because we're feeling this Joy

134
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:23,399
something in the body has a chance to relax a lot of the relaxation of the body has

135
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:31,019
to do with finally being present for your experience the body just wants to relax

136
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:37,860
if you just give the body half a chance it'll relax and some of us don't do that

137
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:42,959
and sometimes the tension in the body is unconscious we don't even know we're carrying it

138
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,480
I was so surprised when I started to meditate to discover that I could feel I

139
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,760
would feel more rested and more relaxed after I meditated first thing in the

140
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:59,220
morning that when I woke up from sleep I thought sleep was supposed to be the

141
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:04,500
premiere rest but in fact meditation that allows

142
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,779
something to rest deeper and a lot of that had to do with just being present the body wants to

143
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:15,720
relax to become and so the body relaxes

144
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:21,560
as the body relaxes that joy that we have gets quieter

145
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:27,660
settles the energy or the excitement around goes away and it gets replaced with happiness

146
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:33,079
well-being and that is usually not translated in

147
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:40,560
energetic terms like Rapture it's it's more Sublime some people actually translate this word the Pali word sukkah

148
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:46,019
as pleasure because it's a very deep embodied sense of well-being that just

149
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:51,199
feels so such Sublime pleasure everywhere

150
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:57,300
and then the Buddha says goes on and says with that sense of happiness

151
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:03,180
that's the condition that allows for some very deep concentration

152
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:09,660
if you're content already if you're happy if your body is happy

153
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:15,660
it's just nice to be here some people talk about it and I feel like I'm home finally

154
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:24,380
this is safe this is you know satisfying this is better than watching Netflix

155
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,120
this is good and um and uh and so there's a deep

156
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:38,639
satisfaction that allows something to settle more to unify to come together which is a lot

157
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:44,459
of what samadhi is concentration just deep willing to settle here

158
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:49,980
and that deep settleness here in the present moment with the mind at rest the

159
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:55,199
body at rest provides a new vantage point A New

160
00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:01,139
Perspective just like the Buddha when he gave his Dharma talks people became ready

161
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:08,280
receptive free of the hindrances elated and confident though that that state of being that he

162
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:14,699
evoked in people prepared them they were ready right receptive prepared them to see and

163
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:21,120
understand something in a new way in fact when he starts teaching about suffering to that audience

164
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,880
it isn't that they then believe something new what happens when they listen to his

165
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:36,260
teachings about suffering the description is their Dharma eye opens some ability to perceive

166
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:45,120
is available we open we have New Perspective arises in the meditation path going through

167
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:53,400
gladness Joy relaxation happiness and samadhi also

168
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,860
gives the meditator A New Perspective to see and what is that

169
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:04,260
so imagine yourself really as contented and happy and satisfied as you've ever

170
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:10,080
been without being sleepy so here's the Earth and present maybe

171
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,960
you woke up and up from a wonderful nap and nothing has to happen nothing you

172
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:22,140
have to do anything and you do have thoughts that come through but the thoughts are like wispy

173
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:29,820
clouds that come through you so there's a thought that goes through and passes and he's looking at the dust I've done

174
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:35,039
nothing laying in bed after a nap and the sunlight comes in wow there's a lot of dust and just watching the dance of

175
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:40,860
dust through the sunlight you know or the Speckles on the ceiling yeah just

176
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:46,020
you know my thoughts come and they go and nothing is sticky nothing is grabby

177
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:53,460
it's just kind of just really nice to be there and then a thought arises

178
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:59,520
about some really big challenge at work that's really distressing for me and

179
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:05,400
anxiety producing for me or something and I see that thought work challenge

180
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:11,039
coming up but I'm so settled so quiet and so

181
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:17,220
peaceful they say oh look

182
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:24,539
there's thinking about that that work challenge and then we feel a little compulsion

183
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:29,640
arise somewhere maybe in the chest like

184
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:35,480
ought to get involved with this anxiety we've got to get and you say wait a minute

185
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:41,640
I don't have to be involved I don't have to pick this up this thought up

186
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:48,840
I can just let it go let you know pass through and there's a such a subtle place that

187
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,940
you actually have some choice oh I don't have to get involved in this though

188
00:19:53,940 --> 00:20:02,280
and then it passes and then you're back to the Dust Dancing In The Light which feels so good

189
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:08,880
just nothing to do and peaceful and content and then you think about then certainly

190
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:14,039
it's been 50 years or something and suddenly there's thoughts about your

191
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:19,500
high school sweetheart comes up who who spurred you or whatever what's the

192
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:25,980
word you know it's kind of left you suddenly or something or and and um and like suddenly the anger

193
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:32,580
starts coming 50 years ago right but you're in this very nice state did

194
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:37,740
you see oh look at that it's fascinating that after 50 years I should feel this

195
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:43,260
compulsion towards anger let's not get involved with that I have better things to do today

196
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:52,440
and you have enough Choice there to not get involved and it passes and you watch all this stuff come and go

197
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:57,660
come and go wow this is something

198
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:03,240
and then you wonder you have this thought how can I live with this kind of peace

199
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:09,000
how can I just go through my life this way so I don't get caught in these things

200
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,480
that I always just get caught in in fact not I think about it I spend most of my days caught in

201
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:22,080
something I never realized that until I was had this deep peace that to watch things

202
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:29,520
come and go watch the tendency to get involved I want you to begin and watch it end I

203
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,740
had no idea that I was so and most of my day caught in things no wonder I wake up

204
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:40,980
in the morning still tense and so he's like how can I live in such

205
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:49,380
a way that I stay close to this piece so you think about it what would it take and first thing you occurs to you well

206
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:56,400
I think keeping this perspective active for me keeping the perspective where I see how

207
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:03,480
things arise see when they first appear so that I can see them as an appearing

208
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:09,299
phenomena with no more reality no more substantiality than just as a thought an

209
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:14,940
idea compulsion arising and so I have a chance to see it pass to Let It Go

210
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:20,280
seeing that all things come and go that's a good perspective okay

211
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:27,059
what else do I should I do well I've noticed that when I do get in really entangled

212
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:32,580
and Rich juicy good painful suffering ways

213
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:39,179
it's because I have a meat being mean

214
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:45,539
I'm being greedy wanting to send more sensual pleasures of all kinds

215
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:52,020
I'm a little bit cruel even I mean those those are cognitively complex

216
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:57,120
complicated activities of the mind to have those motivations

217
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:04,500
let's not do those okay that's the second thing let's let's avoid certain kinds of behavior and

218
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:10,320
motivations and then you think what else well

219
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:16,380
I've also seen that it's cognitively complex and involves entanglement takes me away

220
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:21,600
from this kind of peace if I lie a lot

221
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,320
how about if I not lie what else

222
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:34,140
I bet I've never you know it's never been an issue for me but I bet that if I

223
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:40,620
spend a lot of time killing people stealing from people

224
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:46,980
and running around doing sexual misconduct I think that that also puts me into this

225
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:52,080
more complicated cognitive world of of you know that I have to kind of plan

226
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:57,600
and hide and run around and escape and justify

227
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,640
that's complicated so

228
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:08,640
let's not do that what else

229
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:15,059
well I've been involved in work that harmed people that didn't do any good for this world

230
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:20,700
and that was so stressful for my mind and I've been involved it didn't do

231
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:26,100
things that were felt wrong to do in the world and that felt so much better

232
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:31,380
let's avoid work that causes harm

233
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:37,679
is anything else I should do well you should really take a good look at myself

234
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:43,200
and I see this from this New Perspective I have I see that when these compulsions

235
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,600
arise in the mind like if greed arises or hatred arises

236
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:56,820
or the kind of spinning spinning around in confusion and delusion and perplexity

237
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:02,640
that that actually doesn't feel good then I'm kind of caught again I've left

238
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:08,419
that kind of relaxed Place watching things come and go

239
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:14,640
let's not do those things I never noticed actually the opposite

240
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:22,380
there are certain ways that the Mind operates and thinks about things and where it's generous or it's kind

241
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:28,320
who it's wise that it comes so naturally it seems to

242
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,200
actually be part and parcel of this peaceful satisfying relaxed place

243
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:40,080
that I discovered at the end of this path of gladness Joy Tranquility

244
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:48,140
happiness and concentration so let's stay close to those good things

245
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:55,320
what else should I do I think I better stay attentive enough

246
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:01,679
to track all this I think I need to be mindful

247
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:08,880
stay mindful what else well it seems that a lot of this new

248
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:16,140
perspective is supported by being really settled concentrated still

249
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:21,360
let me live a life in such a way that I have access to a quiet concentrated

250
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:27,299
still mind great

251
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:32,600
what I just went through is the Eightfold Path

252
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,980
this is their apparently what the Buddha did when he was enlightened he went did

253
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:47,000
exactly the same analysis what keeps me close to this freedom I discovered penny

254
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:55,279
so when the Buddha gave this talk where he made people's minds

255
00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:00,559
receptive ready receptive free of the hindrances

256
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:06,720
elated and confident he was putting their minds in a state

257
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:13,320
that now was ready for a new perspective and what was that news perspective

258
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:21,120
it was suffering that the arising of suffering the appearance of

259
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,159
suffering the cessation of suffering remember this

260
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:33,900
is what happened after the nap that you saw states of Mind thoughts

261
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:39,360
ideas arise and pass and you saw compulsions to be involved

262
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:46,500
in them come and you chose not to be involved let it all come trust the simple mind relax don't get caught in

263
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:52,380
anything see the arising and passing because if you get caught in it and

264
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:58,020
involved you won't see things come and go there's Freedom there almost like

265
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:03,840
between the ending of one thing in the beginning of the next there's peace there's space there's something

266
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:13,220
wonderful almost like that and then he taught them the path

267
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:21,900
sometimes called the path leading to the end of suffering and uh and this is the eighthful path

268
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:28,980
I like to think of it with the Buddha thought about it this way as well that it wasn't so much leading to to the end

269
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:35,520
of suffering it is but it also is how to live

270
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:41,600
from that place where is that freedom that ease

271
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:48,539
so happiness has a role in Buddhist

272
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:57,059
practice happiness prepares us to be able to see the world and ourselves in a new way

273
00:28:57,059 --> 00:29:03,960
that's actually hard to do for suffering a lot Buddhist practice can help people who

274
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:09,600
suffer a lot can give us practices and perspectives and compassion and all

275
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,700
kinds of things that support the lessening with suffering coming to

276
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:22,380
having better relationship to our suffering finding our way with suffering but at some point this practice of

277
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:30,899
Buddhism is also about Awakening or staying close to developing our capacity for a

278
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:37,440
significant kind of well-being happiness

279
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:46,159
how often in your day do you allow yourself to be happy

280
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:53,580
how often in the day are you so involved in serious things

281
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:58,919
that you don't take the time to be delighted at what your circumstances are

282
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:05,600
the weather the sky the trees the people around you

283
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,539
maybe you have such important things to do that you can't really take the time to appreciate anything that's around you

284
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:18,960
or with you so I don't want if that your life is that important

285
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:25,140
I don't want to interfere but maybe for some of you it's not some

286
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:33,539
of the things you get involved in are not that important if an anthropologist from Mars

287
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:39,600
came to study you and looked at what you actually did through the day

288
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:45,740
what conclusion would they make about what human beings are all about

289
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:53,159
would it be like the best news in the universe or would be well maybe you should have

290
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:58,620
chosen someone else because the way my mind works I'm always

291
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:04,940
caught up in this and that and involved in this or that and being resentful or

292
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:10,140
so when they report back to Mars this person mostly spends their time thinking

293
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:16,500
about the past or they could write back to Mars and say this person

294
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:22,919
is mostly planning because they're always anxious that's what's that maybe that's what

295
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:28,740
human life is on the planet Earth is all about being anxious a lot of those people are anxious so

296
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:35,279
they must have I think it's a religion of anxiety they must worship it you should see what

297
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:44,220
they do and they had this special altar the sacrament they go to regularly in

298
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:52,398
which to kind of increase their level of anxiety they're really good at it it's a monitor

299
00:31:57,179 --> 00:32:04,799
and uh so I think at first not for anyone here of course but there are people for whom

300
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:12,000
what we do in daily life regularly and repeatedly would not be the best representation for

301
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:19,039
what human beings are capable of if the anthropologists from Mars reported about us

302
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,480
I would propose that some of us don't have to be don't have such

303
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:30,000
important things to do all the time that we can take more time

304
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,279
to feel happy do you feel joyful to feel appreciation

305
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:42,059
to find things that are inspiring is that pollyanish is that saccharine

306
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:49,320
life is that a life then it doesn't realize that this is a serious World we're in there's a

307
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:57,179
lot of people suffering and we have to get Grim quickly or we are serious about the degree of

308
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:02,820
suffering that is in this world there's a lot it's heartbreaking what goes on in this world

309
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:11,039
but maybe just maybe we are better off with a new perspective about it all

310
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:18,840
in addressing it than the old perspective to have the Dharma eye open

311
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:27,179
and that's what the Buddhism is about and to have this Dharma eye open to be able to see in a new way

312
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:35,760
to see from the perspective of how things are coming and going Moment by moment

313
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:41,899
to see from a place of well-being subtleness happiness

314
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,640
and then from there let us address the suffering of this world

315
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:53,159
let's not ignore it let's not just be happy and then

316
00:33:53,159 --> 00:34:02,220
forget everyone else so so the importance of happiness

317
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:07,260
and that the a full path is a recipe for

318
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:13,440
that happiness staying close to it the happiness of this New Perspective

319
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:20,179
and it's kind of a a kind of a cycle

320
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:25,740
that if you feel the happiness of this New Perspective

321
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:31,200
that strengthens the gladness The Joy the tranquility

322
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:38,099
the happiness and the ability to see things as they are better

323
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:43,800
which can produce more happiness more feeling of this is being inspired

324
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:49,858
and so it grows and grows so

325
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:54,559
today's talk was about happiness and suffering

326
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:00,780
and the point I wanted to make was the importance of happiness

327
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:05,880
I don't say it's easy to be happy but it might be

328
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:13,980
more available to you than you allow yourself to take advantage of or to touch into

329
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:21,240
and if you allow yourself to have more happiness perhaps it'll allow your meditation

330
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:27,960
to become more settled more contented more concentrated so that

331
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:34,140
it isn't just dust dancing and in in sunlight that you

332
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:39,960
that you see coming and going but there's a profound way of seeing this world

333
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:45,359
as coming and going and you

334
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:49,578
free in the midst of it

335
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:58,700
so those are my thoughts for today and um

336
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:05,339
we have a few minutes here we can take maybe a couple of questions if someone would like to ask or comments about this

337
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:11,280
or anything and then afterwards we can take some time and go outside in the parking lot those of you would like to

338
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,560
join join me out there we'll put chairs in a circle and

339
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:24,799
and uh we can have continue our discussion and out there you can also take off your mask if you want

340
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:39,060
Gail early in the talk you mentioned I think serotonin which

341
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:42,980
leads which he mentions

342
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:54,559
houses not so good do you have the other one mark

343
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:05,640
okay it's better Gill early in the talk you mentioned

344
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:12,420
serotonin and I think and that leads to a body chemistry kind of question

345
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:17,520
um I have this idea but that I'm not sure about that that

346
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:23,220
um that any any kind of getting what we

347
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:31,400
want kind of activity stimulates some body chemistry uh

348
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:39,480
serotonin or adrenaline or hormones that feels a lot like happiness

349
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:47,280
but maybe they have the seeds of some stress maybe these maybe these maybe this body

350
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,380
chemistry that gets stimulated has the seeds of stress

351
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:58,020
underlying them and that the greatest happiness the kind of

352
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:04,859
a dharmic happiness would be the kind of happiness that that Taps down

353
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:10,260
our body chemistry so that there's not strong emotions

354
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:18,599
happening instead there's just kind of like pure awareness and and a letting go

355
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:25,560
does that does that bringing body chemistry into

356
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:31,640
the Dharma like I'm doing now does that make sense to you

357
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:40,160
I'm not qualified to answer I mean I shouldn't have brought up serotonin I hardly know what it is

358
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:46,079
that's what I was asking you because I don't know and so you know to answer questions about body chemistry is

359
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:51,359
something I'm not really capable of doing but I think that the when Buddhist

360
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:57,599
classic Buddhist point of view there's a difference between the mental emotional

361
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:03,359
physical activity that we're engaged in which leaves traces and those it doesn't

362
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:08,400
leave traces and so the traces of

363
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:14,579
of uh you know what those traces are that there are not that are not helpful

364
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:20,720
for us not useful for us uh the negative karma in a sense uh is uh that's what

365
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:27,180
Buddhism talks about Karma being left behind and so maybe it's maybe just chemicals

366
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:33,480
that are you know stuck in our system but there are good chemicals too there's good states of mind that can get quite

367
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:40,140
strong and persist and create very different conditions that persist and whether this practice makes us kind of

368
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:47,640
kind of emotionally neutral dampens down our emotions um I think it's a it's a

369
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:52,920
it depends on the person there are people who whose emotions

370
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:59,400
swing between very dramatic states of well-being and very dramatic states of suffering emotions of

371
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:04,800
suffering Despair and all kinds of things that are directly connected to what they're clinging to

372
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,960
write the clinic directly connected to their attachment to self-identity

373
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:16,800
and so for those people as their clinging reduces the swings won't be as much

374
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:23,339
the other people who cling the and the way they cling Narrows the range which they have

375
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:31,280
they're not going to budge they're going to be frozen kind of like and just maybe they'll smile you know and and so they're damping down

376
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:37,140
and for them as they relax they're clinging they begin having a much wider

377
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:43,619
range what the right range is for and for people is a very individual

378
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:50,280
and there shouldn't be any comparison to others what the only thing is get out of the way and don't add clinging to make

379
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:57,720
it worse this helps thank you yeah or maybe one more if you have any

380
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,578
so a build button in the quarter

381
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:12,660
thank you for the talk uh so nice to be here this is my first time back since

382
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:18,119
since it's the shutdown um so I just got through watching a global

383
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:25,099
Joy Summit it was a multiple day thing it had speakers from

384
00:41:25,099 --> 00:41:31,980
all sorts of you know from contemplative sciences and you know neuroscience and

385
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:37,619
different spiritual leaders and it was really amazing and it started with

386
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:43,800
um a documentary that is available to everybody uh where Desmond Tutu and

387
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:52,079
Dalai Lama it's a if you look for them and and joy it

388
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:58,800
comes up and it's it's just really timely what you're talking about also with the Eightfold Path well on its way

389
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:04,980
here um but one of the biggest things because both of them have gone through such

390
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:10,740
tremendous suffering their countries have and they have but to see the two of

391
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:18,078
them together was really remarkable they were like lovers because they couldn't keep their hands off of each other

392
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:23,880
and and it was I guess what what I took away from that and and today

393
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:30,780
um it's not about denying suffering at all absolutely not these people these two

394
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:36,060
leaders absolutely faced it but it's almost like a choice to

395
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:43,619
purposely make space for joy and to and to to see it to see the opportunities for

396
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:49,260
it to claim it in a sense when it's available I I guess that's what I took

397
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:56,339
away from it it's in no way is it meant to deny the suffering at all it's more

398
00:42:56,339 --> 00:43:03,540
of a purposeful claiming of joy is that about

399
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:09,300
in line with with what you're saying I think it's close enough uh I think I

400
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:16,200
like what you're saying right so I feel a little hesitant about claiming it seems a bit strong but I think that

401
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:21,420
uh there are all kinds of ways in which people

402
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:28,339
are there are people out in the world who are trying to make you miserable I mean terrorists for example and

403
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:34,260
politicians and all kinds of people and it's a revolutionary act to not buy into it

404
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:41,520
and it's a revolutionary and Powerful act not to give into fear not to give into anger when there's a lot of people

405
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:47,220
coming at you with with giving you a reason or ordinary motivation to be that

406
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:55,380
way so to appreciate how how radical it is to stay happy

407
00:43:55,380 --> 00:44:00,960
but how to do it so it's genuine is the art there's so many people who do it in

408
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:06,060
a fake way who do it as a veneer and that doesn't help either

409
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:12,440
so I think meditation is one of the means by which to keep it sincere or

410
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:17,579
authentic for ourselves because you if you're really practicing mindfulness and

411
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:23,040
being present you'll feel that the veneer doesn't work

412
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:28,740
the pretending doesn't work and or the insistence

413
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:34,319
but I think that I believe that the examples you give are fantastic examples

414
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:39,960
of people who have stood up against the suffering and the evil of this world and

415
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:45,599
demonstrated an alternative in such a way that inspired people to live a

416
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:51,180
different way so yes so um please

417
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:56,579
if you want to change this world in a very good way be happy

418
00:44:56,579 --> 00:45:03,780
please and it's not easy for those of you who

419
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:11,099
struggle with this topic I don't want to pretend that it's easy but it's really worthwhile to be on this

420
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:18,599
path and there is a path that you can take and sometimes the path is slow but it's

421
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:26,880
really worthwhile and to knowing you're on a path is one of the recipes for at least gladness if

422
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:32,640
not for joy so thank you very much and those of you

423
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:38,099
would like to stay we'll go uh there's folding chairs in the little cabinet just around the corner there in the

424
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:46,220
other room take one with you outside and then we'll we can meet outside and continue our discussion thank you
