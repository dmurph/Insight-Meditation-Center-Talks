1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:08,480
so good day to everyone and welcome to our dharma time together

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:18,160
and um so for this uh sunday morning meditation

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,840
i'd like to use an analogy a little bit of rough analogy

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:30,880
is that if you put black duct tape around a light bulb

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:38,239
and then turn on the light bulb there might be no light coming into the room

6
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,760
if you take a little pin hole make a little pinhole in the duct tape you get

7
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:50,000
you know little stream of light going out in one direction but if you begin peeling away the light

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,440
that the the tape you get more and more the light going more and more wider

9
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,039
wider kind of directions if you take the duct tape off entirely

10
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:09,600
then you have um you know the light shines out in kind of like 360 degrees all the way around

11
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:16,799
so if our awareness our capacity to know and be present is a little bit like the light we turn

12
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,920
on our capacity to to see turn on the light

13
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,560
the capacity to be aware but we have uh something that we're caught up in and

14
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,840
preoccupied with it's like we have the the light can't shine or can't

15
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,520
be open fully in all directions and if we're completely lost in fantasy

16
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,520
or lost in distracted thought it's almost as if there's you know the duct tape is completely surrounding

17
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:51,360
the light and the light is only there for itself it's self-absorbed in a certain way

18
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,880
and all the lights bouncing on it bouncing on inside the bulb

19
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,280
but as we meditate we learn uh we appreciate how limited it is to be caught up in

20
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,879
preoccupations and thoughts even if those thoughts are grand in nature and

21
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:15,200
you know have phenomenal wonderful fantasies of traveling around the world

22
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:22,959
everywhere it's still ingrown in inward directed as we begin to let go of our

23
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:30,959
thoughts and big glow of our preoccupations there is slowly and steadily an opening up of the light opening up of

24
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:37,760
our vision our capacity to see and at some point it really becomes really clear the difference

25
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:44,319
between having it be wide open all the duct tape off and when it's that we start covering it

26
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,920
again and that movement of oh now i'm kind of it's gotten narrow it's gotten

27
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:57,360
contracted it's got become even self-absorbed that doesn't feel so good it felt really

28
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,120
nice to have the awareness uncontracted unlimited

29
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,959
we might still focus on a particular thing like the breathing but we do so without there being a

30
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:15,440
tightening and narrowing there's more like rather than the the attention going really

31
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,519
focused in a tight way it gets really focused in an open way kind of like the open palm of

32
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:27,360
the hand the most sensitive part of the one of the most sensitive parts of the hand is right here

33
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:34,879
at the center of it if we kind of get focused this way you know tight and focused we don't

34
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:40,879
avail ourselves of the most sensitive part but if we're really relaxed and open

35
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:48,959
then the sensitive part meets our experience our breathing and then um

36
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:56,319
so this is an effort to use analogies to emphasize the sensitivity the care

37
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:03,280
to letting our awareness be open be wide be relaxed

38
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,760
be be uncontracted untight unlimited

39
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,879
you know unlimited in a sense by the restrictions we put on it by our

40
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:20,720
desires our clingings and our versions that get you know hyper focused and so if that

41
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,560
made sense to you then we can practice that and if it doesn't make so much sense you don't have to worry about it too

42
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,280
much or at all so assuming a meditation posture

43
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,560
that is

44
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,840
relaxed then open

45
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,638
with the chest maybe it'll open

46
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,240
gently closing the eyes and taking a few long slow deep breaths

47
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:10,320
and as you exhale maybe there can be a relaxation that

48
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,680
it kind of the kind of maybe relaxation that a

49
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:22,840
a flower does when it opens its petals from being a tight bud to being an open

50
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:29,360
flower so to relax and exhale and

51
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:38,000
let things open up

52
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,160
on the exhale relaxing the belly

53
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:53,840
relaxing the chest

54
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:07,840
softening the shoulders

55
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:21,840
softening the face

56
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:03,840
breathing normally

57
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:11,319
and imagine that you're turning on the light of awareness so that it shines

58
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:17,840
360 degrees in all directions

59
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:32,880
and then at the center of that is a sensitive spot that's there to meet

60
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,120
the experience of the body breathing

61
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,800
breathing in and breathing out

62
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,240
being intimate with breathing

63
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,800
but without contracting or getting tight with awareness without the mind

64
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,759
bearing down or tightening up

65
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:27,840
and this kind of intimate sensitivity is often associated with being receptive

66
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:37,360
open receptive to all things but with the center of it all center of

67
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,839
awareness receiving breathing in and breathing out

68
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,760
and perhaps as you get caught up in thoughts or fantasies

69
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:01,120
you can feel how you lose that openness that

70
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,560
maybe is lose a spaciousness or lose a

71
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:12,720
receptivity and without being critical of that

72
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:20,080
relax and receive again open again

73
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:37,839
breathing in and breathing out

74
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,839
so

75
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,839
so

76
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:04,480
are you absorbed in thought so the light of awareness is

77
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,199
obscured

78
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:16,000
what is it like to let go of your thoughts

79
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,959
so that the light of awareness

80
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:33,840
is on 360 degrees very open present

81
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,720
with its sensitive center

82
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:47,840
centered on the breathing

83
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,840
so

84
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,840
you

85
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:13,840
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

86
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:24,840
perhaps to consider how the how as we become more

87
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:32,960
aware more present more open to our experience

88
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:42,640
there is a place within of sensitivity heightened

89
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:50,159
awareness sometimes associated with a tenderness

90
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,679
a place that is receptive and

91
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:09,039
and that to meet the world with this

92
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:17,760
receptivity this tenderness this sensitivity

93
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:27,200
this is a way that we evoke

94
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,720
the sentiments of care caregiving

95
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:42,080
respect good will for others

96
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:52,799
and to end the sitting with some orientation

97
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:03,120
to look upon others be ready to be present with others

98
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:09,760
from a place of receptivity care tenderness

99
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:21,760
that inspires or reminds us of our capacity to love others

100
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,679
to have to be friendly

101
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,320
kind compassionate

102
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:42,720
then may it be that our through this meditation practice

103
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:53,519
that we are giving more and more developing more and more capacity

104
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:58,000
to gaze upon the world kindly

105
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:06,000
to become a friend of the world a friend of others

106
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:15,200
and in our friendship with all beings may we wish for the happiness

107
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,760
of others

108
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:28,399
for their safety and their health

109
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:32,399
for their peace and their freedom

110
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:44,000
and with our friendly disposition may each of us in our own way and

111
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,760
appropriate for each of us contribute to the welfare and happiness

112
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,640
of all beings

113
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:04,240
may all beings be happy may all beings be free

114
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:11,840
may all beings everywhere

115
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:25,840
have their hearts settled and at peace

116
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:32,839
so good day everyone and as an announcement for before before the

117
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:38,320
talk um you know we're getting to the point where

118
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:45,200
imc is seriously considering opening uh for our doors here our physical doors so

119
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:52,240
people can come here together and meditate and engage in the dharma and

120
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:59,359
we were planning to open in a week from today on august 1st so i think it's a prudent for us to

121
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:06,480
delay that opening and continue online the way we have

122
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:14,960
the and the

123
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:23,599
and part of the reason for that is that this delta variant that uh is spreading

124
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,640
and we don't quite understand the implications of it and the impact it

125
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:34,400
has that the degree to which even people who maybe have been vaccinated

126
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:40,160
can be asymptomatic carriers of it and what it means for us to come together here and

127
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:48,079
you know somewhat close confines and as it's still kind of growing the delta variant and the cases are

128
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:53,920
growing here in our county here in california i think that the prudent thing to do is

129
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:00,560
to wait and ideally we would wait and i think until

130
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:08,560
the local county health department rescinds the request that people who

131
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:14,640
even vaccinated people when they come together indoors that they would

132
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:21,119
wear masks so i don't know if that's the standard we want to keep but at least for now that's the request and

133
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:27,359
with the delta variant i think it's just better to wait and um so i think we'll we'll just keep

134
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:34,079
it open or in you know undefined when we'll open and probably will have

135
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:40,640
at least a week's notice that we can announce it here and our other uh online

136
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:47,920
um or other online offerings and also we'll

137
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:55,200
we'll update the calendar we'll update also on the imc website about what's happening so hopefully to

138
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:00,400
keep it keep track of these things you'll know those of you who are interested in

139
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:09,838
coming locally and being here in person

140
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:17,040
so you know we've gone through many of us all of us i guess uh many many months

141
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:22,400
now of this pandemic of covet 19

142
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:28,720
era and um and you know when it first started here

143
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:35,599
and we went into shelter and place in california back in march or april i gave a talk about this being a time

144
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:40,720
for kind of the shelter in place was kind of like a retreat and

145
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:48,000
the many of the dynamics and that the patterns that happened on retreat would probably unfold for people on this

146
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,720
enforced retreat of the shelter in place and now we're coming to a different

147
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:00,000
phase of it it's not clear exactly what phase it's premature to say that we're

148
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:06,079
completely open again and it's over here in california at least in parts of the country and parts of the

149
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:11,520
definitely parts of the world it's raging and surging and you know tremendous

150
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:17,119
suffering that's continuing with this virus

151
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:22,720
and um but to have some reflection uh what are the lessons from this what

152
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:28,000
are the how do we grow and develop under the impact

153
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,400
of this powerful event that's happening to us all

154
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:43,440
and so that's a little bit inspires this talk today and uh and i want to before i specify

155
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,720
what the theme is i want to say that one of the first things that really

156
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:55,359
impressed me about the circumstance of the beginning of the pandemic beginning

157
00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:01,119
of shelter and place is that um

158
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:06,400
the same behavior looking like outside can look exactly

159
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:15,119
the same it could be behavior which the main motivation is for individuals to protect themselves

160
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:21,839
and the same behavior that looks exactly the same would be to behave in such a way as to

161
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:27,599
protect others so what i mean by that is that we're all

162
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:35,359
you know subject to being maybe getting sick from the virus and so we

163
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:41,280
might want to stay away from people who have the virus we want to shelter in place we might want to live apart and

164
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:47,440
that's what many of us have done now for many months and somewhat many people somewhat isolated

165
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:53,520
existences for this time and so it can be motivated by protecting oneself

166
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:59,200
however all of us are capable of being a vector for it the transmitter of the

167
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:05,839
illness we know that the people can have the virus and be asymptomatic

168
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:13,359
they have no idea that they're carrying it and they're just walking walking transmitters and

169
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:19,280
and so one way to protect people our neighbors our friends our family and others

170
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:24,560
is to uh not walk into public not walk into their

171
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:29,760
situation not go to a wedding not go to visit grandchildren or

172
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:37,680
visit grandparents or not to go into places where we might be a transmitter

173
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:43,359
so both behaviors look exactly the same and what struck me at the beginning of

174
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:51,440
the pandemic is that if we could if we were motivated by care for others

175
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:57,520
rather than only protecting ourselves that i think that caring for others is

176
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:03,920
uh is really good for the heart it's really a wonderful kind of medicine

177
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,839
and support there's a kind of a radiance or goodness that comes from that

178
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:16,240
and of course protecting ourselves is not wrong and some people have a higher need to do

179
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:22,319
that than others for many different reasons and that needs to be the focus

180
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:28,800
but even there it's possible to both protect oneself and at the same time do it for the sake

181
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:35,920
of protecting others and and so this idea of being able to do both

182
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:41,760
uh we don't have to choose one or the other and that's kind of the theme of what i'd

183
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:48,480
like to say here is that the buddhist practice is a practice that

184
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:54,240
i'm hoping i very much staked my career in practice and teaching on this

185
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:59,760
that as we develop in the practice that it becomes a natural thing

186
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:05,280
to want to care for others or to be friendly or be supportive or have live in the

187
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:14,720
world in a compassion in a world of suffering in a compassionate way and and not to do it in a way that is

188
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:21,280
oppressive not to do it in a way that is stressful but really from the abundance

189
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:30,560
of the heart from a sense of the peacefulness the openness the heightened kind of 360 degree radiance

190
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:37,200
of awareness and the heart of compassion that meets the world with our sensitivity and

191
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:43,520
responds to it in some way and that and that this is an integral

192
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:50,240
part of buddhist practice is this uh growing to become someone who will

193
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:57,599
uh in one way or the other in particular for each person how it's done live for the welfare and

194
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:02,720
happiness of others and for some people it's uh caring for their family

195
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:08,560
that's what for some people is caring for family and neighbors for some people it's

196
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:16,079
offering whatever they have to offer that brings joy and happiness to the world some people it's to do

197
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:21,920
to be actively involved in service roles where we're helping others and involved others and some people are

198
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:29,359
activists and involved in social action and some people humanitarian efforts is all

199
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:35,359
this whole range of things that people will choose that's a lot depends on their karma and their disposition and their

200
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:42,480
circumstance what's the right way but it's always of somehow having a

201
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:48,880
heart that cares for the world so when the buddha after the buddha was

202
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:54,240
first awakened and soon thereafter he set forth out into

203
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:59,680
the world to teach what he had learned and after some period

204
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:06,880
he had gathered around him 60 people 6-0 who

205
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:12,160
who had been transformed by his teachings and the practices taught

206
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:19,040
and they became fully enlightened fully liberated and at that point he told them and this

207
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:26,160
is a quote this is a passage that's quoted often it's kind of beautiful he instructed them he gave them the

208
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:31,680
final instruction it's kind of like after all the instructions and all the practice

209
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:38,960
they all end up here as a final and that is to go forth

210
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:45,359
for the welfare of the world welfare of the beings the

211
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:50,960
people of the world go forth for the happiness

212
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:57,680
of this world of beings go forth out of care

213
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:04,319
for this world of beings and people no two of you of you go in the same

214
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:10,160
direction spread out and live for the practice and teach

215
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:16,720
for the welfare and happiness of all people and all gods

216
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:23,280
the word gods here it's possible it means sometimes the word dev deva means

217
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:31,280
kings so go for the four for the welfare of all beings all humans ordinary humans and those who

218
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:36,880
are in ruling position who sometimes need greater greater

219
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:43,680
remedial support for learning how to be free and really understand what freedom from

220
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:51,280
suffering really is and um so i i love this little passage

221
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:59,119
that uh that the instructions are to go forth for the welfare and happiness of the of the world um that that's that's kind

222
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:06,079
of like it's like the north star of what buddhist practice is aiming towards uh this is the final

223
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:11,680
instructions and um and then if we go to a whole different

224
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:19,200
set of teachings which is uh also emphasizes this care for others and care for

225
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:26,480
oneself and this is the buddha's teachings to his son so he had a son who spent much of his

226
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:34,480
growing up under the guidance of his father from the they think about from the age 7 onwards

227
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:40,480
and at some point the buddha gave him this instructions that could be

228
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,920
seen some people say well this is kind of a child appropriate kind of teaching but

229
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:52,480
because it's so simple and so to the heart of the matter it may be easier to understand and all

230
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,839
the rest of buddhism can be seen as an expansion of this particular teaching

231
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:05,040
it's uh it seems the way the story is go is told that his young son maybe seven eight

232
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:10,720
nine years old was caught telling a lie

233
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:16,480
and and so the buddha

234
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:23,680
addresses him about this and says you know that if a someone on the spiritual path tells

235
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:30,240
a lie it kind of undermines the value of their practice

236
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:36,720
and really empties the kind of reservoirs of goodness or dharma inside of a person that really

237
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:44,079
would allow a person to grow and develop so he kind of kind of little bit strong strong language like this like that it's

238
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:49,839
not really that someone who's on the path should never lie

239
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:57,839
and and after he does that he says this he says what's the purpose of a mirror

240
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:05,200
and his son says oh the purpose of a mirror is for reflection to see yourself in the mirror and the buddha said in the

241
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:10,960
same way the dharma is like a mirror the purpose is to see yourself and to reflect

242
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:19,280
yourself more clearly and this is how you do it before you

243
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:25,760
say something before you do something and before you intentionally think about

244
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:31,359
something you should reflect you should look at that

245
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:39,760
take a good look at yourself with these criteria is what i'm about to say will it cause

246
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:47,839
affliction will it cause harm to yourself

247
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:53,040
others or to both self and others

248
00:48:53,280 --> 00:49:01,599
if you say it if you do it or even if you think it will it cause harm and if it does

249
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:08,720
don't do it if it doesn't cause harm if it's for the benefit of others then

250
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:15,280
please go ahead and do it while you're doing something or saying

251
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:22,559
something or even while you're reflecting and thinking about something also use that dharma mirror look at

252
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:30,640
yourself and ask yourself the question as i'm doing this is it for my own harm for the harm of

253
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:39,359
others or for the harm of both self and others and if it's harmful stop doing it

254
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:46,720
if it's not harmful if it's for the benefit of others and self then keep doing it

255
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:52,160
and then he says after you've done something after you said something after you've

256
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:58,160
finished some action that you've done after you've spent some time thinking about

257
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:05,520
someone or someone something you should also use a dharma mirror to be released reflective life

258
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:11,599
questioning yourself looking at yourself considering the impact the consequences

259
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:17,599
of your behavior and and did it cause harm to yourself

260
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:23,359
did it cause harm to others did it cause harm to self and others

261
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:30,720
if it did then go find someone that you respect a lot the ancient language is a wise person

262
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:36,240
find a wise person and let them know this the alchemy the

263
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:41,359
chemistry of the inner life is such that if you if you've caused

264
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:48,240
harm and usually like not exactly a confession but just kind of make it acknowledged in the presence of

265
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:56,480
something else it changes the some inner relationship to it all it's easier for you to kind of not

266
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:02,160
succumb to the same thing again it's it's more likely to be if you're accountable in some healthy

267
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:08,000
way um and uh and you're not in your little not public to everyone but

268
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:14,480
you share it with someone else then you're a little bit more accountable to that person to yourself it's a little

269
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:20,400
bit more like a fuller recognition that creates the conditions that you're more likely to be

270
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:26,160
careful in the future so he said buddha said go tell someone

271
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:32,559
and then but if it's uh after you've done something and it's uh

272
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:40,319
has not been harmful to anyone for self or others has been beneficial then just go about your business happily

273
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:45,680
that's that's great so what we find here at uh at the

274
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:52,079
if teaching his son when his son was just a kid is kind of like the most beginning level

275
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:59,760
of dharma practice dharma teaching that here also we find a concern

276
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:06,240
emphasis on the concern of being care careful for the welfare of others to not cause

277
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:12,400
harm in the world to anyone including oneself and

278
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:18,079
it wasn't only about not harming harming oneself only doing things beneficial for oneself

279
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:23,280
it's equal concern for self for others and then this third category

280
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:29,839
self and others which i understand that's that includes kind of we as a as a

281
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:35,520
community we as a as a group as a dynamic of people who work together the

282
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:42,000
relationship between us and um so one way so we see here in

283
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,040
these two examples how integral it is to the teachings of

284
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:52,880
the buddha the concern for the welfare of others and well-being of others and

285
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:59,200
the concern with not causing harm to others or and to ourselves and that

286
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:05,839
all along from between the beginning instructions to the final instructions to go forth for the welfare of others

287
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:13,839
we see over and over again that we come back to this idea that um that the dharma has a lot dharma

288
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:19,760
practice maturing in the dharma has a lot to do with how we care for others as well

289
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:25,040
and with the example that is what i was inspired by at the beginning of the pandemic

290
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:32,559
perhaps also we begin discovering a way of having this care and

291
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:38,000
sensitivity and carefulness for the welfare of others to not cause harm

292
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,200
that doesn't feel punitive that doesn't feel constricting it doesn't feel limiting

293
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:50,720
but actually it's opposite that as we go forward that um and consider others that we're

294
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:57,119
doing so from this openness this uh uh uh you know uh

295
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:05,040
uh uh inclusiveness this um uh unconstricted place unlimited place

296
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:11,280
un uh whether we're not our concerns are not narrowed and tight

297
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:19,280
but our concerns come out of an openness and a wideness and a receptivity all the way around and that

298
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:24,400
and there's a way in which when we're excessively concerned with ourselves

299
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:30,960
our own cons you know our own well-being our own you know protecting ourselves or

300
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:37,680
benefiting ourselves as i said earlier sometimes that's completely appropriate and necessary

301
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:43,119
and should be appreciated as such but human beings also have a tremendous

302
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:49,280
capacity for being selfish for having conceit and when that happens

303
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:56,400
then the self-concern feels like a narrowing a tightening a shutting down

304
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:02,640
and this is one of the great advantages of meditation is we can have a experienced

305
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:09,200
experiential a felt sense experience of what it feels

306
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:15,920
like to be start closing down constricting tightening the tension and the stress of

307
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:22,559
selfishness the tension and stress of conceit of excessive self-preoccupation

308
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:29,839
and uh and and a felt sense experience that when we open up there's a way

309
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:35,680
of caring for the world that is absence of stress absence of a kind of

310
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:40,720
tension that feels has a kind of a

311
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:46,079
uh a rightness to it a nourishing to it a

312
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:54,079
a freedom to it even if what we're encountering in the world the suffering in the world is quite uncomfortable

313
00:55:54,319 --> 00:56:00,000
and this kind of the goodness of this the support of that and so i think that kind of inherent in

314
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:07,119
the dharma practice is a learnings perhaps a slow learning

315
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:13,920
of the disadvantages of shutting down closing down or having this very strong

316
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:19,680
um division divisiveness boundaries between self and

317
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:25,280
others that is actually kind of harmful to oneself

318
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:31,599
and it leads to ways easy ways of harming others that those begin to dissolve begin to

319
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:37,200
soften to open and it isn't that the boundaries completely dissolve exactly

320
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:44,400
uh between self and other that distinction doesn't completely disappear but it becomes one that is there's a

321
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:49,839
sensitivity and openness and intimacy without this strong reference to

322
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:57,280
me myself and i here and openness relaxation freedom

323
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:02,559
and um and then one more teachings of the buddha around

324
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:10,880
this it's such a i think a very important topic to think carefully about and that is that

325
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:16,880
the buddha gave this teachings about four different ways in which people

326
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:22,960
might orient themselves towards others or to benefiting others the first one is

327
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:30,559
to have no interest in the welfare of either oneself or others the second is to be interested

328
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:36,240
in the welfare and happiness of others but not oneself

329
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:43,280
the third is to be concerned for the welfare and happiness of oneself but not be involved in benefiting others

330
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:52,160
and the fourth is to be concerned for the welfare and happiness of oneself of others and of the whole world

331
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:59,280
and then he goes on to say that the last of these uh is the foremost is the best and that

332
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:07,200
it he says it's kind of like um uh if you take milk and it gets in the inc

333
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:12,319
you could be it gets curdled into curds and then from the curds you can make

334
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:17,520
ghee and from ghee apparently you can get the cream of the ghee like the

335
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:23,599
the the best parts of the ghee if you separate it maybe or something and at least the translation that i have

336
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:29,839
says that then finally you get to the cream of the ghee and and the last category the person is

337
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:35,599
concerned for both self and the whole world that's kind of the equivalent of the cream of the ghee kind

338
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:41,440
of person the foremost person but what's interesting is that there's a hierarchy here

339
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:47,119
between these and and where caring only for others or caring

340
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:52,559
only for ourself fits into these categories is fascinating i think

341
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:59,680
because the second best is to care for oneself without caring

342
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:05,440
for others third best is caring for others but not oneself

343
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:12,559
and this i think is a little bit jarring it was a little bit jarring for me when i first saw it for some people's jarring because

344
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:18,400
sometimes there's a message that we should really care about others first before ourselves we shouldn't be selfish

345
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:25,839
and caring for others is really the highest kind of virtue we can have but i think in the buddhist analysis

346
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:31,599
that if we care for others before we have developed ourselves developed

347
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:38,319
our own capacity and understanding of liberation of freedom before we've

348
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:45,599
kind of freed ourselves of some of our capacity for attachments for clinging

349
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:53,760
for hostility and irritation and cynicism and and resentment and

350
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:59,599
that then it's all too easy to cause harm when we're involved in supporting other

351
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:04,960
people but if we practice for our own benefit first

352
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:12,480
then we learn at some point what the highest benefit is we learn what the human capacity is for

353
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:19,760
real deep thorough going fully embodied heartfelt well-being and peace and

354
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:25,280
happiness that's what the dharma is moving towards and then when we want to support

355
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:31,680
and help others we have a reference point of how deeply and fully this is possible

356
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:37,520
for people that we can point to that or we can support that or we have a north star

357
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:44,880
of what we're trying to do for them and uh and so

358
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:51,359
um but the best of it all is if we live our lives caring for

359
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:57,920
ourselves caring for others and caring for the whole world and so here we see three different examples

360
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:04,079
of the buddhist teachings where caring for the world is integral to it

361
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:10,400
and in the last one i told first about sending people off to fully mature people to care for the

362
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:17,280
world there's the idea is that when you're fully liberated you ha you've experiencing for yourself

363
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:22,559
the best possible way of living in this world the greatest happiness the greatest peace

364
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:29,440
so there's no need to kind of focus on oneself in the same way anymore to attain that what's been attained and

365
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:36,720
then what's next is to care for others so whether one is beginning in practice

366
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:42,319
or in the middle of practice or at the end of the whole cycle of practice

367
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:49,280
that in the buddhist teachings at least that this

368
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:56,480
inclusion of the well-being of others is important and and in the first beginning teachings

369
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:02,240
to his son tremendous care about the consequences

370
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:10,240
of our actions what's the impact that we our lives how we live has in the world around us and one of

371
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:15,359
the things that the coronavirus teaches us is that that impact might be

372
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:20,960
invisible to us how we buy consumer goods

373
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:29,440
uh you know we don't see the impact of the on the people who

374
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:37,839
mine the resources we don't see the impact on the countries and the peoples from whose who made it in fact

375
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:44,079
sweat houses or in factories we don't see the impact in pollution and the environment in the communities

376
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:52,160
that are impacted by that and so to be concerned about the impact the consequence of our actions on

377
01:02:52,160 --> 01:03:01,119
others can also start to involve a care and sensitivity to the unseen ways

378
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:09,760
that we impact the world because it would be nice if we could live in the world without

379
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:17,760
any harm caused to this world both seen and unseen known and unknown

380
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:23,760
what a great thing it would be and what a great thing is to meet people and know there are people in this world

381
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:31,680
who are living with this kind of care and this kind of sensitivity because they're free because they

382
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:38,000
matured and developed and they know how to do this in a way that nourishes the best in our

383
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:43,359
hearts so as we come to the end i know the end

384
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:49,920
we've come to this this phase of the pandemic i think it's a wonderful time to reflect

385
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:58,559
a little bit about how how beneficial it is for self and for

386
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:04,799
others to include in our practice the welfare and happiness of others as

387
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:13,760
well so thank you very much
