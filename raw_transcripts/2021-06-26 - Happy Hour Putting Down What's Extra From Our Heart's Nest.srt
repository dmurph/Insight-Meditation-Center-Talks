1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,359
so hello and welcome everyone

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,080
give our practice space together

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,380
so for the theme of today's practice i'd like to um

4
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:22,400
[Music] pick up in this similar vein

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:31,840
where we're practicing on wednesday with the theme of putting down or letting go

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:40,640
and bring another nuance another consideration into it

7
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:48,239
and and this idea of letting go of what is not beneficial

8
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:55,920
what is not wholesome what is not needed in this moment in order to make space

9
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,239
for what is wholesome to make space for peace to make space for during our meditation

10
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:09,840
quiet silence as a way of also self-care as an expression of love

11
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,520
for ourselves taking care of ourselves and taking care of others when we're

12
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:23,280
more available when there is more care we care for ourselves with more stillness and love and

13
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,479
one quote that i like to bring in to inspire to inspire

14
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:37,118
to be served as an inspiration for our practice together

15
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:44,000
is a quote by thomas merton

16
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:52,840
who was a [Music] mystic writer priest

17
00:01:52,840 --> 00:02:00,159
um and [Music] yeah beautiful being so

18
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:06,960
um here is the quote the rush and pressure of modern life and

19
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,319
mind you he wrote this i think he passed away in the 40s am i

20
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:19,280
right let me quickly check he passed away well anyway he passed away long before the age of the intern he he

21
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,879
passed away in 1968 so he definitely wrote this even before

22
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,640
the age of the internet so whatever he's saying about the busyness of modern life you

23
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:39,280
can put it on steroids and and imagine just how much more profound of course this applies to our situation so

24
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,440
uh yes he was a tapist monk that is he was a tapest monk theologian

25
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:53,599
mystic poet social activist and scholar so so he says the rush and pressure of

26
00:02:53,599 --> 00:03:02,239
modern life are a form perhaps the most common form of its innate violence

27
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:10,319
to allow oneself to be carried away by a multitude of conflicting concerns to surrender

28
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:18,080
to too many demands to commit oneself to too many projects to want to help

29
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:25,599
everyone in everything is to succumb to violence the frenzy

30
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:31,080
of our activism the frenzy uh the frenzy of our activism

31
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:39,040
neutralizes our work for peace it destroys our own inner capacity for peace

32
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:45,760
it destroys the faith the fruitfulness of our work of our own work because it kills the

33
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,040
root of inner wisdom which makes work fruitful

34
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:57,360
so i'll reread a part of this again the russian pressure of modern life are

35
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,400
a form perhaps the most common form of its innate violence

36
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,239
to allow oneself to be carried away by a multitude of conflicting concerns

37
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:13,599
to surrender to too many demands to commit oneself to too many projects

38
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:20,239
to want to help everyone and everything is to come succumb to violence

39
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:28,240
so powerful words this busyness of our modern lives

40
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:37,120
to want to help everyone in everything to be carried away by a multitude of conflicting concerns

41
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,040
surrendering to too many demands it kills the inner peace it kills our inner peace which really is

42
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,919
the foundation for service

43
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,840
to care for ourselves and for others so with this as an

44
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:01,440
inspiration i'd like to lead us into a guided meditation especially this

45
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:09,520
friday and for some of you saturday or merry christina sydney australia stillness in a way to

46
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:16,880
let go to let go to put down to put down all the multitudes just to come back

47
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,919
just to come to our heart to this moment

48
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,240
so so i'd like to invite you to land

49
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,000
in your meditation posture

50
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:41,520
whatever is supportive for you in this body sitting lying down

51
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:53,759
and can we let go can we let go in this moment

52
00:05:53,759 --> 00:06:07,840
our preoccupations not necessary in this moment

53
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,960
can we set our intention at the outset set our intention

54
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:22,720
with uprightness with a sense of integrity and dignity

55
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:39,038
can we set our hearts our intention to put down to let go

56
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,199
oh what is not necessary right now what is extra

57
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:49,840
preoccupations worries

58
00:06:50,400 --> 00:07:03,840
as much as possible as much as it may be available

59
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:36,800
and having set our intention with wholesomeness letting go from putting down

60
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:45,840
ah can we release is it possible to invite

61
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,160
the tension in the body to be

62
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:02,240
softened released the tightness the holding can we bring our awareness

63
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:12,560
letting go of thoughts preoccupation stories can we put down the stories right now

64
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:20,240
release the stories no stories right now thank you stories

65
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:27,680
not needed in this moment and gently invite our awareness to the

66
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,120
body to the experience of breathing

67
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:41,839
being breathed

68
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:15,920
letting the bear the breath fill the abdomen the chest the whole body on

69
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,639
its own no work needed

70
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,480
with our end just noticing that it's already happening

71
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,240
simply being aware simply being aware

72
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:51,839
no extra effort is needed putting down the extra effort

73
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,839
this

74
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,839
this

75
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,839
this

76
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,839
this

77
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:43,200
can this putting down for what is not needed in this moment

78
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,760
is extra be seen as

79
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:57,839
care as meta as love for ourselves

80
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:06,000
this relinquishment it's a foundation of inner peace

81
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:13,600
it's a foundation make space for care and love

82
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:25,839
for ourselves and others and the world

83
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,199
can we let go release

84
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,440
this inner violence of our times

85
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:31,839
in the words of thomas merton

86
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:59,839
the inner preoccupation with all the demands we have taken up in this moment

87
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:09,600
relinquish push release favor of peace stability

88
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:27,839
space to be and not do non-doing

89
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,839
this

90
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:15,840
can we see the equivalence of relinquishment

91
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:29,840
and love

92
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:35,919
relinquishing what's not needed what's extra

93
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:42,960
what's burdensome to release into love and care for

94
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:57,840
ourselves stillness and in spaciousness

95
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,840
this

96
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,840
this

97
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,840
this

98
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,840
this

99
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,320
this can inner silence

100
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:37,279
be a place for loving oneself caring for oneself stilling the mind

101
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,840
feeling nourished

102
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,840
this

103
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,840
this

104
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:23,760
even if it's a mindstorm in this moment simply ask is it possible to put it down

105
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:31,600
in this moment is it possible just gently ask the question without

106
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,320
forcing without forcing

107
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:43,840
just gently ask the question and often with that question alone

108
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,480
things are let go of and if not it's okay

109
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:03,600
be patient giving it space a lot of space

110
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,480
it doesn't have to be center stage plenty of space

111
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:21,840
for stillness and silence

112
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,840
this

113
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,840
this

114
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,840
this

115
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:40,880
putting down again and again whatever is extra

116
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:50,799
doesn't serve needs to be put down again and again it's okay with patience

117
00:31:50,799 --> 00:32:01,840
gentleness and ease

118
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,200
it's a way to nourish to care for yourself

119
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:31,600
as if you're a little tricky the comfortable nest

120
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:43,600
nurturing soothing nest of your heart letting go of whatever is

121
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:57,840
extra in the nest take space

122
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:07,039
resting resting in the nest of the heart

123
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:25,840
without clutter without what's extra

124
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:49,839
this

125
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:11,760
and for the last moments of this practice period as we

126
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:20,160
come to a close is any criticism self-judgment arises

127
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:25,680
or how it went or how it didn't go for you

128
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:33,680
it's extra it's extra

129
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:41,359
self-criticism doesn't need to be in the nest of the heart

130
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:48,320
letting go letting go relinquishing releasing

131
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:55,440
and appreciating that you showed up you tried as best as you were able to

132
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,680
given the causes and conditions in this

133
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:08,240
moment and letting go of whatever arose or did

134
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:14,480
not arise and meeting this moment this moment

135
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,838
fresh and a new

136
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:33,838
may all beings be free including us

137
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:55,280
thank you all thank you for your practice

138
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:02,480
ah so before we turn to practicing

139
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:10,000
in small groups in sangha and community i'd like to invite you if you like to

140
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,200

141
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:21,599
observations you can type them in chat if it's to everyone i'll read your name

142
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:30,640
if it's just to me it'll be private i won't say your name out loud and i read the reflection you can also

143
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:36,720
raise your zoom hand especially if you haven't spoken for a while if you haven't shared

144
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:43,440
or if you're new would love to hear your reflections your questions your

145
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:49,119
comments your observations as a gift offered to the sangha

146
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:54,839
to yourself to be held witness and to others always of benefit all reflections and

147
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:58,640
questions so

148
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,359
as i wait for any reflections that might bubble up from you i'll share that for

149
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:16,560
me what i noticed with this practice

150
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:23,760
was a lot of inner stillness a lot of inner care and their stillness as if as

151
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:31,920
a way of nourishment and care um became more and more prevalent

152
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:37,520
and and yes putting things down preoccupations and thoughts over and over again

153
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:43,280
with patience is part of this practice just part of this practice when we've

154
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:48,400
gone through the whole day or whole week with lots of demands

155
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:55,839
especially given our modern lives it's natural to have to put down to gently incline

156
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:04,839
the mind to put down to put down and sometimes it's not possible and that's okay we set the intention

157
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:10,400
of but we're gentle with letting go not being

158
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:16,160
possible nicholas says the phrase

159
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:23,839
sowing seeds of presence came up as a kind response whenever the mind got swept up

160
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:29,039

00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:57,280
um i have too many fans going to have heard you uh the entire uh context of what you

169
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:05,040
were saying but in my meditation i was trying to let go of all of this stuff that was extra

170
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:11,200
and so i heard those words and um it was very helpful i hope you

171
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:17,119

172
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:23,119

thank you noticing what is extra great beautiful thanks nancy and casey please

175
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:47,200
hi nikki thank you so much for a beautiful guide another beautiful guided meditation

176
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:52,240
um there are a lot of phrases tonight that really resonated with me

177
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:58,560
and i had a visceral response i think it was the part where you said putting down as well

178
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:04,480
as there's enough space for stillness and silence and my my body just kind of went like it

179
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:10,880
went like it felt like relaxed like ah and there's like this appreciation

180
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:18,480
um coming forward and it was interesting also when you talked about silence

181
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:25,520
and how um this past year and a half i've been really hypersensitive to sound

182
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:31,040
and i'm not sure if it's because i haven't been able to sleep very well but um

183
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:37,760
there's a lot of noise around me but i crave violence so i was wondering i have such because

184
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:44,000
i'm so hyper sensitive to sound i have like like i've developed i feel like dog ears where i'm just like i wish my hearing

185
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:50,400
wasn't so good it's never been this good but anyways i'm wondering if you have any advice or guidance because i have

186
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,440
such a version to um to sound to a lot of different sounds

187
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:01,040
because my nervous system is out of balance but i i really just want i really crave silence and i know that

188
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:07,119
people have mentioned you know like go in inner silence but i haven't able to master that so any tips

189
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:12,400
would be greatly appreciated yeah yeah thank you casey thank you for what you brought up

190
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:18,640
um and what you're sharing is not uncommon for the past year everything that has happened becoming

191
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:24,319
hyper vigilant and then their sense of ah sounds and you know here i am i don't know if you can hear

192
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:30,960
through the mic the sound of this the ambulance going yeah

193
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:39,040
um so what you're describing the uh the hypersensitivity to sound

194
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:45,599
and the wanting the craving for silence and really is coming through

195
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:52,560
is being co-created by what you mentioned which is the

196
00:45:52,560 --> 00:46:00,000
um the aversion to sound which is the aversion so the aversion is what is making the

197
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:07,040
dog ears the hypersensitivity if there wasn't the aversion there the lens of a version i don't want

198
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:12,079
sound i want silence i once then like you you see you know if if i

199
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:17,760
all of a sudden told you uh color whatever red is terrible bad

200
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:23,920
then all you would see in your environment is color red like oh my god danger danger i don't want color red oh my gosh he's wearing red ah

201
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:30,560
right it just you become hypersensitive to it right so so basically the the clue

202
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:37,920
that the way to work with it is through the aversion really that is what hooking it in place

203
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:45,680
so and that so notice the aversion notice the aversion uh like i hate sound

204
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:52,480
i hate sound why it's just sound it's there's not it's not good it's not bad

205
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,599
it's just in the environment there's so it's it's this

206
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:04,800
affiliation the association that's bringing all the the suffering the way that

207
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:10,000
the mind is seeing it so bring the attention with kindness with

208
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:16,640
gentleness to the aversion like oh sweetie it's it's just a version it's just

209
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:22,319
a version it's okay make friends with the aversion then make friends with what's underneath

210
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:30,480
their vision which is the unpleasant vedana unpleasant feeling tone oh my mind just perceives it as pleasant

211
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:38,880
as unpleasant okay it's just unpleasant big deal and slowly it will lose its

212
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:46,480
its hold on you and there can be a lot of sound without the reactivity and then there

213
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:52,000
can be the nourishing enjoying the inner silence even though it could be a lot

214
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,119
of noise around but it's really i'm pointing to the aversion

215
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:05,200
which is on top of the reactivity to the unpleasantness so so when they're so when the

216
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:12,000
reactivity to the unpleasantness is met with ah it's just unpleasant okay

217
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,119
it's unpleasant big deal it's not gonna kill me it's just not but then you're not giving it power

218
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:23,040
otherwise you're giving power it's unpleasant it's like okay here take you know have power over me like every

219
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:29,040
did you see how it it happens you know unpleasantness so so that's what i would like to offer you

220
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:35,119
as a way to work with it and happen happy to reflect again later come back

221
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:41,599
and and you can share how it went okay great thank you casey

222
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:49,359
so dear once the time has come for us to turn to into small

223
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:56,880
practice groups or sangha to practice together so i'll create the small groups

224
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:04,480
and the invitation is to start with um 15 seconds

225
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:10,720
of silent meta for each other and then take care of

226
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:18,319
each other take care of yourselves really important to be uh sensitive to each other sensitive to

227
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:23,599
yourselves and let go of what is not needed

228
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:30,000
what is not needed just saying only what's what's needed and maybe you'll spend

229
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,359
time in silence and if there's awkwardness in silence

230
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:41,280
awkwardness is not needed let the awkwardness go from your mind see if you can be

231
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:48,480
in community with just care and ease so it can be profound practice put down

232
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:55,839
what is not needed put down what is not needed whether it's i want to sound impressive

233
00:49:55,839 --> 00:50:04,000
not needed oh i don't have anything to say of value not needed just put it all down see what explore

234
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:10,960

all found this to be um you know a very warm warm and sweet experience

240
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:01,680
um you know each each in a different sort of way um it was you know and i will tell you

thank you thank you neil yeah i appreciate the report back from

243
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:22,480
the group it's um meta shows up in so many ways

244
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:28,319
without phrases and making space for meta making space for care and love in this

245
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:35,040
way is quite radical it's actually quite radical and i like to teach to share radical

246
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:42,160
teachings how's that [Laughter] so yes okay so uh

247
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:48,559
let's make this the last comment it's i forget since your your name says

248
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:54,000
iphone uh here please oops

249
00:51:54,720 --> 00:52:01,680
oh wait we're having okay there you go one more time if you mute yourself oh

250
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:09,599
there perfect here it comes so um just just letting you know

251
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:16,160
that i just want to really practice letting go of everything and it feels like it's just

252
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:23,440
letting go of whole series it just like scares me off of like like

253
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:32,240
losing my power over something that i want to accomplish it just to keep like haunting my mind

254
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:36,800
so it caused not letting go

255
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:45,200
so i hope that i you can just give me some advice or maybe i'll just practice more
