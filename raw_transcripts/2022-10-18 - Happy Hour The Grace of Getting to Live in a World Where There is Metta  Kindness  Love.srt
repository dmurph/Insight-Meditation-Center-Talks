alive being it's touching as if your beloved other

163
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:34,100
can feel so miraculous to touch ourselves being touched

164
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:40,980
and touching shift your perspective from your hand to your chest and drift your

165
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:48,559
chest to your hand feel the warmth feel the pressure

166
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:57,240
and maybe if you're have the sense the perspective of the chest it's as if a dear friend putting

167
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:02,960
their hand on your chest sweetheart may you be well

168

174
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,539
of holding touching

175
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:16,620
sometimes when we don't have words actually just this gesture is enough

176
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:23,720
when you have empowered it when you have endowed with meaning it's all that's needed sometimes

240
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:11,160
so many gifts so so we have opportunity right now a few

241
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:16,700
minutes for Reflections for questions for for um

242
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:22,320
comments what you notice what came up for you in the

243
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:30,420
AHA moments you like to share um challenges anything and the invitation

244
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:35,700
is to share for the benefit of yourself and everyone when we share our

245
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:44,119
practice it opens more doors for others so what came up for you

246
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:51,720
always do different practices as happier or the same thing twice I don't think we

247
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:57,240
had ever done it this way as far as I remember the past two and a half years or the past actually more than two and a

248
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:02,700
half years I've been doing happier for what three four five years I don't know I'm losing track

249
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,320
Karina please

250
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:13,800
what was coming up for me was like um I I guess I was just like is it

251
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:18,960
really so amazing that I'm here and like we're having

252
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:26,040
like that we live in I don't know I think I like at times they feel really connected to that

253
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:32,119
um that feeling of like gratitude and at times like today I felt just like really

254
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:37,740
flat and like yeah my brain can recognize like that that's amazing and

255
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:46,140
but my heart was like not there today yeah yeah not a problem no worries

256
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:51,300
um thanks for sharing that and and it's all okay we are planting seeds right

257
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:56,579
we're planting seeds so in some practices you might actually feel that

258
00:38:56,579 --> 00:39:01,920
that sense of awe and some other times as you said the heart is flat and

259
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:07,859
and the more you actually plant these seeds the more

260
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:15,119
your mind will find an inclination towards gratitude and connection so and that's how meta and all these

261
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:20,640
practices work um it um yeah this is how they work it's

262
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:26,400
expected it's not not every single time there's connection with them and and it's perfectly annoying but hang in

263
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,920
there keep without being frustrated I didn't hear frustration in your voice voice which I appreciate it was just

264
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:37,619
like yeah it wasn't there today fine no problem you showed up you planted seeds

265
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:45,180
and now notice how it might show up this is the other interesting thing how it might show up tonight tomorrow the next

266
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:51,900
day you just don't know the story of um and I've seen so many practitioners

267
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:58,320
actually that that practice and and sometimes they say like it feels dry nothing is happening and then later I'm

268
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:04,440
saying wow I'm a different person my life's changed I'm acting differently I feel different I'm like yeah yep yeah

when I'm here but um well Nikki thank you so much that was wonderful

293
00:42:56,579 --> 00:43:03,420
um so I'm in the ninth month of um the year-long program at Spirit Rock

294
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:09,540
um a year to live so I've been spending a lot of time you know thinking about death and dying

295
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:15,240
and this was a wonderful um counterweight to that

296
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:22,380
um to just you know be reminded of how um precious and fleeting our lives are it

297
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:29,460
was wonderful thank you thank you Jamie yeah thank you so much for for speaking and bringing that in

298
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:36,420
yeah it's uh it's such an important aspect of actually mindfulness of death but though I appreciate the the program

299
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:42,420
at Spirit Rock and and the way I teach it I want to prove I like to bring in as much emphasis to the preciousness of

300
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:49,980
life and preparing for death I think that's just as important so thank you for that yeah Claire will let this be

301
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:55,380
the last comment here thanks so much Nikki this this was a

beautiful evening uh it happens to be my birthday so it was a lovely gift happy birthday Claire thank you uh but and

303
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:09,780
what it brought up for me was really beautiful too I come from a musical family and for whatever the reason my

304
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:14,940
mind went deeply into some of my favorite music and I just sort of heard

305
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:21,119
it and I was practically singing through it because I wanted to come but

306
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:29,339
I was hearing in my head and I was really a wonderful experience for me so thank you oh so sweet thank you Claire

310
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:54,119
into groups one person privately uh I had been

311
00:44:54,119 --> 00:45:01,920
challenged to Incline towards gratitude until recently when I took your retreat on death as a practice but that focus on

312
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:07,140
how we don't know when or where we may die has sharpened my focus on the

313
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:12,599
preciousness of every moment oh beautiful thank you so much for sharing that reflection oh that makes me so

314
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:19,260
happy yay beautiful beautiful and let's see

315
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:26,460
um Neil says quotes Richard Dawkins we are going to die and that makes us the

316
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:33,359
lucky ones most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born yes I love that the potential
