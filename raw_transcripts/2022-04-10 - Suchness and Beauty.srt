1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,240
so welcome everyone here in person and

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,360
online i appreciate so much the chance to come

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,920
together for this purpose that we have and to share the dharma now

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:25,039
and uh with this pandemic we've had it's been two years since i've taught my the

5
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,800
unusual intro to meditation class i would sometimes teach it two or three

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,440
times a year and maybe since it's been so long i'd like to do a

7
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,719
demonstration that i often do at the end of the intro class some of you have seen it

8
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:49,600
but i think it'll be done a little bit differently than usual and

9
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,680
it has to do with holding up a flower

10
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,160
and and there is a

11
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:09,280
kind of an important zen story that the zen tradition began

12
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:16,799
when the buddha held up a flower and a particular monk mahakashapa smiled

13
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,840
and the buddha saw the smile and then recognized him as

14
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,320
a kind of a successor a teacher and he then passed the lineage on down through the centuries

15
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,560
until it came to the modern world and it's this little story is a little

16
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,600
bit of a co-on you know some some kind of

17
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,920
you know contemplative question for everyone like why what was it that both why did the buddha just

18
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,040
hold up a flower and why did the monk smile and why was

19
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,520
he smiling so significant is it volume okay is it going in and out

20
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,600
or is it good okay and uh so i can't exactly answer that or

21
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,440
maybe the talk is an answer to it but i just appreciate so much that uh

22
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,280
when we see this flower maybe we see the suchness of the flower

23
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:22,560
the flower is being held up by itself and so it's it's alone it's just the flower it's a nasturtium and some of you

24
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:30,080
might know and it has a particular color and

25
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,080
kind of number of petals and it just kind of allowed to be itself in

26
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,440
the moment and uh so one way of talking about that

27
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,599
is to call it the suchness of the flower it just is itself

28
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:53,120
but i could um i can do something interesting with it

29
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,800
and that is i could hold up another flower

30
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,040
if you can see it there's a maybe it's so small maybe you can't see it so well but there's a little yellow flower next

31
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,080
to the nasturtium and now we can say something we couldn't

32
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,239
say before we can say that nasturtium is the big flower

33
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:22,000
and this little composite is the small flower

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:31,200
and uh and now it's not just the suchness of the flower by itself the suchness now exists in our minds

35
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,640
in relationship to the other flower

36
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,000
i can i'm pretty confident that these flowers if they looked at each other

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,319
are not looking at each other and not thinking about each other and are not comparing each other and doesn't occur

38
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:54,640
to one that i'm the big one and oh no i'm the small one or something

39
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,080
it just the suchness of the flower so but then we could do something very an

40
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,280
interesting thing again is i could put down the small flower

41
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,799
and i can pick up this flower

42
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:17,840
a rose and now we can now something very interesting has happened

43
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:25,280
the small flower the big what was big flower before has now become the small flower

44
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,520
you bring up a big rose next to the nasturtium and the starshim is a smaller flower

45
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,199
and that contrast that comparison of the two of these

46
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,479
flowers does not exist in the flower itself

47
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:50,160
it's a provisional let's say interpretation it's a it's a it's a

48
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,000
provisional label that comes out of the comparative mind that sees one as being different than

49
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,280
the other so this what was big now has become small

50
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,960
so the uh

51
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:17,360
so a tremendous amount of human suffering comes from comparisons

52
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,440
comparing ourselves to ideals we don't live up to ideals

53
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:30,320
we do live up to them and now everyone else should should other people are not living up to them

54
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:36,560
compare comparing ourselves to people compare themselves to each other

55
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,280
sometimes the comparison is that i'm not

56
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,759
as much x as someone else someone else says that you know that uh

57
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,360
you're i'm more you than you like the letter u

58
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,400
uh and uh the uh

59
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:05,280
and then people you know tremendous amount of suffering when those has projected other people that people are somehow wrong and bad because of

60
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,840
something about them because they're old and people use ageism and people who are older will

61
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:18,240
often comment on how they're now ignored or not treated well or sometimes they're treated

62
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,520
you know ways that they wish they weren't because they're seen in some kind of category of being old and

63
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,720
incapable and people are treating them a certain way

64
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,479
people because of their size their compare this comparison people like their hair

65
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:40,000
color here the length of here kind of here skin color

66
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,360
uh ethnicity all kinds of things that people do to compare each other

67
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,360
that and make judgments about the value of one over another

68
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:58,400
we compare ourselves to who we were before before i was young and now i'm not and i

69
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,759
wish i had been young or still young or now i'm not as not as much

70
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,360
as my as as a z as i was before whatever z stands for

71
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,880
i'm not as you know now i'm wrinkled

72
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,880
and rather than and think well in our you know beautiful people don't

73
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,919
have any wrinkles whatsoever i grew up with a person a friend of my

74
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,919
parents the woman apparently never smiled

75
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,560
because she was attempting not to get any wrinkles

76
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,879
and so but what about the suchness of the human

77
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:52,879
being what about your suchness is there such a thing where you can be held up like a flower

78
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:58,720
and you're allowed just to be as you are in the

79
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:05,440
perfection of suchness in the simplicity of suchness without any comparisons at all

80
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,000
what's the beauty of each of us of each of you

81
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,080
in what way are you a flower in what way are you

82
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:25,520
perfect wonderful as you are and is that is that valuable

83
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,720
is that somehow sentimental or pollyannish or

84
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,080
not really realistic because we should be comparing ourselves or

85
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,959
those comparisons are real or they're not real but they're imposed on me the world around me is constantly

86
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:48,800
making comparisons and i'm having i don't feel i'm not i'm not safe in the world because

87
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:56,640
of what people are doing and their comparisons to against me and so to emphasize the suchness of us of us

88
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:04,399
maybe that just allows the status quo to be there the status quo is is harmful

89
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,720
is that the case or is there some way valuable way

90
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:19,519
where we can appreciate our own suchness can we gaze upon ourselves in such a way

91
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:25,440
that the gaze does not have any comparative thinking

92
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,880
we're not compared to before to after

93
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:39,120
to even ideals even wonderful ideals where we're not compared to

94
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:46,800
other people it's just the simplicity of who we are

95
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:53,040
in a way that maybe we allow the flower to be itself

96
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,279
now it's possible in the course of

97
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,920
flowers being flowers and maybe beginning to kind of

98
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:11,120
gather its forces together to focus on making seeds

99
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:17,120
that a wind comes along and it blows off the petal

100
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:23,760
now we have something new in this world that kind of maybe wasn't as clear as

101
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,120
before now we have the suchness of the petal

102
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:35,120
and the petal is just allowed to be itself and it's got a beautiful petal just

103
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:41,519
itself another option

104
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:47,680
is to look at the flower that's still here and believe

105
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:54,399
that the essence of a flower that we have to maintain at all costs

106
00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:00,560
are the petals all the petals and if a flower loses a petal it's no

107
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:06,399
longer perfect it's no longer right but is that the case

108
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:14,120
the natural course of things that the petals fall off a seed is made

109
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:21,200
why do we carry with us the idea of the perfectly full

110
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:28,000
and blossom flower with all its petals is the only suchness of the flower

111
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,839
can't it be that as it as it begins to lose its its petals that

112
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:40,880
it's just as much as suchness as when it was before this rose that

113
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:47,200
came from the here at the grounds of imc

114
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:55,519
is already weathering up i can't maybe see it here but some of the pedals are kind of beginning

115
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:02,160
to curl up and turn brown and probably going to fall off soon and

116
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:09,279
it's possible to see it as being starting to become ugly it's possible

117
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:15,040
but is there a way of seeing this that is seeing it neither as ugly

118
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:23,440
or as beautiful just a suchness of it or is it possible to see beauty

119
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:30,320
in its decay after all it's just the natural process in which it takes

120
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:37,120
the suchness of it everything maybe it's beautiful maybe everything is beautiful

121
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:43,279
in its suchness maybe wrinkles are beautiful i've seen

122
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:50,880
people with exquisite face full of cobweb wrinkles and it literally i

123
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,880
thought wow that is beautiful there's something special about it

124
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:02,720
and i've seen people with just a little bit of wrinkles wow that's beautiful

125
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:09,040
and i've seen faces with no wrinkles wow that's beautiful

126
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:16,160
why not see it all as beautiful why do we have these judgments these comparisons

127
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:22,720
these ideas if we

128
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:28,639
take a flower let's take another one

129
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,240
let's take this one

130
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:41,360
and we single one part of the flower out as being the most important part of the

131
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,880
flower as being a thing that really counts and we're going to protect that at all

132
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,560
cost we're going to be upset if it's not there anymore maybe for this flower what's most

133
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,000
important is that it has supported by these beautiful green leaves

134
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,560
but then someone comes comes along and takes it or it falls off but but but but

135
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:11,680
that's what made the flower a flower or maybe it's a long stem maybe the length of the stem the more

136
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:19,519
longer it is what makes a flower a successful flower but then somehow or other the flower is

137
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:25,199
made smaller oh no shorter oh no

138
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:31,240
i was so attached to it being long that's what really made it a flower

139
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,600
and then the petals start falling off the people who thought that petals were the essence the most important part of

140
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,720
the flower and let's glue it back on

141
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:49,600
you know they have they sell petals at the the local craft store and you know it's important to make the

142
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,600
flower perfect so let's go buy some other bipedals and glue them on when they're falling off

143
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:02,399
these are all kind of silly examples but don't we do this to ourselves

144
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:09,519
aren't we judging ourselves and selecting parts of ourselves out as being what's important and what needs to

145
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:15,440
be held up and made to be the way it is

146
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:23,600
but aren't we innocent in doing this comparisons or in the sense or maybe isn't it

147
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,600
inevitable we do this when the world around us is doing it the social world the people the

148
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,600
advertisements the they're all doing it and they're all holding up a certain way that's supposed

149
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:42,079
to be the ideal in the right way and then people behave that way

150
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:47,519
and people do judge each other and if they're judging each other they

151
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:54,320
might judge me and if they're judging on me and then i don't feel safe and so i better figure

152
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:00,160
out the right length of here that an acceptable person

153
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:07,600
is supposed to have i better figure out the right something and this and that

154
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,800
and people do make adjustments to themselves and you know people i know people like

155
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,480
myself have moved between cultures and then there were different standards

156
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,959
and then you kind of figure out like how do i fit in here and what is expected and what clothes and what

157
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:30,880
ways of speaking and what ways of being and all kinds of things

158
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:37,360
and so you know this once we get into all this complicated social world it's sometimes difficult not to be

159
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:44,560
pulled into this world of selecting parts out of the whole

160
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:54,480
and maybe it's reason to protest maybe it's reason to stand up and point these kinds of terrible things out

161
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:01,040
that goes on but what about the suchness

162
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,880
is that going to be eclipsed is that does that never have a place

163
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:14,480
is there a time and place where we can appreciate the suchness of ourselves of the flower or the

164
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,160
situation the suchness of a moment in time

165
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:26,959
or do we are we always on the treadmill that keeps going on and on

166
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:33,360
of the mind involved in the activity of comparative thinking

167
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,799
the mind involved in not seeing the simplicity of the moment

168
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:44,880
seeing how much suchness is here in some wonderful way

169
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:53,280
the treadmill is that kind of going and going and going churning away thinking wondering

170
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:59,200
and i think sometimes meditators especially when they begin or maybe when

171
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,240
they i don't know can happen anytime

172
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,799
it's possible to be in awe at the treadmill in which the mind is just

173
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:20,799
thinking and comparison stories and ideas and concerns and just like the thoughts just keep going and going

174
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:27,720
but it's not not necessary to live that way all the time

175
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:35,440
just like it's important to eat meals or to eat

176
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,799
it's usually not a good idea to eat non-stop

177
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:47,760
but the mind somehow can go non-stop just churning away churning away

178
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:54,799
and even if some of that churning and thinking and reflection is important

179
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:02,400
it doesn't need to be all continuous and so we come to meditation

180
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:09,280
i think not just to calm ourselves down but it's possible to come to meditation

181
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,880
to come to gaze upon the suchness of ourselves

182
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,000
which i'd like to propose is beautiful

183
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,840
to be able to gaze upon the beauty of who we are

184
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:34,320
which is which is you know that which is most natural about being a human being

185
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,360
what is that this this rose which is decaying turning

186
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:46,000
brown is in the suchness of it all i would say i can i look upon it with a certain

187
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,440
reverence and beauty as it ages and gets brown

188
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:58,320
of course it will why why does it beauty only reside in

189
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:05,559
the full kind of peak vitality of the of the rose

190
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:15,360
and one of the one but one of the fascinating and important ways in which suchness can be seen

191
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:23,440
is with a mind that is not caught up in unskillful states of mind

192
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:30,960
a mind that's not caught up in these comparisons that are driven by

193
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:38,240
fear ill will greed vanity conceit

194
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:45,280
jealousy uh that a whole spectrum of kind of ways in

195
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,799
which we get caught in the mind that's tense and contracted and

196
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:57,520
attached to something that's selecting something out of the whole as being what's important

197
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,679
and some idea that it has to be a particular way

198
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:09,280
the mind that can see suchness is the mind that

199
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:15,360
is not caught in all these mental states of attachment

200
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:22,960
and that is a beautiful mind that's that's a mind that's as beautiful

201
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:29,760
as looking out across the here in california from the beach the the ocean view and looking out across the ocean

202
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,960
and seeing the beauty of the ocean looking at

203
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:42,080
half dome in yosemite looking down into the grand canyon looking up into the night sky and seeing

204
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:48,159
the constellations and stars there are times we look at the natural

205
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,559
world and we're in awe and it's beautiful

206
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,840
but to look into our own mind to look into our own being

207
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:06,000
and be as marvel with that as much as we would at the world at the universe the world

208
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:13,120
outside to be able to see our mind as being

209
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,480
they should probably make it a nation protected national monument

210
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,320
or maybe each of us that we know that

211
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:30,480
maybe you know if maybe that's where the next time the park service kind of makes a national park

212
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:36,720
it should be the suchness of everyone's minds the mind that does not caught up in

213
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:42,000
these concepts and comparative thinking it's a phenomenally beautiful thing this

214
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,679
mind this heart and to see the world

215
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:54,400
with that beautiful mind that beautiful heart allows us then to see the suchness

216
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:00,320
of people suchness of other people their beauty as they are we look at the

217
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:06,320
rose that's decaying and it's a beautiful rose maybe we want to bow down to the rose

218
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,399
it's so beautiful we have a reverence and care

219
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:18,320
the ability to see the beauty see the suchness of things

220
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:24,880
i've been to the bedside of someone who had died and it was profoundly beautiful in the

221
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,080
suchness of it is it okay to say that

222
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:37,919
probably i'd be careful to say that if the relatives are all quite upset and grieving and or whatever

223
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:43,919
i might not say it then but is there something about

224
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:51,840
seeing everything in this life except

225
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:58,480
those things that are driven by hatred driven by greed

226
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:06,400
driven by delusion or attachment do they belong to the world of suchness

227
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,400
in some ways they do

228
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:21,120
but they are born from an inability to appreciate the

229
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:27,840
suchness of life they they are born from a mind that doesn't see the beauty of its of

230
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:34,320
itself they're born from hearts that are withered and contracted and

231
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:40,320
in pain and so they don't have the ability to

232
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:48,960
touch into or be resting in or be grounded in this beautiful quality of our life

233
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:58,320
everything is beautiful when they are free

234
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,840
of great hatred and delusion

235
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:18,080
but it's a lot of it depends on the how your mind is the ability to see it

236
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,320
so if we're looking out and expecting to see

237
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:29,120
the beauty and suchness and appreciate that in the world without somehow

238
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:34,960
finding it in ourselves it's probably not so stable or so

239
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:41,039
accurate or something so some meditation

240
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:49,278
buddhist meditation as a way of coming into ourselves

241
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:57,840
to be set ourselves free of our attachments are clinging

242
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:03,520
not so that we just are i don't know detached

243
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,640
but so that we can appreciate and see the beautiful suchness

244
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:15,279
of this world where there's no clinging no grasping no hatred

245
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:22,799
and then we can be and then we can start kind of being the

246
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:28,880
suchness there is a acting living in the world

247
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,159
from the suchness with the suchness what's that like

248
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:39,840
it's a life which is free free of attachment

249
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:47,760
so for me this uh whole movement of mindfulness and meditation is such a phenomenally wonderful thing

250
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,600
we're doing something i almost have you know kind of a deep reverence for

251
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:59,520
like i do for the night sky looking into the amazement of it or

252
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:06,559
beautiful scenery in the night in the natural world or taking the time to walk in the garden

253
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:12,320
and see the flowers appreciate each flower for itself or

254
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:21,000
take a time to see a hummingbird and the incandescent color and the flittering around it's so beautiful

255
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:27,200
it takes time to stop and appreciate

256
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,919
the suchness of our mind the suchness of the world

257
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:40,000
and then we're available to live a wiser life

258
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:46,880
because of what what a wonderful thing to live a life that comes out of that

259
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,159
recognition of suchness recognition of beauty

260
00:27:52,159 --> 00:28:00,399
that is so easily overlooked in ourselves and others in this world

261
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:07,039
and it's overlooked when we our attention becomes excessively selective

262
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:14,159
it's only about how long the stem is it's only about the kind of the full complement of

263
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:20,159
petals are there it's only about some aspect of it that we hold on to

264
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:25,600
this is what it's about this is who i have to be this is what i'm about

265
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:34,559
there is a few mentions in the ancient teachings of the buddha of

266
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:40,720
people who are just such

267
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:46,960
the suchness of themselves one of them which maybe is a little bit interpretive but there's a

268
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:53,120
the buddha most frequently refers to himself as not as the buddha not as this given

269
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,159
name gautama but he refers to himself as the tattagata

270
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:04,960
and it's a ancient title that probably preceded the buddha no one quite knows what it means

271
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:10,000
but it's a compound of two words but they don't quite know which two

272
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,000
words because of how the compound words can letters kind of merge

273
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,520
but my favorite interpretation of it is that

274
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,960
it means the one who is thus

275
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:33,840
the buddha is the one who is thus the one who is such like such

276
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:39,600
so imagine that you know you go up to the buddha and you're like he seems like an unusual guy

277
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:45,520
so you ask him you know who are you what are you what are you about

278
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:52,080
and you have your notebook out you're going to write down notes because after all you don't get talked to buddha that often

279
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:58,480
and he says uh i am thus i am such

280
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:04,880
i'm this is the i'm the suchness of this

281
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:11,440
would you be irritated or would you now appreciate wow

282
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:18,799
rather than picking and choosing the parts and defining who he is in some particular way

283
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:27,279
that the uh he just is not defining himself he's

284
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:32,880
just there and you can and what is apparent what is there he's not going to define it any

285
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,799
more than the suchness of it

286
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,000
here's a few quotes versus

287
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:08,320
so if you if you uh see the selective process that doesn't see the suchness as one that has a

288
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:14,000
opinion about things a story about things a view of how things are

289
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:21,519
then maybe you'll appreciate this poem one who is attached argues over

290
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:28,320
doctrines how and with what does one argue with someone unattached

291
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:34,320
embracing nothing rejecting nothing right here

292
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:42,960
a person has shaken off all abuse so there's a time sitting in meditation

293
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:49,760
where it makes a lot of sense to embrace nothing and reject nothing

294
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:57,799
if what we want to do is to see the fullness the wholeness of the suchness of this moment

295
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,080
here's another verse they aren't enemies to anything

296
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:16,960
seen heard or thought out how in this world could one have

297
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:25,120
assumptions about those who see in this way whose conduct is open

298
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:33,278
so people who are not opposed to anything that they see or hear or anything that's thought out any opinions

299
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:41,799
if they don't have that how could you make assumptions about them how can you define them

300
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:49,760
and they reverse them these are people whose conduct is open i guess you get what you see you see

301
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:55,760
with how they conduct themselves how they are in their suchness and one more this is

302
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:01,200
the one that one does not construct

303
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,679
prefer or take up any doctrine

304
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:15,200
a sage is not led by precepts or religious practices

305
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:23,039
is someone who has gone beyond who does not depend on beliefs

306
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:28,559
it is someone who is thus

307
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:34,960
someone who is thus so

308
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:43,279
so why did the buddha hold up a flower

309
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:46,880
and why did the monk smile

310
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,000
can you hold yourself up in such a way

311
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,960
that you smile

312
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:05,200
in your thusness your suchness i certainly hope

313
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:12,000
that you can gaze upon yourself in such a way be present for you in such a way with a mind that's quiet enough from its

314
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,358
attachments its fears its desires its

315
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:22,960
so that you can gaze upon this beautiful being that you are

316
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,720
in its suchness and then to look upon others

317
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:35,200
every other person with their reverence and care and respect

318
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:41,200
they can come to see the suchness of them as they are

319
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:49,200
and what a great world it would be if we loved and respected people just as they

320
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:55,280
are in a world where we don't see

321
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:00,520
the through the filter of great hatred and delusion

322
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:11,838
