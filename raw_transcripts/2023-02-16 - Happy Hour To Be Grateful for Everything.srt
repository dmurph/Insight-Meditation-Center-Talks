1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:08,040
so hello and welcome to happy hour everyone lovely to be with you wherever

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:15,080
you are in the world practicing together so um

3
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:21,720
yeah a couple of words and then we'll

4
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:31,080
practice together and we'll meditate together the same for tonight I'd like to invite us to engage with

5
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:37,620
um bring to our hearts and Minds a beautiful practice of gratitude

6
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,500
and it's really important not to approach this practice of gratitude as

7
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,200
it should like I should be grateful oh God I should be grateful no no no please

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,719
please don't actually it's it's not a practice to have any issues about it's

9
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,120
it's an invitation can I be grateful for this can I be grateful for this and if

10
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,760
the answer comes back no I I don't feel great then don't don't push it don't

11
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,640
push it but it's a gentle invitation and yet it's such an important practice in

12
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:18,420
this very gentle way of of not shooting uh that someone said not shooting all

13
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:24,619
over ourselves um is is because we usually look for

14
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:29,640
problems in our lives or it's just the

15
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:37,500
way human beings work it's it's our um evolutionary

16
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:44,520
um basically Heritage because those those uh who survived those who passed on

17
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,759
their genes they were looking for threats in their environment those

18
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:57,060
ancestor human beings they were looking for threats in the environments they were not looking for those who were

19
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:03,299
looking for berries did not survive the uh they out survived those who were

20
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,819
looking for threats and and um so so we are looking for threats

21
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:14,879
we're looking for what's not going right what's problematic that's it's so we

22
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,980
need to balance we need to balance the tendency that we all have as human

23
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:26,760
beings for what's difficult um it's it's said I've heard this before

24
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:33,840
that I might have heard it also that our minds uh are like uh velcro for what's

25
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:42,120
challenging and difficult and they're like Teflon uh the old days when there was a lot of Teflon for for for good

26
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,519
things for for uh for things that are good in our lives they just don't stick

27
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:55,680
to our minds like oh yeah yeah we get a compliment oh yeah thank you maybe it doesn't quite stake the goodness but oh

28
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,160
yes what's challenging what's wrong what's problematic are we just go

29
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,260
through it again and again and again so velcro Teflon

30
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:12,300
so so in order to balance in order to balance our hearts and mindsets it's

31
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:19,560
helpful to turn to what is good and when we intentionally just ever so gently

32
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,739
turn towards good and what's good could be outside what's good could be inside oh

33
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:31,739
the goodness of my intention I'm showing up yeah maybe I find

34
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:37,019
meditation challenging maybe I'm a beginner maybe I fall asleep and and and

35
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:43,799
yet I keep showing up this is good this is good so so sense of oh yeah can I be

36
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:50,879
can I appreciate maybe not even use the word gratitude maybe that's too heavy for some people can I appreciate can I

37
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:57,480
appreciate that I'm showing up and maybe yes yeah I guess I can if I step out of myself I can appreciate that

38
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:03,840
this person who's me is showing up uh even though they fall asleep all the time or judge themselves we're not doing

39
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,599
it right yet oh yeah there is goodness here so so internally externally as a

40
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,720
way to turn our minds to so much good to so much good not to take it for granted

41
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:23,160
so much good really and and when we notice good the good in our lives

42
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:31,380
then it feels like more good shows up because we're noticing the good we're open we're open for more goodness to

43
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:39,300
appreciate to befriend uh to support to give to be generous it's it's it's we

44
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:46,199
we try we joined we become part of a virtual cycle

45
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:52,020
all right I've said plenty let's um let's practice together

46
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:59,419

ten thousand Joys ten thousand sorrows

143
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:26,100
of its impermanence deeply woven into the fabric

144
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:31,320
being alive in this impermanent moment can this hard

145
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:36,419
to be wide open just for a moment experiment to receive it all

00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:02,899
that has been is will be

156
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:11,600
the mystery of it all beyond our understanding

157
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:28,500
that I am a part of this whole mystery I'm a player in

158
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:34,440
sentient conscious playing my part

159
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:39,200
growing learning serving giving

160
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:46,100
hurting being hurt gratitude for all of it

161
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:06,919
or the ways I've grown in the ways I have yet to grow I have yet to grow and stretch myself

162
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:10,500
and if you find if you meet limits of your heart it's okay bow to it be grateful for that

217
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:22,079
and actually I know I've said this before first of all I want to say thank you for this uh and I've said this

218
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:27,240
before but I just like to sell it again through another spiritual program that

219
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:33,240
I'm in I started circulating a gratitude list with two friends on email about six

220
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:39,720
or seven years ago we do it every day and it made such a difference in my life and I think even just one night like

221
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:45,800
this it can make a huge difference yeah I mean because I tend to look at everything that's wrong with my life

222
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:51,960
we all tend to yeah exactly where's this me to look at what's right there's a lot

223
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:57,599
so there's just so much that's going right it's it's just it's overwhelming

224
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:04,380
actually it's quite quite lovely thank you Claire thank you for that and Diana you're next and before that I want to

225
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:11,160
read a message if I came to me directly and one of you said I realized that a lot of my meditation practice was to

226
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:20,460
observe things neutrally it was very refreshing to observe things grateful yay beautiful yes so so lots of

227
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:26,760
different practices and with the practice of with vipassana with with

228
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:33,359
with uh Insight practice we often try to well it's in some ways it's neutral but

229
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:39,900
in some ways we're looking at a rising and passing we're looking at things but but with the practices of the heart with

230
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:44,940
meta and with with all the Brahma vihars with loving kindness with compassion

231
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:50,220
with vicarious joy and with Equanimity there's a particular way of looking and

232
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:55,800
especially with mudita and and by the way gratitude fits under vicarious joy

233
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:02,700
in the in the in the for Brahma vijayas that's where it fits because when you when you feel great

234
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:08,099
happy for someone else's happiness it's joy for them when you're happy for you

235
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:14,280
feel happy for your own blessings yeah guess what that's gratitude anyway so um

236
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:21,240
so yes there's a particular there's there's a beauty there's a goodness to this practice of modita vicarious Joy

237
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:28,859
turned inward that becomes gratitude so I'm delighted person who uh sent this

238
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:34,500
this reflection yes it's such so refreshing it's so beautiful to and

239
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:42,480
um maybe I'll just say one more thing the path towards Awakening doesn't go through just the gray zone of the things

240
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:48,960
or as they are there's a lot of Joy the Buddha was was known as the happy one

241
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:56,579
and the path actually in this instruction step by step by step by step um as well as you study the suttas you

242
00:42:56,579 --> 00:43:04,140
see there is joy and there's contentment then there's Bliss this and there is gladness all of these parmesan and Piti

243
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:10,980
and and sukkah you know all of them they're just laid out they're just uh so so the path and then at the end is oh

244
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:18,960
yes nibana Awakening but it just goes through these the mind the heart need to go need to contain Joy need to contain

245
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:25,260
all these uplifting qualities in order to be liberated it's not a grim duty to

246
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:31,280
be liberated so anyway thank you for that reflection Diana

247
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:40,920
oh this is just really quick um we were thinking uh and saying that

248
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:46,680
we could actually if we had time do this all night the this gratitude just go

249
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:55,020
around and around because what happens is you keep thinking if at least for me to keep thinking of things and and it

250
00:43:55,020 --> 00:44:00,960
builds and it makes and and Oddball things too could come to mind an oak

251
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:06,480
it's just like an endless array so it's a it's a really joyful practice thank

252
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:12,420
you for offering this to us thank you thank you so much it's that's lovely and

253
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:19,140
one of you reflects I had a lot of rage come up during the session it was not about Joy at all for me tonight no

254
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:24,720
problem and that's what needed to come up um rage anger so so there are conditions

255
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:30,119
in the mind and the heart and that's when you when you quieted your mind when

256
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:37,619
you know we quiet our mind and there's just a lot of something else that needs to be a 10 ended too maybe that comes up

257
00:44:37,619 --> 00:44:44,400
or maybe or maybe the rage comes has come up perhaps because of a sense of lack or or

258
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,619
um or you know various things but it's worthwhile not to push it away and and

259
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:58,260
say okay this is you know it didn't work out it's the disaster but actually stay curious stay curious can you I know this

260
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:03,900
is going to sound like a high bar but can we even be curious or or have

261
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:09,500
gratitude about the rage can we have gratitude that we can actually have

262
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:15,480
emotions instead of just being a complete blank and and not just

263
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:23,160
completely blank uh or that we have the mental facility faculties to fear age and then when when

264
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:28,260
you welcome Rage with gratitude not necessarily acting out of it I'm not

265
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:33,839
saying act out but well yeah it's here okay can I be grateful for this too yeah

266
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:40,920
I can have emotions I can feel upset can that be a way to then turn towards

267
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:47,040
um working with it and and actually cultivating uh gratitude anyway

268
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:54,480
thank you all thank you so much for your practice thank you for being here for your cultivation may all beings be well

269
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:59,420
may all beings be free including ourselves
