1
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,840
so nice to be

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,480
here it's amazing this this 7 a.m. sitting

3
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:26,920
and and little short dmet it's been going on for more than four years

4
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:34,520
now that's kind of astonishing to me it's really really

5
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:46,760
lovely so um let's uh let's settle into a

6
00:00:53,079 --> 00:01:01,719
meditation tending to uh to the posture

7
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,560
finding that balance of alertness and

8
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,720
ease uprightness and

9
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:30,520
relaxation now balance is something that we're always always looking for in the

10
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:37,200
in our practice of the Dharma in many

11
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,759
different areas and the posture is a place where we can

12
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,079
start establishing a sense of

13
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:59,119
balance not striving and not uh zoning out

14
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,280
it's being

15
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,000
present so allow yourself to to be present

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:27,920
to the whole body sense of the whole body as it's sitting or lying

17
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,840
down standing as it

18
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:50,319
maybe just feeling into what it what it's like to be in the posture you're in

19
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:08,319
and then just taking a little trip

20
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:15,040
around the body with the with your awareness your attention and recognizing

21
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:22,720
tension if it's present and and releasing it just as much as as

22
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,200
possible and knowing it has been

23
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,760
released e

24
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:26,120
just be uh be present to what's going on energetically in the body in the nervous

25
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:31,720
system any kind of pulsing your

26
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,240
tingling maybe in the hands and arms legs other parts of the

27
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:51,160
body any sense of uh agitation or

28
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,120
excitement in the nervous system

29
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,039
itself in the

30
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:17,600
body breathing into what's present and letting whatever is there as

31
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:26,199
settle just attending attending to the lives of our bodies with care

32
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,199
the muscles and Joints to the nervous

33
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,439
system finding a place of

34
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,639
balance

35
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
e

36
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,560

55
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:31,800
deeply it opens up for us and more and more freedom is

56
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,360
possible and we stay

e e

93
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:35,679
what would it be like if um if we all brought a kind and

94
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:43,120
interested regard to every interaction that we had

95
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:52,080
today wherever we happen to go we go to

96
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:58,880
work people we meet there people we meet if we're shopping or walk walking down a

97
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:05,039
street or in our families with

98
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:13,799
friends a kind and interested [Music]

99
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:29,960
regard I may we all bring that to to all our interactions with the world

100
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,399
a day and other days as well

101
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,869
[Music]

102
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:56,169
[Music]

103
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:18,440
so um to recap so far uh the Dharma I

104
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:25,760
yesterday I I talked about the first two qualities uh of the Dharma that are in this list that it's well proclaimed that

105
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:32,000
it's useful throughout the all stages of practice and that it's visible here and

106
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,480
now um we can see it unfold in our daily life experience and that that's the only

107
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,639
place really where it is visible in our daily life experience in our practice

108
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:50,880
and those are the first two qualities of these six and in order to make use of the Dharma in order to uh to see it here

109
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:57,440
and now um we need to develop a capacity for uh mindfulness for sustained

110
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:03,120
attention sustained focused attention is what it uh the the essay that I'm

111
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,399
referring to pointed to the ability to stay connected to our to our present

112
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:14,039
moment experience to see the ways that that suffering that dooka that stress to

113
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:19,880
see the ways that it arises and uh also to see the way that it

114
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:25,639
ceases and then we need to be willing to not give up to uh when we forget when we

115
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:31,039
get distracted when we get bored or assistant and this essay that I'm uh

116
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:37,880
that I'm referring to this week called that a tolerance for failure speaking about students reading texts but I don't

117
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,919
really like to use the word failure in regard to to practice obstacles maybe

118
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:48,080
bumps in the road you know we don't let them deter deter

119
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:53,200
us so today I want to talk about the third and the fourth qualities of the

120
00:32:53,200 --> 00:33:00,679
Dharma in this list um along with the uh the capacities that support them and the

121
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:06,159
third quality is that the Dharma is immediately effective and that's of

122
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:11,559
course related to it being uh visible here and now we can see it and then we

123
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:18,880
can see that it works as well and I I mentioned yesterday I mentioned an analogy that Gil uh I've

124
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:24,240
heard Gil use before about having a pebble in in your shoe what's

125
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,880
immediately effective is bending down taking off my shoe getting the pebble

126
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:36,320
out there is immediate relief I see the dooka I remove the cause and the Dua

127
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:42,000
ceases and in our Dharma practice um perhaps um we might not discern so

128
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,240
quickly the choice of which Dharma prescription to apply you know

129
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:53,960
mindfulness Compassion or meta ethical Behavior truthfulness as taking off a

130
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:59,240
shoe you know especially early on in practice if I have a

131
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:06,039
tendency which I have had in the past to get impatient with my partner I can

132
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:12,240
practice restraint and patience I can in investigate my impatience and then then

133
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:17,320
I can see how it's really creating stress for me and it's not really having

134
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:23,599
any effect on on how my partner washes the dishes for example it might take

135
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:31,560
some time for me to actively recognize that being patient relieves the stress

136
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:37,720
re actually relieves the stress but when I see it here and now then I can see

137
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:44,320
that patience has been immediately effective recognizing the stress of

138
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:53,559
impatience and the release that comes through dropping it is you know it's seeing the for noal truths in

139
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:59,160
action so sometimes it's clear what would be immediately affect Ive and uh

140
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:04,800
and the result is immediately visible um sitting in meditation for example and

141
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,440
like like I invite every morning and like most uh Dharma teachers will invite

142
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:18,599
um being mindful to our breath noticing tension in our neck or jaw um we can

143
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:24,599
begin to let to relax it to let it go let the Pebbles of stress fall

144
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:30,400
away and as practice matures and we develop more sensitivity to our inner

145
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:36,280
State we see this kind of immediate effect applied in more and more subtle

146
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:44,800
experiences to very mild emotions and subtle moods subtle movements of

147
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:52,240
mind so um the Dharma is immediately affective I

148
00:35:52,240 --> 00:36:00,160
see that in just many small ways throughout uh throughout my day both in my formal practice and and just in in

149
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:09,079
daily life and the fourth quality of the Dharma is often translated as inviting

150
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:14,560
inspection and uh and this

151
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:21,359
uh uh this this word aaso is the poly word

152
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:28,520
and um you it's a kind of famous exhortation of the of the Buddha come and see for yourself

153
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:33,680
and uh so we're invited to just keep looking does the Dharma seem well

154
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:42,119
expanded is applying the teachings immediately effective do we see it here and now we pay attention to our actions

155
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:48,040
to our movements of mind we choose to act ethically we choose to act kindly

156
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:53,359
and we notice what the results are perhaps we apply mindfulness to some

157
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:59,480
difficult sit emotion in our in our uh in our meditation or in our life using

158
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:05,640
the rain or the raft techniques that that uh are spoken of so often in Dharma

159
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:11,680
talks and then we look you know is there more space around the emotion were we

160
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,960
Kinder were we more balanced when we dealt with that particular situation

161
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:24,160
that gave rise to uh some strong emotion do we see what it was that

162
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:29,800
hooked us the conditions uh that triggered the

163
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:36,800
emotion as we practice as we keep coming back and looking seeing coming to see

164
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:44,480
for ourselves we understand our minds a little bit better we get a clearer picture again and again of what makes

165
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:51,160
them tick as time goes on we keep coming back you know to see

166
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:58,319
for ourselves and this might be the heart of the you know the empirical nature of our Dharma practice um and I

167
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:06,119
mentioned that all these six qualities are they point to the empirical nature of of the Dharma um this coming back

168
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:12,040
coming to attend to our experience again and again with curiosity with kindness

169
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:17,200
to gradually learn to distinguish uh more skillfully between what leads to

170
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:22,760
dooka and what leads to more peace more ease more

171
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:30,440
freedom and this uh inspection that the Dharma invites is really supported by

172
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:36,560
two factors that uh Sheridan Blau the man who wrote this essay speaks of in h

173
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:42,079
in this essay on literacy the first is a willingness to suspend

174
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:48,280
closure to entertain problems rather than to avoid them and then the second

175
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:53,880
is a willingness to take risks so suspending closure and taking

176
00:38:53,880 --> 00:39:00,680
risks willingness to interpret for ourselves to respond to to to our our

177
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:07,480
our practice honestly to what's going on honestly and to question conventions and

178
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:14,040
question accepted uh interpretations of the Dharma as

179
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:23,240
well as we practice and learn more about the Dharma um we don't give up if we don't

180
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:28,359
understand you know Concepts uh that are unfamiliar to us like not self perhaps

181
00:39:28,359 --> 00:39:33,880
or emptiness or some things that seem kind of esoteric we're encouraged to be

182
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:39,839
curious you know it's essential we apply sustained attention and we stay open to

183
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:45,640
what arises we keep investigating we don't jump to conclusions about our

184
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:52,440
experience about what it means about what motivates us or if we do jump to

185
00:39:52,440 --> 00:40:00,720
conclusions we recognize that and we question them we stay open and we maybe

186
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:08,800
hopefully we can recognize oh there are other possibilities here we continue to look we continue to be

187
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:14,040
curious you know before he was awakened there's famous stories about the Buddha

188
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:21,839
the Buddha was asked to teach by two really highly regarded teachers who both said he had reached the Pinnacle of his

189
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:28,359
practice and he was you know he was ready to pass on the the teachings

190
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:33,440
but the Buddha said no you know he suspended closure he felt there was more

191
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:39,520
to learn more to accomplish he had not solved the problem of suffering so he

192
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:46,400
continued to entertain the problem and then he changed his practice model you

193
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:52,119
know he came to something new he discovered something new for himself seeing that the conventional approach

194
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:58,960
that he was following he was doing really aesthetic practice that had you know had him was starving at the time

195
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:06,319
according to the stories and then he remembered a time when he'd experienced a happiness that

196
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:12,520
he judged to be beneficial and uh he took the risk to see where that might

197
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:18,119
might lead and that where it led was to his final

198
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:24,800
Awakening so I haven't uh solved the problem of of

199
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,920
suffering at this point you know and I want to be willing to engage with

200
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:37,119
practice as an open question I keep looking what is this what's motivating

201
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:44,200
this so the the willingness to uh to suspend closure and to take

202
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:49,480
risks are both really useful as we continue to come and see for ourselves

203
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:54,839
what the Dharma is how it unfolds Blau talks about these in terms

204
00:41:54,839 --> 00:42:03,440
of an intellectual courage and I think it does take courage to not settle for easy answers to keep an open mind not

205
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:09,760
come to a conclusion to be curious about inconsistencies and sometimes to change

206
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:17,599
course to take up a different practice to start doing Brahma vihara practice for instance to move to a concentration

207
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:22,880
practice from a you know from a mindfulness practice it feels safe to

208
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:29,119
have certainty but feeling safe can be a way of staying stuck

209
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:37,440
so we we refine our own understanding by staying open and curious not just by

210
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:45,520
swallowing everything that we're taught we have to walk the path ourselves no one can walk it for us not even not even

211
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:51,880
the Buddha could walk it for us it takes energy and sincere intention to keep

212
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:59,119
inspecting and to stay curious we can come to New interpretations of Dharma Concepts that

213
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:04,160
that differ from the way we've uh heard them taught and understand under and

214
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:10,920
understood the way we've understood them in the past and we can check our understanding with those we respect

215
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:16,079
accepting feedback from others checking to see if our interpretation supports

216
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:22,359
growth you know seeing the empirical uh nature of the practice does it move

217
00:43:22,359 --> 00:43:30,480
towards freedom and if not you know we stay open to having our interpretation

218
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:45,880
overturned in our practice it just it's so useful to question our assumptions about uh how practice uh is supposed to

219
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:51,839
unfold no we have we do have assumptions about that I believe there's that

220
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:57,119
well-known quote from Suzuki roshi you know the the founder of San Francisco's

221
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:04,200
Center in The Beginner's mind are many possibilities in the experts there are

222
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:10,240
few or the Korean uh zen teacher uh sang

223
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:17,640
his advice only don't know only don't know something you can always kind of bring into your practice I think the

224
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:23,240
Buddhist invitation to come and see for ourselves could be seen as an invitation

225
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:29,400
to keep that beginner's mind to stay in the place of curiosity to stay in the

226
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:34,559
place of an open question and see I've gone on Beyond

227
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:41,240
because I had it's like I think I was muted for about four minutes I'm really sorry I didn't wasn't paying attention

228
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:48,800
to the chat I was I was tied to my words but when I was thinking about this

229
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:57,800
aspect of the Dharma um I thought of this quote from Rainer Maria R you know from his uh letters to a young poet

230
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:03,200
um that it's this is another quote that's often often repeated in Dhat

231
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:10,680
Dharma talks and it's quite profound I think you know I want to beg you as much

232
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:17,079
as I can Dear Sir to be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and

233
00:45:17,079 --> 00:45:22,720
try to love the questions themselves like locked rooms and like books that

234
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:28,599
are written in a very foreign tongue the point is is to live

235
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:35,359
everything live the questions now perhaps you will then gradually without

236
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:42,240
noticing it live along some distant day into the

237
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:50,319
answers so immediately effective and in inviting

238
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:57,079
inspection aaso come and see for yourself staying open to new possibil

239
00:45:57,079 --> 00:46:03,079
ities continuing to be curious not coming to conclusions being willing to

240
00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:09,640
look again and again and uh thank you very much again

241
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:17,079
today for your attention um tomorrow we'll look at the fifth of these qualities and I'll try to stay on top of

242
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:23,200
whether I'm muted or not and in the meantime I encourage you to keep looking keep living your

243
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:32,760
questions uh with that kind and curious interested regard for your life so see
