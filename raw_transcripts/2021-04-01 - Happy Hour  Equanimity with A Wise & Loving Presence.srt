1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:07,600
okay so so warm hello and welcome

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:14,240
wherever you are whatever time zone and for

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,400
the practice today i'd like to invite us to explore the

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,240
practice of equanimity and entering into it yet in a different

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,359
way on monday we explored equanimity

6
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,480
entering into it in one way as i described

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:43,040
noticing the coming and goings etc in our lives and then sense of

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:49,840
spaciousness so tonight we'll try something else yet another doorway

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:56,320
into equanimity and um see what do i want to say about it

10
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,399
before we start yeah maybe what i will say is there are so many different ways to

11
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:09,040
practice this beautiful practice of equanimity the crown jewel of buddhist practice

12
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:16,880
and maybe i will also say that the near enemy

13
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:24,000
or or what masquerade sometimes as as equanimity is aloofness not

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,479
not caring kind of uh turning our mind or our our hearts away

15
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,920
whereas equanimity is a sense of caring stability it holds presence

16
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,479
so we'll explore that another aspect we'll explore is there are so many different

17
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,600
perceptions so many different perspectives that we can play

18
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:58,399
with so many wholesome perspectives that we can invite and play with so

19
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:05,200
we will play with one perception a perspective of

20
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:12,080
on our life from a compassionate being from someone who cares and and take on

21
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:19,920
their perspective of both care and equanimity for us so that's kind of the territory

22
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:28,800
where we're going and let's just practice together and see what happens so i'd like to invite us

23
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:36,830
all to get into our meditation posture ah landing landing

24
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:46,319
[Music] landing in the body you need to shift

25
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,280
to lie down that's okay or sit up straighter

26
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:05,840
see what this body needs right now in this moment

27
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:32,879
and just landing glanding in the body arriving with the breath

28
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:40,400
spending some time to settle in a relaxed soft

29
00:03:43,599 --> 00:04:01,840
present connected body grounded deeply rooted

30
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,880
will take a few minutes to just settle and arrive

31
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,840
the breath receiving the breath in the abdomen

32
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:43,840
in breath and opera

33
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,840
inviting your body to relax and soften

34
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,919
with the breath

35
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,840
nowhere to go nothing to accomplish

36
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,000
then to just simply inhabit this moment here

37
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,840
however it's showing up

38
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:33,839
noticing the sensations of the breath and the abdomen

39
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:50,720
noticing any sensations anywhere in the body that

40
00:10:50,720 --> 00:11:00,560
calls to you letting the sensations be felt be sensed

41
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:11,040
whether pleasant or unpleasant the comings and goings of the sea of

42
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,839
sensations

43
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:31,680
just witnessed known now trying to fix push away

44
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,600
simply known

45
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:57,839
the rivers are sensation some pleasant some unpleasant

46
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:03,279
can also open up the awareness

47
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:11,920
to include the river of sounds the soundscape

48
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,839
coming and going arising and passing

49
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:34,480
not falling into not wanting more not pushing away just

50
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:44,240
knowing a rising passing of all the sounds the river of sounds

51
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:50,639
there can be peace ease the heart can be relaxed

52
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,040
the comings and goings of sensations

53
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,839
and sounds

54
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:41,279
not taking any sounds personally they come and they go can we have

55
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:46,800
equanimity equipoise with all the sounds

56
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,880
the same with the sensations

57
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,199
coming and going

58
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,839
being witnessed

59
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,839
spacious open allowing the comings and

60
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:09,839
goings not turning away not personalizing

61
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:16,880
and now also opening up to the comings and goings of thoughts

62
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,319
goings of comings and goings of emotions

63
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:36,240
perhaps labeling not my emotions but emotions

64
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:44,840
maybe sadness joy whatever it might be with each breath

65
00:17:44,840 --> 00:18:01,840
witnessed not owned not clunked to

66
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,120
similar with thoughts like clouds in the sky

67
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:29,840
i'm getting entangled in the content

68
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,360
like watching the clouds and the sky

69
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,000
it's easy to have equanimity with clouds in the sky that come and go not me not

70
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:07,840
mine born out of causes and conditions

71
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:41,840
now you can stay with this or if you like continue with the next invitation

72
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:55,840
to imagine a kind compassionate presence

73
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,229
who is witnessing [Music]

74
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:23,840
with you all the comings and goings the rivers of sensations

75
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,080
pleasant and unpleasant

76
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:39,360
the sounds the emotions the thoughts like clouds in the sky

77
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:51,840
this kind compassionate presence who cares

78
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:04,480
witnessing knowing as if a good friend sitting next to you

79
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,799
watching being aware of this these rivers flowing

80
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:23,520
and they care they care about you and they have a lot of wisdom

81
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,919
they're both wise and compassionate

82
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:38,720
they have vast vast wisdom of the causes and conditions they're not

83
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,440
caught they care

84
00:24:44,400 --> 00:25:00,400
and yet as they observe as they witness with you these comings and goings of your life

85
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:06,720
they have a sense of caring stability in their perspective

86
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:15,840
they care

87
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:23,440
and they are not toppled over they watch they sense they notice they

88
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:29,279
know that's happening for you intimately

89
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:33,200
and with a lot of equanimity

90
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:57,840
with their perspective of care and wisdom

91
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:50,559
then is it possible to witness yourself witness your own life

92
00:26:50,720 --> 00:27:07,840
from the perspective of this wise and compassionate presence

93
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:17,200
you're welcome to imagine it as a friend sitting next to you or maybe non-localized

94
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,840
just a knowing that's wise and compassionate

95
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:35,840
see what works best for you

96
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:27,278
letting the body be relaxed make sure you're not trying too hard

97
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:33,200
if you notice it's the body has become tight or the breath

98
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:40,480
has become tight just relaxed just soften

99
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:59,840
and let the breath and body be known keep it simple

100
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:26,640
all the rivers of sensations thoughts sounds emotions just coming and going

101
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:35,200
known witnessed with care stability without pushing away or

102
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:43,679
falling into the vast wisdom spaciousness

103
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,880
with equipoise

104
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,840
equanimity

105
00:31:54,399 --> 00:32:01,200
comings and goings of sense and events internally

106
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,880
and externally in the world

107
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:14,000
some pleasant some unpleasant all witnessed

108
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:23,600
all witnessed spaciously with equanimity

109
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,840
equipoise

110
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,760
all the comings and goings witnessed

111
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:24,960
from the perspective expanse of perspective of deep wisdom and compassion

112
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,240
far beyond

113
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:35,838
what we give ourselves credit for

114
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,358
but from a knowing a presence that compassionate

115
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:54,399
and wise from that arises deep deep equanimity

116
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:03,839
to hold all that arises and passes

117
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,240
perspective we can peek through

118
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:31,839
at our own life and others

119
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,839
and for the last

120
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:55,838
minutes of this practice together

121
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:04,880
allowing the river of thoughts sensations sounds

122
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,838
that this period of practice was

123
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:23,838
letting it be held witnessed from this expanse perspective of equanimity

124
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,720
caring stability

125
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:37,839
not judging not pushing away not berating

126
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:48,079
it flowed exactly as it needed to flow given the causes and conditions

127
00:37:48,079 --> 00:38:05,838
and appreciating that we showed up and we did our best to practice

128
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:24,880
appreciating if we if our perspective managed to connect

129
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:32,560
even for a split second with the perspective of equanimity vast

130
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:40,320
equanimity stable caring witnessing the comings and

131
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:47,839
goings with care and wisdom

132
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:05,589
[Music]

133
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:17,838
thank you for your practice

134
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:30,960
so we have some time for reflections

135
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:36,960
questions you're invited to share your wisdom with

136
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:43,839
the community as they can be very supportive

137
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:53,599
and you can raise your [Music] zoom hand if you wish or type it in chat

138
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:58,800
and if you type in chat just to me i won't say your name

139
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:05,839
it'll be anonymous and if you type it to everyone then i will say your name so what did you notice in

140
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:14,318
this practice what did you notice in this way of practicing equanimity

141
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:21,200
maybe as i wait for you to form your reflections your questions

142
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:28,250
your complaints i will say that [Music]

143
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:38,960
it is said that with the four brahmaviharas the first one being metta love

144
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:46,560
loving kindness second one being mudita vicarious joy sorry second one being compassion karuna

145
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:52,079
third one being vicarious joy and the fourth one being equinemedi

146
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:57,210
upeka so it is said that

147
00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:03,040
[Music] compassion is the love child of

148
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:10,000
suffering plus when love meets suffering it expresses itself

149
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:17,359
as compassion and i just thought that actually uh equanimity the fourth brahma vihara

150
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:25,599
is the love child of metta love child of love with um

151
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:30,720
wisdom with wisdom wisdom that sees all causes and conditions so when you

152
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:38,240
have love caring meta meets wisdom the two of them they express

153
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:43,760
themselves as equanimity so it's stable it's caring it's holding

154
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:51,359
witness it's not turning away and yet has

155
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:56,799
vast vast wisdom as a part of it

156
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:04,800
so so reflections why did you notice how was this for you

157
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,680
i'd love to take a couple of reflections from you

158
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:23,760
how are you finding yourself right now compared to before we're starting this

159
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:31,839
practice

160
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,599
mark please

161
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:47,040
i really enjoyed the practice i was just going to say not a super deep

162
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:52,560
reflection i just finished the book of joy which i'd heard about when you did this

163
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:57,599
series based on it and so my compassionate being was the dalai lama

164
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:04,240
and so the meditation was kind of like what would the dalai lama do like how would he hold whatever's coming

165
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:10,480
up which was fine because sometimes it was like laughter and just being silly sometimes it was compassion

166
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:16,160
and sometimes it was just sort of like peaceful like you said sort of vast wisdom that

167
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:22,960

168
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:28,720
sharing that i i love worth hearing that you're inspired to read the book of joy which i

169
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:35,440
think is wonderful based on the series we did together and also that your compassionate presence was dalai lama and

170
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,560
was playful because he tends to be a playful person especially as it comes through the book

171
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:46,160
the book of joy he's just he's having a fun time with desmond tutu and they're

172
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:53,599
joking and making fun of each other and just just such lighthearted compassionate joyful presence together

173
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:59,280
with a lot of wisdom of course so yay i so appreciate you bringing that

174
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,880
in clark that's lovely that's great

175
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:10,400
and question comes from mitra can you say a few words about equanimity and right effort

176
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:16,480
being okay with what is and making effort to stay with mindfulness

177
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:24,319
um [Music] vitrogen let me ask you some uh what uh

178
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:30,160
what would be helpful what because there's so many directions i can go so it would be helpful to hear a little

179
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:36,160
more about what would be what's coming up for you that this question is becoming relevant

180
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,280
so yeah um in regards to

181
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:48,400
meditation um i tend to be very upset with myself when

182
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:56,000
i can stay mindful or i lose my

183
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:03,200
mindfulness and how do i and i i see the benefit of trying to be

184
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:09,760
more economists with that but how do i gauge it so i'm not too

185
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:15,839
easy on myself yeah yeah that's a really good question

186
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:24,240
so um so it's it's i'll also so i understand

187
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:29,440
the question thanks for for elaborating um so

188
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:36,800
i'll say a couple of words about wise effort or wise engagement the word effort

189
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:43,839
brings a lot of we can bring oh tightness so why is engagement what is wise engagement they're not related to

190
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:48,880
to equanimity so so with wise engagement

191
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:56,560
the buddha likens it to tuning a bow a bowed instrument so sometimes it will be too tight like

192
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:02,880
are you trying too hard oh i miss that breath oh i missed that thought bad bad bad that's a little too tight

193
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:10,319
ouch and then too loose would be daydreaming for the entire 45 minutes

194
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:15,920
and then it would be the last you know if it's the 45 minutes or in this case the 30 minutes you know

195
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:21,200
uh they drew me for 35. oh i'm daydreaming it's fine noticing that you're daydreaming

196
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:28,240
and not doing anything about it that's too loose right in the middle you're like i'm daydreaming but it's fine this is so

197
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:36,560
fun i don't really want to follow that meditate so that would be too loose so okay so those are the ends okay

198
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:44,319
so from what you've described it sounds like you're closer to the tight to the to the efforting right it's like

199
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:52,240
bad you missed that oh instead of so so it's okay so go you so so in order to

200
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:57,760
find what is the the appropriate level of engagement you need to loosen you will be

201
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:04,160
you get you will get too loose at some point and then you'll get a little tight at some point and then lose some so you

202
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:09,520
you'll just do this until you how you develop a discernment for

203
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:14,800
what is appropriate so don't expect to be right on all the time but from what i'm hearing from you is that

204
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:22,640
you're too tight so loosen it have more ease like oh i just noticed i

205
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:31,200
i was daydreaming for five five minutes ah it's okay i'll start again

206
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:38,559
so a sense of ease a sense of ease of letting go um so and and that's how actually

207
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:45,280
equanimity can come in here because then you're not fighting it you're not trying because it's past it's gone anyway there's a

208
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:51,680
sense of ease of spaciousness oh maybe the mind is really busy because

209
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:57,119
these are the causes and conditions that's the that's how the wisdom comes in like these are the causes and conditions

210
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:02,559
of this body right now it's very distracted and another um

211
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:08,160
thing that i've heard and i use is distracted buddha or thinking buddha is

212
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:13,440
what you can say and i've used that a lot of times i've you know i've sat and my mind has been

213
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:20,720
really really all over the place like oh today the mind is busy i'm showing up as the busy buddha

214
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:26,400
busy mind buddha as the distracted buddha this is these are the causes and conditions that are

215
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:33,680
showing up and having just as much ease that's a training too having just as much ease so because you

216
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:40,480
know and recognize you had the intention i had the intention um but being

217
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:46,800
equanimous with with what arises because that's really what we're trying to

218
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:52,880
cultivate anyway it's a sense of peace with all causes and conditions so if we can't have peace

219
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:59,440
because the conditions of our minds right if we're then

220
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:04,640
we're trying to get somewhere that we're just going the opposite way how can we get there when we're going this way

221
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:10,000
you see so having more peace with

222
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:18,160
i love thinking about causes and conditions i mean that that kind of loosens

223
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:24,640
the the harshness is also thank you thank you

224
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:31,200

231
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:16,079
let's turn our attention to small practice in small groups in small

232
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:22,319
breakout groups and we'll come back and reserve some time for reflections at the end

233
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:29,760
so here we go creating the rooms and look let us start

234
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:35,440
with um 30 seconds of silent meta for each other and then you're

235
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:40,800
welcome to share anything you wish okay here we go i'm going gonna open the rooms

236
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:48,880
here we go okay okay welcome back everyone we have

237
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:56,480
about a minute left and uh matthew you had your handle up so please if you would kindly unmute

238
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:02,640
yourself hi uh i haven't been here in a few weeks uh the last time i was here i think was

239
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:09,760
for mutita and for me it's easier that i find like mudita or meta are a little bit

240
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:15,520
less subtle like they're a bit easier to bring up for me and i was wondering if

241
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:22,400
there's kind of a way to maybe like go from one of those into equanimity or if if that's kind of

242
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:27,599
normal the economy is like a little bit less easy to kind of just feel straight

243
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:33,280
away yeah yeah equanimity tends to be

244
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:40,079
more subtle than the other ones which is why it's number four because all the teachings of the buddha if you've noticed they go from the

245
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:47,599
grosser to more and more subtle um so um

246
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:54,720
yeah so so um so yeah so if you're finding it more subtle you're not alone i've heard this from

247
00:51:54,720 --> 00:52:03,280
many other people that oh yeah this is a little more subtle wait a minute like ah um so hang in there hang in there

248
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:08,720
and and it's it's nature to be a little more subtle it's just it's it's part of the kind of nature of

249
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:14,720
equanimity to be a little more subtle right it's not in your head over you know it's like oh

250
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:23,359
my god it's more like ah it's more kind of a subtle way of holding there's some care so um so with that you

251
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:30,720
can either get into it from meta where there's a little some care some care and there's and then opening to

252
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:38,880
wisdom with all causes and conditions or or getting into it from compassion like ah i care for you i hold

253
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:44,880
you and may um it is what it is and i guess also the

254
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:51,119
other thing to say is that um at the beginning you said that um you haven't been to happy hour since

255
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:57,920
uh mutita and then after murita we did a week of uh of equanimity and

256
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:04,319
and there was a lot more uh methodical i use the phrases and sometimes the phrases can help

257
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:10,480
people so so that's it matthew you might want to go back and look at the archives of the week of equanimity

258
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:15,920
when there were five or six or sessions or something and much more methodical and yeah and play

259
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:24,000
around with those yeah great i am glad you brought this up thank you thank you thanks so

260
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:30,880
dear ones the time has come for us to end with equanimity to let go to this hour of

261
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:37,599
practicing equanimity together so thank you all for your practice for this cultivation that

262
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:45,760
you do not just for yourself but for all beings everywhere may all beings be happy may all beings

263
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:54,078
be free thank you
