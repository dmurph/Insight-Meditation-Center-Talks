1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,759
uh my name is May Elliot um good morning good afternoon good evening wherever and

2
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:13,880
whenever you are uh wherever you find yourself um today we are continuing our

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:21,680
exploration of the Buddha's five daily Recollections uh sometimes called the five remembrances or the five

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,840
Reflections I like the translation the five Recollections because it includes

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:33,000
that word collect so ideally reflect on these teachings when the mind is

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,559
collected and settled so uh so today we'll be focusing

7
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,760
on the second phrase I am the nature I am of the nature to become sick I have

8
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,280
not gone beyond sickness or sometimes uh I am of the nature to become ill I have

9
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,680
not gone beyond illness and as with yesterday uh we'll

10
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:01,399
we'll practice with this phrase in two ways so we'll um we'll sit silently together and then after the mind has

11
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:08,280
settled in meditation uh we'll just drop the phrase into the Mind allowing it to Ripple through without much

12
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,720
thinking um uh then I'll offer some questions the second way is I'll offer some questions so you can actively

13
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,600
contemplate the phrase and uh just as a reminder um

14
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:28,439
though we're we are um yeah though we we cognitively know that illness will come

15
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:36,720
um this contemplation is to help us move this understanding from the head to the heart um and maybe we could even say uh

16
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,360
from the heart to the belly so that we can actually digest these truths more

17
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,079
fully um I might add um if you're not feeling well resourced today and it

18
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,399
feels like a little too much to uh to contemplate the eventual decay of your

19
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:59,640
well-being uh it's totally okay to mute the sound sit in silence and come on

20
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,960
back back at 7:30 for the D so um so do what feels best for

21
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:11,000
you and for those who want to join uh for the guided

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,560
meditation uh please take your meditation

23
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:34,280
posture so finding yourself in a comfortable stable

24
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:43,400
position something that allows your your body to be alert and

25
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,280
relaxed maybe starting with a few deep breaths

26
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:17,280
inviting relaxation and settling the mind on your

27
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,760
anchor whatever that may be the breath Global sense of the body maybe your

28
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,799
touch points with a cushion or floor

29
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,799
maybe the sound sleep and inviting the mind to rest let

30
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:44,959
go of past and future prioritizing just being

31
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,959
here simplifying stabilizing settling the

32
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,720
mind go ahead and sit in silence together for some time

33
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,720
now

34
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720

e e

37
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,199
from time to time in meditation can be helpful to among other body to

38
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:40,070
relax to soften the face the temples the jaw shoulders

39
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:46,199
[Music] belly bringing some Tranquility to the

40
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,840
mind and the

41
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520

e e

54
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,759
Sting the mind steadying the

55
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:55,240
mind letting go of anything extra

56
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:32,079
before we begin to drop our phrases in for

57
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:37,260
recollection we can start by bringing an attitude of kindness to the

58
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:43,640
[Music] mind a little meta a loving

59
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:51,480
[Music] attitude a little warmth or caring whatever resonates for

60
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:58,440
you this might be the attitude you'd have if uh you were holding a baby in

61
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,040
your arm

62
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:23,759
so bringing in this attitude to help bolster us

63
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:30,519
and support us as we engage in these phrases

64
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:39,319
so let's begin let's begin with dropping today's phrase into our

65
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:48,800
meditation so the traditional phrase I am subject to

66
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,440
illness have not gone beyond

67
00:15:54,440 --> 00:16:02,800
illness just allowing that to drop into your meditation and ripple through through the mind and heart seeing what

68
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:11,480
arises I am subject to illness have not gone beyond illness

69
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:35,519
and maybe something happens maybe nothing happens and it's fine either way

70
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:42,519
we're not demanding a response we just noticing we drop the

71
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:48,040
phrase in and then it's a mindfulness practice to see what comes forth it's

72
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:54,120
fine if there's pictures or words in the mind just keeping a short leash on them

73
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,759
so we don't go into discursive thought

74
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:04,918
[Music] memories emotions just noticing what

75
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:10,918
comes up we might play with a

76
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:19,480
more modern version of this phrase from Nikki Mir Gori can try dropping this

77
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:28,919
in breathing in gently I lovingly remember that this body will sicken

78
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:38,520
breathing in gently I lovingly remember that this body will sicken

79
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:05,420
your own noun playing with this phrase dropping it in at a pace that feels right for

80
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:12,120
[Music] you and at any time if you feel ready to go back to your anchor and let go of the

81
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,400
phrases that's totally

82
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
fun

83
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

84
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,679
e e

85
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,840
let go of the phrase coming back into silence

86
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:52,310
start our engaged [Music] contemplation again offering um a couple

87
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:58,880
[Music] questions and because this is a contemplation you can allow yourself to

88
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,559
think about each question if there's certain questions

89
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:13,520
that don't resonate for you it's not important to reflect on each one just choose whatever stands

90
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:23,640
out so again remembering I am subject to illness and subject to sickness I have

91
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,840
not gone beyond sickness

92
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:38,279
so when you become sick injured or are in pain how do you relate to it how is

93
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:40,799
that for

94
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:05,440
you you do the contemplation staying close to the question such that um that we don't get

95
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:12,559
lost in discursive thought so keeping a short leash on on

96
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:17,600
the reflection on the contemplation and including whatever

97
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:24,159
Body Sensations or emotions arise as you reflect

98
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:37,600
when you're healthy and the body is working well do you appreciate your

99
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:45,360
health do you notice that the body is working well and that you're feeling

100
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:57,960
good or do you only notice the body when something goes AR

101
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:24,120
what is it like for you knowing that we can't prevent sickness and

102
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,480
injury e

103
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:09,279
How Deeply do you know that illness will come do you know it conceptually

104
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,440
only or do you know it in your

105
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,360
core e

106
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:16,799
you might just take a moment to notice what it feels like in the body right

107
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:22,640
now there's a noticing if there's a mood or an emotion

108
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,320
present noticing what it feels like in the heart

109
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:43,399
just taking all of this in with a kind and gentle awareness making space for whatever is there

110
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:26,880
knowing that a great sickness may come for us or maybe already has that some of

111
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,919
you may be ill at this time and that these Reflections can

112
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:38,679
bring up a lot let's bring in some meta

113
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,559
phrases may I be joyful and

114
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,480
happy may I be strong and healthy

115
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,760
may I be safe and

116
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:14,730
protected and may I be peaceful and at [Music]

117
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:31,120
ease or instead of the formal phrases Maybe just it's okay

118
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:37,919
love there there it's okay it's okay to be

119
00:27:51,799 --> 00:28:01,240
sick coming back to your inchor settling the last few minutes

120
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:55,960
beings be happy healthy safe and at ease

121
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,278
okay welcome back

122
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:38,039
so for those who are just arriving my name is May Elliot and we continuing our

123
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:42,278
exploration of the five daily

124
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:54,080
Recollections and uh as a reminder uh these phrases span uh aging

125
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:59,399
sickness death losing those that we love

126
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:07,640
and all that we love and the teachings on Karma so uh so this is a vast array

127
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:13,960
um and today I'd like to begin by sharing a Zen Coan with

128
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:22,840
you as translated in Zen flesh Zen bones so uh it starts with a man traveling

129
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:29,480
across a field and he encounters a tiger uh he fle of course and the tiger

130
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:36,799
uh chases after him coming to a cliff uh he catches hold of a root of a wild Vine

131
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:42,200
and swings himself down over the edge the man is hung over the precipice

132
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:51,440
by a root while the tiger sniffs at him from above the man looks down uh to where far

133
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:59,679
below another tiger was waiting to eat him only the vine sustained him

134
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:09,000
two mice one white and one black little by little start to naw away at the

135
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:16,080
vine at that moment the man saw a luscious strawberry near him grasping

136
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:21,399
the Vine with one hand he plucked the strawberry with the

137
00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:29,440
other and the ends with how sweet it tasted

138
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:40,039
so this um this setup may seem a little absurd maybe like something from an

139
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:45,080
action movie or a fantasy film a tiger above a tiger

140
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:50,440
below appearance of two mysterious mice just at the critical

141
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:58,480
moment uh but surprisingly this is a description of our life um there's no

142
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:04,279
avoiding the inevitability of sickness aging and death and we can't we can't

143
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:11,840
avoid these things by going uh back in time that would be like climbing back off the cliff Cliff onto stable land and

144
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:17,000
into the Tiger's mouth um and we all know that going forward in time bring

145
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,880
brings sickness aging and death um even closer and that's the tiger at the bottom of the

146
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,840
cliff the white mouse and the black mouse represent the days and nights of

147
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:34,679
our life nibbling away at the vine little by little diminishing the time we

148
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:42,120
have left and and what happens uh when we

149
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:47,880
really come to terms with this when we when you really understand deeply that

150
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:56,960
sickness old age death loss are coming for us um what happens is we can learn to

151
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:03,679
love this life and be more present for it we can we can be truly present for

152
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:09,960
that one ripe strawberry we can taste the sweetness of this precious

153
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:16,919
moment so so this is really what what these phrases are about what these Recollections are about it's one of the

154
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:23,200
effects of practicing with them as they wake us up to the beauty of what we have

155
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:30,480
here so today as you know the reflection uh focusing on is I am of the nature to

156
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:36,440
become sick I have not gone beyond sickness and I love Nikki's take on this

157
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:42,519
breathing in gently I lovingly remember that this body will

158
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:49,320
sicken uh in the uh the 10 subjects for frequent recollection by one who has

159
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:54,639
gone forth uh there is a line that goes

160
00:33:54,639 --> 00:34:02,880
the days and nights are relentlessly passing how well am I spending my time the days

161
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:10,158
and nights are relentlessly passing how well am I spending my time white mouse

162
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:17,240
black mouse the days and nights are coming and going are you practicing

163
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:22,720
diligently so this this phrase that reminds us that sickness is coming if it

164
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:29,919
hasn't already arrived and we we may not always be well enough to practice with energy she and Zeal to do what we

165
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:36,520
love I may not always be well enough to meditate or to be able to go on meditation Retreats or whatever it is

166
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:41,720
whatever way you practice and whatever it is that you love to

167
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:48,000
do I did a dayong retreat at one point with a man in a wheelchair and when it

168
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,480
came time to do walking meditation uh the way he did it is he would um take

169
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:59,800
his two fingers and he'd um walk them up and down his thigh middle finger and

170
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:05,880
pointer finger walking up and down and will this body always be well

171
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:11,119
enough to practice in an easeful way we don't

172
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:18,599
know and it's so rare when the body is well that we actually it's so rare that we actually uh acknowledge and

173
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:24,920
appreciate everything that's functioning properly technotan offered the teaching

174
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:30,839
uh to be grateful for our non toothache um we so easily fixate on what's going

175
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:36,880
wrong it can be easy to forget uh uh to acknowledge the great relief of no

176
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:43,200
toothache of no headache of no pain or sickness on any given day remember I am

177
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:50,640
of the nature to become sick it can highlight in relief the ways that Wellness is available here and now we

178
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,400
can be grateful for our nonto

179
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,520
fake and uh and the continued remembering of this teaching I am of the

180
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:07,440
nature to grow sick to become sick uh not only illuminates that which is not

181
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:15,240
yet sick U but it aligns our expectations such that we're not surprised when illness comes so um so

182
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:22,720
sickness and injuries are common visitors for me and I've noticed that the mind's immediate response um uh if I

183
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:29,119
get sick or injured can be oh no not again um so at a certain

184
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,720
point uh I started I started in the morning with the sentiment uh today

185
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:41,920
could be the day as in today could be the day for a new cold or flu or injury or health issue today could be the day

186
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:47,280
so this became my short hand for I am of the nature to get sick I have not gone

187
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:53,440
beyond sickness so uh I remember on the first day I did this practice I was eating and

188
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,720
I bit down on a pebble or something and I lost a tooth and rather than having

189
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:05,160
this sense of like oh no not again uh the thought was oh well of course today

190
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:10,560
is the day and there's no upset around it so uh

191
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:18,280
when we shift our expectations we no longer feel wronged by the universe or singled out or oh for me it's like of

192
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:24,960
course this is the nature of how things are and there's there's an extraordinary

193
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,760
way in which when we we suffer well we often think that we're alone or isolated

194
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:37,760
in our suffering why me no one else is suffering how I'm suffering and something I appreciate

195
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:45,160
about this suta with the five Recollections is that it actually it invites us to not only contemplate our

196
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:51,079
aging sickness death Etc but that we do this for others as well so this this is

197
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:57,640
from mut says now a disciple of the noble ones considers this

198
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:02,920
I am not the only one subject to sickness who has not gone beyond

199
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:08,480
sickness so I not the only one and he repeats this multiple

200
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:14,040
times uh so there's no need to get into oh I have more health issues than my

201
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:19,400
friends or I get sick more often than others we're all in this together at one

202
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:27,240
time or another and uh often when sick or ill

203
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:32,680
people people can think uh my body betrayed me or how did this go

204
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:39,400
wrong so instead uh in this suta each phrase functions with a unique intention

205
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:46,359
counteracting this sense of surprise uh so uh we I shared the first one

206
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:53,680
yesterday which was um the phrase is I am of the nature to age um and then uh

207
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:59,040
the intention is of saying that praise is to overcome the intoxication with

208
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:05,040
youth intoxication of Youth so today's I am of the nature to become sick and

209
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,800
that's to overcome the intoxication of good health um so that we we don't think

210
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:17,839
that we're always going to have it um to so that we're not clinging to it it's not that we don't enjoy good

211
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:24,280
health um but that we're not attached to it or the third phrase I am of the

212
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:30,960
nature to die um that's too overcome the intoxication with life and it's not

213
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:37,720
saying that we're overcoming uh our love of life um but rather our clinging to

214
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:43,040
life in a way that causes us to engage in misconduct

215
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:50,079
misconduct um misconduct by Body speech and mind um to let go of clinging to

216
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:56,280
life in a way that causes suffering um the fourth phrase I'm of

217
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:01,800
the nature to lose what is dear to me that's to weaken and overcome desire and

218
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:07,920
lust and the fifth I am the owner of my actions which I'll just say in shorthand

219
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:13,920
for now your reflection on Karma um the intention of that phrase is to become

220
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:19,000
responsible to abandon misconduct this is just some of the uh

221
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:25,078
some the different intentions behind the phrases from the

222
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:32,240
Buddha so ultimately uh all of these cultivate a mind uh a mind of Greater

223
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:38,359
Freedom they invite us to let go of fear and resistance they help us live with

224
00:40:38,359 --> 00:40:45,400
greater [Music] love and still this practice isn't easy

225
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:51,040
so be gentle with yourself dogen the the founder of Zen in

226
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:58,359
Japan he would say speak to sentient beings as you would a baby and one of my

227
00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:04,760
teachers extrapolated on this by saying dear one are you hungry do you need to

228
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:12,160
have your diaper changed do you need to be held so so we can relate to ourselves

229
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:19,200
with this sort of tenderness and kindness now please be gentle uh when you work with these Reflections and be

230
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:27,440
be kind to the child that lives in your own heart and uh today I hope you're able to

231
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:33,760
stay to stay close to this reflection so uh if you notice that your body is able

232
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:42,800
to see able to hear or smell or taste uh if it can walk or stand if it

233
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:50,000
can lift its limbs it can talk and digest its food uh stay close to what's

234
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,760
going well stay close and um uh feel some appreciation for your

235
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:02,839
