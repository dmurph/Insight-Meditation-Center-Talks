1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:07,279
good morning everybody good morning it's a joy for me to be here

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:12,400
this morning to be invited to come and join you here

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,640
at insight meditation center i've spent some time

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,760
in this space while being with the

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:31,279
sati buddhist chaplaincy training program but i've never had the chance to

6
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,880
come and practice here on a sunday morning so

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:43,200
i was a little bit nervous about being in a new space with new people

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,600
and now that i'm here i'm feeling much more relaxed so thank you for welcoming me

9
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,440
thank you when i um was talking to gil

10
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,840
about being here this morning and i was asking him you know what the order of events was

11
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:08,640
and i said to him well will i should i ring a bell at the beginning of the meditation

12
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,479
and gil said something along the lines of oh well we're not nearly so delineated

13
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:21,520
there's there's no need for a bell thing the meditation just starts and flows in

14
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,119
and you know i started thinking about that you know the ways in which

15
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,560
we bring ourselves into this space you know whether it's

16
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,920
just by some simple sound a bell i thought of

17
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,360
a poem that's very dear to me by the poet david white called the bell and the

18
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,560
blackbird where at the beginning of the poem he says

19
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:55,360
the sound of a bell still reverberating or a blackbird calling from a corner of

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,920
the field asking you to wake into this life

21
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:09,399
or inviting you deeper into the one that waits

22
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:17,360
so i thought well there could be a bell or there could not be a bell or perhaps there'd be the

23
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,840
sound of a bird what is it what is the little sound what is the cue

24
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,879
that brings us here

25
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:38,000
so the place where i practice which is cannondo zen center in mountain view

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,920
like many other zen centers we have outside our meditation hall

27
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,040
a big block of wood called a han the name of this is a han it's a big block

28
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,120
of wood and there's a mallet that comes with it and then

29
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,720
before every session of meditation the wood is struck

30
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,840
in a particular way with often with great force depending on the size of the

31
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,680
the center and how far the noise needs to travel and over the years

32
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,040
many hands begin to become indented and they'll sort of have a big sort of

33
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,640
splintered hole in the middle of them that attests

34
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:29,360
to the amount of energy and effort that has gone into striking them calling

35
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,920
people to practice and often these hands have

36
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:43,120
like a a poem um inscribed or rather painted on them

37
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,040
and the exact wording of the poem differs

38
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,200
um from one place to the next that's not always exactly the same

39
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,280
but usually the words are more or less to this effect

40
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,400
it goes something like great is the matter

41
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:14,319
of birth and death quickly passing gone gone

42
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:19,759
awake each one awaken

43
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,359
don't waste this life

44
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,199
so this message is conveyed often in this

45
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:45,919
very definitive sound of the wood being hit with a mallet

46
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,360
and the invitation is well whatever we're doing in that moment whatever activity

47
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,479
we're involved in best to wind that up as quickly as

48
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:06,639
possible and try and get to the meditation hall in time for sitting

49
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,400
and well it's part of my personality that i'm not always very good at being on

50
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:19,520
time for things and often i'm running i often in my head

51
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,759
i associate the sound of the wood with great effort being exerted and being out

52
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,360
of breath and trying to get to a place on time

53
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,759
and sometimes i think oh you know what's my what's my motivation here in

54
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:43,360
my hurry what am i worried am i worried about being in trouble sometimes i i get

55
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,360
flashbacks to being at school being late for class you know am i going to get shouted out by somebody

56
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,680
is somebody going to think less of me because i'm late am i going to disturb somebody else's

57
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:02,880
practice if the meditation hall is quiet when i enter you know all these very sort of

58
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:10,080
self-centered thoughts that arise very surface motivations also but

59
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,520
they're they're the first ones that come up for me in my hurry

60
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:24,960
so then i think well what are the deeper motivators

61
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,600
what's the what's the more fundamental source

62
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:39,919
of motivation for practice and i find this a very rousing question

63
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:46,440
for me it's a driving question

64
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:58,000
in the zen tradition we refer to the mind of practice

65
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,560
mind of practice and we talk about giving rise

66
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,919
to the mind of practice

67
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:15,280
which is something like allowing our our true nature our original nature to

68
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,800
emerge to flow freely

69
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:28,758
i think of a river flowing freely without impediments

70
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:38,638
not a river that's dammed up or that has been prevented from taking its natural course

71
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:45,440
but the energy of that flow that has has found its natural direction

72
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,400
and it just goes

73
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:57,759
and this kind of image is helpful to me for thinking about the sort of effort

74
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:04,160
and energy necessary for spiritual practice

75
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,960
because fundamentally when we at least when we start practice and

76
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,400
even in the day-to-day practicalities around practice

77
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:26,080
we require effort you know we talk about effort

78
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,198
just showing up here today

79
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:38,080
getting here having found a teacher maybe you know

80
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:44,959
having put that effort in to open towards a tradition and a teaching

81
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:51,360
to learn maybe even reading a book or two

82
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,680
on the subject

83
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:03,839
and then the efforts that we put into meditation itself you know

84
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,680
it can be very difficult at first just to just to stay put

85
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,279
and put yourself there and

86
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:23,200
perhaps when we're first starting out we might have been sitting for a few weeks and

87
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,640
then think uh but i don't know what's changed my brain's

88
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,760
still ticking over i'm still having all these thoughts i feel

89
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:40,640
so distracted and that can feel very demotivating

90
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:46,240
i can feel like ah what am i doing wrong

91
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:53,839
am i doing something wrong maybe i'm not trying hard enough

92
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,360
maybe i need to try harder that's what i need to do you know

93
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,360
maybe i'm not dedicated enough

94
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,480
and so we try harder and

95
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:18,480
maybe that can bring us some difficulty too working with these

96
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,800
levels of energy is a skill it's a skillful thing

97
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,560
that we we work with as our practice develops i kind of think of it a bit like you

98
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,880
know salt and cooking a little not enough or too much can

99
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,800
you know totally ruin the deal like knowing just how much

100
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,760
well there's a skill in that

101
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:58,160
so there's a story that came up for me when i was thinking about this maybe this is a story you've already heard and it reads a

102
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:04,560
little bit like a joke in fact so there was a

103
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:12,240
a martial arts student who went to his teacher in great earnest

104
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:18,320
and asked his teacher he said you know i'm really i'm really devoted

105
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:24,720
to studying this system i really want to learn everything you can teach me

106
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:32,720
how long will it take me to master this how long will it take me to get to where you are

107
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:40,079
and the teacher thought about it kind of casually just threw out an answer no

108
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:45,760
10 years and the student

109
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:51,120
very impatient and shocked and answered but

110
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:59,120
no like i need to do it faster than that i want to you know i have enthusiasm

111
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:05,920
i will work very hard i'll practice every day i'll i'll do this for 10 12 hours you tell me i'll be here the whole

112
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:12,399
time if i do this how long will it take then

113
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,480
and the teacher thought again for a moment and replied

114
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,880
20 years

115
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:32,959
so as that story suggests um sometimes the harder we try

116
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:40,240
the further away we get to where we think we might want to be going

117
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,560
and the late zen teacher from who was a teacher here in the area shinryu

118
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:57,680
suzuki who was a teacher up in san francisco

119
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:04,560
he used to say that the right kind of energy is very important

120
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:11,839
and if there was such a thing as bad effort um he would say that well

121
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:17,600
that's the kind of effort that moves in the wrong direction

122
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:25,440
so that would be something like maybe moving against the current

123
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,720
you know the wrong direction direction that requires

124
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,639
more effort so i think about cycling sometimes i like to go cycling and

125
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:43,279
sometimes it gets very windy around here and maybe some of you have had this experience but i like to cycle

126
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:48,880
over by shoreline and the bay lands some beautiful trails there

127
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,880
and some days i go and i'll be cycling north and there's a southeasterly wind of like 18 miles an

128
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:02,639
hour and it's really hard it's like like pushing against this wind and it

129
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:09,600
i get horribly frustrated and you know i start to feel myself you know wishing

130
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,680
wishing for something else you know wishing that it be different like ugh i'm expending so much energy and

131
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:21,839
i don't have that wonderful feeling of just you know moving gliding on two wheels which is the part that i love

132
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,639
about cycling

133
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:35,440
so then when we apply that to practice that image what does it mean

134
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:41,560
when in our practice our efforts move in the right direction

135
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:52,560
so another another prominent figure in in zen teaching and

136
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,839
in soto zen teaching specifically was a a monk and a teacher from the 13th

137
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:03,600
century called hey dogen and

138
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:10,399
on the subject of effort in practice he he provided some images to his

139
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:17,360
students to to take away and to think about to chew on he said to them think about the kind of

140
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:25,199
effort that would be exerted by a thief trying to steal a precious jewel

141
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:32,480
well think about the kind of effort that would be that would arise for a warrior

142
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,360
about to fight a formidable

143
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:44,399
enemy or maybe the kind of energy and

144
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:51,839
effort that comes up in the heart of somebody who's in love

145
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:59,040
and wants to get the attention of their beloved

146
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,800
that sort of rich boundless energy that would be in somebody's heart

147
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,120
at that moment

148
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,000
and so i think what he's trying to say here you know not necessarily encouraging us towards you

149
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,519
know theft and violence but that the the energy that's present

150
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:27,759
in all of these examples it's inherent it's it's already there

151
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:34,320
it's not something that needs to be forced it's something that can be used

152
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,639
tapped into

153
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:47,279
so maybe in in some ways we can we can all relate to this on some level

154
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,120
that kind of focus when

155
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:59,680
we move towards an object of desire you know maybe something that we really want

156
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:05,839
a beloved person an activity that we become

157
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:11,120
fixated on survival you know whether it's just our

158
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,520
own survival the survival of someone we love

159
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:23,120
i'm a parent i um i think about

160
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,160
the kind of attention and energy i put into being around my

161
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:34,240
daughter when she first started to walk or when she first rode a bicycle and my

162
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:40,480
heart was in my mouth being next to her just every wobble like

163
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:46,000
you know and there's not much that would have distracted me at that moment

164
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,799
you know i absolutely feel like by how i have this biological

165
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:57,840
programming as a parent to you know

166
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,960
have her at the forefront of my attention

167
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:10,000
especially if there's some danger in the air

168
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,559
so the effort's already there in abundance and i think the way that i

169
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:22,240
understand master dogan's teaching you know the way that he talks

170
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,520
about energy in this way is that there's an encouragement here to

171
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:35,120
try and find a quality of effort that can be sustainable

172
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,240
um that would be healthy and not and not be depleting

173
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:47,200
you know if you spend half an hour

174
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:53,360
cycling against the wind you won't get very far

175
00:18:53,360 --> 00:19:00,000
and you might end up feeling very frustrated and tired physically in your body

176
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,480
if you turn around and point your bike in the other direction it would be a very different kind of

177
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,480
experience

178
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:22,330
so how to bring that quality or even that intensity of energy

179
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:29,440
[Music] into everyday life into practice

180
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:35,440
into moments that are not necessarily exciting or fraught

181
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,799
you know maybe especially starting out in practice we may just have a

182
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:49,280
a moderate sort of idea that oh this would be good for me this is a good thing to do

183
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,400
seems good people who meditate they seem to be

184
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:00,880
happy happier maybe maybe not but you know maybe this is a direction

185
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,720
i'd like to move in or maybe i feel very strongly about this today

186
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:13,120
but how will i feel next week or next month or next year like how could i sustain this

187
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:21,919
over time how to really find an authentic

188
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:30,559
motivation in myself in the midst of distractions and tiredness

189
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:36,400
or maybe just too much comfort safety you know

190
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:42,158
or just moments of feeling disengaged how to do

191
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:53,520
that so what master dogen said

192
00:20:53,679 --> 00:21:00,320
he said well you can't just make this up you can't just will it into being

193
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:06,320
or think about it you know do it this is not an intellectual exercise

194
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:14,200
it's not something that can be done by some temporary method of contemplation

195
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:22,080
instead he taught this he said that in order to arouse

196
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:28,960
this mind of practice we need to try and tap into what's

197
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,640
already there we need to

198
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:43,320
prime the ground so that it can appear so that it can rise up

199
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:52,000
and his recommendation for this you know he said what what we can all work with

200
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,679
is we can all practice with impermanence

201
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,640
impermanence

202
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,880
so what is it about impermanence you know

203
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:15,919
this is something that's very core to buddhist teaching

204
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:23,280
but how can practicing with impermanence you know

205
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,559
give rise to this kind of energy well at least when when i think about this

206
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:34,799
you know the most um the first example that comes up for me is you know thinking about death it's very obvious

207
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:40,640
sort of stands for it seems to be the first kind of image of impermanence that rises

208
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,720
up for many of us through various points in my life

209
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,840
especially as a young person death the idea of death has been quite a

210
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,240
fixation for me

211
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:04,000
on the one hand it's it's generated a lot of actual sort of physical fear you

212
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,600
know felt sensations of fear in my body this idea of extinction

213
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,799
this may be a very natural response to the prospect of

214
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,279
extinction is a kind of a bodily fear

215
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:26,240
a kind of panic as though i was already you know facing a very hungry tiger or

216
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:33,280
something sort of a flight or fight energy it can be a very strong kind of bodily

217
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:39,600
energy so that's you know that's one thing that i experience in the face of

218
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,400
impermanence

219
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:55,200
and then there's a more kind of mental reaction that comes along with it too

220
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:06,240
this is a you know perhaps um

221
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:13,360
in the face of of death or in contemplating death in an intellectual way we sort of arrive at a bit of an impasse

222
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:19,760
sometimes it's something that's very hard to understand i think for me

223
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:26,320
in contemplating impermanence in this way it was sort of hard to understand how

224
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:32,640
we just carry on with our daily lives and

225
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:38,960
not be addressing this very urgently you know day by day

226
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,159
so this was this this question that came up if you know how to live in the in the face of impermanence you know for me

227
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:55,840
this generated a lot of energy um in wanting to well find an answer find a solution you know

228
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:02,960
and there's a wonderful um little student master exchange in the

229
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:10,559
zen tradition that i heard recently that i just thought ah yes the student asked the master one day

230
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:17,039
what is the direct way to obtain buddha's wisdom what is the direct way

231
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:26,159
to obtain buddha's wisdom and the master replied there is nothing more direct than this question

232
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,320
think that's it you know the question's there and you're off

233
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,399
they say the question's there the way opens

234
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:45,200
i was with a friend recently who sadly lost

235
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:52,000
their their pet you know they just lost their pet and

236
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:58,240
we were talking about this and you know what a what a traumatic experience this had

237
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,919
been for this person and they'd actually been

238
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:09,120
in the vets with their pet when the pet was put down

239
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,480
um and then they were administered i suppose an injection and

240
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:20,400
you know they were holding the animal and then one moment the animal was alive and the next moment

241
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:26,799
they were gone and this this friend is a fellow

242
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:32,159
practitioner and he said to me you know i um

243
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:37,279
and excuse me i'm paraphrasing him but this was how i understood what he said to me he said

244
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:42,400
you know i i've come to through my practice try and understand impermanence

245
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:49,240
on some level and i can try and understand our

246
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:55,840
interrelatedness as human beings and as as all life forms in the world and

247
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:02,720
there's ways in which i can understand birth but he said i can't get my head around

248
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:08,880
this i don't understand this death i don't understand

249
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:15,200
where this member of my family has gone

250
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:21,120
it just it created a you know a kind of a wall for him and he said i'm you know

251
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,640
i'm trying to look at all the teachings that are out there but there's nothing that's resonating with

252
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,279
me right now

253
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:39,200
and what i noticed was it it gave rise to a kind of energy in him almost an anger that seemed very

254
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:45,200
motivating what he wasn't saying was like so you know having having had this experience

255
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:52,240
now i'm just gonna pack up and not try anymore you know it seemed to want to push him forward

256
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:59,919
into something and what that is isn't necessarily entirely obvious

257
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,080
at first

258
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:13,520
so there was a another zen master in 17th century china called wu yi yuanlai

259
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,720
who's also popularly known in japan as master boshan

260
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:25,440
and master boshan would be very happy with this situation with my friend he would be very happy because he he

261
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:31,760
would he like to hear his students express this kind of situation for themselves

262
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:39,200
he he very much felt that this was the door that would open and lead students into practice and lead

263
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,960
them toward awakening there's a there's a phrase that says great doubt

264
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:51,278
great awakening that's the idea great doubt great awakening and

265
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:57,679
master yan lai said he said if you genuinely inquire

266
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:04,559
you rouse this doubt and you wield it as a razor sharp sword

267
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:10,399
whoever comes in contact with its blade will be annihilated

268
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:14,880
that strong a wonderful image

269
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:26,240
so i don't know um how many of you are familiar with the rinzai school of zen i know myself i'm

270
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,919
only very faintly familiar but one of the things that some people know

271
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:37,600
about the rinzai school is that they they practice with koans the koan

272
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:44,640
is a kind of a situation or a sort of a puzzle that's given to a student

273
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:52,399
and it can you know it's something that just stays with you and it's something

274
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:58,799
that doesn't make sense and maybe sticks with you and

275
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:06,399
eventually it challenges a student's sense of the world you know to the extent where

276
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:11,600
they might start their paradigms of the world would start to shift

277
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,398
you know they would start to be a fundamental kind of change

278
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:22,480
so this was a great insight i think from from the rinzai masters that something

279
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,520
that gives people energy is problem solving you know it's very hard to sit

280
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:33,600
with a problem and just let it go like we have this we have this

281
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:39,679
desire you know to find resolution a lot so this this is harnessed in some

282
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:46,000
practices so in summary

283
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,720
um you know thinking about the different kinds of energies that arise from

284
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:59,519
the practice and contemplation of impermanence they can be any they can be things like

285
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:05,519
fear or even anger doubt

286
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:12,559
longing puzzling problem solving

287
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,640
or joy

288
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,919
all responses that come from different parts of ourselves maybe

289
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:29,919
different different personalities for different people maybe some of us are more driven by

290
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:36,720
questions maybe some of us are more driven by fear maybe some of us are driven by a sense

291
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:44,760
of longing a sense of wanting to connect with something we don't even quite know what it is

292
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:54,240
and to address the the last mention of or

293
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:02,080
and joy i think of mary oliver's beautiful poem wild geese

294
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:07,760
in which she says you do not have to walk

295
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:14,880
on your knees for a hundred miles through the desert repenting

296
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,880
you only have to let the soft animal of your body

297
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:27,840
love what it loves you do not have to walk on your knees

298
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:34,799
for a hundred miles through the desert repenting you only have to let the soft animal of

299
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:40,760
your body love what it loves

300
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:49,440
she's talking about trusting ourselves and trusting what

301
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:55,039
arises whatever it is that's bringing us here

302
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:02,480
letting the soft animal bodies love what we love

303
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:10,039
fear what we fear long for whatever we long for

304
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:18,000
because first if you're thirsty you'll get yourself to water

305
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,760
and if you're hungry you'll get yourself to food right if you're tired you'll you'll find

306
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:29,360
your bed eventually and so what is it in you that's bringing

307
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:36,000
you here what is it that's fueling your spiritual practice

308
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,840
what are you responding to

309
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:52,679
and i'll finish with um a quote from another late zen teacher called cobenchino

310
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,080
he said when you realize how rare

311
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,320
and precious your life is

312
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:10,639
and how it's completely your responsibility

313
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:18,560
how you decide to live it how you manifest it

314
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:25,040
that's such a big responsibility that naturally

315
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:31,280
such a person sits down for a while

316
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:36,639
it's not an intended action

317
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:40,240
it's a natural

318
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:52,638
action may all beings benefit from practice

319
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:59,280
may they be happy may they be joyous and may they be safe

320
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:06,480
and may every river run into the sea

321
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:20,160
so we have thank you we have a couple couple of minutes left

322
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:29,880
i think on the clock if you have any responses reflections even questions

323
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:37,920
yes please if you live with joy the way you

324
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,359
described it and wisdom the way buddhism describes wisdom

325
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:49,039
what is the state of awakening that might come

326
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:57,760
at some point could you repeat the question sorry so

327
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:03,680
you said that the joy well you uh you mentioned that if you

328
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:09,359
live naturally and let the the shelby say the

329
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:15,839
the better part of you the loving part of you to manifest itself in real life

330
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:21,520
and and have joy be the driving force

331
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,960
how does it lead to awakening

332
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:37,920
in the moment when true joy

333
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:44,079
is manifest true joy as a response to

334
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:49,440
life and the understanding

335
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,480
of this conscious being

336
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:00,800
just that moment itself is awakening

337
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:07,480
thank you very much thank you thank you for that question

338
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:24,560
thank you yeah i was um hurrying to a retreat once and this bit of doggerel arose in my mind

339
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,599
something like i'm late i'm late i cannot wait i must hurry up and

340
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:37,040
meditate [Music] anyway

341
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:43,359
and uh so thank you for mentioning doubt and uncertainty it's interesting the interplay between

342
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:48,839
doubt and confidence trust

343
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:54,480
um and another thing is that you know another translation for a nietzsche is

344
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:02,720
uncertainty so anyway if you have any any comments

345
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:07,920
what was the word you used the translation that you translated

346
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,960
the three whatever they are

347
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:29,359
is um uncertainty or impermanence anata is not self and

348
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:34,079
is suffering pain

349
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,960
and how do you how do you experience them as interrelating

350
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:48,960
so the the theravada term for those is the three characteristics of existence

351
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:55,599
and so they uh there are fundamental

352
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:02,000
things that operate in our in our existence they're

353
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,640
demonstrably true yeah thank you

354
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:18,079
yes please bill i just want to thank you for early in your talk

355
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:23,200
raising [Music] the question of noticing how

356
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:28,480
those thoughts will persist during meditation and

357
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:34,640
then wondering can i do this or am i not dedicated enough or is there something

358
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:41,280
wrong with me so i i know that's

359
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,560
the persistence of daydreams during meditation is a very common

360
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:54,559
still it's helpful to hear that even teachers

361
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,200
sometimes have that experience too thank you

362
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:07,119
sometimes even more than sometimes i didn't want to say that

363
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:14,640
thank you thank you all so much

364
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:19,760
thank you i wish you a good day and a good

365
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,800
