1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:06,160
okay so nice to see all of you we're starting

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,759
a fresh week together so just as a brief introduction

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:20,240
I'll say more after the sit um I'll tell a little story one of the early influential

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,640
teachers of the teachers who founded the Insight movement in the US was an Indian

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,360
woman whose name was deep and she had had a very difficult life

6
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:38,320
with a lot of loss and then a powerful Awakening that made her really an

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:45,840
embodiment of love and wisdom and she was teaching a retreat at IMS in

8
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:53,520
Massachusetts and somebody asked her what's in your mind it's an interesting question right

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,280
and she answered very straightforwardly she said there is meta there is

10
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:08,040
concentration and there is peace that's a nice mind so this week uh

11
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,600
we're going to be looking at a list that says something about the Buddha's mind

12
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,040
uh it's considered a very it's actually considered skillful in this tradition to

13
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,920
open ourselves to reflecting on the qualities and abilities of w awakened

14
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:33,479
people and even then on our own wholesome qualities it's meant to reflect back into us so there's a list

15
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:40,840
that's called the epithets of the Buddha or sometimes it's called the attributes of the Buddha that we'll be exploring

16
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,159
this week in the talks um there's also a way of formally

17
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:54,040
meditating on these qualities but it's not quite the right format for us to do that during the meditations so in the

18
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,399
meditations will be touching on our own wholesome qualities in various ways but

19
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:06,520
if any of you are in this area and you want to learn the formal practice I'm going to teach it at a day long this

20
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:11,840
Saturday October 12 so that's called the recollection of the Buddha

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:20,280
practice um but for today uh we'll we'll be meditating um on various on a certain

22
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:27,080
wholesome quality of mind so let's get started on that please find a posture

23
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,480
where you can meditate well it's fine if you're sitting or lying

24
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:40,280
down or standing could even be walking gently back and forth if that works for

25
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:46,519
you and check in with your posture

26
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:53,120
so finding a way to be upright or at least to have a straight

27
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,519
spine and also relaxed

28
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:05,720
softening to the so we want to be alert and present but not tight so easy to be

29
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:14,440
a little bit overly tight as we're

30
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:22,560
present so softening in closing the eyes if that feels comfortable for

31
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,120
you maybe taking a couple of long slow deep breaths

32
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,760
in and then softening on the out

33
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:41,799
breath letting your breath fill the body to the degree that you can so that you

34
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:50,200
really feel the energy of it flow into not only your chest and belly but your

35
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,040
arms and legs and

36
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,920
head letting the attention spread over the the wholeness of the

37
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:19,400
body and then to kind of greet the body by touching in with the attention to

38
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:27,440
various parts so the softening the muscles of the face the eyes and the eye

39
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,440
sockets jaw

40
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:46,479
bringing the attention down the neck throat to the shoulder area that too to

41
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:53,280
soften letting the shoulders drop a bit I like to imagine the shoulder

42
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,199
blades sliding down the back

43
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,039
down the arms to the

44
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,680
hands and into the chest

45
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:24,000
area sensing the heart space and also the physical rib gauge

46
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,680
the front the back the sides

47
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:39,440
releasing the [Music] diaphragm letting it just move on its

48
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:49,919
own and softening down into the whole belly area just

49
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,919
inviting

50
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:04,280
ease I find it helpful to simultaneously soften the abdominal muscles and the low

51
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:10,280
back muscles so the tightness of the in the spine

52
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,360
Falls away on both sides of the

53
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:26,160
spine and softening the hip joints sensing if you're sitting the

54
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:35,680
contact point with the seat relaxing into that letting yourself be

55
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:44,260
supported then releasing any tension in the legs all the way down to the

56
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,279
[Music]

57
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:58,199
feet and inviting mindfulness in the mind inviting

58
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:04,919
presence of already been cultivating it with this simple connection to the

59
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:12,240
body so softening that gaze and letting the mind take in the whole of the

60
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:19,680
body and know that you know that and be at ease with how the body is

61
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,800
it's fine as it is

62
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:41,319
and allowing anything else that's present if you're in a certain mood or there are certain emotions or

63
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:48,319
thoughts lingering in the mind spying to acknowledge

64
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:05,560
those and for just uh the beginning part of this sit I'd like to invite the use

65
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:15,000
of the cognitive mind to bring in a reflection on your

66
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,159
aspiration and it's up to you to decide if you want to have an aspiration just

67
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:26,280
for this sit or if your mind is happening to be

68
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,440
opening to a wider aspiration about practice

69
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:39,760
aspiration is not goal you know we're not setting some requirement for

70
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:47,920
ourselves in the future self-improvement project an aspiration is an uplift in

71
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:54,519
the heart that we feel when we sense what is good or

72
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:59,720
beneficial about this practice that we know

73
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,040
so maybe there's a sense

74
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:13,519
of ease we know that there's an openness a

75
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,959
softness in the heart it comes from practice and we open

76
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:29,279
to that to whatever degree it's is present we know ah yes this

77
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:36,720
this is good or it could be a broader

78
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:45,360
reflection like knowing that over time our tendency to react has been

79
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:52,240
decreasing feeling Joy at the ease and relationships we've noticed from

80
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:58,839
that then having a sense of yeah this could keep going

81
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,120
or for some there's a sense of walking in the footsteps of the Buddha the

82
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:14,839
Buddha also did Sitting meditation it led to his Liberation from

83
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:21,720
suffering and here we are partaking of the same action how

84
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:28,399
amazing so whatever it is I'll be silent for a couple minutes

85
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:36,240
while you touch into that preferably as a bodily feeling yes it's in the mind but can you

86
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,440
feel it also in the

87
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,279
body e

88
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:51,639
and then allowing the cognitive mind to relax or release if it hasn't

89
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:59,399
already and just settle into the sensations of the breath

90
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:08,000
and if there's a lingering sense of goodness or even some kind of Joy or peace from

91
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,920
the aspiration maybe consider if the breath

92
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:22,199
can distribute that through the body just inviting that

93
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,959
possibility noticing the

94
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,399
effect and then even allowing that intention to

95
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:57,639
soften so this is a skillful way it's okay to use thinking

96
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:05,199
mind or the directed purposes and now settling into our usual

97
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:11,240
mindfulness of the breath or body

98
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:53,279
just noticing as you continue to sit normally if there's an effect from

99
00:13:53,279 --> 00:14:01,040
having brought in the [Music] aspiration

100
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

101
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
e

102
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

103
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,959
e e

104
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:04,919
if you find that the mind has drifted away which is very

105
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,240
normal you could touch back in briefly to the

106
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:20,798
aspiration that you had evoked as a simple way of re-inspired

107
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:26,799
uplifting the mind as it starts again in the present

108
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
moment

109
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

110
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

111
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

112
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

113
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

114
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

115
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

116
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

117
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,559
e e

118
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:39,000
as we continue to sit you're welcome to just continue on

119
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,159
with the breath or the body or your regular

120
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:53,480
practice or if you like you can invite a deepening of the

121
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:59,760
embodiment sense of this aspiration or

122
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:05,039
wholesome wish for your practice wholesome

123
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:10,919
motivation really feeling the goodness of it in your

124
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:16,519
cells in your tissues even in the

125
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:25,559
bones not creating anything but letting the mind's

126
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:31,039
Beauty Infuse into or resonate with what's

127
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:40,919
already open or free in the body so we have a sense of Mind and Body

128
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:47,039
together breathing through our

129
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:54,279
goodness the goodness of our practice it's not

130
00:23:54,279 --> 00:24:01,400
selfish it's not UNH wholesome in fact it's very

131
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:05,840
wholesome to really

132
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:15,240
feel what it is that we are doing in this practice and the goodness of it so

133
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:20,559
resting with that breathing with that daring to feel it all the way to our

134
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,559
core

135
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,320
having confidence in our good intentions

136
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

137
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

138
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,278
e e

139
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:06,200
and as we come toward the end of this

140
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,480
sitting sensing into how there may be some

141
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:18,520
momentum generated from this kind of practice or

142
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:23,799
this way that we directed The Mind in our practice

143
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:29,600
today and that we can carry that out into to our

144
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:36,960
life our mind will become occupied with other things of our

145
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:44,840
day but there is some momentum that we carry from touching into this

146
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:51,799
goodness it travels within us in some way and there's a bit of protection that

147
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:59,600
comes from that know maybe that moment and will

148
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:07,200
make it less likely that we can get knocked off balance by reading something or hearing

149
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,480
something that is disturbing or even thinking something one of our old

150
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:20,120
habitual thoughts maybe like when the bicycle's going a little faster it just doesn't

151
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:26,640
get knocked off so easily and so we might be a bit less

152
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:35,039
reactive we might be be a bit more open to others more open to

153
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:42,960
ourselves and there's some protection some degree of Refuge in

154
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,919
that so our practice once again is benefiting not

155
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:56,360
just us but those around us those we encounter and it serves as direct

156
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:03,080
protection in our normal daily activities what a beautiful

157
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:10,519
thing that can [Music] come just from paying attention

158
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:15,200
for period of time

159
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:07,240
so the theme this week is called uh Buddha's mind which might be a little

160
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:14,960
grandiose because the mind of the Buddha is actually unfathomable but it's meant to capture

161
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:21,600
the idea that it is skillful in our practice to touch into in various ways

162
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:29,320
from time to time what it means to live in an awakened way and the Buddha was

163
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:34,840
the Exemplar of the awakened life does that mean wearing monastic

164
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:42,399
robes and living in Ancient India no um instead we can uh we can look toward a

165
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:49,200
list that is traditionally called the epithets or the attributes of the

166
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:55,519
Buddha and in the main list that's used in the tadan tradition which is chanted

167
00:30:55,519 --> 00:31:01,320
every day in monasteries actually uh there are nine of these

168
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:06,760
attributes according to Scholars the official list has 10 and it's actually

169
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:14,720
used in every major Buddhist tradition so it's something that's common across all of Buddhism from the earliest texts

170
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:21,200
up to Modern practice that's happening right now so it's very appropriate that we take that up this

171
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:27,519
week um but I want to say a little bit about about this so you know why why

172
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:33,799
reflect on attributes of the Buddha at a base level it's meant to be

173
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:39,960
inspiring or uplifting and within that of course there's some mental training around how

174
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:45,519
we handle ideals within our mind I'm going to talk about these qualities not

175
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:50,840
as impossible ideals that we're not measuring up to yet but instead as

176
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:59,799
beautiful qualities that we already have some measure of so just

177
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:06,320
I was reflecting around this process and I remembered that when I was a kid I was

178
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:12,799
a trumpet player for a while and um there came a point where I had the

179
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:19,200
opportunity to meet a trumpet player named Claude Gordon who was uh quite a

180
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:25,440
master of the 20th century and in particular he um it's funny I didn't

181
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:31,559
know this at the time but he taught a method that included training in in breathing he he made his students do

182
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:39,039
breath exercises and he also devised some of the most detailed practice methods for trumpet that are probably

183
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:45,080
similar to practice methods for meditation you they're sort of a step-by-step process he was a very kind

184
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:52,519
and precise teacher and I had a chance to meet him and there was you know there was I'm certainly not was not on the

185
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:58,519
track to being a professional player at all I just was doing it as a as a kid so

186
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:04,000
there was never any consideration that I could be like Claude Gordon but I felt a

187
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,679
lot of respect for him and it was really wonderful to meet him and I also had a sense that I wanted to bring forth

188
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:18,080
similar qualities in myself that I saw in him so we could say there was kind of

189
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:26,159
wise admiration going on there um uplifting motivating for my for my

190
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:34,039
music and in the collection of the Buddha practice we bring to mind these nine specific attributes or epithets of

191
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:39,799
the Buddha and we turn them over in our mind letting them sink in so it's kind

192
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:45,399
of parallel to this wise admiration if you will and I'll acknowledge actually

193
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:52,919
that you know for some people uh the recollection of the Buddha practice is genuinely uh devotional and is a pure

194
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:59,159
art practice um but uh there's also different aspects of it

195
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:05,760
so um this week we're not going to be doing the formal practice but we are going to reflect on these nine in the

196
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:14,760
talks with three aims one is to inspire and uplift the heart uh the second is to

197
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:21,118
see aspects of these in ourselves because we actually have some of these

198
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:26,280
qualities to some degree and to feel that and to recognize and acknowledge

199
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:32,720
that and then third uh to see in them ways that we can use them in our daily life practice ways

200
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:41,240
that we can use them practically in the moment to support how we're doing our practice so

201
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:47,040
um that's the idea so there are nine of these and we'll cover the first two of

202
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:53,358
them today and I will offer interpretations of them based on my own

203
00:34:53,359 --> 00:35:00,680
practice and the commentaries of earlier traditions for your teachers um so this

204
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:08,640
whole list I should say also is Progressive the order is not arbitrary let's say it that way so if you hang on

205
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:16,599
throughout the week they get um more and more interesting and um move toward uh

206
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:23,160
really something quite amazing at the end so the first of the qualities is

207
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:31,720
simply called Aran it says the Buddha is aratham and that's the poly and um arant

208
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:39,760
is the goal of practice so it's um a mind that's free of greed hatred and

209
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:45,720
delusion so I like to think of this as you know kind of in modern terms perfect

210
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:52,000
mental health and so we would turn over in our mind wow you know what would it

211
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,960
be like to have a mind with no gried no hatred to no delusion wow you know that

212
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:06,040
would really um that would really be meaningful and amazing um we know uh from our own

213
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:11,960
mindfulness practice we are aware of greed hatred and delusion in our own

214
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:19,000
heart it's one of the things that mindfulness reveals and we have to take that on if we start a mindfulness

215
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:25,359
practice but I think it's very inspiring to think of uh the possibility of not

216
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:31,440
having those it's like why [Music] not to say oh no I'm not there I could

217
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:38,319
never get there but to just reflect on what that would be like and so then um

218
00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:45,359
it reminds us in a practical sense to be aware not only of the moments where we

219
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:51,079
are falling into various habits or where we just did and have now returned to

220
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:56,920
mindfulness but also to be mindful of moments where greed hatred and delusion

221
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:02,720
are not there right now after all these qualities are not

222
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:09,800
with us 247 they really aren't so for

223
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:16,240
example I'm going to do an exercise that was taught uh by the Burmese Master

224
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:21,760
tangu sad contemporary of mahasi

225
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:27,040
sadon and he would say look into your mind right now because usually while

226
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:32,520
we're listening listening to the Dharma we are not terribly caught up

227
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:38,599
in re hatred and delusion so look probably there isn't very much greed in

228
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:44,400
your mind right now you're not obsessed with getting something with the next thing you're

229
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:50,760
going to have probably the mind is pretty free of

230
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,480
grasping how does that

231
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:03,640
feel and and probably at this time your mind is not horribly wrapped up in

232
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:10,680
hatred in Rage or in detesting something you're

233
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:17,680
just sitting listening how is the mind without

234
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:27,560
hatred and probably your mind is not having a terribly distorted view of

235
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:35,160
reality right now I we all still have ignorance probably um but this moment you're

236
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:44,640
probably not grossly caught up in a a self a grandiose self view or um some

237
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:51,160
kind of very distorted understanding you're listening to the

238
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:57,640
Dharma how is it to have a mind relatively free of delusion

239
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:05,160
this is not too far from a taste of nibana of

240
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:12,520
I want to be careful about being too grandiose about that but there are moments of Freedom throughout our day

241
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:18,200
and can you bring a recognition of this kind of mind how this is for you into

242
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:25,760
your day more often we're not so far off when the mind

243
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:34,079
is relatively calm peaceful so Aram the possibility

244
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:40,680
of having mental health having balance in the mind some degree of ease that's

245
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:46,920
not dependent on conditions in the world being a certain

246
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:57,880
way and then the second of the bud gut as they're called in P is Sama s buo

247
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:02,920
s s buo which means something like fully

248
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:08,520
self-awakened It's usually the translation and I like to see this as

249
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:14,440
the Buddha saw all the way to the root of what's going on in the mind he saw

250
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:21,880
the the underlying process so in a sense he saw all the paths to Freedom not just

251
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:28,079
his own you know he had his own from based on his many lifetimes various

252
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:33,440
conditioning that he freed himself from but he saw so deeply that he didn't just

253
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:40,160
free himself he saw all the paths that are possible and so um the way we see

254
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:46,640
that in the modern world is that the teachings that we we read or hear about

255
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:53,200
are still so relevant I mean the Buddha lived in an ancient Indian culture 2600

256
00:40:53,200 --> 00:41:00,440
years ago across the world across the world for most of us um and here we are in a totally

257
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:06,960
different time in culture and yet when we hear the teachings we think yeah that

258
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:12,240
feels there's something right about that or we read it we think wow my mind works

259
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:18,960
that way too I'm Amazed by this and it's I think because of the Buddha seeing

260
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:25,079
down so deeply that he could teach in a way that touches human Minds in general

261
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:31,280
no matter where and when they live so there's a lot of gratitude arises in me

262
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:40,000
from that and then I feel a connection to the long line of practitioners who has uh kept these teachings alive for so

263
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:47,760
long after the Buddha saw so deeply so I like to think that these

264
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:53,200
verse two emphasize that the Buddha's mind was fully

265
00:41:53,200 --> 00:42:00,640
whome and our mind too has many whome some moments many moments where we see

266
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:06,440
into the reality of Human Experience We Touch in our own hearts and

267
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:12,960
Minds this is how it is and we're aware of that and we do our best to meet it

268
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:19,480
without greed hatred and delusion so this is um quite amazing

269
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:27,559
that this process is still unfolding there's a suta that says that um the Buddha said

270
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:35,680
I'm paraphrasing what the Buddha said but he essentially said a person whose mind has not so much greed hatred in

271
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:43,160
delusion is close to me regardless of their distance whereas someone who is

272
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:50,000
even following right behind me holding my robe is far away from me if their

273
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:56,520
mind is filled with GRE hatred and delusion so there are ways in which we

274
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:02,240
reflect these wholesome qualities um and it's important to

275
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:07,960
notice that and to reflect on that and to bring it into our hearts because as

276
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:15,359
we all know greed hatred and delusion are the roots that bring about

277
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:24,359
wars various other problems in the world like uh the challenges that the media

278
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:34,160
offers us of the delusion of various kinds spreading of um agitation harmful

279
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:39,599
views uh all the kinds of greed that unfold in the world all of these come

280
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:46,800
from these roots when they're unrecognized and are allowed to just grow out of control each time we bring

281
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:52,280
in our wholesomeness our aspirations our practice our mindfulness and we

282
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:57,680
recognize that in our own heart we contribute to the reduction of those

283
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:04,720
forces in the world so how beautiful is that and we've all

284
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:10,760
done it together this morning together and I hope you'll keep that in mind as

285
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:16,280
the day unfolds it's so simple each of our moments of wholesomeness but they

286
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:22,160
add up to quite a Rushing River of all of us doing this

287
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:28,400
together so this is our first and really the simplest

288
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:34,160
um understanding of these attributes of the Buddha and they'll continue to

289
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:39,760
unfold day by day and we'll go through nine of them by the end of the week hope

290
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:45,280
you'll continue so thank you for your practice and for your good heart and

291
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:53,880
your good aspirations and may they benefit many people today be well
