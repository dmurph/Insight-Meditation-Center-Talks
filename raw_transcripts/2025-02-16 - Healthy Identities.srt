1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,640
so good good morning everyone is this uh loud enough for everyone well

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:12,880
hello so I have one announcement same I did last week last week we launched this

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,400
fundraising drive for save the children and um and so it's partly a

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,720
followup and announcing it again we're for this week for like this eight days

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,840
or so we were focused as a community on supporting save the children

6
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:37,480
and uh this is a longterm longtime one of the Premier best rated Charities or

7
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:43,480
humanitarian organizations in the world focused on caring for children uh in uh

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:51,280
especially in areas of great distress and they have an emergency fund for those who are in overd distress and

9
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,480
great emergency places like Gaza and Sudan and and

10
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:03,360
um and uh uh we raised uh money for them three years ago

11
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:09,920
and then we I was surprised I didn't know what to expect but there were $70,000 thought that was pretty cool

12
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,720
coming out our community so we're doing it again now and uh and we're close to

13
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:23,880
that goal uh on the on the if you if you donate you you'll end up on a page and

14
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:29,479
if you follow follow the links on imc's website you'll get to a page on Save the

15
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:38,840
Children which is for IMC so they're tracking how much is coming in from us and uh and uh and right now there's

16
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:45,600
about $53,000 and then another $10,000 or so have come has come in in other ways that

17
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,560
uh that is not not listed there so that's like $63,000 and that's pretty

18
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:57,600
close and that's kind of inspiring and the $70,000 is

19
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:04,640
arbitrary and um so you know it's not like it's all fantastic that we're what

20
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:13,040
we're doing as a community and it seems very um invalu more invaluable to do this for

21
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,599
the children who are going to be supported but also because um so many nonprofits like this who are doing

22
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:26,000
really important work in the world and now have now been defunded by the current Administration and including

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,200
save the children so that uh the now I I imagine

24
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:38,400
the donations now are worth much more than what comes in because they'll probably put it to really high use and

25
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,920
and um so it seems like particularly important time to support these things so if you're all interested that'll it's

26
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:51,200
on you know imc's homepage there's a two different places to connect to

27
00:02:52,040 --> 00:03:00,440
it so so the last uh two days espe

28
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,519
yesterday uh I've been teaching dayong Retreats on the topic of

29
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,440
identity and uh so it's still fresh in my mind and it's such a phenomenally

30
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:18,560
important topic to address to become wise about um because it follows us

31
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,319
everywhere we go in all situations down through times people have struggled and

32
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:30,159
and uh cause a lot of pain through the topic of their identity and their

33
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,760
identity in relationship to other people and uh so to have some sense of

34
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,879
some focus on it I think uh is the focus in one of the core

35
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:50,000
human dimensions of being a human being and um and so yesterday my co-

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,680
teer for Vanessa Abel read this poem by David White and so I'd like to start

37
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:03,120
with reading it the sound of a

38
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:10,799
bell still reverberating or a blackbird calling

39
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:18,600
from a corner of the field asking you to wake into this life

40
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,280
or inviting you deeper into the one that

41
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:32,000
Waits either way takes courage either way wants you to to be

42
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,280
nothing but that self that is no self at

43
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:44,160
all want you to walk to the place where you find you already know how to give

44
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,080
every last thing away the approach that is also the

45
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:57,680
meeting itself without any meeting at all that Radiance you've always carried

46
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:05,400
with you as you walk both alone and completely accompanied in Friendship by

47
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,880
every corner of the world crying

48
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:18,000
Allelujah one of the reasons I like this poem for for now is David

49
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,560
White uh is going back and forth with different ways of understanding the self different kinds of identity at times

50
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:31,039
identifying with everything at times being being nothing there's nothing here to

51
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:37,280
identify um and uh and we find that the whole topic of identity is really a

52
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,600
fluid phenomena that comes and goes and disappears and arises and exists in so

53
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,280
many different ways as we go through our day and any attempt to solidify it and

54
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:56,720
make it into this is how it is is bound to dissolve at some point or crack and

55
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:04,400
break and um so um uh the other thing about this topic

56
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:12,400
of identity is what we'll do today is talk a little bit about how the Buddha addressed this issue because the topic

57
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,800
of identity was uh very big in his time as well and there was a lot of suffering

58
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,520
around it that he wanted to address and uh and the way he addressed

59
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,759
many things including this topic could be understood to be both

60
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,160
spiritual and from the Buddhist point of view which is pointing towards the possibility of some kind of profound

61
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:42,240
deep Liberation but also he addressed it ethically and over and over again he you

62
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,440
see him pointing to living an ethical life as being at the heart of it all and

63
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:54,599
it comes together with Liberation Liberation itself is a source for an ethical life for

64
00:06:54,599 --> 00:07:02,680
people and so in these last uh while now uh uh with what's happening in our world

65
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:09,000
uh uh I've kind of feel like I've been I've been wanting inspired to replicate

66
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,160
what the Buddha did and really to emphasize ethics the Buddhist approach to ethics over and over again it seems

67
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:21,120
like this is really a key time to emphasize it uh as a response as a way

68
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:27,360
of responding to what's happening in the world where there's so much of it which is unethical where there's so much

69
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:34,000
cruelty and hostility and so much creation of US versus them uh which has

70
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,400
to do with identity in a way that is creating more suffering than it's

71
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:47,440
alleviating and uh and so this topic of Ethics is addressing the issue of how we

72
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,639
cause harm or how we stop causing harm and that's the kind of simplest

73
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:58,960
definition of ethics from a Buddhist point of view ethics is the study of how

74
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:06,639
not to cause harm in any kind of way so in the time of the Buddha there

75
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:13,520
was a class of people who called themselves brahans and brahans considered

76
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,800
themselves to be the superior class and it wasn't just that they were

77
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,919
off by themselves happily thinking about themselves as being Superior they also

78
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:29,159
uh had all kinds of ideas how everyone else was a lower class than them and

79
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:34,518
they had various classes that they was distinguished in their time and they had

80
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:40,800
a hierarchy of it and in at least from the Buddhist uh texts where the how the Buddhist

81
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,920
describe it um uh sometimes uh when they when the brahmans wanted to be critical

82
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:54,160
of the Buddhists Buddhist monastics um they put them at the very bottom of that

83
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:00,760
hierarchy and um and had various not so kind things to say about them

84
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:07,040
and um so um um and so but this was a a

85
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,600
topic of the uh issue in the Buddhist time and it was an issue among the brahmans

86
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,720
themselves and there was a debate between two friends who were brahmans

87
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:24,920
and one of them made the claim that one becomes a Brahman by by birth that it's

88
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:31,920
a hereditary phenomena it's a biological thing you are a Brahman and then you somehow pass on that Brahman Hood to

89
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:38,959
your children to your children in other words uh superiority in society is a

90
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:45,839
genetic thing is a is a biological thing that gets transmitted through birth only

91
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:52,360
meaning anybody who's not born as a Brahman does not deserve to be in that Superior

92
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,760
class so that was the one of the friends was claiming that and the other one was

93
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:04,680
claiming no one is a Brahman by action by how one lives one's life what one

94
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:10,480
does and so if it's by action then anyone can be a Brahman even the people

95
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,880
who would may be considered to be the lowest C class sometimes the Buddhists

96
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:23,399
maybe even they could be uh brahmans um by what they did how they acted so they

97
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:29,399
were having this debate and they couldn't uh come to an agreement so uh they went to the the

98
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:37,160
Buddha to ask him and what is interesting to me one of the interesting things about that is uh

99
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:43,120
the Buddha um took

100
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,560
sides he was very clear and

101
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:56,440
quite strong in taking the sand that one is a Brahman by action he did not stay

102
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:04,760
above the fry he did not stay somehow Det ped from it all without taking sides and somehow taking some kind of other

103
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:14,200
third position in this kind of situation he took a clear stand and given uh how the Buddha often

104
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,440
teaches I suspected it was very much because uh the the approach that you're

105
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,839
Brahman by birth was causing a lot of harm and he saw that harm that was being

106
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:30,480
created in his society and then he went on to say

107
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,920
that a Brahman the word Brahman is simply a verbal

108
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,320
designation it's just a word it's a word that's applied or defined in a certain

109
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:47,320
way there's nothing inherent and absolute about the word and um and it's

110
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:54,160
just you know it's a convention and and the Buddha felt quite

111
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:01,079
free with these conventions so he simply redefined it

112
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:07,920
and um and so uh and he defined so he used the title

113
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:14,199
Brahman but he said uh let me tell you who's really a Brahman since he's going to talk about it from the point of view

114
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:20,240
of action before he does that he did he did go through in responding to these two

115
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:31,160
brahmans with their debate saying in human life among humans there is no kind of biolog

116
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,680
logical visible way to really distinguish people from each other human

117
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:45,839
beings we're all human beings together in common kinship and uh and so uh that you know

118
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:52,760
so he first made clear in his view that's what he believed and then he went on to say well now I'll tell you who a

119
00:12:52,760 --> 00:13:01,120
Brahman is so um so I'll

120
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:09,399
um so and this is he does this in a series of I don't know how many 27

121
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:15,760
verses and uh these verses are then kind of canonized or held up in higher

122
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:22,480
respect than Buddhism they they appear at different places because they're so important maybe and um and one of the

123
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,920
places in the dapada it's in the end of the dapada it's kind of but here's here

124
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:36,079
it is in this this other text having given up

125
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:42,600
violence towards living beings both timid and strong whoever kills nor

126
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:50,160
causes others to kill I call a Brahman whoever speaks what is true

127
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:59,240
informative and not harsh who harms no one I call a Brahman

128
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,839
whoever endures abuse assault and imprisonment without

129
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:14,839
animosity and and who has forbearance as one strength as one Mighty Army I call a

130
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:21,440
Brahman whoever is wise of profound wisdom understanding what is and is not

131
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:28,040
the path and who has attained the highest goal I call a

132
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:37,079
Brahman so he goes on there's a lot of verses like this he's ending I call the Brahman so he's not shying away from

133
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:43,759
using a term that implies an identity a Brahman he's defining it in a way that

134
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:50,040
fits life of not causing any harm some of you might not agree with

135
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:57,560
that strategy that to use an identity to apply that to people the way he chose to do but that's what he did but it's a

136
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:02,680
definition of identity based on action what people

137
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:10,440
do and um and then he goes on to say or in the same context he says that um just

138
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:18,959
like Brahman is a verbal designation based on what a person does uh we call someone who Farms a

139
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:27,519
farmer we call someone who is involved in Commerce a merchant someone who is a

140
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:34,399
crafts person does craft a craft person so people get identity based on the

141
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,160
activity that they do which has functional value if

142
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:48,839
um uh if your neighbor ordinarily works as fixing cars and is known as a car

143
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:56,000
mechanic and your car doesn't start one morning and you need to get someplace important you know it might be useful to

144
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:04,920
remember oh there's this car mechanic next door and uh that's a useful identity at that time um you could not

145
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:10,319
have that word car mechanic because you think it's kind of oppresses people that

146
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:17,160
be narrowed down to such a thing you could just kind of do say it more complicated to yourself there's a person

147
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:22,959
next door who's able to fix cars but in shorthand you do everyone a

148
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:28,519
favor sometimes to have you know a single word for what's going on but it's

149
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:34,000
also understood to be contextual it's a verbal designation that has a functional

150
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,040
role that is not necessarily who the person is so that was the Buddha's

151
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:45,399
preferred way of seeing identity if you behave a certain way

152
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:50,560
live a certain way then that's who you're called and if you change you

153
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:57,519
change you become something else so each of us probably has many identities in

154
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:04,558
the course of a day some of them are applied to you by others and some of them is ones that you

155
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:10,880
happy to have for yourself um if uh you know if you're

156
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,839
driving on the freeway and uh and maybe you drive a little

157
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:23,079
funny on the freeway then someone comes home and says to their friends there was

158
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:28,120
this driver on the freeway he drove funny so you you were a driver for that

159
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:35,240
purpose that was your identity that you applied to you at that time uh if you

160
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:42,799
uh were buying food in the supermarket with eth very ethically very careful

161
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:51,200
choosing exactly what to do for the best possible thing someone else might be watching you being so careful and slow

162
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:59,280
choosing what you're going to buy they go home and say there was a shopper at the store you become a shopper

163
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:05,320
and um if you're at home cooking you're a cook if you're um and you know you

164
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:11,840
might not be thinking your yourself that way but functionally you're maybe behaving that way it becomes more

165
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:17,799
relevant uh if you're if you're with your children you're a

166
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:23,799
parent if you're uh with your parents you're kind of a child or a son or a

167
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:29,520
daughter or something sibling and uh and so

168
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:37,960
uh identity how we're seen how we're related to changes many times through the day and

169
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:44,559
uh sometime they have to do with roles we play where we earn our living we have

170
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:51,919
one role and one identity and then you might leave there and um be a coach for

171
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:58,320
the high school volleyball team and now you're all the kids in high school think of you as a coach and that's that's your

172
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:06,360
identity there which is useful in that context uh when I'm here with you

173
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:12,559
all trying my best to give a talk um I'm a teacher Dharma

174
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:19,000
teacher um if now if I care keep that identity with me like this is really who

175
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:27,158
I am boy is this this and people need to know that and I go home

176
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:34,240
this is this is not good when I first started to teach a lot

177
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,559
you know many many years ago a couple of times my wife would look at me and said to me

178
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:43,840
gil you're using that voice

179
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:54,120
again so you know I I couldn't be a teacher at home so um and so we pick up and we put

180
00:19:54,120 --> 00:20:00,400
down and it's fluid how it goes or we don't

181
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:06,000
and some of the identities we have we need to have somehow or stay close to

182
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,679
them because of how Society identifies us it sees us a

183
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:17,799
certain way and treats us through the lens of that identity and sometimes they

184
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:24,039
Society causes a lot of harm to people there are people right now who uh for

185
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:29,520
how they live their lives and conduct themselves and um uh the current

186
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:36,919
Administration is is uh has extreme hostility uh towards certain category of

187
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:42,679
people and so those people who are living their lives um now are afraid

188
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:49,480
because they're being identified and searched out by by people who don't like

189
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:55,799
them and so those people now have to kind of live uh in the wake of that live

190
00:20:55,799 --> 00:21:01,600
under that so it's kind of they might have an identity of their own but now

191
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:08,240
they're forced to kind of relate to it in a much more solid way and carry it with them just to be safe to think who

192
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:16,480
they are so harm is being caused when we have identity and create US versus

193
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:24,320
them and um so action

194
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,400
so um

195
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,480
so the

196
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:46,080
um so that's kind of nice that our actions define us or identify us but it

197
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:52,480
feels inadequate because it can feel like who we are as a person is much more than a

198
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,960
role much more than an activity and it feels almost like we're

199
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:03,159
reduced to much and certainly we're something else we're something more something greater something more

200
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:08,520
intimate and deeper and um and there is a word that I

201
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:14,000
believe the Buddha used for this kind of sense of self sense of

202
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,799
identity and um and uh I translated it as

203
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:26,039
personhood he called it ATA Baba and personhood and personhood is

204
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:31,159
made up of the sum total of all the things things that come together to give

205
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:37,960
us a sense of he for who we are and in some ways it's a some total of all the

206
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:45,320
actions not just what we do with our bodies you know the work we do or the activities we engaged in but also the

207
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:51,559
feelings we have the emotions we have the attitudes we have um the mental

208
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:57,279
activities the mental actions that we do and there was an idea in the time of

209
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:03,720
the Buddha Buddhist teachings that uh that people could also be

210
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:11,520
recognized by what they were attached to in their mind and that uh something about uh

211
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:19,640
being attached clinging to something and some activity of the mind some belief some attitude clinging to some identity

212
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:25,600
the clinging created something that had a certain which is in action created

213
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:32,640
something that you could say that person is clinging it's a Clinger and not everyone could see that but in

214
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:39,159
the mythology of Buddhism there was a um a mythological figure called Mara and

215
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:45,480
Mara is kind of like a demi demigod or Demi Satan or some hybrid of those two

216
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:51,039
we don't quite know what what this person is but the primary activity that

217
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:57,200
Mara wants to do stop in the world is to stop people from getting

218
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:04,120
enlightened because because Mara really likes it when people cling and see so the last thing Mara

219
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:09,240
wants is anyone to stop clinging in this mythology Mara

220
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:17,159
identifies people by the clinging in their minds and Mara gets confused when the

221
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:23,240
mara sees a a liberated person because there's no

222
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:29,840
clinging and you can't see the person in a sense so this point to another important

223
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:35,080
topic around identity it's one thing to have an

224
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:41,240
identity it's another thing to identify with the identity there's one thing to

225
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:48,159
have an identity it's another thing is how we relate to that identity how we hold it how we are with

226
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:55,840
it and um and so if we have some sense of personhood it's one thing to have it

227
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:02,760
it's another thing how we relate to it how we hold it how we participate in it

228
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:08,799
and for the Buddha personhood is something we contribute to and we help

229
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:14,600
cocreate it's not something that we're passive recipients of just because we were born some way

230
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:20,480
or and um and uh and the way and what

231
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,080
the Buddha wanted us not to not have any identity some Buddhists thinks that some

232
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:33,080
Buddhists think that if you're a Buddhist you're not supposed to to have an identity and uh harm has been caused in

233
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:40,480
Buddhist communities when people have said oh you know there's no self and therefore you're at

234
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:46,960
you're living in your world from the perspective of your identity should be overcome should be let go of and that's

235
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:53,880
you have a problem here and I think this is uh unfortunate that this is this this not self- teing has been interpreted

236
00:25:53,880 --> 00:26:00,679
that way the way the Buddha talked about identity and talked about especially

237
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:06,039
personhood he said there's a a healthy way of doing this and unhealthy way of

238
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:12,520
doing it that's my language um his language was more there's a wholesome way of doing it than

239
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:17,559
an UNH Wholesome Way in other words there's not a categorical rejection of

240
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:24,840
identity there's not a categoric categorical rejection of some inner sense of a person there my

241
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:31,720
personhood but rather are we in the activity of personing the activity of

242
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:37,720
selfing the activity of identifying is it done in a way that

243
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:43,440
creates health for us that creates uh wholesomeness in US creates goodness in

244
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,720
it is being do do uh being done in a way that is

245
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:55,919
ethical and the word there's one word that covers all these things I've been saying Health

246
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:02,120
wholesomeness uh ethics uh and that's the word um cusa some of

247
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:08,080
you might know it that is is probably the closest Buddhist word to our English

248
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:14,960
word ethics but it also means wholesome which kind of means healthy

249
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:22,360
but I love it that it means uh belonging to the whole the issue around identity

250
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:27,440
sometimes is the way in which we select out of the whole a piece of who we are

251
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:34,399
that we hang on to or limit the perspective on and uh and what Buddhist Liberation

252
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:42,399
is talking about is dropping the limit limiting ideas of identity in certain

253
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:49,240
situations so that we can have experience of the whole so that that sense of the whole and that freedom of

254
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:54,279
non- clinging then becomes a reference point for understanding how we

255
00:27:54,279 --> 00:28:02,399
participate in identities and personhood where we hold it as functional useful

256
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:07,840
designations that have a role but we hold them lightly we don't get attached

257
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:14,279
to them we don't cling to them and so this idea of uh of relating

258
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:20,320
to our personhood relating to the even the activities of our mind and a

259
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:27,640
assessing evaluating them is what I'm doing healthy for me is it wholesome and

260
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:33,919
is a contribute to Wholesome cultivation growth in the wholesomeness do I grow to

261
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:39,760
become a better person do I grow with my mind my heart is

262
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:48,640
Kinder more generous more loving more caring for others is it Freer is it more

263
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:55,399
peaceful is it more at ease or not which direction are we going

264
00:28:55,399 --> 00:29:03,399
and sometimes when people attach to Identity to their own or sometimes in their their uh projection of that onto

265
00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:09,840
others it's clearly causing harm to the person who does it some people hold on

266
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:15,320
to Identity for dear life in a way that actually harms them some people acquire

267
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:21,200
or take on identities that uh are identities of hostility and hate

268
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,480
identities of US versus them and that creates alienation that is bad for the

269
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:32,600
person who has it and um and so uh so the question is how

270
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:39,880
do we hold identities was what the Buddha was most interested in and is it unethical or

271
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:47,039
unethical is it wholesome or un wholesome is it healthy or unhealthy where all three of those categories are

272
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:53,120
talking about the same thing and um and so this is where

273
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:58,600
Buddhist practice comes into play Because as especially a meditation ation

274
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:05,679
practice because as we sit and meditate we become more and more sensitive

275
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:12,080
to what is healthy and what is unhealthy what is wholesome what is UNH

276
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:18,720
wholesome what what is uh in a sense ethical and not ethical what is harmful

277
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:24,120
what is not harmful what brings stress and what doesn't bring

278
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:30,399
stress and uh and the the the clear the mindfulness becomes the more stable and

279
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:36,240
subtle we are in the moment the more we see this movement sometimes very subtle

280
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:43,279
sometimes not so subtle of the impact the effect the influence the mind has on

281
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:50,320
itself or the mind has on the heart and in some ways we're shaping our

282
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:56,840
personhood by the very nature of what we're choosing to be involved in and in

283
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:04,519
ordinary life we don't track ourselves so much we don't even track ourselves not only what the mind is doing to make

284
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:10,080
a choice but we all not tracking the influence it has on us but not a few

285
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:16,279
people are ruminating and thinking over and over again bad thoughts about themselves critical thoughts about

286
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:24,120
themselves seeing it as being this is what's you know the nature of the true nature of the universe that I'm a bad

287
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:32,399
person that very is making them sick making them depressed that has a a tremendously negative influence on them

288
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:37,720
but when we sit in meditation and get quiet enough we can start seeing these

289
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:42,840
thoughts operating and if we're lucky enough we come to a place where we see

290
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:49,399
we have a choice to either continue with those thoughts or put them

291
00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:55,399
down and we can even feel some points that having no thoughts as as harmful as

292
00:31:55,399 --> 00:32:01,159
they might be self-critical thoughts um just having them is

293
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:06,200
tiring and it's just nice to take a rest and that

294
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:12,919
applies to positive identities as well you might have done a lot of kind

295
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:19,720
things in your life and it might be reasonable for you to think of yourself as a kind person you're sitting

296
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:26,039
peacefully in meditation and you start remembering yeah I'm a really kind person yeah I'm a

297
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:32,760
kind person yeah I'm pretty good kind person I've been kind person a long time yeah I'm a kind person isn't it great

298
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:39,240
that I'm a kind person and after a while it's going to occur to you

299
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:46,519
hopefully sooner rather than later but unfortunately it's many time it's later because these kinds of things are almost

300
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:52,320
subconscious this is tiring you know I I got the message the

301
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:58,639
first time I have better things to do than repeating this kind of thought

302
00:32:58,639 --> 00:33:04,919
uh and so even good identities at some point it's just good

303
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:10,679
to put them down you know it's

304
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:18,200
nice and then there's also deeper senses of personhood deeper senses of identity we have you know not involved individual

305
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:25,840
thoughts but kind of a gal of it all the whole and it's fascinating to watch as

306
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:33,559
that shifts and changes too and one of the places I think some of you maybe have had this experience of it

307
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:39,519
changing is on meditation Retreats those of you who've been on them and maybe

308
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:45,919
those of you haven't maybe there's situations where you've um you've experience yourself in a totally new way

309
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:51,120
that you've never had before so in meditation Retreats people in the course

310
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:58,519
of their longer retreat will get softer Kinder uh less ATT atted less

311
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:05,360
preoccupied with thoughts less rumination and caught up in the usual things and there's a softening of the

312
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:12,720
personality there's a uh there's a feeling of Greater kindness and care and preciousness and intimacy with life that

313
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:19,040
happens that people feel they have a whole different Persona whole different personality whole different sense of

314
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:25,599
self that feels so much healthier than how they live their life usually where there's a lot of

315
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:33,079
stress and some people will say say this is it I'm home this is what home is in

316
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:38,878
myself this is what I want to how I want to live my life and then they leave the retreat and

317
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:44,079
their personality returns before they leave the driveway of the ret Retreat

318
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:50,560
Center you know the personality starts coming back and and after a while we know it's back but we know we've seen it

319
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:56,118
coming back but um after a while we just forget that we could be different

320
00:34:56,119 --> 00:35:02,599
because we're so lost in that world world of this new P the old persona come back it's just how things

321
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:09,800
are uh sometimes people have that shift uh when um of something when their

322
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:16,839
ordinary life stops in some way I've known people for whom had serious illness or injuries and there was

323
00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:23,880
something about how much their life changed that they came to terms terms with that they the whole sense of how to

324
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:29,320
be a person shifted sometimes in a better way wow I'm a different person

325
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:37,520
than I was before uh I was so caught up in my previous identity I was so um Angry all

326
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:43,280
the time I was so ambitious all the time and I'm a whole different person now this is

327
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:48,640
phenomenal some people when they become parents their experience of who they are

328
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:55,800
becomes radically different and um there's a powerful book I for

329
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:03,440
parenting called um far from the tree and it's children who are born who

330
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:09,240
are very different than their parents and um and what's interesting

331
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:15,800
about this book The the author studies different kinds of different people

332
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:21,720
different who were born differently like people are blind or deaf or different condition all kinds of different

333
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:28,160
conditions prodigies and and then studies their the parents

334
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:36,480
and he his observation is that um parents of certain kinds of

335
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:44,359
children tend to become better people especially if the kids have great

336
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:49,640
disabilities parents of other kinds of uh children tend to become not so good

337
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:54,920
folks more selfish or preoccupied and that's apparently especially true when

338
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:00,599
when parents have prodigies that that somehow does something to the

339
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:08,040
conceit that is not so good so um so we we we shape this all

340
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:13,200
the time it's shaped and changed and we're actually more changeable than we

341
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:20,200
realize in all kinds of different ways and you could wake up tomorrow and find

342
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:27,800
yourself radically changed in unbelievable ways in terms of what you consider your identity

343
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:33,359
or it might be slow over a long time and

344
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:39,520
um I had a new identity recently that I said out

345
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:45,319
loud I uh I was teaching a retreat at our retreat center for people is in the

346
00:37:45,319 --> 00:37:51,720
20s and 30s you might ask what business I have doing that but I was I was

347
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:58,200
invited to teach it so I had a role and you know I look around the room and I

348
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:03,680
was clearly the oldest person there when I started in Buddhism I was like the

349
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:10,440
some of the youngest ones there and so at some point during the retreat I described myself as a as a

350
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:16,760
designated old person I had a new identity for that

351
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:23,760
Retreat and I thought it was kind of humorous so the sense of

352
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:30,400
self and then when mind gets really quiet there's a very interesting thing that

353
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,960
happens there's something that gets simpler and simpler and simpler about

354
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:41,760
Identity or about this notion of self and if you turn your attention to

355
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:47,119
sense and feel where that sense of self is in us when things are quiet enough

356
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:54,160
and still enough it might feel like it has a location there might be a a a feeling of

357
00:38:54,160 --> 00:39:00,280
enness that's all it what is amness just that I M it might be a very subtle

358
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:06,040
feeling of um of of a Locus a center

359
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:13,800
someplace it might be a Locus or Center has a little bit of pressure or little nice feeling of

360
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:19,200
tension or nice feeling of vibration or aliveness or something like

361
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:26,280
that and it can feel oh that's who I am the core the center of it all you know

362
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:32,599
free of all these identities free of everything left alone that's who I

363
00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:39,160
am now you can sit there and spend time hanging out with it looking at it

364
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:46,040
recognizing it and at some point what'll happen you'll

365
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:52,680
feel that it's a little bit tiring to do this focus on this place it's a little

366
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:59,280
tiring to keep looking at it and thinking about it just like it's tiring to keep having thinking the same identity

367
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:07,920
and so in meditation some point because it's tiring to have that Focus there's a quieting relaxing letting go that

368
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:14,119
activity and lo and behold that sense of amness that may be

369
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:20,280
a sense of locus the the center Falls

370
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:27,319
away it seems that it's the looking at the self is the

371
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:33,480
AC it that creates that little sense of activity and energy and vibration or

372
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:38,880
pressure it's the seeking and searching for the self in the end that creates

373
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:45,400
just a thing that's feels like this is who I am but if there's no looking for it no

374
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:50,240
searching for it where does it

375
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:57,880
go it becomes an irrelevant question because what's left is very peaceful

376
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:05,119
very spacious very free it's possible to have a tremendous

377
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:13,119
feeling of ease and peace without any reference to any kind of self self any

378
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:21,599
kind of creation of self identification of self a sense of personhood not to negate any of

379
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:29,839
that but it's just like in context from time to time it's really

380
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:35,520
good to take a vacation from it all it's really good to take a break

381
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:40,920
from all this selfing that we live in in our society where selfing goes on all the

382
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:48,520
time it's really healthy to do take that break because then we can see much more

383
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:55,040
clearly how selfing is constructed how selfing is something we participate in

384
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,599
and how it comes together and come comes and goes and morphs and

385
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:07,079
changes and um and we can hold it lightly why for what

386
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:15,240
purpose so we can live with it in an ethical way so we can live with it in a

387
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:21,160
with causing less harm in the world but actually doing the opposite live with

388
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:28,000
identity live with the personhood live with how we see other people in ways that support them

389
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:35,559
that is beneficial that sees them kindly that sees them generously that sees sees them with care

390
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:41,240
sees ourselves with care and maybe one of the identities

391
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:49,640
will will develop over time is we're a person who cares we're a carer for this

392
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:56,400
world and that can't be too bad so I'll read this um David uh White

393
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:03,400
poem again and then we'll stop so maybe you'll um this poem will have a little bit more

394
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:10,800
meaning now the sound of a bell still

395
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:16,520
reverberating or a blackbird calling from a corner of the

396
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:22,000
field asking you to wake into this life

397
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,280
or inviting you deeper into the one that Waits

398
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:34,319
either way takes courage either way wants you to be

399
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:41,400
nothing but that self that is no self at all wants you to

400
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:51,000
walk to the place where you find you already know how to give every last thing

401
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:57,119
away the approach that is also the meeting itself without any meeting and

402
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:03,960
at all that Radiance you have always carried with you as you walk both

403
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:10,800
alone and completely accompanied in Friendship by every corner of the

404
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:19,078
world Allelujah so I don't know if we want to say Allelujah that often these

405
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:26,640
days but let's let's at least be friends let's go into the world ready to

406
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:33,240
be friends with everyone and may that change the world if we want to change the world

407
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:39,680
Let's Be the Change by being ethical ourselves and if we and and then as we go about trying to make the world a

408
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:46,520
better place let's find a way to do it that stays ethical stays

409
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:56,838
wholesome and that way we become better people in the process may all beings be happy

410
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,640
thank you
