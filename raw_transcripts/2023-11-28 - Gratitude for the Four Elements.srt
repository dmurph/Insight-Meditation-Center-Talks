Thanksgiving and so here I am again A year later uh also here to talk about

6
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:50,000
Thanksgiving last year I spent about a week reflecting on what what things I

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,600
I'm thankful for what things I'm grateful for and I came up with um lists first

8
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:04,838
and foremost my parents who brought me into being who raised me

9
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:14,000
fed me educated me loved me um the rest of my family my sisters

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,439
and my brother and my aunt and grandparents

11
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:28,280
um uncles and aunts uh my community you know our

12
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:36,520
neighbors um people we went to church with um my friends people I went to

13
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,398
school with my

14
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,960
schoolmates um my Educators my

15
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:54,560
teachers I started school when I was three in preschool and I ended when I finished

16
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,320
graduate school at age 29 so I spent a lot of time in formal education ation

17
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,520
settings and had a lot of teachers um some I absolutely loved you

18
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:13,000
know some were kind of like so so but they all

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,720
um all of them I felt had my best interest at heart and um inspired me to keep going

20
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:28,640
to learn about science and math and um many other

21
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:34,239
things uh who else well

22
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:43,000
um I know people I knew from school fellow students and then uh I came to IMC in

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,280
the late 90s I guess in January it'll be 26 years since I've started coming

24
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:58,040
here um and so the teachers that I had here Gil and many other

25
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,640
teachers um who just

26
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:09,080
um offered the Dharma open-handed for so many years for

27
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:17,000
me um and the and the friends that I made

28
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,480
here um how often people that I consider are

29
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,239
my Dharma brothers and Dharma sisters or I guess not days Dharma

30
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:36,159
siblings um who I spent time with in cantam camita

31
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:42,840
groups discussing the Dharma or um just on one-on-one

32
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,040
discussions uh having meals going on

33
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:54,239
Retreats it's been very rich it's been it's been a very rich Community for me

34
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:01,360
to be part of um so that were those were some of the

35
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:10,159
people that I'm thankful for I probably didn't remember all of them um and then also being thankful for

36
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:16,359
my health um both my physical health and my mental

37
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:22,240
health um I've mostly been pretty healthy and when I haven't I've had good

38
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,759
medical

39
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:36,160
care um and I think it's

40
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,800
important certainly for me but I think for everyone to do some

41
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:48,840
conscious reflection on who the who and what they're grateful for the mind has a

42
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:55,960
tendency towards it's sometimes said the mind has is like velcro for the negative and like

43
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:04,479
Teflon for the positive so for things like gratitude it may take some actual

44
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:11,199
um conscious effort to bring that forth to

45
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,360
um to keep that in your

46
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,280
awareness when I started thinking about what I was going to talk about tonight I

47
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:30,600
thought well I could I could cover that same ground I'm sure there's other people

48
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:36,440
that I'm haven't uh acknowledged or things that I haven't

49
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:41,560
acknowledged uh institutions i' I've worked now for

50
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:47,639
NASA now for over well I guess it's been like 42

51
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:57,199
years so my gratitude to NASA uh the universities I've been

52
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:02,560
in um so about a week ago I was laying in bed

53
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,840
doing um uh mindfulness meditation we call it

54
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:17,080
lying meditation which means that I'm in a prone position not that I'm lying to myself about whether I'm doing

55
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:23,720
meditation and I thought well I wonder what'll come up and actually I was laying there and I

56
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:29,840
was paying attention to my breath and I thought you know I don't know that I've

57
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:37,759
ever felt gratitude for the breath you know it's there all the time

58
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,479
it's there all the time it's one of the main things that supports this this body

59
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:51,280
being alive I've certainly been aware of it

60
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:58,400
um in Buddhism and in other in many other uh maybe Traditions or or

61
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,680
practices the breath is one of the central elements things that we pay

62
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,720
attention to it can be used for mindfulness

63
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:16,319
developing an ability to really pay attention to what's happening in the present

64
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:23,039
moment um it can be used for soothing the mind and the body you

65
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:28,960
know particularly long slow out breaths can bring some sense of relaxation and

66
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:35,240
ease it can energize the body that's one of the things that I do in the morning is

67
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:41,759
use the breath to start kind of waking up my mind and waking up my

68
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:49,199
body getting it ready to um uh launch out into the

69
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,479
day you can use the breath for uh

70
00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:00,800
concentration or for unification of the mind you know just just staying with the

71
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:08,879
breath continuously not going off to other uh phenomenon like you might in

72
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,960
mindfulness uh I know there's yogic practices of

73
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,120
using the breath for if I I don't I'm not an expert on this at all but I know

74
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,520
if that if you breathe in in one of the nostrils it tends to warm the body and

75
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:32,399
if you breathe in in the other nostril it tends to cool the body I don't understand all of that but people have

76
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,120
been using the breath for years for for

77
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,039
um cultivating states that are

78
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:52,080
helpful and yet I think there's something that I was missing out by looking at the breath simply as a tool

79
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,200
you know simply as this phenomenon

80
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,480
um it's not really a thing right I mean it's it's not like you can point at the

81
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:10,880
breath as something different than this body it's it's a process of the

82
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:20,720
body and so over the last week or so I've been you know reflecting on

83
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:30,160
how how can I treat the breath as something other than just a tool

84
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,200
something other than sort of like some impersonal

85
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,320
phenomenon

86
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,480
um yeah and so I've I've you know I I start reminding

87
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,959
myself the breath is what keeps me alive that's pretty important you know I

88
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:05,200
mean that's that's a prettyy important function

89
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:12,760
and although it's not the only way to bring gratitude to it it's like realizing that that may not always be

90
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:20,680
the case you know there's people that have respiratory issues where the breath is

91
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:27,000
difficult people that use um these CPAP machines to help them get enough air

92
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,800
when they sleep at night so that um so that the body can function

93
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:41,560
properly you know people who have had um either illnesses or damage to their

94
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:50,480
lungs um my uh ex-grand or my late ex-grand

95
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,600
father um used to work in a mining town and he

96
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:04,720
specifically made the decision not to work in the mine he was a a blacksmith

97
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,639
so he could repair equipment and he didn't make as much as he would have if he had gone into the mine but he also

98
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:16,240
knew that working in the mine you would get mineral dust in your lungs that

99
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:24,560
basically would lead to an early death so

100
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:33,000
um you know so being thankful for our

101
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,040
breath while it's still pretty easy and we actually most of the time just ignore

102
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:47,720
it um is one of the most accessible things that we can cultivate

103
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:55,399
this gratitude for the other

104
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,639
um so there's the process of breathing breathing and

105
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:09,079
then oh that's right and then yeah so excuse me for a

106
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:16,199
little uh discontinuity in my thoughts yeah so there's people that use

107
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:23,040
these cpat machines for for breathing um I know people that rely on

108
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:30,519
having machines that either enhance the amount of oxygen that they breathe or actually breathe pure oxygen

109
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:38,199
uh at the beginning of the pandemic you he heard a lot about um ventilators that people would use to help them machines

110
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:44,240
that would help them breathe and even in the the middle of

111
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:51,079
the 20th century there were these machines called iron lungs that people would be in that would help them breathe

112
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:56,560
that they couldn't breathe on their own so

113
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,600
um I think appreciating it and learning to enjoy it while you

114
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,760
can you know

115
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:14,120
uh and then in addition to thinking about the body breathing I think of what is it that we breathe you know the air

116
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:20,760
that we breathe here in the Bay Area our air quality is quite

117
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:27,040
good I just looked at a website called Purple air before I came here

118
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,399
and there's a little bit of particulate in the atmosphere right now from

119
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:39,600
probably from uh fireplaces this time of the year um but

120
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:47,519
mostly it's pretty good now of course if you were here in some Summers while the wire wildfires are going You' see well

121
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:54,560
yeah you know that the air quality really decreased there was a lot of particulates a lot of

122
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:00,519
so uh you're advised to wear in 95 D

123
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:08,279
masks uh and maybe stay indoors uh fortunately that here that

124
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:14,839
wasn't the case for very long for too many days but it did make

125
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:24,279
me appreciate more those days when the air is clear and safe to to

126
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:29,680
breathe I've also worked in parts of the world where that's definitely not the case

127
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:36,440
I've worked in South Korea I've worked in Houston you know I've

128
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:44,759
um worked in other places where uh air quality is is definitely an issue

129
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:52,680
so so I'm thankful for the air

130
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:01,839
um where my Reflections went from there is

131
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:08,800
in Ancient India at the time of the Buddha everything was thought of as

132
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:15,519
being made up of four elements there was the air element the water

133
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,160
element the Earth element and the fire

134
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:28,279
element so I started to think hm what about those other three so then

135
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:34,560
I start Ed to think about the water element now we don't as a physical

136
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,079
chemist we don't usually scientifically described the

137
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:46,000
world anymore with those four elements but I think they're worth looking at they're they're they they their

138
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,360
qualities of matter um but it gave me a framework to think

139
00:15:53,360 --> 00:16:00,959
about what I could be grateful for what I could be thankful for so in addition to a the breath and air said you know

140
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:07,920
water that's that's pretty prominent as a human being I looked it up on the web

141
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:14,199
today um the average human being is about 60%

142
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:20,199
water some for some people it's as low as 45 and some it's as high as 75 but

143
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:26,040
probably most of us are you know somewhere around 60%

144
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:32,560
water so we're intricately tied to the hydrological cycle you know intricately

145
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:39,440
tied to taking in water hopefully every day in sufficient

146
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:45,639
quantity to um to make the body work you know to Aid

147
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:50,720
digestion to get rid of um metabolic um

148
00:16:50,720 --> 00:17:00,160
waste materials um to keep our eyes clear clear of uh

149
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:09,760
dust and and other things um sweating to help keep our body at at

150
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:15,959
the right temperature and of course every breath

151
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:21,640
we take that we exhale there's water going out you know

152
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:28,919
we're continually breathing out water uh you you'd see that most

153
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:36,840
noticeably if you've ever lived in a uh cold environment you know where you

154
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:43,160
breathe out on a cold winter day and you can just see this big cloud of condensed

155
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:50,799
water so um so that's an important

156
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:57,400
um so we're a flowing processor this body is a flowing processor of

157
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
water

158
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:11,159
um so seeing that acknowledging it appreciating

159
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:21,039
it uh being grateful for it um are all

160
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,880
possible and just like air uh water is we we

161
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:33,799
it's here in the Peninsula we can just take it for granted right you turn on the tap and there's water that's not

162
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:38,919
true in a lot of parts of the world you know that

163
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:47,320
um fresh drinking water uh in some ways is a a gift it's a gift

164
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:53,039
to our to us from all of the people that work to to make that

165
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:05,120
possible you know over the last five years we've had like I think maybe three years in a row of drought and so that

166
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:12,520
you know that was kind of a time when I think people's awareness of water increased you know they started to say

167
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:18,240
oh yeah well yeah it's starting to get scarce

168
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:25,720
it's it's starting to get um we may not be able to do everything

169
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:31,240
that we're used to with water we may not be able to water our Lawns and wash our

170
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:38,320
cars maybe even wash our bodies as much as we're used to I know some

171
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,400
restaurants took it as far as not giving you water with your meal unless you

172
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:49,919
asked for it you know that was just a uh you know sort of a wakeup

173
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:56,080
call we had a wet winter last winter and I it's expected that we'll have a El

174
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:03,200
Nino winter so um it's amazing just as Waters become more

175
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:09,360
plentiful how that awareness of water is is kind

176
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,559
of um diminished for me you know it's like okay well now now

177
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:21,120
it's over now they we're back to there being plenty but um that may not always

178
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:27,600
be the case so I think now is the time to be

179
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:33,600
grateful now is the time to be aware now is the

180
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:39,200
time to be um

181
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:50,120
appreciative and then the next um it's all moving on from water uh the next

182
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:55,880
element is Earth the Earth element and

183
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:01,640
that's what supports us now you know the Earth is supporting

184
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:07,440
us it's also holding us here I mean one of the things

185
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,919
that's that we don't escape for a millisecond is the gravitational field

186
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:19,240
of the earth it's holding us in place it's holding all these chairs in place you

187
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:25,559
know we set things on tables and desks and everything else and just assume

188
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:34,360
they'll stay there but um the Earth supplies gravity so um again

189
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:39,640
gravity we take for granted we quite honestly if there was

190
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:46,200
no gravity there'd be no atmosphere all the air would just float

191
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,320
off into space so

192
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:58,600
um one of the aspects of the earth is it lets us know which way is up right the

193
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:05,919
gravitational field it also um feeds us right

194
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:11,919
plants use the minerals from the earth um to

195
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:19,360
grow um they hold it in place the W the Earth holds the

196
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:25,559
water if you're if you eat a plantbased diet you know the Earth supplies

197
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:32,039
everything directly if you're an omnivore or a carnivore you you know at least some of

198
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:38,760
the animals that you eat are fed by plants that grow on the

199
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:49,200
earth and then the the final Earth the the final element um that I'll talk

200
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:57,760
about tonight is um what's called the fire element and that might be I don't know

201
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:07,000
for it's right to say personified by but exemplified by the Sun that which produces light and

202
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:15,600
heat I know when I wake up in the morning I I look forward to sitting at my my work area because I have a

203
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:21,720
southern facing window and the sun coming in really does something for my

204
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,880
mood it certainly helps heat up the house

205
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,279
um you know the circadian rhythms of the

206
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:39,520
body get tied to the to that and almost all of the energy that

207
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:47,640
we use has is either currently or in the past has come from the Sun you know

208
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:53,960
either you know the solar energy that we might be using or wind energy that's

209
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:59,279
coming from the the sun driving the the winds or from fossil

210
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:07,080
fuels that took sunlight and stored them for millions of years

211
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,080
so

212
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:22,679
um so being grateful for the sun being grateful for

213
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,840
heat if you've ever been really cold and I grew up in Wisconsin and I've worked

214
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:36,399
in Alaska and uh Northern Sweden in the

215
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:42,960
winter I know what it's like to be cold and uh it's very easy to be

216
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:52,039
grateful for heat when you walk inside a building and uh feel

217
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:02,279
that so that's just

218
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:08,559
some a a brief uh listing of the reflections that

219
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:16,120
I had on those four elements and uh being grateful for

220
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:21,559
them when I think about well so I'm not a historian and

221
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:28,000
I'm not a mythologist but I have read history and mythology that cultures

222
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,760
current and past have

223
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:39,279
recognized the importance of these things of of air of

224
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:44,679
water of the earth and of the

225
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:55,720
Sun and have had a sense of reverence for them you know

226
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:01,399
reverence reverence for the air re reverence for the the water reverence

227
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:06,320
for the Earth reverence for the

228
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:13,720
sun um you know recognizing that our lives

229
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:22,080
depend on all of those those four things you know that's we may not want

230
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:30,679
to think about it we we may think that our water comes out of the

231
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:38,240
tap uh you know our food comes from Whole Foods or Safeway uh you know our

232
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:44,320
heat comes from pg& and all of those are partly true

233
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,520
right but

234
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:58,159
um but I think it's also there's there's some level of of um

235
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:05,919
seeing clearly or honestly if we really see how tied we are to those four

236
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:11,320
elements how they're they're integral to us being alive and that we're not

237
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,799
separate from them

238
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:22,360
um in some ways breathing is a communal

239
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:28,600
activity you know I'm breathing the same air as you are and As You Are

240
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:34,120
and as you are um there isn't some

241
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:40,960
boundaries that it's something that we share with each other and so having

242
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:48,240
[Music] some you know having some reverence for

243
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:54,159
the air and the water and the Earth and treating them

244
00:27:54,159 --> 00:28:04,440
well so that we can continue living um the kind of lives we're living

245
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:20,360
now I wouldn't I I'm I'm not suggesting that we worship those as though there

246
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:26,440
are some uh deity but having reverence for them having

247
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:32,880
respect for them

248
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:39,480
um doing what we can

249
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:47,279
to to um support them you know what how can we

250
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:54,720
change what we're doing to um it leads to better quality air better

251
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:01,120
quality water better quality

252
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,919
soil Earth and this is a little bit more

253
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:12,679
far-fetched but what do we do

254
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:20,360
to um altering the sunlight that comes and

255
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:26,640
hits the Earth you know we we've actually now reached the point where

256
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:32,200
human activity can affect how much of the Sun how much of the energy of the sun

257
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:39,640
gets um trapped in the radiative balance of the earth so how do we recognize that

258
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:47,440
and and um work with it in a way that will be beneficial for

259
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:58,760
all so those are some of my thoughts about uh thank Thanksgiving this year of

260
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:05,919
you know thanking thanking the natural world um not that just supports us but

261
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:13,880
that we are part of you know that we are not separate from the natural world and

262
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:20,039
how do we respect it and um care for

263
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:28,559
it so I leave you with those questions to reflect on thank you

264
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:35,799
and if there's any questions or comments um Martha has a

265
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:50,200
microphone it's more more of a comment is that on

266
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:57,279
yeah um that when you were talking about air water fire and the earth I thought

267
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:02,600
thought of what you brought up later which is that feeling of connection that

268
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:09,799
there's something and also the other thing you know people you were thankful for that I

269
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:18,440
I thought of feeling connected to everyone and and the elements and what a

270
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:26,720
um what a warm feeling that is and and respect for for all those

271
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,919
things also being a warm feeling so that's all oh

272
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:38,279
thank you thank you yeah they they they all do connect

273
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:43,760
us right breathing you know the water the

274
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:50,480
Earth Sun thank

275
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:58,840
you I'm grateful for for emotions Joy and sorrow the the whole

276
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:05,279
gamut of human emotions yeah thank you your talk is

277
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,480
wonderful thank

278
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:24,399
you okay well um if there's no other questions uh thank you for coming

279
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:30,120
tonight uh I'll stay up here afterwards if you want to talk

280
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:38,120
individually and uh and I and I hope
