1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:08,160
so good morning everyone and welcome can you hear me

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:15,679
okay so last week I talked about mindfulness of speaking and so to follow

3
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:24,240
up this week I'd like to talk about mindfulness of listening and uh listening is such a has such so

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,760
much overlap with mindfulness that um sometimes I think

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,640
that if you can't be mindful

6
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:42,360
listen and and or if you can't meditate if you can't learn to meditate learn to

7
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,399
listen there's a little story that I made up the once of this person who

8
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:55,440
lived next to the who was visiting ing from another country for a year and was living next to the monastery and she

9
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,239
started going visiting regularly and was taught to some introduction to meditation and did some meditation and

10
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:09,360
really was taken by this but then her family was going to move back to her home country uh where there was no

11
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,640
Buddhism and no meditation so uh she went to the abbs of

12
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,439
the monastery and said what do I do when I get home who is going to teach me to

13
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:25,520
meditate and the AB said um ask around

14
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,640
for the person who's the best listener and then ask them to teach you

15
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,920
how to listen so to listen well as a as a form

16
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,600
of mindfulness or substitute for mindfulness but ideally you do both

17
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,000
learn to be mindful and learn to listen learn to be mindful as you're

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,399
listening learn to listen as you're mindful the

19
00:01:53,399 --> 00:02:02,079
um um there's tremendous value in listening

20
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:07,080
some people it's been said that some people have trouble listening because it involves a lack of

21
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:13,200
control and I suppose it does you don't control the people around you if you just listen

22
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:20,879
um but uh uh we certainly can uh acquire a lot of control of ourselves mastery of

23
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:27,200
our ourselves if we learn to listen so I have two quotes two quotes

24
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,680
here about listening and um uh I think they're kind of wonderful

25
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:44,000
one's a poem and once both of them are poems and um and uh the idea of the

26
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,959
person is um one has a person being really small

27
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:57,400
and one has a person being really big so I include both for

28
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:03,440
equal equal opportunity equal representation in case some of you don't

29
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,560
like the idea of being small and some of you don't like the idea of being big

30
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:16,720
we'll start with the big this is uh from Walt Wittman very important American poet

31
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:24,080
this was his uh song is he's called the poem called Song of the Open Road

32
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,280
so it begins kind of with exclamation from this hour

33
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:38,879
freedom from this hour I ordain myself freed of limits and imaginary

34
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
lines listening to others and considering well what they

35
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,640
say pausing searching receiving contemplating

36
00:03:53,640 --> 00:04:01,599
gently but with an undeniable will devesting myself of the holds that

37
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:07,400
would hold me devesting of the clinging that would cling to

38
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:13,680
me i think it's a powerful step for me for listening listening to others and

39
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:21,000
considering well what they say pausing

40
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,919
searching receiving contemplating gently but with undeniable will

41
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:38,080
devesting myself of the holds that would hold me i think it's a great Buddhist uh

42
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:46,160
little paragraph there or lines of a poem but it's together with this idea of freedom freedom uh celebrated like

43
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,720
that's the beginning could be very self-centered uh especially in individualistic culture

44
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,960
that America has often been um it could even be more so expression of our

45
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:04,479
individuality sees the day for oneself but immediately it's it's there's some

46
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:11,680
lines in between I didn't include but um then in this poem includes just a deep sense of

47
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:20,600
listening So after this listening to others he writes I inhale droughts of

48
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:27,680
space the east and the west are mine and the north and south are mine i

49
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:36,280
am larger better than I thought i didn't know I held so much

50
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:45,000
goodness all seems beautiful to me today imagine if

51
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,639
listening in that spirit listening that you're better and

52
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,520
bigger and have more goodness in in you than you know so this is the one about being

53
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:03,680
big listen and here's the one about being small and this is by uh the po

54
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:11,160
poet May Sorton it's titled "Can I Weave a nest of

55
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:17,000
silence." Isn't that evocative can I Weave a nest of

56
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,319
silence it refers to a small bird named the Phoebe

57
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:28,479
the Phoebe sits on her nest hour after hour

58
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:36,400
day after day waiting for life to burst out from under

59
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,560
her warmth can I weave a nest of

60
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:47,919
silence weave it of listening listening listening

61
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:54,440
layer upon layer but one must first become

62
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:01,479
small nothing but a presence attentive as a nesting

63
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:09,280
bird pro-offering no slightest wish toward anything that might happen or be

64
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,599
given only the warm faithful

65
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:19,880
waiting contained in so contained in one's

66
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:29,520
smallalness beyond the question the silence beyond the answer the silence I

67
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:37,960
thought this was a great poem to represent meditation sitting you know sitting and um the Buddha did

68
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:43,479
liken doing Buddhist practice like an egg sitting on its

69
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:49,919
eggs and incubating them he uses language of uh that not his his word

70
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:55,919
it's a modern word but gestation that having something be working and growing

71
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:02,000
developing and being born from within as we do this practice so I thought in that

72
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,360
spirit this poem about uh the the bird sitting on its nest with its warmth

73
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:14,240
justestating something letting something develop the eggs develop until something gets born and now May Sartin wants to do

74
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:20,360
the same through her listening can we is does a listening

75
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,840
well does it give birth to something new does listening a well justestate

76
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:32,399
something allow something else to happen in you and in the person you

77
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:39,039
listen to there people whose job is to listen to

78
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:45,680
people's stories and um uh uh they are sometimes

79
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:54,720
referred to as midwives that they are um they uh hear things into birth in their

80
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:02,480
listening things come alive and are born in people in your listening to yourself can

81
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,920
you listen to yourself to sit quietly and it would be different if you use the

82
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,839
metaphor of listening for mindfulness than if you use the metaphor of seeing

83
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:19,920
for mindfulness for some people seeing is much more active and in fact I know some

84
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:26,480
people who actually engage their eyes when their eyes are closed in meditation you know they're trying to look and

85
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:34,000
stare at their breath they're trying hard um it's a little bit harder to do that with listening listening has to

86
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,760
almost be a letting go of effort to listen well there can be an act of choice to listen but uh there's a kind

87
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,440
of giving up control or giving up it's almost like you have to let go of effort

88
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,920
to listen really well your listening can be directional but still it's not you

89
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:00,080
have to kind of allow it to come there's less interference and that's part of the

90
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:07,440
power of mindfulness when there's no interference and we can just feel without any attachment know without any

91
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:15,519
attachment just there and to not be in a hurry to wait

92
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:21,399
uh to uh be small to build a

93
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:26,959
nest and I like this very much that uh that part of meditation especially in

94
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:32,079
the early years of being a meditator um we're kind of beginning to kind of

95
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:39,279
create something wonderful inside a nest a a tenderness a softness a presence a

96
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:45,680
capacity to be present and here where the body begins to soften and relax

97
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:53,120
there's a yogic body that comes into play that slowly gets formed by meditating day by day by day and the

98
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:59,440
body itself shifts and changes the heart shifts and changes the mind shifts and

99
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:06,240
changes when less and less uh preoccupation the mind doesn't wander off so much in thought is something

100
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:13,920
begins shifting and changing when we're not so uh uh writing our concerns our preoccupations really tightly you know

101
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:20,160
really want something or don't want something or reacting liking and not liking drifting off in distractions not

102
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:27,120
drifting off in distractions racing off in distractions and uh and so the uh with

103
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,560
the idea that we're building a nest as opposed to doing it to have an

104
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:39,519
attainment i'm going to get this i'm going to be a really good meditator i'm going to get the attainments of Buddhism

105
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:45,040
full enlightenment i'm going to get the Janna i'm going to get this i'm going to get that

106
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:53,839
but what if what we're doing is building a cocoon building a nest building a womb

107
00:11:53,839 --> 00:12:00,880
gestating something that's a little bit more the Buddha's understanding of what we're doing in meditation the Buddha did

108
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,000
not present Buddhist practice as something we engineer something we

109
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,360
construct something we build um he presented Buddhist practice all through

110
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:17,440
language and metaphors that uh were creating the conditions for something to

111
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:23,079
be born something to arise something to grow and um and

112
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:28,320
so creating creating the conditions for something to grow can be represented by

113
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:34,480
this metaphor of the nest it can be represented by um you know being so

114
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:41,320
still and quiet and warm incubate it bring warmth tenderness to all that you

115
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,600
are there's a um wonderful story from the

116
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:55,000
Ramayana that I sometimes I've quoted a lot um the Rama is in the forest with uh

117
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:03,040
companions and um Rama hears a very faint voice in the forest and he asks

118
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:09,200
his companions do you hear the voice and uh they say no but he hears the voice so

119
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:16,560
he kind of tries to figure out where it's coming from starts moving in that direction and then very faintly he hears

120
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:22,279
the voice is calling his name Rama

121
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:28,560
rama and he asks companions do you hear the voice no we don't hear it so he goes

122
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:36,399
closer and closer and as it gets closer it's a little bit louder and louder but still very quiet and finally he comes to

123
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:43,600
the source of it and the source is a very big boulder and uh coming out of the boulder

124
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:50,000
is this voice Rama Rama kind of inviting him perhaps to

125
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,240
come closer so Ramba takes and puts his two hands on the boulder and immediately

126
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:02,839
the boulder um transforms itself into a beautiful

127
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:08,880
woman who long ago had been um uh uh

128
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,240
someone had cast a spell on her and turned her into a solid boulder but

129
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,680
someone like Rama had to come to dissolve her and so she wouldn't be so

130
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:25,199
petrified and uh and so what I how I interpret

131
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:30,240
this wonderful story was Rama listened only he could hear what is it only you

132
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,639
can hear what's calling you what's calling you

133
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:41,959
inside what is it that's solid or petrified in you that's waiting to be

134
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:49,120
touched waiting to be somehow held recognized and so to sit in mindfulness

135
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,560
as a listener to yourself what is it that what is it that's speaking deep

136
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:00,399
inside that doesn't have words doesn't have a voice but this idea of listening

137
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,839
deeply deeply it's a little bit different than looking some people if

138
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,880
they're looking for their depth looking for the answer inside um people are

139
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:17,600
really active searching searching around looking around all the different places where can I find it there must be some

140
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,880
place here under behind the navl you know and in the back of the

141
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,480
heart you know no it has to be in the base of the brain where is it

142
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:38,399
um but you can't do that if you're listening listening you have to just be quiet quiet still listen feel sense in

143
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:45,680
some deeper and deeper way so what is it that calls you and um

144
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,920
and uh and I love the language of being called because that's been so much kind

145
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,199
of how I've been operated in my adult life um called to meditation called to

146
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:03,680
practice meditation uh and with the things that began happening to me when I meditated was

147
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:11,040
basically say come here this is good this is the right place to be this is where peace is this is where harmony is

148
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,320
this is where the the wholeness your wholeness resides come here and let this

149
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,360
wholeness grow and so I then went from meditating

150
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:28,320
every day to going living near a Buddhist center to becoming a resident of a center to going to live in a

151
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:35,120
monastery uh all all of because I felt this inner call to become go into this deeper and

152
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:42,880
deeper listening to what was calling me and eventually there was a call to be of service the call to be a teacher or

153
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:50,480
to somehow support people in the suffering of the world in Buddhism in Mahayana Buddhism they have this um

154
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:58,360
great bodhicattva great celestial kind of being called

155
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:14,959
suffering of the world uh sometimes it's called the one who see Yeah who hears who uh who hears

156
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:22,319
the suffering of the world so this metaphor of hearing uh is there and and of this wonderful

157
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:27,918
there's statues of of uh of a loadhara and we have actually one that's in the

158
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:34,000
museum in Kansas City we have a big photograph they have a beautiful one there it's up on the top of the steps

159
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:41,280
above if if you're brave and sign a liability form we take all full of

160
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,320
risks you can go you can go up the spiral staircase and uh and see this

161
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:53,440
that the wonderful photograph of that Kansas CityWin and it's in the pose of in the

162
00:17:53,440 --> 00:18:00,720
pose of repose uh it's sitting in a very relaxed posture the one who hears the cries of

163
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:08,080
the world who um is relaxed at ease who listens well

164
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:13,840
and maybe we can only listen well if we're relaxed and at ease and to the

165
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:20,880
suffering of the world is it okay to be relaxed at ease listening to the suffering of the world some people say

166
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:27,440
absolutely not you have to be distressed you have to be angry you have

167
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,880
to be distraught you have to be you know show that you really care by being all

168
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,559
worked up that is not creating the nest that's

169
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:44,480
not creating the the place of some deeper wellspring of growing and

170
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:51,039
maturing and responding to the world actually it mitigates it if we're if we

171
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:56,240
are caught in distress in anger distraught over the conditions of

172
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:02,080
the world which is easy to do it's actually maybe in a certain way very

173
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,440
logical to do that and but and then we

174
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:14,080
are um held by what would hold you

175
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:21,840
which to paraphrase Walt Wittmann but he said devesting himself of the holes that

176
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:30,080
would hold me and um so how to listen well so

177
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:37,120
there's also a story in China ofwan yin there where someone asks a Zen master

178
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:43,520
um what's it like to be Quan Yin what's it like to listen to the sounds the the

179
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:51,039
the suffering of the world and the Zen master says "It's like adjusting your pillow in

180
00:19:51,039 --> 00:20:01,080
the middle of the night." Isn't that weird but the idea is that um uh we're

181
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:06,400
uh the I think the assumption is that the metaphor means that you're you're

182
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:12,640
kind of half asleep and you adjust the pillow unself-consciously

183
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:19,360
you feel something needs to be adjusted and that simple relaxed unself-conscious adjusting of the pillow that's what it's

184
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,559
like to be compassionate there's a need but there's no distress there's

185
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:30,679
something but and responding to that need the

186
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:39,840
um um so um how do we listen well to others

187
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:46,799
one way is to try to listen without the filters of our own judgments our stories

188
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:54,400
our interpretations of what's going on and that's one of the values of mindfulness the more mindful you become

189
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:00,000
the more you're also tracking yourself you're tracking uh whether you're

190
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:07,440
actually responding to them in your mind and stop listening to their what they're saying and I don't know if I'm just

191
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,480
weird but I've known myself to do that that uh what what did the person

192
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:20,080
just say i I'm just impairing my my my answer and um and that's not healthy so

193
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:25,679
the idea to recognize that's happening to no listen stay listening stay present

194
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:33,679
hear the person out and um and to to be able to track yourself and know how

195
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:39,360
we're kind of and sometimes occasionally I felt this tremendous power this urge

196
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:45,360
to speak like it had you know it was like hard to keep my mouth shut

197
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:51,520
sometimes interrupting other people because of that power that's there mindfulness is supposed to protect

198
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:57,600
us from that unless the situation requires action but to track oursel to

199
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:05,120
see what's going on but listen mindfulness also provides us with a lot of wisdom a lot of understanding if we

200
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,720
can track ourselves as we listen we can understand the reactions we have to what

201
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:17,039
we hear we can understand the beliefs that are operating or the thoughts that come up the judgments that come up we

202
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:22,240
can feel recognize the emotions that are coming up and uh the tensions that are

203
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:28,120
coming up or the softness that comes up we can kind of track what's happening inside of

204
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:35,360
us um that doesn't make us a worse listener it can actually make us a better listener so all those things

205
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:42,480
don't interfere uh so we can listen better to the other uh and also if we listen to

206
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:50,960
ourselves while we're listening to others um it turns out part of who we are is in this wonderful natural world

207
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:58,240
we're not a singular independent thing who we are is partly co-created all the

208
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:06,240
time in the world and so if we're tracking that and being present for it in ourselves we're actually in this

209
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:12,440
we're watching and seeing the co-creation that happens if we only paid attention

210
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:19,760
ourselves which some people are capable of doing and uh uh then we don't hear the

211
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:26,039
other person but if we only hear the other person then we don't hear

212
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:32,440
ourselves and some people feel we're obligated to listen to someone 100% we're supposed to be a good

213
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:38,000
listener turns out we can't be a good listener if it's 100% with the other person

214
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:46,480
and so what I like to the idea is that the mindfulness helps us to have the attention 5050 50% here with oneself and

215
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:53,760
50% with someone else and so I want to offer the alternative to these two poems

216
00:23:53,760 --> 00:24:00,080
one poem is about becoming large and the other about becoming small for me the

217
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,720
wonderful delightful alternative is to disappear

218
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:12,679
that's there's a third option and so when the attention is really

219
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:18,720
present 50% to the person 50% to what's all in here

220
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,279
um then the imag as Walt Whitman says the imaginary

221
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:31,480
lines disappear the imaginary boundaries between self and other kind of

222
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:39,440
disappear and so this usual understandings and sense of self disappear that often interfere with

223
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,039
listening well and it's just such a pleasure to disappear this way and are

224
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:53,520
you going to be unsafe in the world if those kinds of imaginary lines that separation in you as person uh is no

225
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,880
longer there how are you going to take care of yourself i suggest you actually can take care of

226
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,960
yourself better because you're tracking your feelings your thoughts the

227
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,480
impact the concerns the beliefs you really see what's going on what's here

228
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:18,559
you get all the right information that you need you just you haven't just you just don't package it into an identity

229
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:24,320
that this is who I am i'm supposed to be this way um and so you're able to then

230
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:30,880
in the conversation to respond appropriately and take care of yourself um because you have all the information

231
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:36,320
from the other and listening to the other person you hear them well so it's not a dangerous thing what I'm

232
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:42,159
suggesting but it's a great relief isn't that nice i mean it's kind of a drag to

233
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:48,520
be small and it's kind of a drag to be big

234
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,960
but it's not a drag to disappear then there's no resistance

235
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:02,840
anywhere so to listen well and then one way to listen well to

236
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:08,720
others is to uh uh let them know that you hear them

237
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:14,080
uh uh active listening often means that we we kind of in a very simple way not

238
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:20,480
you don't go you don't repeat everything they say but even with one or two words uh demonstrate that you've heard what

239
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:29,360
they said and uh even simply as saying um yeah um like you know oh Gil you were

240
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:36,039
talking about listening today well then I know you heard you

241
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:43,200
you and uh and something different can happen and uh so it could be very simple

242
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:49,679
but help people understand know that you listened more powerfully help people

243
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:57,360
know that you understood them people have a tremendous need to be understood i would venture guess that

244
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:03,840
you have a tremendous need to be understood if you have a need one of the wonderful

245
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:12,159
I think maybe pops psychology principles that I like is if you have a need offer

246
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:21,039
it to others give it so if you have a need to be understood understand others

247
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:28,320
it's it's the alchemy of that is very fascinating the what you know if that's included in the nest of something that's

248
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:34,000
growing it's really fascinating what can happen but you know just simply it might

249
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,120
be that people feel like wow the person's really interested in me maybe I

250
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,240
should ask them how they are and so then then they initiate it

251
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:51,200
but if you say to them you never you you never listened to me you never shown interest in me and you then they get

252
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,440
defensive and then they're not going to listen but you kind of do this iikido

253
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:03,640
move you know you know understand them and

254
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:10,279
um so as a way of finishing these words I'd like to uh

255
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:15,519
reread this one's one part of Walt Whitman's

256
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:23,399
poem listening to others and considering well what they

257
00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:31,559
say pausing searching receiving contemplating

258
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:39,279
gently but with undeniable will devesting myself of the holds that

259
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:46,720
would hold me so may it be that listening is one of the ways that you're

260
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,760
able to start letting go of some of your attachments and clinging that listening

261
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:57,919
is an antidote to holding on tight that you begin letting go just

262
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:04,919
like meditation is meant to be an antidote to holding on tight helping you to let go so if you can't

263
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:10,120
meditate now you know what to do practice listening

264
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:17,320
instead and listening you can practice all day long when you're with people or with yourself listen to yourself

265
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:24,039
well so those are my thoughts and uh with this fresh on your

266
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:32,399
mind and uh maybe inspired by it or want to want to try it quickly how about if

267
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:37,840
you turn to one or two people next to you and say something about what arose

268
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:45,559
for you in listening to this talk what inspired you what was interesting to you what what protests you have what you

269
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:51,520
didn't what you didn't like about it and um but but give the other people one or

270
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:57,960
two people with you um a chance to practice listening to you but as you

271
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:03,440
speak be sure that you're listening to yourself as you speak and don't speak

272
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:10,960
for very long make it really brief because mostly this is a listening exercise so you want to just get over

273
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:17,919
your talking so you can get be doing the listening part and as you listen to them listen to

274
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:24,480
yourself that 50/50 so have a you know friendly conversation and those of you who don't want to be part of this you

275
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:30,640
certainly welcome to go have tea you're welcome also to sit quietly in here and then we'll take five minutes or so just

276
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:36,080
to kind of come back and have a few more words so um just make sure no one's

277
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:43,960
sitting alone uh look around you and then uh I'll ring a bell when it's time to stop

278
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:53,919
so what did you learn about yourself as a listener in that exercise anything

279
00:30:53,919 --> 00:31:00,240
were you listening anybody want to offer something

280
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:08,679
i do but that's Yeah but people online need it

281
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:17,520
a lot of work for somebody i've found out that I'm not nearly as good of it as I think I am

282
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,960
that's it that That's progress

283
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:42,840
i also found out I'm not as good as I thought and I like to give advice

284
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:52,370
so what in recognizing that was that also progress definitely good definitely

285
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:56,610
[Laughter]

286
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:16,559
well I'll just I'm just a quick one i find for myself if I'm excited all my

287
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:21,919
energy goes out i mean any kind of strong emotion if I'm angry it's like

288
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:29,000
the idea of bringing it back to myself is challenging

289
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:36,799
it's funny that you spoke before me because I was kind of going to say something similar just that the

290
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:43,279
eagerness to speak can be distracting and it's nice being able to witness it

291
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:50,880
and let it go so that we can drop in with one another in a more still and tender way that was very nice to hear

292
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,960
that you see that see it that way thank you

293
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:04,080
there's There's a next Oh go ahead

294
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:09,440
no a quick comment i just find that I get so interested in hearing more and

295
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:15,000
learning about the person that sometimes I ask too many questions

296
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:24,840
now I finally understand what tune in and drop out means

297
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:51,200
um I have just one little story to share which is I think one well it's one of my

298
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:58,320
favorite things about becoming a meditator i've not I've only been meditating about seven or eight years I

299
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,720
want to say but when I was an absolute beginner um

300
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:09,520
I immediately fell in love with loving kindness and found it to be a very

301
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:14,560
lovely thing to carry around during the day and I was very mindful of that in

302
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:21,839
the beginning that was the one piece I I could carry and all of a sudden at work

303
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:28,919
at least once a day someone would stop when we were done discussing and say "You're such a good

304
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:34,079
listener." And I've never had that happen prior in my life and I was very

305
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:40,240
good at it then because I was so mindful of this new thing it doesn't happen

306
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:47,000
nearly as often now i don't know if I just went on to more complicated

307
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,560
meditation concepts that I'm trying to master but it was the most delightful

308
00:34:53,560 --> 00:35:00,560
gift from my practice pro it might be my favorite thing and it really is a shame it doesn't happen very often I have to

309
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:08,760
confess but um it was a gift well you know it's invaluable to always be a

310
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:14,400
beginner another thought

311
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,800
not not the tune in dropout kind but um I was thinking it's

312
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:26,000
easy to really tune into listening when I'm speaking with strangers not the

313
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,520
people that I know in life ah that's fascinating

314
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:37,839
there's so much history and complications and all kinds of things with people we know maybe it's but they

315
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:44,320
might be the most important p people to listen to well thank you all very much i hope

316
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,760
this was nice for you and uh this topic of listening is really central to a

317
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:55,079
mindful life and may you mindfully listen and listen

318
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:59,560
mindfully so thank you
