together I feel happier and more grateful through this practice

156
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:35,159
together so what we did just a quick um recap we started

157
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:42,000
with settling in the body with the breath first relaxing the body relaxing

158
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,480
starting from the head going down relaxing relaxing Landing in the body so

159
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,880
we can become embodied and then we connect it with the breath

160
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:59,880
receiving the breath in the abdomen I invited you to uh

161
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:05,700
to receive the next three breaths so that was a pretty low level of

162
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:10,740
commitment just stay with three person then you would refresh your commitment

163
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:16,800
when you got to the end of the three breaths and then after a while there could be a tendency to pull

164
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:23,158
forward and not be with one breath but just kind of pull to the second and the third to the end of the race so we

165
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:30,060
pulled back just two breaths and then we pulled back even more after we had the scaffolding of the three breaths we

166
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:37,138
pulled back to just one breath just this one just and then just this in breath just this out breath

167
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:43,320
and then as we stayed with the breath for a while we connected the breath breathing in

168
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:51,000
what we're grateful for right here right now in the immediacy of our experience just like our breath the immediacy of

169
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:59,400
the experience cushion we're sitting on the warmth of where we are the roof of

170
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:04,740
our heads maybe the meal we have eaten that's giving us energy

171
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:11,520
I invited you to explore for yourself brightening your heart and mind which is skillful it's wholesome

172
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:17,940
do this with with the blessings in your life because we usually turn to see what

173
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:23,579
where the problems are we don't turn to what's good and then when we turn to what's good it's like oh my goodness I

174
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:29,540
am so blessed yes there are problems yes of course there's sorrow suffering but

175
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:36,900
yes so many blessings and ah and at the end we turned to to the

176
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:42,060
blessing of the triple Jewel the Sangha the community of

177
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:47,520
practitioners how lovely that we're practicing with other beings right now

178
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:52,859
other human beings on this path with us and then we turned to

179
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:58,500
the Dharma the the teachings the having met the teachings how awesome is that

180
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:03,720
wow through technology here we go on Zoom who would have thought on YouTube

181
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:09,540
and then turning to Buddha within the possibility of our Awakening yes we can

182
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:15,599
of course we can otherwise they Woulda wouldn't have taught it and and we know

183
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:21,660
we can we know there is goodness within this being trust there's goodness here of course

184
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:29,220
and that's that serves as as a source of Joy Delight so that was the Arc of our

185
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:36,500
practice so now I'd like to invite you all if you have Reflections questions

186

206
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:50,820
I want to share with you actually so um this is a poem uh this is a haiku

207
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:58,140
actually that someone wrote recently on a retreat I was teaching I taught a mindfulness of mortality

208
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:06,599
Retreat a couple weeks ago at at Spirit Rock on land and and the retreatings

209
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:13,320
were invited to to um towards the end to write haikus to

210
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:19,380
um capture some of their wit insights and so here's this one that that I've

211
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:26,099
that I saved [Music] um and they say I've now understood that

212
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:33,420
it's already all right everything ever

213
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:40,859
isn't that it's I've I've now understood that it's already all right

214
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:45,960
everything ever and that is an Insight that is an

215
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:51,599
understanding sorry to you all right everything ever even when things go wrong it's already

216
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:57,660
alright everything ever so I offer that to you Christine that that uh for your

217
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:07,140
travels yeah thank you any other Reflections comments

218
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,980
ah

219
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:20,160
as I wait for your Reflections either in chat if you want to share them or raising your hand

220
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:27,780
I'll share reflection with you that before starting to teach I was feeling fatigued I had an intense day of trying

221
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:35,760
to finish something accomplished something and and uh and I feel less tired now there is a

222
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:42,000
refresh I feel more refreshed not just in my mind but in my body which is very

223
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,859
interesting right the the the uh relationship between the mind and body

224
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:05,160
so Sarah

225
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:12,060
please hi everybody uh thank you so much Nikki

226
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:19,920
that was just such a beautiful meditation yeah you have such a soothing voice thanks

227
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:28,260
I just I wanted to um just reflect back on the the um so often

228
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:34,980
when when we're in pain um how it can become overwhelming it you

229
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:40,380
can become the theme of our days and our sleep and everything that revolves

230
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:46,800
around alleviating finding comfortable positions and uh and I have some knee

231
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,900
pain that I've been struggling with recently and and uh and so I always have

232
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:57,540
to get creative with my meditation posture and it and it's

233
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:03,660
interesting because um as you brought that up during the meditation I just reflected on the fact

234
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:11,880
that I I can be with it I can't be with it it doesn't have to pull me into

235
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:20,420
you know the sensations but that I can be an experience a multitude of things

236
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:27,780
along with paint and pain being present and still not let it detract from this

237
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:34,740
experience yeah so that was really helpful to me yeah thank you Sarah beautifully eloquently spoken exactly

238
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:42,240
and when there is discomfort especially in the body and the heart too they're similar on our Focus becomes Narrows and

239
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:49,140
that's all we see is like oh yeah it's a microscope and that's all we see takes over and yet can realize just as you

240
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:54,420
said yes I contain multitudes absolutely I contain multitudes yeah the pink and

241
00:42:54,420 --> 00:43:02,339
beer doesn't have to take Central stage and the answer can be joy and gratitude and gladness and the pain too yes pain

242
00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:07,560
welcome join the party right there's just so much here yeah that's that's

243
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:15,720
lovely and one thing to say uh as you were saying you have um knee pain and to be creative with your posture uh if I'm

244
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:23,160
sure you already know this but just just to say that you know that it's okay to say it on a chair to stand to lie down

245
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:28,920
whatever has come you don't have to sit cross-legged or any particular posture

246
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:36,119
you know that already right yes thank you yeah of course we have complete permissions there's so many postures the

247
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:41,940
Buddha has taught so this is lovely in fact um thanks Sarah and I'll share this with

248
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:47,640
with everyone um I was in in Thailand a um a couple

249
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:54,420
months ago already gosh time flies and there were many um statues of the Buddha of course there

250
00:43:54,420 --> 00:44:00,720
are statues that the Buddha sitting in the sitting posture and and and lying down and standing there all these

251
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:05,880
postures and there's also uh I saw um uh

252
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:11,040

253
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:16,740
pretty cool and pretty pretty cool to see so yes and it is said that the next

254
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:23,700
Buddha is going to be sitting on a chair or something put off the next age anyway just giving permission for for physical

00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:45,079
and round in a spiral is what are you grateful for and it's such a joyous

258
