1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:10,599
okay hi folks welcome um yeah lovely to uh to see see

2
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:15,719
your uh names and uh be with

3
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:24,480
you so um we'll do the usual thing I'll say a few words and uh sit and then offer a

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,439
DED and uh I think last time last time the inaugural group last time my

5
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:38,440
meditation instructions were something like uh attention attention is just an

6
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:44,879
appendage of our wanting there's stress in trying to find

7
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:53,039
but relief in being found it's like what does that even mean

8
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,920
you know really those are the opening meditation

9
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,478
instructions but um sometimes we get more vague and

10
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:11,960
impressionistic sometimes more concrete this week tacking back towards the

11
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:20,680
concrete and so um intention intention

12
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:27,479
intention to put down greed and distress with respect to the world you know in a

13
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:33,560
way it's like um we sort of have to have equinity before

14
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:39,640
we've even developed it right but that's that's uh the instruction we put down as

15
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:45,520
best we can greed and distress with respect to the world that's the that's the

16
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:53,000
intention and that means we're we're just actively

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,920
relinquishing the intention to solve our problems right the way in which

18
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,039
meditation becomes the workpace for our kind of problem

19
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:12,840
solving uh we relax that energy and we offer up our kind of heart

20
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:20,239
to the moment trusting that the moment will do good things to

21
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:26,120
it so intention and then attention

22
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:34,319
attention we set the the kind of the anchor for

23
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:42,440
the attention the the we set the anchor for the attention you typically and we set a kind of aperture

24
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:48,959
aperture right um where the attention is and how the aperture how wide the kind

25
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:56,159
of Spotlight of attention is it's not totally right but generally

26
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:01,519
The Wider the aperture the more more concentration is

27
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:09,080
required in order to stay out of auditory thinking the narrower the aperture it's

28
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:16,400
it's not easier it's not a lot easier but it's a little easier uh to there's a little lower

29
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:24,440
level of concentration needed to to stay out of uh auditory thinking so there's

30
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:31,319
there's where we place the attention the aperture okay just at the tip of the you know it's breathing but it's not

31
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:36,640
breathing here it's breathing right here narrow aperture for

32
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,840
example and then we're nurturing a certain kind of vividness

33
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:50,480
vividness and uh yeah that means like a very um yeah well we know the difference

34
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:59,159
between dull and Vivid right Vivid this is a a kind of uh experience of our of

35
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:06,920
sensor sense the sensory World in vividness and we're stabilizing the

36
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:13,239
attention we're stabilizing the attention uh so that the you know the

37
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:19,959
telescope is not shaking as much right we we don't choose to do that but but

38
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:27,400
we're this is um we're cultivating this kind of stability of the

39
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:35,479
attention and then the fourth piece um is is effort effort the kind of

40
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:43,639
subjective impression that we have about our current attentional state how easy it or

41
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:48,680
difficult is it to sustain right we have to modulate that

42
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:54,120
often the effort right it's like I said vividness I said stability right but

43
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:00,160
that doesn't mean the effort gets out of control right we modulate the effort too

44
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:07,440
not too tight not too loose what kind of effort is actually entailed in this practice what what

45
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:15,840
actually supports you and uh we were're that's a kind of not

46
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,440
constant but often often we're modulating that

47
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,520
right and how do we uh make a kind of

48
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:33,319
effort that feels sustainable right that generally we kind of we don't want to be

49
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:38,960
uh burning you know the more kind of effortful our practice is the more we

50
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:46,319
get this kind of whiplash of real depletion where the attention totally needs to go slack so how can we make a

51
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:53,080
kind of sustained effort while nurturing these these qualities of uh of vividness

52
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:58,120
of stability how is the

53
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:04,440
effort uh of Letting Go different from the effort to make

54
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:10,319
something happen right the effort of

55
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:16,880
receiving the effort of listening to the silence feeling into the Stillness that's different kind of

56
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,560
effort than engineering silence engineering

57
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,560
Stillness engineering anything so

58
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:38,000
um so with this as a kind of preface Let's uh let's sit

59
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
together

60
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
e

61
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:43,520
so in whatever ways you can reassure

62
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:49,000
yourself it's okay for

63
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:57,960
this period to contribute nothing to the

64
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:03,599
solution of our problems to the resolution of the first Noble

65
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:11,240
Truth to the complexities of Being Human we just put it

66
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:19,720
down rather than extract something from the moment we offer oursel up to

67
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
it

68
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:53,399
we just kind of treat our life for these

69
00:08:53,399 --> 00:09:01,440
minutes is good enough treat the moment as good enough

70
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:25,959
the energy around maximizing optimizing you

71
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:31,360
just relax it with that drain into the

72
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
ground

73
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:19,120
we uh place the attention

74
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:35,079
somewhere maybe uh our breathing or our body more

75
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:42,120
broadly maybe the soundscape maybe let the soundscape run

76
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:50,040
right through your head and include external sound and the internal sound that we call

77
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,120
thinking but the attention has a place to

78
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:31,240
rest and the how of our attention

79
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:35,639
Vivid

80
00:11:49,000 --> 00:12:00,079
stable but not vivid and stable by making an effort born of clinging not

81
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:06,160
vivid and stable making an unsustainable

82
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
effort

83
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:46,519
gently nurturing investing our our interest in the object of

84
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
attention

85
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
e

86
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
e

87
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

88
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
e

89
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

90
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

91
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

92
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

93
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:15,640
and when we become identified with the

94
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:20,400
thought mind wandering kind of

95
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:32,120
Daydream the uh sense of attentional agency

96
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:43,840
collapses we just live inside the content of that

97
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:53,600
thought and then we wake up it feels like the attentional agency

98
00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:00,840
is restored

99
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:08,440
and then maybe we pit one part of oursel against

100
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:19,200
another the our fault for uh being

101
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:30,760
lost but uh this is uh unnecessary

102
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,440
it's all the same

103
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:53,120
mind so we reestablish that kind of intimacy some

104
00:18:53,120 --> 00:19:00,720
vividness some stability with the anchor of attention

105
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,320
modulate uh the effort up down slightly

106
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,799
different or the

107
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,960
same keep

108
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
going

109
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

110
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

111
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

112
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

113
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

114
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

115
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

116
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

117
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

118
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

119
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

120
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

121
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

122
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

123
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:43,960
these last um few minutes just

124
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:56,840
uh noticing the mind in a in a kind of holistic

125
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
way

126
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:24,480
in a sense uh move from very concrete anchor to something like the

127
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:30,640
anchor is uh is everywhere Maybe we say

128
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:39,320
nowhere just notice all that can be

129
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,120
noticed

130
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,120
e

131
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,039
e

132
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,039
for

133
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,480
okay good to uh stay with

134
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:26,080
you so over

135
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:35,080
uh over the year uh teaching a lot of a lot of um Pain's

136
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:41,120
been shared with me in one one way or another

137
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:48,039
and that pain uh has the quality of being both uh

138
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:57,039
sacred and uh and quite ordinary and some of the the the pain

139
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:02,320
that's been shared are things that I've directly experienced that uh

140
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:10,120
know directly and then some some of the pen or things I've not known must infer

141
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:16,240
must draw from other experience to better

142
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:22,519
understand and uh when I'm receiving

143
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:28,720
something like that somebody sharing that in a conversation retreat

144
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:34,120
something you know I try to uh convey

145
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:43,679
from my own being from the kind of from the Stillness in me what I try to convey is

146
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:49,120
this I'm unafraid of your

147
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:55,960
pain I I will not diminish uh the sorrow

148
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:03,080
but I'm unintimidated by your pain that's what I wish to

149
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:08,639
convey and of course I feel it it resonates with my

150
00:32:08,639 --> 00:32:14,919
own pain we feel its weight together

151
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:21,320
right but I'm not scared by it and I'm not scared by you and that feels

152
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:27,880
important because people uh need to learn to trust

153
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:36,880
TR their own capacity to to heal people need to know like oh yeah me

154
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:44,638
too me too like I am I am also included in the Buddhist

155
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:52,320
Grace and there's this very I don't know

156
00:32:52,320 --> 00:33:00,080
um kind of yeah sort of an um intriguing way

157
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:05,799
that that our pain gets threaded together

158
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:12,159
with uh shame I why is it like that I don't I

159
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:20,200
don't really know but our wounds and our shame somehow become

160
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:26,039
one and it's um it's odd in a way that

161
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:31,240
what most needs compassion somehow becomes the object of

162
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:39,760
Shame right but um the need that's bound up that's

163
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:48,600
expressed in our pain somehow that needs to be that need must be hidden must be

164
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:57,279
hidden and I've read that um evolutionarily um shames sometimes

165
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:04,720
considered an appeasement display like in the kind of social

166
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,760
history of our animal species like shame is is

167
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:18,158
uh yeah is an appeasement display it's like I submit I'm hurt don't hurt me

168
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:24,960
right you know that kind of gesture of a of a a dog or something submissive dog

169
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:31,480
that rolls exposes their belly as like I

170
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:36,839
submit and it's hard to be uh to be seen

171
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:42,960
in in our our pain it's vulnerable quite vulnerable to be

172
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:49,200
witnessed and something in US often feels like we must hide we must

173
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:56,358
hide and uh and so so much of Dharma is about normalizing suffering normalizing

174
00:34:56,359 --> 00:35:02,880
suffering D stigma izing it and draining some of the shame that

175
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:08,800
gets threaded together with the wound and shame always has a kind of an

176
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:14,520
audience even if that audience is just the internalized harsh gaze we want to see

177
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:20,839
like okay what's the what through what eyes am I perceiving my pain that

178
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:28,359
compounds a sense of Shame and so it can be very

179
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:37,480
um healing to have uh to have our pain witnessed without uh yeah just in a

180
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:43,560
field that is devoid of Shame

181
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:51,839
and it's almost like um as we begin we have to treat our pain as like uh as

182
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:59,640
sacred but then as the shame begins to melt as the shame begins to melt

183
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:07,599
the the pain becomes very very ordinary it loses its electric

184
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:13,760
charge now to to to actually receive

185
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:21,400
another's pain to actually receive another's pain we must know our own with

186
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:27,599
Incredible vividness to loop back to that word to deeply know our own

187
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,880
suffering our own pain to to experience it a thousand

188
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:40,880
times with with a lot of vividness uh because until

189
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:49,520
we uh become unintimidated by our own pain we remain afraid of others the pain

190
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:55,520
of others may be afraid of them in some

191
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,720
way this is um Norman Fischer from uh training training

192
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:06,599
and compassion if you've ever been ill he writes uh physically or emotionally

193
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:12,079
or otherwise in need of compassionate caring you may have noticed that many

194
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:17,839
people will offer help and kind words but somehow most of these offerings seem

195
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:23,319
either insincere or otherwise miss the mark they don't feel good they don't

196
00:37:23,319 --> 00:37:29,640
help it's as if these people though they clearly meanwhile and their offers are

197
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:37,480
touching are not capable of really receiving your pain they want to make you feel better

198
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:43,480
help you somehow by offering remedies and recommendations cheerful words or

199
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:52,319
distracting gifts but they seem unable or unwilling to do what you need them to

200
00:37:52,319 --> 00:37:59,839
do to Simply feel and acknowledge your pain they want to be

201
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:05,640
compassionate but they can't seem to do that and so their presence makes you

202
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:12,760
feel more lonely and isolated in your Misfortune this is because they are

203
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:19,640
actually terrified of their own pain and you can feel that they are also

204
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:26,800
terrified of of your pain even though of course they would never say so and may

205
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,440
not even realize they are feeling

206
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:42,599
this as we sit as we sit and as

207
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:49,079
we struggle with optimizing maximizing the moment looking

208
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:58,760
for Spiritual pleasantness of one kind or another we miss we we we can miss Dua

209
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:05,240
suffering we can miss experiencing it with uh

210
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:11,319
vividness and the precondition for empathy the

211
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:19,800
precondition for empathy is having a very rich Vivid experience to

212
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:28,480
know our own suffering in an undefended way to know it time and time again

213
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:35,800
again the Buddha said comprehend Dua

214
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:44,200
comprehend DOA comprehend to really know to really

215
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:54,000
know and to really know Dua doesn't mean we marinate in our pain it means the

216
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,240
that that suffering pain difficulty is is we know it in

217
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:06,200
Awareness we really cannot understand Dua if we're identified with

218
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:12,640
it we we we will not experience we can suffer vividly but we will not

219
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:18,760
comprehend suffering vividly unless there's

220
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:25,760
space and the the space of awareness is what's

221
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:32,359
necessary and so suffering we come to see suffering

222
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:38,760
and understanding suffering are very different very

223
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:48,200
different and how many opportunities do we have to comprehend Dua count the ways

224
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:57,920
right and so as we we um come to to understand

225
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:04,200
understand Dua to comprehend it uh part of what happens is we become

226
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:13,520
less intimidated by it we begin to drain out the the kind of

227
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:19,599
the moralism that's that's so often attached to our own our own pain the

228
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:27,359
kind of uh the shame the shame yeah and when

229
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:34,839
when we um when we do that when we we begin to comprehend Dua to really become

230
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:40,000
unintimidated by it then we can begin to offer

231
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:47,560
others our confidence because we've swam in that pool many times we know those

232
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:55,640
Waters we may not know exactly their suffering uh but but we have had the

233
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:03,079
Vivid experience of of swimming in those Waters in one way or

234
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:10,440
another and as we become less intimidated by our own pain we can gaze

235
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:16,880
upon the the pain of another

236
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:24,319
and just um see innocence in a

237
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:31,800
sense maybe they we say they the opposite of Shame

238
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:37,000
innocence we gaze upon the pain of another and

239
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:45,160
see uh See the Dharma the unfolding of

240
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:52,240
suffering freedom from suffering and we offer our kind of

241
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:57,880
heartfelt uh conviction that um

242
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:03,240
uh that pain is practice that there's a kind of

243
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:08,880
innocence in it and

244
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:19,280
uh that our heart actually can be nurtured by it rather than corroded by

245
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:27,680
suffering so I offer this for your uh consideration and uh please please uh

246
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:33,839
please pick up whatever is is useful leave behind the rest and

247
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:39,599
uh uh I uh wish you all a good uh good week

248
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:44,319
