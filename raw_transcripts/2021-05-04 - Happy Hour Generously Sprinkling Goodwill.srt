00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:49,120
this sense of goodwill friendliness for others it's actually a gift to ourselves it

9
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:55,520
really makes us happy it makes us calm it makes us there's a sense of

10
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:02,000
peace and ease and beauty that our heart revels in and i especially want to

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,080
invite this practice if the internal weather at times is

12
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,799
gray or say you're lying in bed and you're having a hard time falling asleep there

13
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,920
there are challenges so this um

14
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,119
this practice i mean there's some so many different forms of this practice but this practice the way

15
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:31,520
i'd like to invite us to explore it is just offering it's offering gifts of

16
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,439
generosity gifts of meta gifts of kindness as if you were as if you were you

17
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:44,720
discovered oh you're santa claus and you have this bag of gifts and it's

18
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,920
goodness and it's never ending it's a never ending bag of

19
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,360
goodness blessings kindness that you didn't even know you

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,640
had and the more you give it the more it gets filled up the more it gets so there's

21
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,960
it's not like oh if i give away these goodness these blessings these wishes for other people's well-being there

22
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,360
won't be enough for me it's like oh no there will be more there will be more i can just go and bless people with these

23
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:21,120
gifts of kindness so so that's one image we can work with

24
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,560
and another image is you can imagine you're a your lofarian's going around and it's just

25
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,239
very dusty and you know you're blessing people with with this these wishes of goodness so there's

26
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:38,640
different imagery that we're going to to invite today a skillful means see

27
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,319
what works for you and the object really the purpose here

28
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,360
is to cultivate our hearts in generosity of goodwill

29
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:57,040
for others and what we will discover is that we are the ones that feel

30
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,319
happy and healthy we feel safe happy healthy ease you know the sense of the

31
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:09,200
four wishes that we kind of went with with meta we share with others we have a sense of goodness

32
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:15,680
um that that we the sense of brightness

33
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:22,800
um and and i'll share with you some some nights ago i was having

34
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:29,360
trouble falling asleep and this is the practice i did i just sharing goodness just sharing

35
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:36,159
a meta for others in my imagination people i knew imaginary beings all over the world

36
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:43,040
people near far my challenging categories my people i care about you know just

37
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:49,599
just gifts of goodness and soon enough there was a sense of gladness bliss

38
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:56,239
happiness in my heart and that night actually i had very happy dreams there were just the

39
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,680
sense of gladness the sense of abundance of the heart

40
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,480
continued it just continued in the dream space so i invite you to

41
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:15,599
to explore this not just here as we will explore it together but but maybe tonight when we're about

42
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:24,400
to to fall asleep when you're lying in bed practice it and see what happens so

43
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:31,840
and one last thing to say to set the stage before we start is we do all this practice as always

44
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,680
without attachment to outcome yes we know that the world is

45
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:45,120
uncertain there's there's impermanence we know there is love and permanence um

46
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:51,600
so as we wish well for others it's not with a sense of clinging to outcome we want you to be

47
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,919
happy now why aren't you happy yet it's more a sense of cultivating our own

48
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:04,320
heart without attachment to outcome um it's a cultivation of generosity the

49
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,080
way we show up in the world so this is practice so that when we actually interact with

50
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,000
others oh we realize wow there's a lot of kindness there's a lot of generosity there's a lot of good

51
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:24,400
will it's like athletes who imagine doing a stroke or a particular

52
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:31,120
uh game and then there's research actually

53
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:37,360
suggesting that in when we do these um imaginary these practices in our

54
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:44,479
minds um physical the same those muscles those physical muscles actually get stronger

55
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:50,000
it's as if we have exercise so this is the same way with with these muscles of quote-unquote

56
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,080
muscles of the heart these practices of kindness generosity good will

57
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,160
gladness that we share and we just become more glad you probably know this by now already

what worked what was challenging questions love to hear your insights you can

190
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:57,520
either raise your hand your zoom hand or you can

191
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:03,920
um type in chat and if you type publicly i'll say your name out loud if

192
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:10,060
it's just to me it'll be um private so bill

193
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:16,800
[Music] hello hi um

194
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:26,320
i was thinking about what you said about um focusing doing meta at bedtime and i've tried that before

195
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:33,280
and it's for me it's it's not sleep inducing it tends to be more emotional i don't

196
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:41,440
think i'm clinging i don't at least i don't think i am um i just didn't know if that was anyway

197
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:48,880
that's that's what i'm sharing so there you go yeah yeah an interesting bill so so actually

198
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:57,200
in um the 11 benefits of meta in the suttas

199
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:04,400
one of the benef one of the 11 is that you fall asleep you sleep you sleep happily so it

200
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:10,800
is supposed to be actually one of the benefits and you have happy dreams so these two items which are reported

201
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:17,200
are actually part of the meta benefit so it would be interesting to actually

202
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:24,880
have bring some more curiosity bill to your practice to your meta practice to see why

203
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:31,520
is there clinging is there attachment to arkham because if you're saying well i don't think there is well maybe that's a pointer

204
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:36,640
there maybe that's what's maybe that's what's agitating the mind really wanting instead of just

205
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:45,040
really giving it away because it's just such and this just feels so light and as manohar says on on youtube

206
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:50,079
it felt much uh it felt much light feels so lighter and relaxing you know there's a

207
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:55,119
sense of lightness in this practice you're just giving goodness away wow you

208
00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:01,520
feel lighter relaxed and the mind the heart falls asleep with happiness with

209
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:07,440
gladness so please bring some uh curiosity um to

210
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:15,359
to what's happening what's what's causing that yeah great because it's it's not exactly

211
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:20,400
supposed to be that way so something is kind of yeah

212
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:27,280
um yeah something is probably causing contraction jerry says very lifting and allowed me

213
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:32,560
to calm and focus meta towards others lovely thank you

214
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:38,960
and i see our ma now one more uh uh that was so much fun so worthwhile

215
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:47,520
thank you and good night says mark on youtube great i'm glad it was fun mark i had fun too so armando i see your hand

216
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:53,599
please i have a question like when there are hindrances

217
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:59,680
present could be like restless or worry or any of the other

218
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:05,119
hindrances um do you think it's a good idea to first

219
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:13,040
like sort of like you know take care of that hindrance or the hindrances and then do mata

220
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:19,520
or maybe mata can be a way of actually sort of helping with the hindrances because

221
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:25,839
i mean i sometimes if the hindrances are strong it may be difficult to do mata i think i

222
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:31,359
mean you know in some situations i believe i mean i feel that right so yeah exactly yeah that's a that's a

223
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:37,040
great question um so you can experiment with

224
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:44,319
with either and both depending on a given situation and see so with the you know if the

225
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:50,240
entrances is so strong that meta is feeling really challenging then turning

226
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:55,760
then turning the attention the awareness to the hindrance either with wisdom

227
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:04,400
practice and you know you know what the wisdom practices are with um or with or um or with meta

228
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:11,200
entirely turning well actually i guess i'm including meta here too entirely turning to the hindrance if

229
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:17,280
it's very strong if it's not very strong then you can continue the practice and just let the hindrance be be there

230
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:24,319
without having to push it away just kind of let it be there let it feel supported so i guess

231
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:30,640
four options the first the like decision tree the first decision is is it really strong or is it

232
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:37,119
kind of weak hindrance if it's very strong then you turn attention to it um and then if it's weak then you can

233
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:43,599
kind of continue the meta so that's the first decision and then let it and then not try to push it away

234
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:49,119
but let it feel included let it let it be included yeah i know you're here restlessness or

235
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:54,800
it's okay sweetie it's okay we're just gonna do this and you can come along you can come along so so if that's

236
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:00,160
possible if it's mild so now if it's really strong then decision tree now we're down to

237
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:08,000
okay so if it's really strong then you can turn towards it with with um wisdom practices

238
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,078
as as you know or if you turn towards it holy with meta

239
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:23,119
one thing i would warn against is to is not try to get rid of the hindrance with meta

240
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:30,560
that can become um conflictual and and if you're doing meta

241
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:35,920
in order to get rid of it it's not really meta so giving it space

242
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:42,240
with a sense of okay restlessness worry okay ah

243
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:48,640
letting there be a lot of space a lot of let your let your hindrance feel safe

244
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:56,079
is let your hindrance feel safe like it's okay it's okay if you're holding a a child

245
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:01,599
that's that's uh kind of crabby and crying it's like you don't try to like okay

246
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:09,760
shut up no be quiet i'm trying to do meta it's like oh sweetie okay what's going on it's all right it's okay it's okay you turn towards it with metta

247
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:16,960
so be be mindful of that thank you thank you yeah and

248
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:23,440
last quick comment from ben before we go into groups yes

249
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:32,800
hey uh yeah thanks um i was listening to a dharma talk the

250
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:40,319
other day on yeah generosity as you know uh a transformational tool for

251
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:46,000
the way the attitude we bring to the world specifically that it's a great remedy to

252
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,520
the feeling that there's you know not enough for me um and that sort of

253
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:59,520
that attitude can often be accompanied by a certain kind of uh um unhelpful degree of sense of self

254
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:05,280
and i'm all for that that makes a lot of sense to me and particularly this teacher was saying

255
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:12,160
you know that implies the following instruction if you feel like there's not enough for

256
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:17,359
you give and like that's that's if if that's

257
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:23,040
doable that sounds great but i don't know for me personally that's like exactly when i don't feel like i can

258
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:29,280
make that first reach into my pocket to get yeah so i strap myself up yeah so so i

259
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:36,400
hear where you're going and i think what i want to connect with with the practice we did tonight is that in this cultivation this

260
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:42,000
imagination this bag is never ending back so you don't have to imagine a situation

261
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:49,520
where oh there's a scarcity mindset so this is actually what can cultivate train your mind where there's so much

262
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:55,839
goodness there's just so much goodness there's plenty to go around so my invitation would be to use this

263
00:46:55,839 --> 00:47:01,760
practice as a stepping stone because there's no way you can imagine that okay i've given goodness away and

264
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,800
there isn't uh there isn't anything anything left

265
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:14,079
does that make sense ben um it it it makes sense in

266
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:20,400
in concept but i think that to really get the energetic feeling that that stuff in the bag

267
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:26,960
is resource i think i would still just sort of have the problem with it i i think you're you're thinking too

268
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:33,200
hard so so so do this for this practice as invited just this imagining that it just

269
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:38,800
the more you give the more there is because that is the case with generosity and kindness with

270
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:44,079
goodwill so start it here and don't try to say well well if if you try to stop yourself before

271
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:50,559
you actually go there it's it's you're shooting yourself in the foot in the imagination space like

272
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:56,240
there's nothing that can stop you so so anyway i'm saying this from experience having

273
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:01,440
tried it so it's like it's not nothing yeah i i appreciate that and at this

274
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:09,599
point this is all i have to offer which is to hang in there with it um so okay

275
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:16,559
so thank you ben and so i like to invite us now to practice in

276
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:21,839
small groups because time is running out and we may not have enough time right now with small groups so there

277
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:28,079
might they'll be shorter today so i've just created the the uh the rooms

278
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:33,520
and the invitation is to start with 15 seconds of silent meta

279
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:40,640
and then to um yeah to um

280
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:48,640
yeah the sense of generosity the sense of generosity of heart um can can you feel it for yourself and

281
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:54,000
can you feel it for others so here we go with the rooms

282
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:01,520
i'm trying to create them quickly here we go all right

283
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:09,040
the rooms are open hello everyone and welcome back so the rooms are closed

284
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:16,319
and we have just about a minute for one final reflection or comment so if you haven't spoken

285
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:30,319
for a while please we'd love to hear from you what did you discover what did you notice

286
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:37,119
and how was it to do this practice of generosity in community terrance

287
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:44,720
i found it extremely supportive the little group interaction i had just and

288
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:50,079
delightful and um helpful in many ways

289
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:57,920
thank you thank you would it be possible to perhaps tease out one thing

290
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:05,119
to share well well we both we we didn't go with your back thing

291
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:10,319
all good whatever the bag of goodness so you know we were we were joined together

292
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:15,520
and poo pooing your bag idea [Laughter]

293
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:22,720
so what worked for you so what was important for you tell me oh just i had a kind of a natural

294
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:28,800
flowing of generosity toward myself i've been taking medications lately that

295
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:34,559
that for pain medication and part of me typically in the past would have said no this is not good you don't

296
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:41,599
want to take very much of that but i'm doing what the doctor said i'm taking a full load and you know kind of

297
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:48,480
unpleasantly dedicated and it's okay i'm being generous with myself nice so whatever brings up a sense of

298
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:54,160
generosity terence yay i celebrate that with you with mudita

299
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:59,920
so fantastic whether it's a bag doesn't have to be a bag it could be actually

300
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:08,240
just a sense of general whatever brings up a sense of generosity flowing um whatever imagery whatever skillful

301
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:13,920
means and for many people it could just be beaming of generosity sense of light or sense of

302
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:22,800
whatever it might be so what whatever made it work for you yay fantastic for you and others so

303
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:29,599
thank you all for your practice for doing this work not just for yourself for all beings

304
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:37,838
everywhere may all beings be happy may all beings be free

305
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,839
thank you
