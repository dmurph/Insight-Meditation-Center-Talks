good morning again good morning and this week

11
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:09,720
this week we're going to be talking about I'll be exploring inner and outer Harmony teachings of the

12
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,780
Buddha that um talk about cultivating qualities of mind and heart

13
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:22,379
that support the practice internally and practice towards freedom and also

14
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:29,340
support beneficial relationships so we'll start with a meditation

15
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:35,700
so whenever you are ready and done greeting each other

16
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:41,940
even as you're finishing up greeting each other the invitation is to look

17
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:48,000
around your Spades notice Where You Are notice your external surroundings maybe

18
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,580
the walls or the sky and the trees if you're outside

19
00:02:53,580 --> 00:03:00,300
take a look behind you and um tune in

20
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:06,739
tune into your surroundings the soundscape around you

21
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:15,900
and then settling in settling into a posture if it feels

22
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,340
comfortable and alert

23
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:28,519
noticing that you're seeing softening your eyes

24
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,159
maybe allowing them to close

25
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,940
and checking in checking in with this body

26
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:55,920
noticing any Sensations first maybe the sensations of your skin

27
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,720
touching cloth or air noticing any textures

28
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:10,319
warmth or cold pressure

29
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,099
lightness

30
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:19,458
and noticing the whole body

31
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,780
or the surface of your body meets the world

32
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:36,680
and perhaps taking one or two slightly deeper slower breaths

33
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:50,419
together releasing any excess tension

34
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:03,500
allowing the mind the attention to rest inward

35
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:14,120
I'm tuning to the sensations of your life's breath

36
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:26,060
or to the sounds around you and resting resting in this moment

37
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:53,060
perhaps noticing their eyes and fall of the belly or abdomen

38
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,660
the flexing of the rib cage

39
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:28,880
the sensations of air in the back of the throat or the nostrils

40
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,900
we're tuning in to the whole body breathing

41
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:20,099

this meditation cultivation of mindfulness

43
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,819
perhaps may this be of benefit

44
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:38,539
or whatever intention works for you

45
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,000
foreign

46
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:56,360
allowing the mind the heart

47
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:02,120
to rest in the flow of the moment

48
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,300
if mind wanders natural

49
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:57,080

50
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:03,680

allowing these to carry you carry you in the moment

55
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:58,940
and do not last remaining moments of this meditation

foreign again everyone and a warm welcome to

76
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:56,760
those who tiptoed into the YouTube room a little bit late

77
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:03,000
happy to have you all here happy to see many familiar names and

78
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,260
people I've run across either in person or virtually great

79
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:17,638
so this week the exploration the theme is on

80
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:23,060
cultivating qualities of mind that are conducive supportive to Inner Harmony

81
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:30,300
and outer Harmony peace of mind

82
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:35,398
but beautiful ways or helpful ways of moving through the world

83
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:41,580
and I'm going to start with a story and it's a story many of you have probably heard before

84
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:47,460
battle back so we're in ancient India

85
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:53,398
and there are performers kind of buskers these days they would be called

86
00:34:53,399 --> 00:35:00,080
who perform for a living and there are these two bamboo acrobats

87
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:08,460
a senior acrobat and his assistant a woman and the way that the trick works

88
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:15,900
is um the assistant has to climb up on a very tall bamboo Pole that the main acrobat

89
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:22,200
is balancing either on their clavicle right here or on their forehead

90
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:28,140
and if you can imagine supporting supporting a person just with a stick on

91
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:34,260
your forehead or your clavicle so much attention is required

92
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:39,660
so the senior acrobat says to The Apprentice okay so here's what we're

93
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:45,440
gonna do you look after me and I look after you and will perform

94
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:53,000
our tricks and then we'll get down safely and collect our feet

95
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:58,500
um that though the other acrobat The Apprentice

96
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:03,540
she looked at him and said no no no that's not how it's going to work

97
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:10,740
we are going to it would be better we're going to you focus on yourself

98
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:16,680
and keep yourself quiet and calm and safe and I'll focus

99
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:22,140
on my balance I'll look to my own balance you look to your own balance and

100
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:29,760
that way we will support each other by supporting ourselves we'll

101
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:37,320
finish our trick and collect our feet so it's a little bit audacious for in

102
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:42,599
Ancient India for a woman to countermand a senior and a man

103
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:49,800
but the Buddha heard this story related and

104
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:56,640
said actually you know what the assistant the assistant was right each person needs to be mindful and

105
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:02,820
reach out for themselves we'd not reach out for themselves but look out for themselves look out for their own

106
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:09,060
balance and in that way the mindfulness will keep

107
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:14,540
each other safe not just in acrobatics but in life

108
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:20,660
however it's also true that the senior acrobat was right that it's important

109
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:27,599
that we look out for each other as well the way we look out for each other one

110
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:34,020
might call it external mindfulness a broader field of mindfulness

111
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:40,680
and that takes place through mindfulness of ethical virtue and

112
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:49,040
kindness and compassion consistency so both were right

113
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:55,260
and and this talking about here

114
00:37:55,260 --> 00:38:01,320
the importance of the Primacy of

115
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:08,339
mindful awareness as a foundation the foundation for keeping ourselves in

116
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:14,579
balance and an important foundation in how we're showing up with other people

117
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:22,680
right so the foundation of all other virtues in some sense is reflexive awareness

118
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:30,380
being aware of what's happening what we're doing how we're showing up what the impact is

119
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:41,460
in a sense this is internal and external mindfulness writ large right mindfulness

120
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:46,980
of how we are in the world and how we are

121
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:52,980
in ourselves so in the ancient teaching the Buddha

122
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:58,740
talks about other beneficial qualities too which I'll cover in the next four days

123
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:06,900
they are Goodwill or loving-kindness a kind of sharing or non-stinginess

124
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:13,260
which is a kind of virtue and the consistency the consistency of

125
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:21,000
showing up in these ways over and over and then the last the fourth is wise

126
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:27,560
View so we'll cover each of these in the next four days

127
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:32,059
meanwhile just to set the stage

128
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:41,700
a wise person the Buddha says a wise person of great wisdom does not intend or practice for their

129
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:48,060
own Affliction for the Affliction of others or for the Affliction of both but rather

130
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:54,960
they practice they think of their own welfare their own benefit the

131
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:01,079
welfare of others the welfare of both and the welfare of the whole world

132
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:09,200
that's the intention so as many of you have been

133
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:15,780
participating in these Zoom sessions for now years you're well aware that the

134
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:23,880
early Buddhist teachings are about cultivating qualities qualities that help create these healthy

135
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:29,700
harmonious mental sort of states or culture or ecology

136
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:34,740
within us and these same qualities

137
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:39,780
when wisely developed also help us show up

138
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:46,740
in a way as I said earlier move through the world in a way that can increase the Harmony in our

139
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:53,220
lives in the micro cultures around us whether they're a band of ancient

140
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:58,680
Indian mendicants like the buddhaled around India or at a modern Meditation

141
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:07,440
Center or family workplace or neighborhood the same kind of principles apply

142
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:13,339
and this combination of the internal and external meditation

143
00:41:13,339 --> 00:41:18,660
cultivation is really helpful as a basis for True

144
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:26,640
spiritual maturation insight greater freedom of the heart of the Mind

145
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:34,380
and also more of a sense of connectedness satisfaction friendliness ease with the

146
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:39,380
other people in our lives even the other animals in our lives

147
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:48,660
one of the teachings um I drew from and it will draw from over the next four days is known as

148
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:55,260
sarania dhamma in Pali dhamma or Dharma is one of those words

149
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:04,680
that can be many many things here it means something like qualities or principles factors

150
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:10,980
there's also a kind of a word cloud a range of meanings for saranya

151
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:18,480
so feeling into your body feel how the different English translations I'm about to give

152
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:24,720
land in you courteous

153
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:30,540
polite friendly

154
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:36,839
thinking happy rejoice

155
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:44,720
Gladden to be compatible

156
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:52,520
they're just feeling those the resonances of them

157
00:42:54,420 --> 00:43:01,619
together this phrase means principles or factors of compatibility

158
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:08,700
friendliness or cordiality it's often it's the teachings I'm

159
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:15,140
drawing from one one way they're called as the principles of cordiality or Concord

160
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:21,119
some of you may also hear the word sarna Nepali in saranya

161
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:26,880
and this is kind of a happy coincidence the

162
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:32,940
word sarna means Refuge many of you have heard that Buddha I'm

163
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:38,400
sorry sarna so

164
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,619
it doesn't appear to be a direct derivation in the language but rather a

165
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:49,500
homonym that the word for compatibility or friendliness among people also

166
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:56,400
happens to sound like the word for Refuge so in my mind

167
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:02,040
that means that these are

168
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:07,500
kind of linked this this happy coincidence it means that cultivating

169
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:13,560
these qualities helps our minds our hearts our Behavior become a refuge for

170
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:22,079
ourselves and our ways of showing up our attitudes ways of relating can also be a refuge

171
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:30,140
for other people can be a refuge for those around us

172
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:38,940
this does not mean sacrificing your own welfare many of you have probably heard a very

173
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:44,700
modern simile you can picture yourself in an airplane on the tarmac getting ready to take off

174
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:50,280
the flight attendants come out and they show the seat belts and then they talk about in the unlikely event of needing

175
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:56,579
oxygen masks will drop in the instruction if you have a companion

176
00:44:56,579 --> 00:45:04,040
especially a child or an older person is to put your own mask on first

177
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:11,359
breathe and then help the other person put their mask on

178
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:19,940
so put your own mask on first in the practice in fact the Buddha kind of

179
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:26,700
ranked motivations for practice and practice which is not for one's own

180
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:33,660
benefit or others benefit is kind of at the bottom like why do it it's not worthwhile

181
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:40,680
worse than useless I'll just say euphemistically for how it's described in the discourses

182
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:47,280
for practicing for others but not for ourselves is a little bit better

183
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:54,359
it's really worth noticing that practicing for one's own welfare even if

184
00:45:54,359 --> 00:46:01,040
you don't have others in mind ranks more highly

185
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:08,760
look to your own balance first then the sort of highest motivation the

186
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:16,619
most excellent motivation that the Buddha praised is to practice for one's own welfare

187
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:23,599
and for the welfare of others a variable

188
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:32,280
so their mission should you choose to accept it over the next 24 hours is to

189
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:37,740
perhaps notice how mindfulness meditation benefits you

190
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:44,460
throughout your day benefits others or maybe benefits both

191
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:49,859
just check in once or twice or notice throughout the day

192
00:46:49,859 --> 00:46:56,160
can talk about it with a friend notice it informal practice and we'll be back tomorrow

193
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:02,819
to continue to explore inner and outer Harmony through talking about the process of

194
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:07,700
inner and outer kindness Goodwill

195
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:15,540
so thank you all very much for your practice it's a real Delight to see you

196
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:20,000

197
