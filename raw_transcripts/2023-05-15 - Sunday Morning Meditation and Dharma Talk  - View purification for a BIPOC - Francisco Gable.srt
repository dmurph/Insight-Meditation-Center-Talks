1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,600
good morning everyone happy Mother's Days

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,179
to everyone involved

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,640
today I'd like to share some Reflections on a teaching that's been very important

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,580
to me has made a big difference in my life and um

5
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:29,340
it's the topic of views views

6
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:35,460
of views and the teachings have a very naked negative rendition and all the

7
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,540
discourses views are not rendered as positive things

8
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:47,399
so they are qualified the views that uh

9
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,739
we work on are things called right views

10
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:57,079
or purification of views

11
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,500
and this is particularly wonderful to me because well I think that this practice

12
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,200
is about meeting all the needs the deepest needs

13
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:18,299
that a human person can have and coming into contact with what we

14
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:23,840
need the most and being able to have relationships

15
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,880
internal and external that help us settle open up

16
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,579
and come up to the fullness of our being fullness of here

17
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:43,979
fullness of being together and so views are usually

18
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:49,799
found in kind of a classic teaching of something called Sila

19
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,439
somebody and ponya words these are poly words that can be

20
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:03,119
translated to ethic ethical conduct samadhi can be concentration or

21
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:10,679
meditation and panya's wisdom and Views are usually in the category of wisdom

22
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:17,280
because views can be the beginning and the end of the path

23
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:24,540
that's one of the potent things about them we start working on our views

24
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:31,620
start relating to our views and branching out widely releasing views

25
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:38,879
lessening views finding views that are helpful and then this amazing thing begins to

26
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,819
happen that without views then there's just this

27
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:51,420
viewing the seeing this knowing

28
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:58,200
and this knowing that I'm talking about the knowing that we develop the knowledge and vision of this tradition

29
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,239
is is very gentle it's about

30
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:11,819
Gil says something like be still and look at everything and gaze

31
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:17,040
at everything kindly gazing at everything kindly and the

32
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,800
kindly part is really important because they're kindly kindly part is

33
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:30,659
where the settling has happened in order to be able to look at views um

34
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:36,680
so first there's Sila and ethical virtue and what we get from

35
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,940
practicing with our ethical conduct is we as

36
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:49,140
we find some safety we find where our need for

37
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:56,159
safety is met and our need for non-harming is also met

38
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:02,340
and then that allows us to settle down and and really start relaxing some of

39
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:08,659
the deeper things inside of us that are a little fragmented we kind of lead

40
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:15,720
fragmented lives mostly we're usually coming and going in our

41
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:21,720
minds usually coming and going in the world we it's part of the worldly life to come

42
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:29,340
and go to reach to push to want to not want

43
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:36,060
and so samadi is of coming together it's a

44
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:42,120
centering it's a not being out there not being then and there

45
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:49,080
and once we find that we have this foothold this place of rest

46
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:55,199
this place we can begin to take note of our view what we see

47
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,320
more easily and we begin to notice those views that are lead us to

48
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:07,320
wholesomeness to the goodness what leads to compassion what leads to

49
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:14,419
Joy authentic Joy and and there are different views the word

50
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:19,620
views and Pali which is ditty can mean pretty much the same thing that it does

51
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:26,479
in English it can mean the view the opinion the belief the

52
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:33,180
metaphysics the history the stories all these things that we've inherited that

53
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:39,360
we brought along and Views can also also means in poly

54
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,639
some well it also shares the meaning of having being out of view

55
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:51,419
of you a beautiful Vista the top of a mountain at the edge of a cliff

56
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:56,580
and then it has a very interesting view that's in Pali that um we don't have in

57
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:05,120
English and that is Here and Now being here and now

58
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:12,539
and and that's what we get to we get to this place where we're here

59
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:17,699
and now with this tremendous clarity

60
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:24,479
this tremendous Clarity that can see here and now in a way that's not normally not available because there's

61
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:30,780
so many filters that we live with that we need in fact

62
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:40,199
so it's a lot about removing the filters and we start to do this by settling down

63
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:46,319
by doing what we just did we meditated we were quiet

64
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:52,860
and then we can begin to notice all the things that also come up

65
00:06:52,860 --> 00:07:00,720
and it's very different than when we are able to just kind of

66
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,600
be there fully let's say that you were standing in line

67
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:14,520
over there in the bathroom and there's a long line and you want to get back here to the meditation to be on

68
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:20,479
time and so

69
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:27,240
there's a little concern there's a little worry there's a little preoccupation there's a little back and forth going on

70
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:34,139
in you it's also possible to maybe you heard some teaching about

71
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:39,199
being quiet and receiving the moment and

72
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,280
being massaged by the present moment and receiving the goodness that's here

73
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:50,160
and you decide to be still while you're waiting for the bathroom

74
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,740
just list just still taking in

75
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:02,360
your feet on the ground the body shifting

76
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:08,819
the space people come in and going

77
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:13,860
the sunlight those are a whole bunch of other things

78
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:22,560
than the concern to get to the bathroom to get back to sit here and be on time

79
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:30,900
and so that's the fullness that I'm alluding to the moment gets like thicker in a way as

80
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:37,500
we begin to quiet down and release our views our thinking

81
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,539
in their different views some that really hold us back

82
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:48,779
fearful views long habits long ideas that we picked up from somewhere

83
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:55,080
some flashbacks and stories and so these begin to settle

84
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,720
and what we do is we can begin to take care of something that's a little deeper

85
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:07,440
inside we begin to we can begin to take care of

86
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:14,640
well maybe that view is not really necessary we can kind of begin to put a question mark on views

87
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,820
and we come back to the present moment and then we can take another look at that

88
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:27,600
view and slowly that can begin to see that that doesn't really help us

89
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,980
and so there's this kind of massage that goes back and forth it's very organic

90
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:42,300
we can sense the effect that it has on us to go back to that same concern that same

91
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:49,279
preoccupation and begin to sense what it does

92
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:54,540
physically emotionally and then we

93
00:09:54,540 --> 00:10:00,300
begin to see that well maybe it maybe I don't need to see it this way

94
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:05,580
maybe I can begin to question it a little bit differently

95
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:13,260
and this helps a lot because it leads us onward it leads us onward to

96
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:19,080
to go a little deeper into what is going on here with

97
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:26,660
how we frame things how we see things how we exist here

98
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:34,200
it's been very very important for me to let go of views very intense views

99
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,440
through a lot of work because I have found myself more

100
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,640
belonging to the world we all have this deep need to belong to

101
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,740
be at home we see the Buddha statue pointing to the Earth

102
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:57,140
on the night of his enlightenment he was pointing to the Earth because

103
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:05,720
the Earth was his witness he belonged to the Earth he is of the Earth

104
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,000
there was no separation nothing could take him away from his

105
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,160
connection to here the fullness of here

106
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:27,500
and then there's the stability also in his gaze it was a kind of a kindness in his gaze

107
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:33,540
there is a sweetness that comes and we cultivated with our practice we like we

108
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:38,579
did just now and so we do this and the more we do

109
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:45,120
this the more we can accept things and see things

110
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:51,839
so many of us maybe have looked at emotions here with one of the guided one

111
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:59,519
of the many teachings that we do in secular mindfulness and in our inside tradition is we we look at emotions

112
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:07,140
and we look at emotions as as phenomena as events

113
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:12,600
and it's very very helpful to look at an emotion as an event

114
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:18,060
as opposed to how we usually feel emotions our

115
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:23,640
emotions mirror emotions become the emotions

116
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:29,640
there's something very different as if we learn to step back a little bit

117
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:35,160
and sense it understand it from a sensory point of view

118
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:41,820
and that's a very very big place that begins to open up that's why

119
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:49,440
being with emotions is so such a potent practice it's this huge place because when we can

120
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:58,260
look at our emotions that way when we can treat our emotions that way we find this Refuge inside

121
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:05,300
there's this space that opens up and suddenly the emotion can be

122
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:11,519
understood better and it's not about doing anything to the emotion it is not about trying to fix it which is really

123
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:17,579
hard right because um it would be really nice to just stop

124
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:22,940
certain emotions like fear anger shame

125
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:28,320
sometimes there can be even too much joy that can be inappropriate

126
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,420
and so we don't really change them but we

127
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:39,720
can see them know them sense them

128
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:45,300
care for them kindly attend to them kindly attend to them

129
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:50,880
kindly let them be so that in that space that opens up

130
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:57,899
these things can get untangled in what gets untangled is not necessarily

131
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:03,420
to our inner something we we do that's one of the wonderful things about

132
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:09,000
a mindfulness it gets untangled by

133
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:16,200
by well something called insight

134
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:23,040
we begin to see and sense that the emotions

135
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,800
are in this flux first of all we see that they are us they are in something

136
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:34,680
we know they're an experience that's happening and that we can know them

137
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:40,680
so it's something very cool that our mind does we can know something

138
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:47,279
and we can let the something be and when that space opens up which we

139
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:53,220
that we do with emotions all the time when that space opens up then

140
00:14:53,220 --> 00:15:00,120
this this untangling begins can begin to happen if we can be steady

141
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:07,380
if if we can be caring in fact we if if we can really just be

142
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:13,320
there not fragmented not pushing away but actually find some sort of Center

143
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:20,220
some sort of foothold some sort of nurturing or kindliness

144
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:25,860
if you can be kindly to some of those horrible emotions that come

145
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:31,620
from life if it can be kind to them

146
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:36,800
they unravel there's this unraveling that happens

147
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:44,100
and it unravels because these things want to be felt and seen

148
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:52,199
because there's a lot in them that has a lot of little sticky parts

149
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:58,320
that we keep us attached I that fear it's like we almost can't even see that

150
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,480
we are not the fear sometimes we almost can't even see that we're not

151
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:13,079
the shame sometimes but if we bring this caring nurturing

152
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:19,500
stance that our tradition teaches us this is a tradition of tranquility and

153
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:25,199
serenity as well as insight if we bring this tranquility and

154
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:32,240
serenity to this stuff these real knots of ours

155
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:39,959
they begin to kind of slowly unravel because they're physical things

156
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:45,720
their emotional things their motivational things

157
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:51,959
their cognitive things and we get insight into

158
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:58,199
oh wow when this happens this happens

159
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:04,199
wow when I when I when that comes into my

160
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:11,220
Vision this happens when that comes into my mind I do this

161
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:17,760
when I feel this way then I really go down that rabbit hole

162
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:24,839
wow and it's cool like how how this happens it happens because

163
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:31,919
you see things are not solid that's one of the big problems of views

164
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:37,440
or one of the big interesting Revelations of having Right View

165
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:44,880
or having a purified View a purified view means that we can see

166
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:53,760
the emotions see the object and we can know we're seeing the object

167
00:17:53,760 --> 00:18:02,100
and that they're two different things and when we can see these two different things we then begin to see that we have

168
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:07,440
this overlay of Concepts and how we see

169
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:14,160
the emotion how we see my anger how I see my anger I begin to see how I see my

170
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:21,000
anger and then I can I can know that and I can take that

171
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:28,380
stock and kindly receive it and one other thing I see is that it's this

172
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:38,220
is changing how I'm looking at it changes and the thing the anger is also changing

173
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:44,880
and so suddenly things are not so fixed we're in this kind of stream moving

174
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:52,880
flowing world and that's amazing because it's like

175
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:59,760
we're more here we're we're more alive and more we're more intimate with

176
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,940
ourselves we can be more intimate with ourselves and we can be more intimate with the

177
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:12,840
world which is very nice let's say that you are

178
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:19,440
at the beach one day it's an off day it's a Sunday afternoon

179
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:27,059
like today and we're at the beach and we just came out of meditation so we're

180
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:34,380
very relaxed we're not yet worried about Monday and so we just really take in the beach

181
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:40,320
we've just really take in the waves we take the foam of the waves

182
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,900
the air the flowing gentle breeze the Cool Breeze

183
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:51,179
and there's the maybe a little Birds little bird legs

184
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:58,679
and we're just really taking taking all these things in we can really just if we're settled and

185
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:05,840
just there in some sort of Joy enjoying this

186
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:13,380
and it's very cool because you're just registering these things

187
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:18,539
and you're just registering it's it's like a Marvel

188
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:23,820
you're not really thinking about these things that's a different thing someone asks

189
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:30,179
you did you see that wave did you see those waves oh yeah those were great waves but it

190
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:36,360
wasn't because you were analyzing the waves it could be analyzing the waves but then that keeps you in a different

191
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:41,940
little frame as opposed to a very very broad frame or you just registering

192
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:48,200
everything in every direction which is what mindfulness does

193
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:56,820
and then at the beach you can go into another layer there's the building blocks of

194
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:02,580
your experience are also available and then

195
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:08,160
how that comes into view is that you see that they're

196
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:14,720
is sand and that you're knowing sand

197
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:22,320
and what begins to show up is the quality the essence of sand

198
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:28,220
hardness wetness

199
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:34,740
moving air shifting Sensations

200
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:40,860
and that's a whole other deeper level of experience that is available to us just

201
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:46,740
like in standing in line when we were standing in line you could have been thinking about getting to the

202
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:52,020
bathroom or you could have been really fully here being in the moment taking in

203
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:57,360
everybody around you and just having a different experience one's not better than the other it's

204
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:05,760
just a different experience and then the different experience where there could be a greater intimacy and a

205
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:14,039
fullness fullness of the moment and that's very very sweet because

206
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:19,280
because we kind of don't live that way for the most part

207
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:27,720
we kind of live in a different way and so we are not in a certain way

208
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:35,520
really fully even here at times many times the world of the Mind

209
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:43,020
is a very very very captivating world to be in it's almost like a virtual reality

210
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:50,280
in a certain sense there's this little story that someone told me my Aunt one of my aunts from

211
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:58,919
where I was born sent me this little story of just this little electronic story about

212
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:05,240
a a woman who was having lunch this was in Spanish

213
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:11,640
so some woman in Latin America was at a restaurant she went into a restaurant to have lunch

214
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:19,500
and she was busy planning her next big project at work and uh

215
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:24,960
also planning some other things that she needed to do her vacation and um

216
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:32,700
she ordered her lunch and then this she heard this voice from

217
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:39,179
like below her it's how the story put it can I have a piece of bread please

218
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:45,240
and she looked down and there was a little boy asking for a piece of bread

219
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,640
and and of course she you know she kind of

220
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:58,679
felt the Pang of that and so she ordered him a piece of bread they brought him a piece of bread and uh

221
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:06,419
and then she kind of really wanted to get back to her her world and then the boy asked can I

222
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:15,900
have a piece of a little bit of butter to put on it please and so she offered him the butter and

223
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:24,299
and then he asked her what are you doing and she said I'm sending emails

224
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:30,419
and he asks what's that uh and she knew that he would not

225
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:36,240
understand the boy had was a desperately poor boy in Latin America

226
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,580
you see this everywhere where I come from and where I work and where I live a

227
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:47,760
lot and so this boy said what what's it what's email and so she was trying to

228
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:54,120
explain to them and she couldn't figure it out how to explain it to him and then she said you know it's like virtual reality

229
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:59,520
it's like a virtual reality that doesn't really exist where it's like letters and

230
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:05,460
notes but it's more like a virtual reality and then she and then he she explained and then

231
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:11,880
he said oh I know what virtual reality is virtual reality

232
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:20,940
um I live in virtual reality too I live in the idea that every that it's

233
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:26,580
going to be Christmas today and that we're going to have gifts and presents

234
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:31,620
because um where I live my mom goes to work

235
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:40,140
every day and um my sister goes to sell her body but she

236
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:47,340
comes back with her body every night my father is in jail

237
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:52,340
and my little baby brother is crying from Hunger

238
00:25:52,679 --> 00:26:02,480
and so I live in this virtual reality too and the woman kind of came to

239
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:08,700
and and came to to see and to sense how how

240
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:15,720
she was how she was missing the World by going

241
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:24,120
back into her world of vacations and in her memories she was remembering suddenly a vacation she had had in Italy

242
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:29,159
or something and she was missing the world she was in

243
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:35,700
the world but missing the world and not be able to have compassion for the world that you live

244
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:40,799
in so it's a very different experience to

245
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:46,380
live in a world where where it's a virtual reality

246
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:51,779
you're not being we're not receiving all that's here

247
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:57,539
we're not unwinding all that could be Unwound and open up the heart to what

248
00:26:57,539 --> 00:27:04,140
the heart can open up we're not knowing the spaces of the heart this is a path

249
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:10,860
there's this great book by Goldstein this little cute little yellow book a path full of heart it's the prettiest

250
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:17,279
little book it's very short but it's a path full of heart

251
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:22,740
this is this is a path full of heart in the way to release

252
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:28,080
release all the Cravings classical word

253
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:34,740
clinging that we have the thirsts that we have

254
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:40,380
the wantings the unquenchable wantings

255
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:46,559
and then the fears and the shames and the flashbacks

256
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:55,260
the way to unwind these things is to is to when it's time to do this practice

257
00:27:55,260 --> 00:28:01,500
to remember that there can be two things

258
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:06,659
very simple at all time there's what we expect there is this

259
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:13,820
glass and I know that I'm knowing this glass

260
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:20,100
and just in the time that I told you that I wasn't really thinking of the glass

261
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:26,700
the glass looks like it's here right but there is all this there's all this shifting and changing at every moment

262
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:32,400
with this glass there's the glass there's I could bring

263
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:38,340
it up and have water I call it a glass

264
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:46,159
but we could put flowers in it and then it's something else

265
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:54,539
so it's a convention that I'm overlaying on it so I can be very rigid this is my

266
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:59,820
glass nobody use my glass for flowers

267
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:07,620
that's rude or just know that this is shifting

268
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:14,279
and I'm thinking about the glass but I'm also thinking about you I'm also thinking about what I'm going to say I'm

269
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:19,380
also thinking wondering if you're getting me all this stuff is going on there's all

270
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:26,299
this shifting and moving happening in just this class

271
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:34,500
and when I enter into the world of just what I know and what's being known

272
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:41,220
the sensory experience is completely changing

273
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:46,740
and so is my internal experience my knowing of it is also shifting and

274
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:53,159
changing so there's this constant movement of arising and passing

275
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:58,620
a rising and passing it's not constant

276
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:04,860
and that's very very relaxing for those things that are not easy to change

277
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:09,899
in US that really softens things up

278
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:15,380
because it gets really hard in there sometimes

279
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:23,880
in that heart mind were really locked no this is

280
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:29,460
not true this is how this is you don't know but this is how this is

281
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:35,880
but is it so what I'm talking about uh is the

282
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:41,220
beginning is what's referred to in the tradition is the beginning of ipasana

283
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:47,940
beginning of insight when we are in that flowing world when

284
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:54,179
we are beginning to sense and know and see and feel and

285
00:30:54,179 --> 00:31:01,919
touch and experience and look kindly at how much flux and flow is happening

286
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:08,640
then we have insight vipasana the V they tell me means you're

287
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:15,620
really seeing you're really seeing we're really seeing through

288
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:21,960
and it's very nice to really see through in this world to to connect deeply to

289
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:27,659
this world to connect deeply to the people around us

290
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:34,740
and equally important maybe as much to connect to ourselves really

291
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:40,380
deeply to really find ourselves where

292
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:47,580
there's a rub where there's a stuckness where there's a repetition that just

293
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:54,600
won't stop that keeps holding me back it's really nice to find

294
00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:01,080
that oh oh that's that's that and then to be kind toward that

295
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:09,120
to care for that to let it be nourished by the calm

296
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:15,779
that's available there's a lot more benevolence here than we usually

297
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:23,100
Avail ourselves of and so we open up broadly to this

298
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:27,440
goodness we can

299
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:34,380
and then it's a new world it's the same world it's this world

300
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:40,500
but it's very very broad it's very very full

301
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:46,940
it's very very free of the concepts that I've overlaid

302
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,760
today being Mother's Day I was reflecting about

303
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:59,340
being with my mother a couple of weeks ago and

304
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:06,539
and it was just kind of amazing how I can be with her now because

305
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:12,779
I can see this person my mother

306
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:17,940
but I can also let her be a person

307
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:25,860
let her be her whatever she whatever she is and that's just an amazing reality to me

308
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:32,220
now my mom and I like many mothers are you know have a very have had a very

309
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:37,980
difficult past I'm a queer man and um

310
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:44,460
she's a Latin American woman um very Patrician upbringing very

311
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:50,399
patriarchal upbringing I grew up in a Latin country and

312
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:56,460
so The Stance was no you're gay no

313
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:03,179
we're going to beat that out of you so my uncles tried to beat it out of me

314
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:08,638
um and then my mom just refused to accept me and

315
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:15,358
um I had a stepfather who also was kind of pushing me out of the house so I kind of

316
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:21,540
left the house pretty early and led a semi-homeless life at a very young age

317
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:27,658
because that's just how it was for everybody it was a different era the

318
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:34,200
country was in a different place the world was in a different place around the issues of being gay being queer yeah

319
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:41,220
that identity was really not what it is today and so for years I would just hang up on

320
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:46,980
my mom because then when we started to talk again she would ask every time was when are you going to get married when

321
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:54,118
are you going to get married when are you going to get married so just have to hang up like for like 10 years like I would just

322
00:34:54,119 --> 00:35:00,300
hang up I would keep calling her because she's my mother I'm Latin so we

323
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:07,020
come from a big Latin family but I was not connected to when I was a teenager because we didn't have all these nice

324
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:14,400
apps but I'm very connected to because they raised me so this is all of this has happened so

325
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,500
there's been eons of forgiveness and moving through

326
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:26,720
and letting go of views and anger and resentment

327
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:32,640
so it's a long process having insight into what is

328
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:38,940
but it's a magical thing really I was with this woman I was telling Gil about

329
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:46,220
this I made a joke I don't know if Gill liked it but I said Gil I think I'm in our heart

330
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:53,460
he did not laugh we take the term our heart which is an

331
00:35:53,460 --> 00:36:00,960
awakened being in our tradition kind of seriously but then I said to him you know how they say Gil that that when you

332
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:08,480
are when you think you're really enlightened to go spend a weekend with your parents

333
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:14,300
so Gil I just did that I just spent three days in my mother's house

334
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:21,780
staying in her house which I didn't stay in for 20 years

335
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:28,740
I was in her house and um we had a great time

336
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:36,359
because now um I see what is arises in me I am

337
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:42,000
responsible for what arises in me the young Francisco that comes up around my

338
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:49,200
mother when she talks that way that's in me but it's my ability now to view this

339
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:55,260
to see that this is coming this old Francisco this young Francisco's are

340
00:36:55,260 --> 00:37:01,079
coming up they're coming up and I can see them I can see them and I can kindly

341
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:06,180
see them and they settle it settles and this is

342
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:11,339
my internal work and then I let my mom be herself

343
00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:18,240
she does things and and she's not my mom only she's also

344
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:26,280
just a person that was getting old now and I can have compassion for my mom in

345
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:32,880
a way that I never thought I could and we relate in a way that I never thought was ever going to happen in this

346
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:39,599
lifetime and that's a beautiful thing In This Very life to be healed with my

347
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:45,480
mother after a pretty checkered past and uh my

348
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:51,780
checkered past our difficult times are no different than anybody else's that's

349
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:57,060
another one of the great liberating insights um that

350
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:03,480
pain that I had with my mom the difficulty being semi-homeless as a teenager for four years

351
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:10,740
that's my story and it's you have your story you have and it's relative mine is

352
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:16,020
not worse than yours I came to this Insight again another view

353
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:23,099
via physical pain I had an accident and then a rare degenerative disease and

354
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:29,040
then a big reconstruction of my spine and then I was rendered disabled like didn't walk

355
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:36,060
for four years and with severe symptoms that I still manage but you can see that I hide them

356
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:42,359
pretty well or I manage them pretty well and then I realized one day I thought

357
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:49,619
this is so terrible I I was a young person when it happened and I was homebound I lost I couldn't work

358
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:54,960
and um so for a long time I pitied myself

359
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:00,660
and it was a big change when I realized oh

360
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:08,640
I remember now when a cold was a big deal so I realized pain is relative

361
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:15,780
so everybody else's pain is that is like their pain and it's serious to their

362
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:22,260
relative experience it's Unique to them mine is not worse than anybody else's

363
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:27,660
that Insight was very helpful because then I just was a lot more

364
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:34,920
relaxed and accepting and at ease with a very difficult reality that's taken a lot of

365
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:40,740
care and attention and medical care to handle

366
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:47,820
but views are very liberating that the right to view the purified view

367
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:53,640
can be very very liberating so

368
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:59,640
now I don't want you to manufacture anything I talked about emotions a lot so that

369
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:07,140
you could see that that that you already those of you who know mindfulness of emotions already

370
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:14,339
know what I'm talking about hopefully and if not maybe our previous if you're

371
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:21,960
new to the practice you can see through you can ex you maybe had an experience in our meditation of being with

372
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:29,280
something and letting it move caring for it being kind toward being present being

373
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,339
at ease with it giving it space and attention

374
00:40:34,339 --> 00:40:40,859
letting it Move Along everything is kind of in this flux

375
00:40:40,859 --> 00:40:47,400
so if anything I could invite you to maybe consider your relationship to the

376
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:56,040
present moment to how things are how things come and go

377
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:04,560
and um and enter the present moment

378
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:11,940
with into as much fullness as is available that's what can come by

379
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:18,720
paying attention to your relationship to how to do one thing at a time

380
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:24,140
what is your relationship to just doing one thing at a time

381
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:29,480
what unveils itself

382
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:34,160
there's much that can be unveiled

383
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:43,500
so happy Mother's Day to all the mothers happy Mother's Day to everyone's mother

384
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:51,420
and may you go in peace I have a great day maybe enjoy a good

385
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:58,859
lunch mindfully taking your time with the food

386
00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:05,220
even there automatic patterns can be seen and not

387
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:12,960
be automatic maybe just going a little bit slower with somebody you can be with them there

388
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:19,500
even more than usual lunchtime is going to come up

389
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:28,200
and I was told that gill has been giving questions to at the end of talks to see

390
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:33,240
if people wanted to have like a little in-person breakout group

391
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:40,500
uh outside and uh so what I what did I say

392
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,099
okay

393
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:50,960
so that's not where it is oh yeah that's where it is

394
00:42:53,339 --> 00:42:58,560
so what does it mean to do one thing at a time to you

395
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:03,780
or what could it mean to do one thing at a time to you

396
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:09,359
so I think that if you choose to go out in outside in the courtyard and

397
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:15,119
mingle a little bit and if you want to have a Dharma discussion what does it

398
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:22,079
mean to just settle on one thing at a time to you

399
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:25,819
thank you so much for your attention
