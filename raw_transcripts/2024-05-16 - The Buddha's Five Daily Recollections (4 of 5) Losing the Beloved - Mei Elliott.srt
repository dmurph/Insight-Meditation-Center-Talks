1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,960
so uh welcome good morning good afternoon good evening wherever you

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,639
are uh my name is May Elliot and here we are discussing the fourth of the

3
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:19,560
Buddha's five daily Recollections and this uh this one today

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:26,800
is a really difficult one uh the most difficult for many um and it goes like

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:33,480
this I must be parted and separated from everyone and everything dear and

6
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:40,200
agreeable to me uh and as with previous days I'll

7
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,559
remind you to gauge your sense of well-being and resiliency this morning

8
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:51,079
and proceed with caution I if you're feeling well resourced today this

9
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:57,440
session might be really powerful for you and if not just take care with what feels

10
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,879
right so uh as with each day so far uh we'll practice with this phrase in two

11
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:09,600
ways during the meditation uh so after sitting quietly for a while um we'll

12
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,920
just drop the phrase into the Mind allowing it to Ripple through um without

13
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:22,240
any sort of intentional engagement just seeing what naturally arises and then after that I'll offer

14
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,400
some questions so you can actively contemplate the the phrase using thinking yes thinking during a

15
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:35,920
meditation um but keep a short leash on it so the mind doesn't get discursive so that's a little overview

16
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:42,680
of what you can expect for today um so let's get started with our

17
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,560
meditation so go ahead and find find a posture that's supportive for you this

18
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,920
morning find something that's comfortable this is given uh how these

19
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:03,799
phrases are challenging um something that feels um like it allows the body to be relaxed

20
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:12,280
and at ease beginning to

21
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:26,959
settle letting go of past thoughts and future thoughts inviting the mind to

22
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:33,289
come into the body into the ne [Music]

23
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,680
beginning with a few deep breaths if that's helpful for

24
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,680
you and allowing yourself to land

25
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:13,040
connecting with your anchor the

26
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,560
breath the soundscape global sense of the body

27
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:26,480
sitting whatever the anchor is for you that helps you stay here that gives you a grounding point that you can come back

28
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,760
to when the mind wanders

29
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,799
be this anchor it's something that's either neutral or even slightly

30
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:48,159
Pleasant can be um can be challenging for the

31
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:54,920
mind uh and cause the mind to become weary if our anchor is

32
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:03,840
unpleasant go ahead and take some time now to

33
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:12,040
settle to

34
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,000
rest and to unify the mind with the

35
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720
body

e e

52
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,959
before beginning our phrases together can be helpful to warm up the

53
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:21,880
heart bring a Little Tenderness you might consider an image

54
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,880
of yourself as a child

55
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,909
or just the general sense of a younger [Music]

56
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,720
you bringing this to

57
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:50,440
mind thinking of some of the positive qualities of this

58
00:13:51,560 --> 00:14:01,040
being of this little kid maybe innocent or loving

59
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,360
friendly

60
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:30,800
playful and as you do this attending to the sensations that the heart

61
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,959
center and noticing any emotions that might

62
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:41,880
arise and that might be enough to warm up the heart just a bit if so you can

63
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:47,320
rest in that [Music] feeling if not you might offer some

64
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:55,839
phrases of [Music] kindness may you be happy dear one

65
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:10,600
may you be [Music] healthy may be

66
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,240
safe maybe at ease

67
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:53,920
just bringing in a little softness here

68
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:15,720
and letting go of the meta and shifting now to our freees so

69
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:22,000
I'll offer you this fourth recollection and when I say it all to

70
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,399
drop into your meditation just Ripple through not trying to make anything

71
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:37,639
happen just seeing what naturally arises in the mind and the heart and being mindful of

72
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:49,319
that breathing in with compassion I gently remember that I'll

73
00:16:49,319 --> 00:16:56,360
be parted from everyone and everything I old dear

74
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:20,520
maybe thoughts or emotions arise or maybe thing arises any response is

75
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:29,320
fine breathing in with compassion I gently remember that I'll be parted from

76
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:35,000
everyone and everything I all of dear

77
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:09,559
practicing with this now on your own of your own

78
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:16,039
Rhythm and at any point you can return to your anchor letting go of the

79
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,760
recollection e

80
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:07,360
we can care to hold whatever you find gentleness and

81
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:17,279
kindness if it ends up feeling like too much just letting go of the

82
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:25,520
phrases you want to avoid weaponizing this practice only doing it when the mind has

83
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,799
enough bandwidth to hold it

84
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:54,360
maybe letting go of the recollection coming back to your inor and

85
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,360
again resting

86
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:11,120
there's more residual emotion Sensations in the body or

87
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,559
thoughts making room for them taking good care of

88
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,640
them e

89
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:30,600
shift now to our engaged contemplation so offer the phrase

90
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:37,440
again and then I'll I'll also share some questions so for this part you can allow

91
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:45,240
yourself to contemplate to think about how you might reply to these

92
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:52,400
questions making sure that the thinking is staying close to the question so that

93
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,760
uh you don't end up on an entirely different topic so we're keeping keeping

94
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,720
an eye on having the discursive mind get out of

95
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:16,200
hand the praise again I must be parted and separated from everyone and

96
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,840
everything dear and agreeable to

97
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:28,320
me how deeply do you know this do you know it conceptually only or

98
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,480
do you you know it in your

99
00:22:53,679 --> 00:23:00,440
core you remember this when you interact with your loved ones

100
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:20,679
what would it be like if you had this in mind when you engaged with those around

101
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:31,480
you how might it impact those relationships e

102
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:07,880
does it change what you choose to say or how you choose to say

103
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:34,440
it does it change your actions what you choose to do and how you do

104
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:01,520
it does it even change how you think about

105
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:25,559
people in this way perhaps changing all actions of body speech and mind

106
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:47,600
what reactions come up for you when you realize you must be parted from everyone

107
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,720
and everything you love

108
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:15,200
here grief acceptance numbness all natural

109
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:29,039
responses recognizing and accepting anything that arises

110
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:34,480
allowing the mind to be wide with lots of

111
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:42,600
space lots of space to hold whatever it comes up

112
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,880
letting go of the

113
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,960
contemplation resting in the wide spacious

114
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:27,159
mind resting and loving [Music]

115
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:31,159
awareness e

116
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,039
being kindness to

117
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:18,600
ourselves just as all beings wish to be happy I too wish to be happy

118
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:45,279
be happy healthy safe and at ease

119
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:16,000
be be happy may they be

120
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,919
healthy may they be safe may they be at ease

121
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,039
welcome back

122
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:09,600
so for those of you just arriving my name is May Elliot and today we are

123
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:18,159
focusing on the four of the Buddha's five Daily Reflections bu's five daily

124
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:25,880
Recollections and for many this is the hardest I must be parted and separated

125
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:32,919
from everyone and everything dear and agreeable to me this is the

126
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:39,320
pH so in the uh the Tibetan tradition the great lay teacher and householder

127
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:45,720
marpa who was in the lineage of naropa he experienced the tragedy of

128
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:51,399
having his son die and one day Maro was out in his

129
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:57,480
Fields weeping and his students surprised to see that their teacher was so upset

130
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:02,720
confront them and they said Master why are you crying you know

131
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:08,840
you teach us that it's all an illusion including death so why are you

132
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:15,360
crying and Mara replied yes it's all an illusion and the

133
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:22,240
death of one's child is the saddest illusion of them all and so I

134
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:31,080
cry so even for the highly realized or the steadiest of practitioners there's

135
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:37,320
no denying the grief that can come forth from confronting the loss of a loved

136
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:42,600
one when the Buddha's two foremost disciples died the Buddha said it was

137
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:49,679
like having the sun and the moon going out at once these two Bright Lights

138
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,760
dropping from the

139
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:02,159
sky there was a a time for me as my my practice

140
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:09,159
deepened where I was grieving the loss of my loved ones but what was odd was

141
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:17,200
that the loved ones hadn't died and not only that they weren't even sick or particularly old so that is having this

142
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,679
kind of mysterious and unprompted sense of loss uh despite the fact that no one

143
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:29,200
was lost yet and so I started calling this emotion pre grief and I thought

144
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:36,840
something might be wrong or I needed to figure out how to get it to stop and then I came across uh these

145
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:43,519
five daily Recollections and this one specifically the fourth one specifically I must be parted and separated from

146
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:49,720
everyone and everything dear and agreeable to me and I began to realize

147
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:55,120
that my pre-brief was actually a textbook example of how the fourth

148
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:02,720
recollection functions and how it can unfold B for us as we come to to as we come to terms

149
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,760
with the rules of the game that we all die even our beloveds as we realize how

150
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:14,720
samsara functions uh this this sense of grief is really a natural

151
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,799
response and as I got to know this practice I began to realize that my preg

152
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:27,559
grief actually wasn't a problem at all um on the contrary it was a healthy purification of the mind and heart even

153
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:32,679
though my dear ones were healthy alive and present that wouldn't always be the

154
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:38,880
case so it was my system coming to terms with the way things are and this uh this

155
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,039
loss is the truth of things and my mind needed to grieve through these losses

156
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:50,559
before it could make peace with them I share this so you know that these

157
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:56,159
phrases can bring forth a lot of strong feelings and uh you can think of it like

158
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:01,720
a purification it's the purification practice if you put a dirty towel in the

159
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:07,080
wash ultimately it'll clean the towel but in the process a lot of dirt comes

160
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:14,560
out in the water so as we begin to wash the mind with this practice though It ultimately cleans the mind it purifies

161
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:20,200
the mind and heart um it brings it to a place of of Greater Clarity and freedom

162
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:26,200
in the process a lot of dirt comes out in the wash and that dirt might be grief

163
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:32,200
or anger or other challenges emotions so we need to be prepared to meet these

164
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:39,358
feelings um they should be seen they should be known intended to so if

165
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:46,480
difficult emotions come up in this practice can we give them the kind and loving attention that they're asking for

166
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:52,158
tenderness patience companionship and let the feelings move

167
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:58,200
through you don't block them don't stop them but maybe you don't have to take

168
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:04,599
them so personally either rather If you experience say

169
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:10,520
grief uh know that this is the great grief handed down through the

170
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:17,280
generations of beings moving through all of these lives not personal showing up

171
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:23,480
now in this body asking for our loving attention here in this body we're

172
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:29,440
receiving the inheritance of fear of Anger of of all the beings that came

173
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:35,720
before and you hold the power to meet that inheritance with the love and

174
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:43,480
attention it has been asking for since time IM Memorial what a task like can we meet

175
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:48,520
our emotions in this way can we meet these um these

176
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:56,359
feels um with that sense of purpose that sense of care

177
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:04,880
now of course we we don't do this practice just so that we can feel difficult emotions ultimately we do this

178
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:10,040
practice because it leads to Greater freedom and

179
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:16,040
happiness and by reflecting on this recollection it it can invite more

180
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:21,359
patience a reduction in irritation easier access to

181
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:27,680
forgiveness when we don't remember that we'll lose everything we love it's really easy to become trivial with

182
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:37,240
people you we get wrapped up in our problems uh and we forget the great matter of birth and death Suzuki roshi

183
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:45,160
founder of San Francisco's Z Center uh would sometimes say sometimes I think that you think

184
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:50,240
that your problems are more important than being

185
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:56,200
alone you think that your problems are more important than being

186
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:06,799
alone so this reflection on loss we're putting things into perspective perhaps just being alive is

187
00:37:08,319 --> 00:37:13,800
a and this remembrance doesn't just purify the mind leading to more freedom

188
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,920
it also shapes our actions how do we act with the ones we

189
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:24,920
love someone asked the Insight teacher James far is what can I do about my fear

190
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:31,760
of having my son die and James responded tell him how much you love him

191
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:40,319
every single day and that's a significant action enough to change a son's life

192
00:37:40,319 --> 00:37:45,599
what if every child had someone tell them they're loved every day maybe

193
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,319
that's an action that can change the whole

194
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:56,119
world Stephen jenkinson a teacher who works with people who are dying and

195
00:37:56,119 --> 00:38:01,520
their families would say you can't really love something until we

196
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:06,720
love its ending too we can't really love something until

197
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:12,359
we love its ending too and what this points to for me is to our

198
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:17,400
attachments uh to the things we love it is our attachment to the things we love

199
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:24,359
and we might love something or someone but we don't love its ending because we're attached so one way that this fourth

200
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:29,440
recollection functions is to weaken and overcome

201
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:36,280
attachment and it may be worth remembering that this fourth phrase isn't only about losing our loved ones

202
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:42,240
but it's about losing anything that is dear to us not just our possessions but

203
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:48,040
say even our senses someday we'll need to say goodbye to seeing hearing

204
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:56,599
smelling touching tasting what would it be like to say a tender goodbye to each one so this this

205
00:38:56,599 --> 00:39:02,960
recollection invites us to awaken or excuse me to weaken attachment to our

206
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:08,599
favorite music our most relished Foods the sights of sunsets and all the

207
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:15,400
beautiful things we're not rejecting these things um but

208
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:21,079
we're we're seeing that we won't have them forever so there's something that

209
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:26,400
can awaken us to them while simultaneously weakening the attachment

210
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:32,880
to them and fundamentally these Recollections are engaging with the second Noble Truth

211
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:39,319
the source of suffering is craving when we cling we suffer so these

212
00:39:39,319 --> 00:39:45,839
Recollections are functioning to loosen our grip as we learn the art of Awakening we

213
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:50,880
have insight into the true nature of things we see how our clinging leads to

214
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,960
suffering we see the selfless nature of phenomena and we see that all things are

215
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:01,359
impermanent and this last insight into the impermanent nature of things it's

216
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:09,760
really Awakening to loss I had a friend who said her entire Buddhist practice was a grief practice because everything

217
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:16,560
at one point or another will go uh as Joseph Goldstein says loss is

218
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:24,000
just another word for change uh if if we're grasping a rope

219
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,160
tightly and it's being through pulled through our hands what happens we get

220
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:34,880
rope burn so as all things slip through our fingers we can either grip them as

221
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:40,760
tight as we can and get rope burn or we can learn to let

222
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:45,839
go and Our intention with this it isn't to try to get rid of our attachment that

223
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:51,520
just ends up being attachment to being unattached so instead we hold our

224
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:57,520
attention or we hold our attachment uh gently with open hands with great care

225
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:05,280
and respect and let it soften in its own time so I'll I'll close with this uh

226
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:11,838
with a some quotes from Francis Weller who's a master of working with

227
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:18,880
grief this life we have is incredibly short but we've been blessed with

228
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:27,000
it when we shut off our grief you forget that to let grief work its Alchemy on

229
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,920
you yields gravitas by which I mean the ability to be present with a Bittersweet

230
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:39,560
reality of Life which always includes loss the work of the mature person is to

231
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:47,800
carry grief in one hand and gratitude in the other and to be stretched large by

232
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:58,880
them so may you have the courage to carry grief in one hand and gratitude in

233
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:06,480
the other such that you are stretched large by them as you go about your day today I

234
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,040
hope you can experience the preciousness of all the other beings that you

235
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:17,160
encounter the preciousness of encountering everything you love and so

236
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:24,319
you can stay close to that feeling and as always please be gentle with yourselves today thank you so much

237
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:30,520
everyone great to be with you have a good day
