167
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:27,539
hold witness to each other really this is a Sandbox to to practice kindness to

168
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:32,580
practice kindness in small community and be inspired

169
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:39,799
so so I'm going to create the um breakout rooms

170
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:46,380
and again confidentiality is always important whatever you say here stays

171
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:54,960
here please and I've created the rooms let's go alphabetically first name okay the rooms

172
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:01,460
are created and I'm gonna open them now here we go

173
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:19,679
okay welcome back everyone welcome back um I see many smiles which is always

174
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:26,100
nice to see Smiles coming back from the rooms from the breakout groups and and

175
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:33,179
we have time before any Reflections you like to share for the benefit of yourself and when I say yourself in the

176
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:40,080
way of being witnessed sometimes actually when we share an aha or a question it's it supports us and also

177
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:46,380
for the for the benefit of the community because if some question has come up for you or an aha moment actually can can

178
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:52,019
help others so and you can type it in chat uh either privately to me if you

179
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:57,720
have an observation reflection or to everyone and and you can raise your Zoom

180
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:03,299
hand um especially if you haven't shared [Music] um

181
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:09,200
in the community for a while I would love to invite you to pull forward

182
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,980
love to hear from you

183
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:27,960
yeah man am I saying your name right it's Yaman Yemen great

184
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:34,020
um thank you for the practice I felt very present and calm I had a question

185
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:39,300
for you you mentioned attachment and I was just thinking about how you can

186
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:46,378
practice uh kindness and compassion and not be too attached

187
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:53,398
yeah yeah yeah exactly so so so the the practice

188
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:58,500
um basically I'll start with what I meant in the guided meditation when I

189
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:03,599
was suggesting you know these wishes that we share may you be well may you be

190
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:10,320
happy maybe healthy and may I be you know all these wishes so I'm like okay I've been wishing you well are you well

191
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:16,140
yet like you're calling your friend okay I've been sending you meta are you happy now it's like there's sense of oh I have

192
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:21,839
the power or or I'm wishing my what myself well I really want to be happy I

193
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:28,619
really am so unhappy I want to be just like ouch it just it's not really a generous way of offering kindness It's

194
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:34,020
it's offering kindness with conditions or or sometimes also with other peels

195
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:39,900
like may you be well if you're gonna be nice to me you're gonna you know you're wishing someone well is conditional

196
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:45,599
kindness right so so without attachment to outcome it's

197
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:52,260
just the generosity of art it's the sense of generosity of I wish you well you know you might be suffering right

198
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:57,720
now I know that and and yet I wish you well I wish you well I it's it's about

199
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:03,540
my heart it's not so much about the conditions of the world and it's not that I want to control it and you wish

200
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:10,980
yourself well with it like a really really or clinging around it but it it's again

201
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:16,940
it's a difference between expectation and aspiration

202
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:23,700
expectation is when you say you are kind with an expectation of outcome it

203
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:30,300
expectation for return expect whereas there's an aspiration you're just as there's a sense of uplift that you're

204
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:36,019
sharing generosity or Spirit does that make sense

205
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:44,220
yes yes thank you you're welcome thank you for the question Yaman now I'm saying your

206
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:51,660
name right thanks for that question great one anyone else any other questions or

207
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:58,260
Reflections what came up for you my practice report is that I was having

208
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:03,839
a great time I was having a really fun time wishing well for my dear being and

209
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:09,720
and for both of us and just very joyous it's it's nice to have fun with this practice

210
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:16,980
can be very happy making hence happy hour do you feel happier now that before you

211
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:22,920
joined yes can I see it now or no shake or not yes yes I see more than I haven't

212
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:28,020
seen any shakes yet but then again I always say very few of you

213
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:35,540
any other reflections like to share before we close

214
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:54,359
kneel so

215
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:59,880
sometimes I find it difficult to give method to people who I think are

216
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:06,300
like really well off I'm like well they don't need this

217
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:11,640
um right and and it you know I guess it seems silly to me right because of

218
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:18,300
course they do right and second well it's really more about me than them

219
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:25,740
um that said you know this has been like a consistent you know sort of feeling

220
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:33,000
so so I'm yeah what advice do you have for me yeah yeah

221
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:39,060
I love it I love the question I love the curveball Neil it's awesome because like

222
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:44,160
the curvy part of it is is your own wisdom like yeah I know they

223
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:51,079
need it um and it's for the benefit of my heart and yet and yet so so let's explore that

224
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:58,020
so so let's explore um the you know they don't need it

225
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:03,060
okay so let's explore that they don't need it and then the wisdom comes back

226
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:08,880
and says well they really do so so can you share a little more about how that

227
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:14,880
is you know maybe it's up in the head not in the heart flesh that out for me a little bit if

228
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:19,760
it's okay to be on the spot for a moment with this exploration

229
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:29,460
because it's really bad because it's that that's the Crux of it go ahead well you know people you know I have a friend

230
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:36,780
he seems pretty happy pretty much all the time like wishing I'm happy you know uh right

231
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:42,420
I I you know I'm friends with him for decades I'm not sure what would be different occasionally he's stressed

232
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:47,460
right I you know then I understand you know may you not be stressed right but

233
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:53,700
that's it but that's it but that's it stress is dukkha everybody has dukkha is

234
00:39:53,700 --> 00:40:00,060
the is translated as stress it's not just these huge sufferings and calamities I realized but stress daily

235
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:05,280
stress but just the daily stress of the body aging and having aches and pains

236
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:11,700
you have to take care of it and all of this is stress you have to wake up in the morning make sure you go to sleep like these are Thai these are stresses

237
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:18,839
of life that all of us have so so he had and then but

238
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:25,619
then you're sharing that he actually has some stressful times and yet really for so for this friend uh he was always

239
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:31,200
happy um it then it's clearly for your own heart if you if you wish happiness for

240
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:37,380
someone who's already happy then it becomes mudita practice then it becomes a joy you're happy that they're happy

241
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:42,720
and your happiness increases hmm
