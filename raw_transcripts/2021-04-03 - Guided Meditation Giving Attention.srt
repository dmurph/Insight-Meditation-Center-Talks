1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:11,519
so uh warm greetings to everyone and uh feels feels wonderful that

2
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,880
we're gathering here for our meditation together and

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,160
just saw a message from

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,600
i think one of our members is having heart surgery today and uh jay so we wish jay well

5
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:45,840
and hope that it all goes well and um

6
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,839
so we sit here

7
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,960
holding all of ourselves everyone in our hearts including those going to surgery and having challenges

8
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,439
today of all kinds and

9
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,760
perhaps it's a

10
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,119
this final step of mindfulness of breathing

11
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,159
is very closely associated with generosity and i'll talk more about it during the

12
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,159
talk but the

13
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:37,600
when we remove an obstruction for someone like say we open a door someone who

14
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,280
can't do it themselves and remove that obstruction just that opening a door

15
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:50,720
is an act of generosity if someone has a splinter in their foot and they can't

16
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,759
get it out themselves it's an act of generosity to get some tweezers and

17
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:04,479
and remove the splinter and so the removal the letting go

18
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:10,319
the stepping away from those movements of the mind which don't

19
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,520
serve us can be seen as an act of generosity

20
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:22,640
not as a indication that aversion or pushing things away or

21
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:30,000
or or some negative thing about anything in a sense

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,680
but rather it's just such a healthy thing to remove the splinters of our life

23
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,480
to move the ways that we um you know harm ourselves and we have a

24
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,319
clearer sense of that harm even the subtlest forms the more

25
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:57,440
settled and peaceful we become in meditation the more meditation feels a place of

26
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,840
freedom and love and peace

27
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:13,360
integrity wholeness the more quiet and still the thinking mind becomes

28
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:23,680
the more um we recognize movements of generosity

29
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:30,319
we move we recognize the splinters that we can take out and letting go of thoughts doesn't so

30
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:38,080
much come from aversion but comes from of course let me help out here let me let go of

31
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:44,239
these thoughts these ideas when we get contracted or caught in

32
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,519
desires and aversions of course here it's a generous thing to

33
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,879
do it's not doesn't have to be done with the obligation to let go it doesn't have

34
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:00,560
to be done with hostility towards what we're letting go of

35
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,560
any more than opening the door are we hostile to the door or pulling out a splinter we're hostile to

36
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,000
the splinter rather it's a act of generosity

37
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,280
so to sit today maybe with a spirit of generosity

38
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:27,600
and so to begin with a posture posture itself the care we put into our

39
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,360
posture maybe rocking around swaying a little bit making small adjustments

40
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,880
can be seen as the beginning of meditative

41
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,320
generosity as we give attention

42
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:57,840
to our body to ourselves

43
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,400
and we might take a few long slow deep

44
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:17,199
breaths and as we settle in maybe even it's a giving in

45
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:24,080
a generosity of letting go of tension and

46
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:30,320
letting ourselves give ourselves the goodness of being

47
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:39,840
stable and settled here

48
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:53,280
and with a feeling of generosity of care of goodwill towards oneself

49
00:05:53,280 --> 00:06:01,440
tenderly maybe as you exhale relax the body

50
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,840
perhaps softening in the belly

51
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:19,759
perhaps softening and relaxing the belly with a reminder to the belly

52
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:35,840
it's okay

53
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:44,000
as you exhale relaxing in the heart a generous feeling even if the heart

54
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,240
aches or is challenged in some way to hold it

55
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:58,160
with a generosity good will compassion and allowing the chest and

56
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,840
the heart to settle and relax

57
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:13,039
relaxing the shoulders maybe even moving the hands a little bit

58
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:30,960
if it frees up the shoulders and the elbows a little bit

59
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:37,360
and as an act of generosity to your face which has muscles which are in working

60
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:44,000
for us and all day long one way or the other those

61
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:52,000
muscle little muscles are expressing themselves and generously

62
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:00,080
give those muscles a chance to rest thank you for your service and now

63
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:12,000
you can rest relaxing the face

64
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,520
then offering your attention to the

65
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
breathing

66
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:43,919
as if attention is a gift a precious gift that's worth giving

67
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,320
giving over to the breathing

68
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:55,040
as if the body breathing

69
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:09,839
loves the gift of attention

70
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,519
and if you notice you notice yourself thinking caught up caught up in thought lost in

71
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:25,440
thought see it as an occasion to be generous

72
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:36,560
to give up your thinking to let it go

73
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,720
so that you can return to a way of being that's more intimate more

74
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:49,360
connected here and now a way of being present

75
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,440
that is more satisfying than being lost to caught up in thoughts

76
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:05,839
generously returning yourself to yourself

77
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:12,399
in the letting go of thoughts opening the doors of the heart and the mind

78
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,680
pulling out the splinters in the heart

79
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:34,720
so as we sit here today if it can help you become quieter and

80
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,839
more focused more present

81
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:50,240
you might practice giving away your thoughts giving up

82
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:56,640
letting go releasing

83
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:06,480
relinquishing all as movements of generosity

84
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:18,959
generosity perhaps associated with a deep quiet place

85
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:29,839
inside of you

86
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,919
let go of your thinking generously

87
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,320
in that in letting go of them you can [Music] return

88
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:59,679
to some intimacy and peace some sense of stillness here

89
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:05,840
that's better than being lost in thought

90
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:19,840
giving yourself the gift of that better

91
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,840
so

92
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,840
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

93
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:16,480
if it is in fact a form of generosity to

94
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:25,279
give yourself the chance to settle in come to a place here in meditation that

95
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:35,840
clearly feels like it's for your own welfare and well-being

96
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,720
then i also might consider that this generosity towards yourself

97
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:49,440
can simultaneously be a generosity for the world

98
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:55,279
that somehow settling in in such a way the best qualities of

99
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:03,840
who you are come to the forefront or are not eclipsed

100
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,919
then the world can also benefit from these good qualities of yours

101
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:22,720
beginning perhaps with generosity being generous to the world around you

102
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:30,640
not necessarily generous with things but generous with your attention your

103
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,960
heart generously letting go of the

104
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:45,840
obstructions inside of you from having a clean presence with others

105
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:59,840
to offer them the best of who you are

106
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:08,880
and if we offer the best of who we are then we benefit others while we benefit

107
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:15,760
ourselves we are benefiting ourselves where we benefit others

108
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:23,440
when we give the best that we have coming from in a good way

109
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:29,120
then we benefit as well we better benefit further

110
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:35,039
at the end of a meditation session or a buddhist event there's dedication of

111
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:42,640
merit and it's understood that if you give away your merit

112
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,360
you produce much more merit for yourself

113
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:56,880
if you can in a clean appropriate way offer

114
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:03,919
the best of yourself to others the best in you can grow

115
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:13,600
may it be that any of the benefits that we receive through this meditation today

116
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:22,240
that we remove the obstructions from letting that be shared with the world around us

117
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,640
may all beings be happy

118
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:33,279
may all beings be safe

119
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:41,360
may all beings be peaceful and may all beings

120
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:51,840
everywhere be free

121
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,039
you
