1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:09,960
hello everyone welcome if you are just arriving

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:16,859
it's great to have you here again my name is May it's fine to stand and stretch for a

3
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:22,859
moment if you'd like um I'll be

4
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:28,160
sharing a little bit about the Dharma with you now

5
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:34,759
so go ahead and find a comfortable spot

6
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:57,539
all right welcome everyone again my name is May so great to have you here

7
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:03,120
um I used to spend a lot of time

8
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,000
backpacking and during these trips we'd go

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,200
for many weeks out into the wilderness and during this time a lot of energy was

10
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:23,100
put into navigation because of course no one wants to get lost in the woods

11
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:30,240
and I was thinking about this because I came across an article recently and this

12
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,700
article discussed the various human responses to getting lost in the

13
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,799
wilderness and there's a there's a study done in

14
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,200
Nova Scotia tracking 800 cases of people who got

15
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,240
seriously lost in the woods apparently Nova Scotia is like the place people go

16
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,579
and get lost so um uh so

17
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:03,320
what they noticed in this study is that everyone who gets seriously lost

18
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:11,940
shares one primary behavioral characteristic they all have an unbearable desire to

19
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:19,400
keep moving to try to find their way back they can't stop

20
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,980
of the 800 people 798.

21
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:32,099
kept moving that impulse was so strong

22
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:37,140
so the problem is it's a lot harder for search and rescue

23
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:44,220
parties to find someone if they're always on the move right so

24
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:49,980
here's what really stood out to me in almost all cases

25
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:56,660
the people who are found are the ones who sit still

26
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:03,480
and this is exactly why the practice of

27
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,599
meditation is so extraordinary

28
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:15,720
in the midst of our busy lives where we might feel quite lost

29
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:21,540
amongst suffering or confusion despair grief

30
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:30,000
Etc that there's this practice where we can sit down and be still

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,340
where we can be found and one of the incredible impacts of

32
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:41,640
meditation is that we can begin to get in touch with our own inner compass

33
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:49,379
and this Compass can help us find our way help our find Our Help us find our way from dukkha from suffering to

34
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:55,500
Freedom and the the inner compass that we attune

35
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:01,799
to is Our intention so we start to become mindful of our intentions

36
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:08,879
connecting with wholesome intentions so intentions that are generous or kind or

37
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:14,659
compassionate and these lead towards greater freedom

38
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:19,799
we start to notice unwholesome intentions intentions that are based in

39
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:27,120
greed or hatred or delusion confusion and we see the ways that these lead

40
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,220
towards past that are not so wholesome where we are less happy if we're acting

41
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,440
on those impulses and so when we act with wholesome

42
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,660
intentions it's as though we've found a working compass that can guide us to our

43
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:48,780
true home that can guide us to a a happy life

44
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:55,860
so tonight that's what I will be speaking about I will be speaking about intention and specifically I'll be

45
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:03,780
talking about intention from the Eightfold Eightfold Path right in tension or Sama sankapa and that focuses

46
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:09,300
on three things which I'll get into shortly but first just want to spend a little bit more

47
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:15,240
time kind of defining intention or identifying intention so you're really

48
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:21,419
clear about it in your own experience so put simply intentions are our

49
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:27,419
motivations our reason for doing something or saying something

50
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:33,300
we can think of them as the about two moment about to do something or we can

51
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:40,919
identify it in the urge or the impulse before we think say or act right so it's

52
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:47,360
that impulse to do the about to moment and we have motives we have intentions

53
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,400
behind every thought word and deed so they're always functioning all of this

54
00:05:53,400 --> 00:06:00,060
is fueled by intention so if I speak from a place of kindness or generosity

55
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:07,020
this will create one habit pattern of mind if I speak from a place of craving

56
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:12,120
or aversion that will create another habit of mine so this is how intention

57
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:18,660
actually functions to bring forth happiness or despair right it creates

58
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:24,539
different patterns of mind so put another way we can think of our life as

59
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:31,020
a garden and our intentions are the seeds that we plant

60
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:36,720
so if we want to be happy we want to plant seeds of non-grasping of kindness

61
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,900
of non-harming and these will grow a beautiful garden and this will yield a mind that's much

62
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:50,460
more resilient and flexible and joyful if we're planting seeds of green hatred

63
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:58,319
and delusion that will grow a very different Garden so you can consider you know am I planting seeds of fear or

64
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:04,380
seeds of self-aggrandizement or of insecurity so

65
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:10,199
we can see what's happening because if you want to grow a mango tree you

66
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:18,060
can't plant poison ivy seeds right so if we're trying to be free

67
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:25,139
plant a mango seed if you want a mango tree plant a mango seed

68
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:31,680
and so what I'm what I'm describing to you is also known as karma now these are intentional actions so we hear about

69
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,020
Karma a lot in Western culture and most of what we hear is entirely confusing

70
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:43,080
but as it actually appears in Buddhism as it's related to this practice it

71
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:49,080
refers to intentional actions So Good Karma results in happiness

72
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:54,419
an action based on a wholesome motivation results and happiness very

73
00:07:54,419 --> 00:08:00,300
simple so so this is why the Dalai Lama says my

74
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:05,340
sincere motivation is my protection

75
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:10,819
my sincere motivation is my protection

76
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:19,199
we can't control our circumstances but our wholesome intentions allow us

77
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,720
safe Passage through our life

78
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:34,020
so I have a medical device that occasionally beeps

79
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:42,539
and I can meet that with an intention of kindness right so

80
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:50,760
without interruption we can meet whatever is happening in our life with attentiveness

81
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,100
and in the same way that a mother takes care of her child can take care of our

82
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:01,339
bodies meeting that with friendliness um

83
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:07,759
non-aversion Etc so

84
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,320
my sincere motivation is my protection

85
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:22,220
so this might seem like a very odd question

86
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:30,980
but I'm going to ask it anyways does stabbing another person lead to

87
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:36,540
happiness or suffering well

88
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:42,720
it depends if the person with a knife is an assailant or a surgeon

89
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:50,160
right each might use a knife to cut someone but one has the intention to heal to

90
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:56,399
help and the other has the intention to harm the surgeon is going to have a very

91
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,980
different life than the violent Criminal

92
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:10,399
so I want to speak now a little bit more about Sama sankapa right in tension from the Eightfold Path

93
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:18,420
um so some of you might be familiar with the Eightfold Path this path to Freedom this path of freedom and right intention

94
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:25,040
is one of the past factors so there's these three facets

95
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,240
of right intention renunciation kindness

96
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:37,320
or non-ill will and compassion or non-harming so renunciation also

97
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:43,500
known as letting go kindness and compassion so I'm going to start with renunciation we'll kind of move through

98
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,860
these three parts of it so renunciation

99
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:57,120
we don't hear that word a lot and it doesn't sound very appealing does it

100
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,519
um but I've found that it's one of the most uh

101
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:08,880
powerful aspects of this practice so many of us are propelled in our lives

102
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:16,740
by trying to get more of what we want and avoiding what we don't want um but we of course cannot control our

103
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:23,880
external circumstances and even if we get what's Pleasant and agreeable of course it eventually passes

104
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:30,420
away because all is impermanent and of course we can't get rid of everything that's unpleasant because

105
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:37,320
there always seems to be another problem um so getting what we want and avoiding

106
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:43,220
what we don't want is not a very effective strategy

107
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:48,480
so instead we can think about the second Noble Truth that the source of suffering

108
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,480
is craving and instead of obsessing about our external circumstances we can

109
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:01,740
pivot turn the attention to look Inward and really address the craving at the source

110
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:06,959
to look at the craving and aversion operating behind the scenes

111
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:13,019
so if it's craving that's the problem that's what we should really get

112
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:18,480
interested in that's what we want to find an antidote an antidote to

113
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,120
and this is where renunciation comes in renunciation is like

114
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:31,560
Kryptonite for craving renunciation letting go undoes

115
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:37,140
the craving impulse so if we can learn to let go of our

116
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:42,360
craving rather than being propelled by it we have a lot more agency in our own

117
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:48,300
contentment there's a lot more freedom there and we can practice this in a lot of

118
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:56,519
ways we can practice this kind of letting go impulse in a lot of ways this can release we can do it with others you

119
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:02,220
know uh do I always need to get the last word do

120
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:09,260
I need to say the snarky thing do I need to make others how I want them to be

121
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:15,000
and can there be some release there can there be some renunciation or letting go

122
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,220
we can practice it with sense craving with entertainment

123
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:27,180
letting go of the compulsion to binge watch Netflix or to have the second

124
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:32,639
donut just releasing and as wisdom grows in

125
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:39,180
our our practice matures renunciation doesn't happen by

126
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:45,560
repression or Force um but like by by a true understanding

127
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:51,959
of the insatiability of craving by really getting

128
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:59,959
how much craving is a ruse we begin to to release the impulse

129
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:06,420
so if craving had a favorite line I'd probably say it's this moment is not

130
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:13,820
enough this moment isn't enough and there's nothing we can do to fix that

131
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:20,040
and when we really really get that desire can naturally fall away on its own

132
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:25,860
so bikubody says real renunciation is not a matter of

133
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:31,860
making ourselves give up give up things still inwardly cherished

134
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:37,620
but of changing our perspective on them so they no longer bind us

135
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:43,320
we understand the nature of Desire when we investigate it closely with Keen

136
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:51,980
attention desire Falls away by itself without needing for struggle

137
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,199
so that sounds nice and in the meantime when that's not

138
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:04,800
happening for us and there's still craving in the mind we just deliberately practice restraint

139
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:10,560
when we notice that our intentions are based in greed anger or delusion

140
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,199
just practice restraint okay so that's renunciation let's talk about

141
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:22,620
kindness non-ill will so loving kindness can manifest in all

142
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:30,360
sorts of ways it can be friendliness it can be full-blown love it can be just a little warmth of heart

143
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:40,740
there's so many ways that it can come forward and specifically meta loving kindness

144
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:47,100
um it's a kindness without any strings attached it's non-transactional it

145
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:53,100
doesn't require others to be how we want them to be um

146
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:58,760
yeah that's without attachment the way the sun shines equally on all beings

147
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:04,620
meta is non-preferential so

148
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:10,740
um yeah meta can involve small Acts you know something like taking care of the

149
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:16,440
Earth turning off the lights using less water or it can be great acts there can be

150
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:23,100
great acts of kindness um I was reading about one in the news that

151
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:29,579
really caught my eye and it was about this woman named April de Donna who's an

152
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:39,600
assistant store manager at a Wendy's in Washington and April was she was reflecting on how

153
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,060
how common it is common it is that people hate for no reason and so she was

154
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:50,399
like well if people hate for no reason why can't I love for no reason and so

155
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:57,180
she was thinking like why can't I just love my customers so so one day she decided to try

156
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:03,720
something a little risky after someone finished placing their

157
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:11,220
order rather than saying like thanks have a nice day she said thanks I love you

158
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:16,558
little dicey in a work environment it was surprising to drop the L word in

159
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:21,839
that setting um but she ended up getting a customer

160
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:27,178
feedback form from this person and it actually had a really beneficial impact so she thought okay well I'm going to

161
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:34,340
try it again the second time someone pulled up to the drive-through

162
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:40,679
meal board the order the order board place the order again April ended the

163
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:46,799
exchange I love you and when this person pulled up

164
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:54,240
to the drive-through window they were in tears and the the woman

165
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:01,080
she said that her her husband and her brother had just died

166
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:08,840
and that she didn't have anyone in her life to say I love you to her anymore

167
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:19,620
so April continued sharing her love with customers and when they say it back

168
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:27,120
she writes a tally mark on the wall and over the course of three months

169
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:35,760
April had 2 549 tallies on the wall

170
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:41,880
and apparently April says that a lot of people are now driving up to the window

171
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:47,899
and saying I love you before they even Place their order

172
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:55,620
so this is of course a very very overt act

173
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:01,940
of kindness but know that any action

174
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:07,820
any deed based in love generosity

175
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:16,260
warm-heartedness plants that that wholesome seed that wholesome intention

176
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:22,580
that starts to pattern the mind towards a happier life

177
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:33,299
so next we have compassion this third facet of samasan Kappa so this is so

178
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:39,600
compassion is when the heart of meta that heart of kindness meets suffering

179
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:46,200
compassion is the natural response so the Dalai Lama said

180
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,480
if you want others to be happy practice compassion

181
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:57,120
if you want to be happy practice compassion

182
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:03,360
one size fits all practice compassion so

183
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:09,720
I read another story recently this was about a little girl named Michaela

184
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:16,200
and she was kind of coming up on her 12th birthday and so her grandma took her out to a

185
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:23,700
special birthday tea I had a lovely time they had their tea and everything was going well until they got home at which

186
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:31,200
point her grandma really realized that she hadn't zipped her coat pocket closed

187
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:39,600
when she had put her wallet in it and the wallet had fallen out So for anybody who's ever lost a wallet you probably

188
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:47,100
know that it is a rather distressing experience and particularly if one has

189
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:56,039
any um kind of financial stresses it can be an extremely upsetting experience

190
00:20:56,039 --> 00:21:03,179
so meanwhile a homeless man who had been homeless for five years was

191
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:11,039
rifling through the dumpster behind the tea shop and he found a wallet

192
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:18,500
and I imagine that homeless man could have really put that wallet to use

193
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:25,580
but I also Imagine in that moment he connected with

194
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:32,340
some ethical thread within him perhaps connecting with a compassionate

195
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:39,120
impulse and before he knew it he was calling Michaela's grandmother to tell her that

196
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:46,020
he found a wallet in the trash so here he returned the wallet now this

197
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:52,400
beautiful wholesome intention manifesting and what I love about

198
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:59,220
compassion and kindness is that it's it has a ripple effect

199
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:05,700
um like it moves through people so when little Michaela found out that

200
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:12,360
this happened uh and you know her birthday is coming up uh she asked people to not give her

201
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:20,299
gifts but instead to raise money for the man who returned the wallet

202
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,880
so this is this is how compassion can function in our lives like one small act

203
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:33,919
one small intention leading to one small act and it moves through us

204
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:44,820
foreign practice compassion for ourselves for

205
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:49,860
others and for the world if you want to be happy practice

206
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:57,240
compassion okay so that's a brief overview of sama

207
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:05,220
sankapa of right intention the three parts of it renunciation kindness and compassion

208
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:12,120
and now I'd like to um just offer you some ways of starting to practice with

209
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:18,720
intention to try to to help illuminate it in your daily life because it can be kind of hard to catch them it can be

210
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:25,440
kind of subtle before we know we're saying something or we're doing something and we're not even really sure how we got there or why we're doing it

211
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,840
so um the best way to start is just by paying

212
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:37,580
attention to the intentions that are already present

213
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:43,020
you know as I mentioned earlier there's a reason behind everything we do um

214
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:49,080
even the really small things there's these you know micro intentions called caitana

215
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:55,440
um uh that you know um uh they're activating

216
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:02,159
when one goes to scratch and itch you know there might be a sensation and then

217
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:08,700
it's unpleasant and there's a little aversion to the sensation so we go to scratch so there's a little

218
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:15,740
intention present there is an intention when we go

219
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:21,840
for a slice the extra slice of pie intentions behind the clothes we choose

220
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,880
and the time we go to bed and the job we

221
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,919
decided on and how we brush our teeth you know it's

222
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:39,960
they're happening all the time right um so the the practice here is just to pay

223
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:46,020
attention to why you're doing what you're doing you're doing

224
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:52,860
um and this can be really Illuminating so just some areas you might have Spotlight a bit some areas to look

225
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:58,320
at in your life um check it out with food practice you know

226
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,539
are you eating for entertainment or for nourishment um

227
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:11,220
try it with conversation or speech practice are you speaking to care for someone

228
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:17,820
else or maybe is there a little Barb in what you're saying some tiny intention

229
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:23,080
to make someone know that they're wrong or you know something like that

230
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:29,880
[Music] um you know it might come up like are you complimenting a supervisor because you

231
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:38,400
genuinely want to want her to know that you care about her and appreciate her or is it coming from a are you

232
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:45,179
complimenting her so you might get a raise now what's what's happening there

233
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:50,940
um are you apologizing sincerely to your partner because you genuinely want to

234
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:57,240
make amends or is it a sort of um

235
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:05,100
what I like to think of as the G's shut up already apology I'm sorry okay those are two very

236
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:11,460
different apologies um so just checking out what's happening

237
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:16,740
when I was in college I uh I made a lot of pottery

238
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:21,779
and I really enjoyed it and I remember at one point I had a Vaz

239
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:28,799
that I was rather fond of and I um I was wanting to gift it to a friend

240
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:35,580
so that face value is like oh you know wholesome action you know you're based on the intention of generosity giving it

241
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:40,980
to a friend but when I kind of paused and checked

242
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:47,460
out the intention I realized that while there was that wholesome intention there there was this

243
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:53,039
also this part of of the intention that was like well

244
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:58,980
I'm also giving this to her because I want her to know that I am a highly

245
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:05,039
creative and excellent artist you know I want to make sure that this

246
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:13,860
person knows that I'm good at this right so this practice is humbling

247
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:20,340
it is not fun to see some of these intentions that are present so then we

248
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:25,919
can bring kindness to ourselves when we see that there's

249
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:33,419
part of the intention that may not be quite as sweet right and so what I'd suggest is just

250
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:40,440
remembering that intentions are often mixed like there might be an intention that's like eighty percent I'm being

251
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,779
generous and uh 20 seeking approval how

252
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:52,559
I was in that situation and when that happens you know we um really focus on the good

253
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:59,340
and then we just notice the other part without judgment oh okay approval seeking

254
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:03,740
approval seekings like this that's okay

255
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:09,779
and what we often find with unwholesome intentions

256
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:16,440
is that they're not moralistically bad just that they're misguided

257
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:21,900
they're not trying to yeah there's some part of us that thinks

258
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:27,000
that's the way to happiness right but yeah they're just just misguided you

259
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:33,960
know just trying to avoid pain just trying to be comfortable just trying to boost the ego a bit

260
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:41,100
very well-meaning um but when we really start getting to know

261
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:46,559
our intentions better these kind of micro intentions chaitana

262
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:52,880
it allows us to set resolves aritana it allows us to

263
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:58,020
have larger movements in our life reorienting our life to what we care

264
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:05,220
about most so if you in feel inspired to start

265
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:10,380
noticing intention in your life one thing that's very supportive to this

266
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:15,659
is sitting meditation because of course this allows us to slow

267
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:21,000
down this the system see the thoughts that are occurring in the mind and start

268
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,720
to get to know the more subtle impulses that occur within us and because we're seated and we're committed to sitting

269
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:33,299
there for half an hour or however long we're there for we're actually not acting out the

270
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:40,140
all the impulses that come up the impulse to rearrange all the furniture is being seen but not acted on so that's

271
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:45,559
a really great way to get to know our intentions better

272
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:53,520
um and then the other thing that I think is really helpful is pausing before acting you know just stopping a moment

273
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:59,100
to listen do I really need to press send on this

274
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:05,940
email now do I really need another cup of coffee just checking it out and maybe

275
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:11,940
you do maybe you're like you know that would be like the most gentle thing for this body right now or like that's what

276
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:18,059
this system really could use um but yeah you don't always have to act

277
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:23,640
on the impulse as I'm sure you all know you've you've been in this situation before

278
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:31,020
and we can do this with really small things like sometimes I'll I'll take a bite of food and while

279
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:36,179
chewing it I'll realize that eating that thing wasn't really

280
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:42,120
aligned with my intention that like you know I might not feel so great if I have that one extra bite

281
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:48,960
and I'll just spit it out like I won't even swallow it

282
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:55,260
so it's never too late to change course you can always change course with your

283
00:30:55,260 --> 00:31:01,980
intentions and lastly I want to say uh that while

284
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:08,399
intentions are clearly very important we also need to observe the impacts of

285
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:13,500
our actions you know we're not operating in a vacuum and

286
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:22,740
sometimes we do something that's very well intended that has a really unfortunate unintended result

287
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:31,500
and um Buddhism is not just about intention we're instructed to pay attention to our

288
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:38,360
actions before we do them when we do them and after we do them so if our

289
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:43,500
well-intended action has a negative repercussion repercussion we're still

290
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:49,980
responsible for that and and we are expected and instructed

291
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:56,700
to take responsibility for that and to shift our Behavior accordingly to allow that to inform our intentions in the

292
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:03,740
future such that we're not causing harm for ourselves or others

293
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:10,500
so if you have been feeling lost in some way in your

294
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:17,460
life and your practice I hope that you're able to notice that

295
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:24,659
which motivates you I hope that you're able to practice letting go practice

296
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:30,779
renunciation that you're able to act with kindness

297
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:36,179
and compassion so that you can get in touch with your

298
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:45,059
your inner compass and navigate to a truly happy life

299
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:51,260
thank you so much let's sit for a moment

300
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:36,569
[Music]

301
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:46,019
thank you so much how wonderful appreciate your attention

302
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:54,179
so we'll now have some time for questions or comments reflections

303
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:59,360
anything that may be arising for you

304
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:13,440
and if you'd say if you'd like to say your name you're welcome to

305
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:20,580
hi I'm John hi John um I have two questions maybe we can just

306
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:29,638
cover one um one is about renunciation I've found uh

307
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:38,220
an aspiration for renunciation which is sometimes fueled by sort of judgment or

308
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:44,280
criticism uh you know an acknowledgment of like a deep longing or a desire and

309
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:51,480
then this hope or this aspiration to like let that go thinking this is sort of a noble thing to be pursuing

310
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:57,420
but sometimes I lose I I don't I've I've in the past not had

311
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:03,060
clarity about the fact that the motive for this Letting Go was

312
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:09,780
actually this like resistance to the desire or the longing that was arising and so

313
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:16,079
so then I with that realization I thought okay I need to sort of like welcome the desire and like allow it to

314
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:21,960
be present but I also would like to sort of like let it go and let it dissolve but I

315
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:28,320
don't want to be like pushing it out like you said it's not something we can force away so I guess what I'm getting

316
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:34,560
at is how do we sort of balance this like desire or how do we balance

317
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:39,599
pursuing renunciation while also not resisting that which we're trying to

318
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:47,640
renunciate yeah great question and I'm I'm really appreciating how uh carefully you're

319
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:56,400
seeing your own experience like being able to identify uh a desire and then really seeing how

320
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,859
you're relating to it and seeing that you know the the wish for renunciation

321
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:08,099
and noticing how that can can some sometimes make us aversive to the desire

322
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:15,240
which then as you're you're recognizing then where we're operating under the same Force again we're just we're then

323
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:23,160
rejecting something so how can we keep ourselves from getting in a tug of war and I and I actually I heard part of

324
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:29,160
that in in your question an answer within your question which was uh being

325
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:34,619
with the desire you know to to fully

326
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:39,780
recognize it feel it in the body get to know it get to know the stories it tells

327
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:45,060
us with mindfulness notice the emotional valence

328
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:52,579
um and explore it from that that angle and as uh as we do that

329
00:36:52,579 --> 00:36:58,740
there's something else happening that's still not acting on the desire right we

330
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:05,520
haven't um uh if we're like straining to let let it

331
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:12,420
go that's just aversion so if it doesn't let go from like a natural a natural

332
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:18,359
invitation um then we can just let it be and that's

333
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:23,460
that's renouncing renunciation right right sort of the back door to

334
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:29,040
renunciation yeah exactly so you can just just let it be and something else I

335
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:34,980
want to mention about this is um uh

336
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:40,920
earlier on in my practice I had like a lot of zeal for renunciation and I think

337
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:48,599
there were certain ways that I was uh uh trying to eliminate

338
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:54,420
um aspects of who I am you know like trying to like kind of crush out Hobbies

339
00:37:54,420 --> 00:38:03,720
or Crush out things that brought joy in my life um and I think there's there's a balance of

340
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:10,800
um you know we're not um we're not trying to eliminate our personality we're still a unique being

341
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:18,960
in the world and there might be something in the world that makes your heart sing that is uh that allows you to

342
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:27,200
to be uh generous with yourself that isn't based in sense craving

343
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:32,339
rather something more more deeper and more nourishing so there can be room for

344
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:38,579
that in one's life to engage in certain worldly things that that feed us

345
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:43,099
makes sense thank you yeah sure

346
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:49,220
any other questions or comments

347
00:38:53,940 --> 00:39:00,180
how about your second question I was gonna say if no one had a second question or a question my second

348
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:06,060
question uh I need to remember it is about

349
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:13,920
um intention and uh I guess so you described you described

350
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:19,380
the the pottery scenario of like making this making this

351
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:24,420
vase and wanting to give it to a friend and is perhaps mainly a general there was a

352
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:30,420
mainly a generous intention behind it but there was also this other intention about being identified as a creative

353
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:35,820
artist and that really resonates with me there's a specific act I do in my life

354
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:44,099
which broadly has this very positive intention of sort of bringing light or positivity to people but there's a

355
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:51,180
hundred percent this underlying intention to sort of like get the attention of a specific person or to

356
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:57,540
sort of like you know sort of egoic based it's it's sort of like getting myself identified

357
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:03,680
in this specific way um and I'm curious about I guess the karmic

358
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:12,000
implications of that or he what how to

359
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,660
how to think about that I'm very aware of the intention that and and it's it's this tricky place because it's not like

360
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:26,099
this act that I'm doing is is somehow like bringing harm to people it's it's a good thing you know like giving the the

361
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:32,160
vase away that's not a bad thing right so it's like if you gave out a thousand bases I don't think Karma would be like

362
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:38,460
no so yeah anyway yeah I'll be at the idea yeah

363
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:46,880
um quite naturally in many of the things that we do

364
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:52,619
regardless of how wholesome it is you know if it's like

365
00:40:52,619 --> 00:41:00,839
feeding orphans or like saving kittens from trees or you know helping grandmas cross the street like our ego will try

366
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:06,480
to hijack it yeah it's just what the ego does and you know it's like she's really

367
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:15,060
just doing her best but she just is confused sometimes um and so uh

368
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:21,780
you asked about the karmic implications uh

369
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:28,980
the function like the way Karma functions like in terms of like being able to map cause and effect is

370
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:36,720
unknowable so it's not an A plus b equals c um so yeah I can't say exactly what the

371
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:42,720
karmic implications are but I think what might be useful is instead

372
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:48,300
um to notice that just be aware of it

373
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:55,500
be gentle with it and uh bring a little compassion

374
00:41:55,500 --> 00:42:04,320
to the part of yourself if that's available to you just some gentleness to like the the being that wants to be seen

375
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:09,780
wants to be recognized and known because often that being has some sort of hunger

376
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:19,140
to to be known in the world for approval or or love yeah yeah it

377
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:24,359
makes sense there's a there's a part of me which says well but then what about

378
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:32,940
all the people who are supposed to receive vases like you know if I cut off my gift my giving of vases and I'm just

379
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:37,980
using your example um but I think

380
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:44,280
compassion towards the part of oneself that wants to be seen can sort of help feed that

381
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:51,780
and then that there should still be space for vase giving outside of that yes yes let me be clear

382
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:58,380
keep giving the vases yeah keep giving the vases and as you're doing that you

383
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:04,859
know if it's like 80 percent wanna do this great thing for people which it sounds like this activity for you

384
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:12,119
actually like it it has this really beautiful wholesome intention to it and then you just you know that other 20 or

385
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:17,720
10 or 50 or whatever it is yeah sometimes yeah right right yeah yeah

386
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:25,260
whatever so whatever that other part is um uh as you give

387
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:33,240
as you engage in the act when that impulse comes over when that that inner being calls out for attention you can

388
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:39,300
just meet it compassionately like oh yeah I see you there makes sense thank

389
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:42,800
you yeah great questions

390
00:43:53,220 --> 00:44:00,000
so about a renunciation um recently I so I have three wonderful

391
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:06,060
adult children and um uh so two of them get to get along

392
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:12,540
and with a third one doesn't get along with with the other with one of the

393
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:17,760
others and so um recently they kind of some of them two two of them said okay

394
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:23,160
look can you can you get this all to work out you know and and that's very

395
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:28,440
seductive for to me it's like oh yeah I'd love to have the power to

396
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:33,780
have them all appreciate each other and get along and communicate but then I

397
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:43,140
realized I have to let that go because they're adults and they have their own life lives and it's not it's not for me

398
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:48,480
to do and so just for me to appreciate and love each one of them and realize

399
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:54,599
that many times people don't like their siblings then that's okay it's maybe not

400
00:44:54,599 --> 00:45:01,319
what my preference would be but to let go oh that's well

401
00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:06,960
that's such a great example of renunciation and the way that Letting Go

402
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:12,300
can function and like of course you want your kids to

403
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:20,460
get along like that would be you know because you probably see uh the exquisiteness of each of them and

404
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:26,040
you wish that they could see that in each other and it sounds like you saw within that

405
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:31,160
how if you really latched on you'd suffer over it

406
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:37,020
and to to be able to hold that really lightly with such a a wise Act of

407
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:42,019
Letting Go that's really beautiful thanks Martha

408
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:49,800
we have a couple minutes left if anybody has anything else

409
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:57,140
any other Reflections on the practice or questions

410
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:13,440
okay I think we're complete then well thank you everyone I so appreciate

411
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,599
you coming tonight giving this time for your practice

412
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:26,339
