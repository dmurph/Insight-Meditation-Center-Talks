1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,519
okay so let's get started uh this week I want to talk

2
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:14,000
about a set of pithy instructions that the Buddha gave to a

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,080
follower and which I found very meaningful to unfold over some years of

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,279
practice I'll just tell you a little bit about it before we start

5
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:31,759
meditating so the Buddha teaches about four foundations on which a liberated

6
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:39,040
person stands and then he gives four instructions or verbs that go with those

7
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:46,640
that we can follow in order to strengthen each foundation and even though the context

8
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,320
is this liberated person they're remarkably simple instructions and my

9
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,120
impression is that they're meant for everyone and are simply ones that are

10
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,439
powerful enough to take us very far so we can start with them right

11
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:09,960
now and then these same four appear in a teaching from a later Buddhist tradition

12
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,240
from the Tibetan tradition but in a a different guise there they're called the

13
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,479
four inspirational blessings so we'll call this series the

14
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:26,000
four inspirational blessings but that's not from the suta um we'll talk about

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,720
the blessing aspect on Friday after we go through the list as it appears in the

16
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:40,159
original suta for those who track the sutas this is Maji Manaya 140 and the four

17
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:48,360
foundational practices are to not neglect wisdom to preserve truth to

18
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:55,119
cultivate relinquishment and to train for peace so we'll talk about each of those

19
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:01,079
and then step back to the bigger picture at least that's the that's the plan and

20
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:08,239
we'll see how it unfolds so let's go ahead and meditate

21
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,920
together so settling into your meditation

22
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:27,440
posture finding your place and if you're comfortable doing so

23
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,519
please close your eyes bringing attention

24
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:41,440
Inward and just sense the places where you're making

25
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,319
contact your seat against the chair or the

26
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,959
cushion or whatever you're lying down

27
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:02,200
on feeling the settledness the balance of that

28
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,519
posture and allowing yourself to be

29
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:18,400
supported letting go into that

30
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:33,640
stability and sensing how the body Rises up from the stable

31
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:42,120
Foundation if you're sitting up it could feel as if there's almost a force lifting the body

32
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:49,519
gently booing it up like water supports

33
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:01,720
something feeling the straightness of the spine in a relaxed way

34
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,879
and then beginning to soften the

35
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,919
body softening the muscles of the

36
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:31,720
face and the eyes in the eye sockets

37
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,850
softening the [Music]

38
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,720
jaw down through the

39
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:04,880
shoulders relaxing the rib cage in the

40
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,720
diaphragm down into the belly

41
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,039
area releasing the arms and the

42
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:51,080
hands and down through the hips

43
00:05:53,440 --> 00:06:00,199
legs all the way down into the ankle joints and feet just inviting ease and

44
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:04,160
connecting with the body as it

45
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,520
is it's fine as it

46
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,440
is connecting with the quality of mindfulness

47
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:39,240
of being present feeling the presence of your

48
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:52,479
awareness right here not thinking about the past or the

49
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:59,160
future but being willing for now to just follow along with the

50
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,520
present

51
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:17,120
connecting in then with the simple sensations of the breath an easy way to

52
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,240
connect to the present

53
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
moment

54
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:42,720
really feeling the direct sensations of the breath so not an idea or picture in your

55
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,560
head about lungs what the actual

56
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:55,759
Sensations felt by the

57
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:05,400
body you may notice that the in breath is different

58
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:12,199
from the out breath on the in breath there's the

59
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:17,280
touch of air on the nostrils or the upper

60
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:24,159
lip perhaps coolness as the air enters the nasal

61
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:31,440
passages some feeling of flow and expansion

62
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:40,120
maybe you feel it in the throat or the chest of the

63
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,440
belly shifting clothing against the

64
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,880
skin and then at some point that comes to an end and there's an out breath that

65
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:07,640
has a different set of Sensations more a feeling of softening

66
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:14,279
or relaxation or falling of the diaphragm maybe the air is a little

67
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:19,440
warmer and the flow is

68
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:30,079
outward not just simple distinctions that help us know whether it's an INB

69
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:37,360
breath or an out breath how do you

70
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
know

71
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:27,519
we may begin to sense the breath as a whole body

72
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:34,440
phenomen May really it isn't just the literal air that we can

73
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,760
feel maybe as the chest expands and the shoulders

74
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:50,040
shift position there's a slight shift in how our hips

75
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:04,600
are maybe we can feel the breath is energy that flows throughout the

76
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,480
body so as we connect with the body in a gentle

77
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,680
way okay again notice certain distinctions the body

78
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,760
isn't all one

79
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:45,680
way we can feel places that have a sense of more solidity in other areas that

80
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,880
feel light or open or

81
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:57,279
soft warm or cool actually quite

82
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:04,160
varied throughout the body and just letting that be as it

83
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:34,079
is in particular we may notice areas of

84
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:39,480
relative tension and relative

85
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:48,800
softness it's not that one is right and one is wrong but it is okay to Incline toward a

86
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,949
general [Music]

87
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:02,600
softening maybe allowing the breath energy to pass through or around places

88
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,880
of

89
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:31,120
tension perhaps letting the body feel like it's being lowered into a warm pool

90
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
water

91
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

92
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:55,920
and as we continue to sit it's possible to notice when the mind gets

93
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,040
distracted and when it is mindful

94
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:08,440
and again we don't need an assessment of right or wrong good or

95
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:14,120
bad but a simple noticing of how it

96
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:20,639
is when there's mindfulness and when there are BS of

97
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:27,160
thought what is different between those different states

98
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,959
of the Mind

99
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:42,040
youing off thinking for a while and we come back does that thinking have an

100
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,680
impact on the body something different

101
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
there

102
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:20,680
it's very natural that things change the body

103
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:27,399
changes the ability to be mindful

104
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:34,279
changes the thoughts and maybe emotions change

105
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:37,360
come go

106
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
shift

107
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

108
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:48,720
another layer of noticing is how we are

109
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:55,640
meeting all of this changing experience in the breath in the

110
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:00,720
body in the emotions and thoughts

111
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:07,520
and awareness how do we meet all of that we may meet it with

112
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,039
kindness interest

113
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,240
care or perhaps there's striving

114
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,760
or aversion or

115
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:31,840
judging and what is the distinction between kind

116
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,480
interest and judging or [Music]

117
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:45,000
striving can we feel the distinction between those is there anything noticeable in the

118
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,640
body

119
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
perhaps

120
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:16,919
so it's very helpful in meditation to be able to make beneficial

121
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:24,480
distinctions spiritually meaningful distinct distinctions or

122
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
distinguishment

123
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:50,120
so allowing the mind to rest with just simple interest in all the

124
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:55,200
differences and changes that are going

125
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:03,000
on with an eye toward not suffering not

126
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:13,320
clinging and that includes both what we're aware of and how we need

127
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
it

128
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

129
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

130
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

131
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

132
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

133
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

134
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

135
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

136
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

137
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

138
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

139
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

140
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:46,559
so it may be that even from

141
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:51,720
this relatively short exploration

142
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:57,240
of beneficial distinctions you've already

143
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:03,440
seen how it's possible to be with tension in

144
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:09,520
the body and softness how it's possible to be with

145
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,559
different emotions or thoughts or the way the mind gets

146
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:19,600
distracted and then just coming

147
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:24,960
back checking the attitude in the way that we're

148
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:33,640
aware there's so many different I want to say handles or knobs

149
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:40,720
to turn in a sense it's not complex but um we have so many ways that we can make

150
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:46,480
simple adjustments toward being more easeful suffering Less in any given

151
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:52,919
moment and this is much of the art of just living a mindful

152
00:27:52,919 --> 00:28:00,120
life how are things now how am I with it could I be

153
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:08,559
Freer oh my mind isn't free right now okay I'll be with

154
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:16,760
that so the encouragement is to bring this same kind of

155
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:25,760
simple awareness into daily life it's definitely a more

156
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:33,398
complex um set of inputs that's why we practice on the

157
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:40,919
cushion but during the day could we have a simple attitude of kindness

158
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:46,039
interest awareness paying attention to whether

159
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:51,559
our body is getting tense paying attention

160
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:54,919
to other

161
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:08,159
people having a sense that if we're present and aware with an attitude of non

162
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:14,360
clinging that's a spiritually meaningful way of being and it's very

163
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:28,559
simple and it rests on the mind's basic ability to notice this and that to be

164
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:34,320
aware of spiritually meaningful distinctions between

165
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,399
[Music] things we can help ourselves this way

166
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:46,480
and by natural extension we have to help everyone else in doing

167
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,039
that

168
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:34,200
so this week we'll be exploring a suta that has four compact

169
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:42,399
instructions for walking the path and in the suta the Buddha meets a

170
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:49,159
very dedicated practitioner a monk who has gone forth as a Buddhist monk

171
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:55,840
without even meeting the Buddha so he must have ordained with one of the Buddha's senior

172
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,880
disciples and the Buddha is impressed with his practice and

173
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:09,360
dedication so he offers this teaching on four fundamental practices that are simple but can take a

174
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:16,279
person very far along the path maybe all the way to

175
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:22,360
Liberation and so the Buddha says in this teaching that a person can stand

176
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:28,480
upon these four foundations as reliable activity that

177
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:35,000
will move us toward Liberation so we'll explore them as

178
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,639
practical activities that we can engage with both on and off the cushion and

179
00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:47,360
they can go very deep they keep unfolding over time they you maybe even

180
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:53,799
when we first hear them we think I don't really know what that is or it sounds kind of abstract but as we start looking

181
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:59,639
at little specific examples it's like oh I get it oh and there's more and there's

182
00:31:59,639 --> 00:32:05,519
more here we see new and different ways of seeing

183
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:12,480
them so the first one is to not neglect

184
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:21,000
wisdom to not neglect wisdom so today is April 8th

185
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,120
2024 there will be a total solar eclipse visible in the northern hemisphere which

186
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:33,600
is amazingly happened twice in the last seven years and where I am it's going to start

187
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:40,360
in just a few hours it won't be complete where I am um

188
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:45,519
in the past solar eclipses were associated with

189
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:52,600
various stories about Gods eating the Sun or Gods fighting in the sky uh

190
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:58,559
nearly every culture has come up with its own stories to explain

191
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:05,360
why the sky gets dark in the middle of the day and typically in history these have

192
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:11,360
been somewhat negative stories because it's disturbing when the Sun goes away

193
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:18,720
briefly during the day that's not our usual intuitive understanding of

194
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:25,320
it but but now in our present time right people treat it like a spectacle and

195
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:31,559
they they flock to see eclipses out of Amazement or for fun or for scientific

196
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:38,440
interest and it is amazing and it's interesting we have a whole different story about what's going on we have

197
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:42,440
stories about the Moon and the Sun and the

198
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:51,480
Earth so what does it mean to not neglect wisdom it has something to do with not

199
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:57,799
getting caught up in the particular story but to remember to pay attention

200
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:03,880
to what is spiritually relevant about any given experience and as experience

201
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:10,800
unfolds so whether experience is totally mundane and ordinary or whether the sun is

202
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:18,358
disappearing from the sky can we direct our attention in some beneficial

203
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:25,398
way so wisdom is about making beneficial distinctions like I said spiritually

204
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:31,520
meaningful or in in the medit ation or maybe valuable valuable distinguishing

205
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:37,919
of experience so the ability this ability to make distinctions is inherent

206
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:43,000
in the human mind that's the faculty of wisdom of making

207
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:50,320
distinctions but if we look at our mind and our experience we have to admit that

208
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:58,800
sometimes we don't use this capacity as well as it could be used yes so you know we're not talking about

209
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:04,240
the distinction of whether to watch the eclipse from Houston or Buffalo that's

210
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:11,079
not so important spiritually uh even if we might have to make such a choice um

211
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:16,480
but non- neglecting wisdom is means remembering to make the distinctions

212
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:24,000
that are important that are going to be valuable or beneficial for us and usually that means starting at least

213
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:32,040
with what is actually known what is actually present in this moment um not

214
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:38,280
an imagination about the future not a getting lost in a memory about the past

215
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:46,040
not coming up with a fantasy or complicated story and living in that or some kind of

216
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:52,240
an ideal that's not actually present what is actually present are

217
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:57,760
various experiences in the body and the mind and also various perspectives that

218
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:03,359
were're bringing to those experiences which maybe are wise like the fact that

219
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:11,599
things change that's a wise perspective yesterday I was driving in a

220
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:18,240
parking lot looking for a space and I saw someone backing out just

221
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:23,440
ahead it's nice timing so I stopped to wait and take that

222
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:30,640
place and the car um backed up and then it kept backing up and backing up

223
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:38,720
getting very close to my car I think it didn't see me the driver didn't see me so I uh the first thing I could remember

224
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:44,480
to do was I honked um and I couldn't easily back up so quickly I wasn't in

225
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:50,800
the right gear um and the other car was going pretty fast but it managed to to just

226
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:59,680
miss my car it was just it just swung out a little bit to the side it almost then overlapped um but to the side it

227
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:07,280
must have been just inches um I don't think that person ever saw or heard my honk but they stopped

228
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:13,319
and and then went on forward on their way it was really close and I was rather

229
00:37:13,319 --> 00:37:19,560
amazed that we didn't Collide um but once the car was gone and nothing was

230
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:25,119
aiss I found that my mind just went went back to calmness and I I even checked in

231
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:32,040
my body I actually hadn't there hadn't really been time for me to have an adrenaline rush and get agitated there

232
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:37,400
was but but there was a little part in the back of my mind that wanted to get

233
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:42,800
agitated or irritated or scared you know it it kept saying but shouldn't we be

234
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:49,640
rattled by that shouldn't we be afraid shouldn't our heart be pounding um and for the most part I wasn't really it had

235
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:56,480
all been quite quick actually it was over and nothing had happened um so I

236
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:04,359
thought yeah my mind didn't neglect wisdom at that moment it didn't fall prey to spinning out or getting off into

237
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:12,640
discursive thought or getting angry at the other person how could they have been so distracted to not even see or hear me as

238
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,720
far as I know um it kind of just stayed with reality it was like yeah that was

239
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:25,240
really close but our day gets to go on we're not standing here right now exchanging information with someone so I

240
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:32,440
even felt grateful at that moment and I don't quite know how it was so fortunate

241
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:38,680
um but we can notice you know in our practice that we have gained some modum

242
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:46,359
of wisdom um even if you've just started mindfulness practice usually we can feel

243
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:53,319
right away intuitively that there's some wisdom uh about meditating or you know

244
00:38:53,319 --> 00:38:58,880
this seems useful something like that so uh the question question then is can we

245
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:06,000
honor that wow even whatever small amount of wisdom there is in my mind in

246
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,280
my life in my heart um can I honor that and we have to

247
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:19,839
admit that we don't always you know because because we don't but it is um it is possible to

248
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:25,440
consider then what does cause me to neglect my my

249
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:31,640
wisdom I have it sometimes and why is it that sometimes we don't honor that or

250
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:39,000
why is it that sometimes we neglect that so I thought about a few things in my own life that I know get in the way of

251
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:47,720
remembering wisdom one of the main things is surely desire wanting something you know when I

252
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:53,880
want something my mind Narrows in and focuses on that I'm going for that and

253
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:58,960
it's easy at that moment to forget all kinds of things to forget that things

254
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:07,400
change to forget that things aren't mine to forget that to forget to pay enough attention to other people um you know

255
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:12,720
it's not always in a dramatic way but I see uh that the desire Narrows the mind

256
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:20,400
in a certain way so it's not that we don't um operate by means of wanting to get

257
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:28,160
the next thing like a drink of water or the next or going to the bathroom or getting somewhere in our car uh we do

258
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:34,200
have those simple daily life movements toward things but can we keep our mind

259
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:42,599
open and spacious so it's still in touch with wisdom while we do those things um another thing that can get in

260
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:51,800
the way of um honoring our wisdom can be a lack of trust a lack of confidence in

261
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:57,520
um allowing things to unfold trusting the practice we get in the way of

262
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:03,839
ourselves and we try to make things happen or we um don't think that it will

263
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:08,920
be enough to be present with kindness with someone we have to engineer it or

264
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:15,880
manipulate it or control in some way and ironically the very Act of trying to get

265
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:22,440
in there and make it all happen uh doesn't allow wisdom to happen

266
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:27,920
doesn't allow things to unfold in the best way so that's all Al something that

267
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:34,720
we learn over the course of practice is how to stay present and use the wisdom that's coming but not get in the way of

268
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:40,040
it through our control and manipulation of

269
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:47,240
things and then also um I think conventionality gets in the way of

270
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:53,440
wisdom our mind is conditioned by so many things from our culture our family

271
00:41:53,440 --> 00:42:01,440
our education our religion these help us make distinctions between things me and you Us and Them

272
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,560
the way it is and the way it should be all these things um but are they always

273
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:12,359
wise distinctions between things so these conventional things lead us to

274
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:19,280
make distinctions usually that benefit our self and are based on things like seeking Comfort eliminating things we

275
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:26,359
don't like uh deciding what's right and wrong in an abstract way but the path is

276
00:42:26,359 --> 00:42:34,319
asking us to make make different choices choices that are about wisdom choices that are about um suffering and

277
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:41,319
not suffering which might not always be the same as that first set of distinctions I

278
00:42:41,319 --> 00:42:46,680
named so we have to go against the stream sometimes in this practice

279
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:52,960
against the conventional distinctions we've been trained to make and I think at some point we have

280
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:59,720
to admit that in order to go farther on the path and be willing to distinguish

281
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:05,720
in the way that we're invited to so specific practices that we can do

282
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:13,160
to not neglect wisdom um a wonderful one I've heard from Gil that I've used for many years

283
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:18,839
what will I sacrifice my peace for like a simple question so for example after

284
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:24,760
meditation when you get up what's the first thing that you sacrifice your

285
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:30,400
peace for and then look at what that is was it

286
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:36,200
worth it how did that end up and there's always something because we're not you know we're not fully awakened we're

287
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:42,400
going to fall out of it at some point but notice over time what are what sorts of things are we willing to sacrifice

288
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:50,359
our peace for it says a lot about our mind another useful practice to not

289
00:43:50,359 --> 00:43:57,160
neglect wisdom is to bring in feeling tone more often so that's whether noticing whether things are Pleasant un

290
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:03,480
Pleasant or neither just as a noticing so so often we're in reactive mode this

291
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:08,640
is something that's unpleasant and I don't like it and I'm going to get rid of it and we're already in the mode of

292
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:15,200
how do I get rid of it how do I solve the problem how do I control it how do I fix that other person so they don't do

293
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:21,640
that that's all that's already happened uh long ago we had an unpleasant

294
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:28,480
experience and this all of this activity is about that so if we can just step back and say you know what what's

295
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:34,119
happening is that this is unpleasant at this moment really cuts out a lot of that

296
00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:42,160
Bona and that wandering off that's a technical term for the discursive mind wandering off into stories and plans and

297
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:47,440
fixing things so using feeling tone is this

298
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:55,480
Pleasant is this unpleasant and then we have choices about how to react how to respond much more often out of

299
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:02,480
wisdom and then having the wise perspective of noticing change without adding a judgment of good or bad things

300
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:08,000
are changing it might even get dark in the middle of the day but just keep on

301
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:14,640
with knowing how things are um without this added reactivity of is this good

302
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:20,880
bad right wrong so when wise distinctions open up other Poss wise

303
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:27,640
distinctions are brought in other possibilities open up for us so we can become more attuned to the actual

304
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:32,960
situation and we can have actual responses that are more precise to

305
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:39,160
what's going on on the cushion um we can help the mind to settle into a more

306
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:45,200
balanced place if we're aware of wise distinctions between things so not

307
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:52,319
neglecting wisdom remembering to make distin distinctions that are helpful and

308
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:58,160
not the distinctions that are just conventional so distinction that lead

309
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:04,040
toward or away from suffering those are useful to know what's beneficial and

310
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:11,160
what's entangling what's helpful and kind and what's harmful these are the distinctions that

311
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:16,559
matter for the path so see how that goes

312
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:22,920
today to not what if I were not neglecting wisdom as often as I do and

313
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:29,599
remember that judging yourself for not negle for neglecting wisdom is not so

314
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:37,440
beneficial so we be aware of that and tomorrow we'll start exploring

315
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:43,000
what becomes possible when the mind has remembered to stay present and

316
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:51,160
balanced what opens up at that point what other things start to unfold so even if we can only for a few

317
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:56,440
minutes at a time throughout the day remember to be with wisdom that's good

318
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:03,760
enough it's significant so have a wonderful day and if you're in the path of the eclipse

319
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:08,400
please enjoy it take

320
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,880
