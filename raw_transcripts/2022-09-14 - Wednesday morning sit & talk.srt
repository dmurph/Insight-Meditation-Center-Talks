1
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,360
welcome to our meditation together

2
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,798
and as an introduction to

3
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:21,840
mindfulness meditation and buddhist practice

4
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,720
perhaps everything that you meet everything that

5
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,240
you encounter everything that you hold everything that you see

6
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,400
everything that you hear is very important

7
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,880
when i was in college i took a history class and near the end of the term

8
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:55,439
preparing for the final or something i asked the professor i said to the

9
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:01,680
professor so this little detail in history this isn't really so important so we

10
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:09,119
don't have to remember it and he looked at me very kindly and he said look at me you know like he looked

11
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:16,319
into my soul kind of and said to me everything is important

12
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:23,120
that really stuck with me everything is important

13
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,959
some people say there's no sound and

14
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:36,640
is that right let's see let's wait and see if there is uh other people say sounds good here okay

15
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:43,040
so i'll continue

16
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,760
so so this idea that everything is

17
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,840
important everything is of value and what it would be like to live if

18
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,879
that was the case everything is of value everything is

19
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:06,560
important that you don't want to miss anything and the idea is maybe everything that

20
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,800
you in the moment you want to really be there for it it's one of the things i learned from

21
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:19,040
zen training was this very idea to meet each thing every moment

22
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,239
as the important thing as the value thing

23
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,159
and in order to do this the key

24
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:37,599
is to be able to bring our attention to what's going on to bring our attention to each thing as

25
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:43,680
if it's the most important thing and mindfulness practice can be seen as

26
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:50,080
a training to develop such a capacity of attention

27
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,879
and to do that it actually helps if we appreciate

28
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:03,599
that what's happening to us here and now is valuable is important

29
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:12,799
whatever it might be that each breath is appropriate to meet and fully receive

30
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:20,000
and be present for as the most important thing is a very important thing valuable thing

31
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,280
that every feeling emotion that comes along is important

32
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,639
every sensation every thought and

33
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:40,720
activity of the mind but as soon as we cling to it as soon as

34
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,960
we pick it up and get involved in it resist it ignore it

35
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:54,960
deny it we diminish its importance and we diminish ourselves in the process

36
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:02,320
we diminish our capacity to really offer full attention to this thing

37
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,800
so of course we can't do this for everything happening in the present moment

38
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:18,160
so we take our time settle in and we do it for what's

39
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:25,919
most prominent we do it for what's maybe most simple to train ourselves

40
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,360
to bring in attention bring attention which is not scattered

41
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,880
not distracted not swept up in thought or swept up in

42
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:43,280
reactions boredom the grass is greener somewhere else

43
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:50,160
there's more important things to do just here with this

44
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,600
everything is important you are important

45
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,440
and you are so important and valuable precious

46
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:12,319
that you it's important not to diminish oneself by being lost in thought

47
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:19,199
closing down with reactivity and clinging and resistance

48
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:25,840
so important to stay fully open here

49
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:33,759
and that's why we allow us train ourselves in the training that everything we bring

50
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,960
our attention to is important maybe the most important

51
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:45,440
thing of the moment so to

52
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,080
take a meditation posture

53
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:02,080
part of the art of meditation posture is to take a posture which is

54
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:09,080
solid diff like you're definitively

55
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:16,720
assuming a posture of attention in whatever way that's

56
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,759
works best for your body

57
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,719
and gently close your eyes

58
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:52,319
and the thing that's most close in most intimate here and now

59
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,440
in our direct experience is our body

60
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:09,680
valuable important in its own right and to begin the process of

61
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,960
meeting our body is the most important thing of the moment

62
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,759
you might take a few long slow deep breaths

63
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:33,360
as you breathe in deeply to feel your body as widely and broadly

64
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,159
as possible especially in the torso

65
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,920
and as you exhale

66
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,040
to release and settle into your body

67
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:12,880
exhale and come home to this body relaxing the tensions that

68
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,800
are kind of pulling away from the center

69
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:38,160
as you exhale settling maybe the weight of your body

70
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,199
all the way down into the bottom of your belly

71
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,440
and then letting your breathing return to normal

72
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,839
and as you exhale relax further

73
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:24,720
relaxing some of the tensions of the body is a way for the body to become whole

74
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:32,640
the body all works together so no part of our body is closing down

75
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:39,680
or pulling away or tightening in on itself

76
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,240
as you exhale relaxing the face

77
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,800
relaxing the shoulders

78
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,560
relaxing the belly

79
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:28,880
relaxing and settling the belly down to the very bottom

80
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,480
core of it all

81
00:11:54,079 --> 00:12:00,880
and then this giving your attention over to your breathing

82
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:07,240
as if breathing is the most important thing

83
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:21,240
as if it's the fir your very first breath the inhale is the first inhale

84
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,200
maybe as if your exhale is the last exhale

85
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,839
something so important

86
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:44,320
and what's it like to give attention over to the breathing

87
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:50,160
relaxed open maybe even loving attention

88
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,320
as if breathing is the most important thing

89
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:14,279
and if anything becomes compelling

90
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:21,519
a moment to recognize it appreciate it

91
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:27,120
as if it's the most important thing of the moment it's so important

92
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:34,720
you don't want to interfere with it or latch onto it or pick it up

93
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:41,440
get involved so important you just want to let it be itself

94
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:48,639
recognizing it as it is with care and attention

95
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,040
and then begin again with your breathing

96
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:04,800
whatever arises don't dismiss anything belittle anything

97
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,839
if it takes you away from your breathing

98
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,320
be content to be mindful of it for a few moments

99
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,240
and then begin again with your breathing

100
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,280
because each thing in itself is important you don't have to be trying to get

101
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:55,840
something or get anywhere in a sense you already arrived

102
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:01,760
where you need to be here

103
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,960
offering your loving attention your caring attention

104
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,559
to each thing and it's the nature quality of your

105
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:17,840
attention relaxed open clear

106
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:24,559
present that's the real

107
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,919
way in which we discover each thing is important

108
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:18,720
as you're aware of your breathing as you become aware of anything

109
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:26,640
relax your awareness too your awareness is

110
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,080
also the most important thing

111
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,720
and don't compromise your awareness by straining or pushing

112
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:47,679
or doubting relax and allow the awareness

113
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:55,200
to do its thing simply openly in whatever way awareness

114
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,840
is aware that's enough

115
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,880
awareness aware of breathing

116
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,520
whatever is important

117
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,639
calls on us to care for it

118
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:22,159
to have a sense of care both caring for it's it's getting a sense of its

119
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:27,840
value we care for it but also to offer our aid our support

120
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:33,039
our good will

121
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,278
for it

122
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,960
they're all things

123
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:57,440
even if we throw some we put something in the trash

124
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:04,639
if it's important that also we don't toss it away

125
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:12,640
no need to use words like tossing or discarding but rather we place it

126
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:20,159
in the trash not as an afterthought or an aside

127
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,279
but as if placing something in the

128
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:31,919
carefully and well and so it can go on to its next stage of existence

129
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:39,360
to recycling or the dumb forever with our care and our

130
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,120
intentionality

131
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,759
and for all people all the living beings of this world

132
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,640
to take the time to let them be the most important thing of the

133
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:09,278
moment we can care for others as well

134
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:17,840
we can care for their welfare and wish for their happiness and well-being

135
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:29,559
maybe there's something some way in which seeing each person is valuable important

136
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:38,080
where it becomes almost second nature for some part inside of us

137
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,480
to care about them to value and appreciate

138
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,120
so that there's good will well wishing

139
00:28:55,039 --> 00:29:02,240
and if that well-wishing is a light bulb

140
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:08,799
turning on the light bulb of meta of kindness

141
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:16,158
so that it radiates and shines out from us almost as a light

142
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:24,840
as a glow as a care a warmth

143
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,080
and as we come to the end of this meditation

144
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:42,240
to send out with our light with our care and

145
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:48,799
goodwill with our attention our well wishing

146
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:59,519
that all may all the people that we know in our lives

147
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:05,720
may may they be well

148
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,679
may they be happy and safe and healthy

149
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,799
may they be at ease in their life

150
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:37,279
and may those people that i encounter today in person or in communication or

151
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:43,440
learning about them in some way through the news or some way

152
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:54,640
they're also they are also important each living being has importance

153
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:06,320
and perhaps some some aspect of goodwill can travel from you to them

154
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:14,559
some kind gaze may all of you

155
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:23,919
be happy may all of you be healthy and safe

156
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:32,240
may all of you be at ease

157
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,880
in your life

158
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:50,799
and then to turn that kindness and goodwill to yourself

159
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:55,440
that you yourself are also important

160
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:04,398
at times you're the most important person for you yourself

161
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:11,960
you're the one that you're most intimate with the one you know the best

162
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:22,000
and to wish yourself well to aspire

163
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:29,720
to wish and work for your own happiness

164
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:36,480
you might say to yourself may i be happy

165
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:44,158
may i be healthy and safe

166
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,840
may i be at ease

167
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,799
may i be free

168
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:14,080
and may it be that on this day that you experiment

169
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:20,640
living a life as if each thing is important each thing

170
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:26,559
is something you can care for and every person

171
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:31,840
is someone who you can offer your good will

172
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:40,480
may all beings be happy may all beings

173
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:48,278
be safe and may all beings be free

174
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:57,370
[Music]

175
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,809
[Music]

176
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:15,440
and then to continue their talks on loving kindness on metta

177
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,560
good will i just i delight

178
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:27,040
in just saying those words i think there's such wonderful qualities

179
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:33,440
and touches something precious and valuable inside to just evoke the qualities of

180
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:39,839
meta kindness friendliness good will

181
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:44,878
and that wasn't always the case for me

182
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:51,118
when i was first introduced to uh the teachings of meta loving-kindness

183
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:56,800
i had a background where the way i rece understood them

184
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:02,400
is that they were artificial they were kind of uh dr uh

185
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,839
creating artificially feelings of goodwill or kindness that were kind of

186
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:13,839
sticky or excessively sweet or something and maybe sentimental and

187
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:20,800
and i was much more practical and pragmatic just i just wanted to have a spirituality that was just about

188
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,920
um waking up just about being present in a direct

189
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:32,880
unmediated way and this loving-kindness thing was just kind of getting in the way

190
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,800
and uh so when the teachers my early theravadin teachers would do guided

191
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:46,720
loving kindness meditation i just tuned them out and just continue doing my basic mindfulness practice

192
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:53,040
until such a time that uh through the mindfulness itself it was kind of like mindfulness is a

193
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:59,760
tenderizing force something settled relaxed something way i was holding myself closed began to

194
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:06,240
open and at some point i started having this very nice feeling inside

195
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:11,440
that was kind of new to me and

196
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:17,760
and uh it had a very very pleasant very peaceful warm nice feeling very

197
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:23,839
different than compassion which i had already tapped into through practice but

198
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:29,760
this other thing and then at some point i thought maybe this is what these teachers are

199
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:36,000
talking about yes it is this is what they mean by this good will and this method

200
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:43,040
and so rather than being something i had to construct or make happen it was welding up inside

201
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:49,359
and then recognizing it then the whole thing about practicing meta loving kindness

202
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:55,200
became quite valuable for me and a very valuable part of my life and

203
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:04,000
a life and so when i say these words the beginning of meta goodwill kindness

204
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,839
just saying the words kind of touches something in my heart that kind of

205
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:17,280
kind of has a feeling of kind of a little bit singing my heart sings a little bit to those concepts and ideas

206
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,400
and so anyway so this is a topic for this week

207
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:28,480
and and one of the things i want to say is that

208
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:42,240
in emphasizing good will and loving kindness and this tradition terrapin tradition also does it for oneself

209
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:49,040
also meditation practice is closing your eyes and kind of focusing inwardly to your own inner experience

210
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:55,119
it's easy to criticize it as being self-centered in fact i when i

211
00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:00,800
back in the early years in which i was meditating i haven't heard this for many years now

212
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:08,800
but people would complain that met people doing 40 minutes of meditation each day

213
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,240
were spending their their time being selfish and you know someone who's religious should

214
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:19,280
really be out there doing things to the world sacrificing themselves

215
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:26,079
and um and the people who complained about the selfish meditators meditating for 45 minutes or 40 minutes or however long it

216
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:32,800
was we're probably spending two or three hours a day watching television but that belonged to a television

217
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:38,079
watching belonged to a different domain of life than the religious life and the religious life should really be

218
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:44,640
about being altruistic and that doing religious life there was you know inwardly inward what they saw

219
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:51,359
as being selfish i don't think it's that way at all and certainly wasn't for the buddha

220
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:58,160
it's not a self-centered path because self-centeredness being kind of preoccupied with oneself is a way of

221
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:04,240
actually harming oneself and if you really care about yourself and see yourself as important you wouldn't be

222
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:11,359
selfish because of this harm it does for oneself also the idea is that

223
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:18,079
there's a mutuality in in this world of ours that the more we care for ourselves and

224
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:24,079
love ourselves and free ourselves

225
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:29,119
the more that we benefit others and the more if we benefit others

226
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:35,920
without harming ourselves that we're also benefiting ourselves

227
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:42,400
and so this practice of loving kindness you can see this in it that as we offer

228
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:48,800
our care to others this meta care this way of this kindness and this friendliness

229
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:54,000
um we benefit also because these fee if if they're really genuine

230
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,040
not artificial not forced not obligated but arising from this kind of wonderful

231
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:05,920
place inside that that as we express it as we live it uh

232
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:11,200
this vibrates this flows this opens up there's a warmth happens here

233
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:18,079
it's nourishing for the person who has the kindness compassion also is meant to nourish the

234
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:25,200
one who's compassionate and if we're not somehow nourished or there's not some satisfying feeling

235
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:31,040
and having loving kindness it probably isn't quite loving kindness or it's loving kindness that's mixed up with

236
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:35,200
other things and

237
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:43,040
so in loving others the loving person benefits and in the teachings of buddhism you the

238
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:48,720
loving person is allowed to benefit from the love it's not selfish

239
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:56,480
it's just a byproduct it's not selfish because developing oneself and growing oneself is a way to become a person

240
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:02,319
who's more beneficial to others more able to meet others and

241
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:08,960
and really see other people and offer a presence as if that person is important maybe the most important

242
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:15,760
person at the moment of the time and if we diminish ourselves and feel somehow that we're less and not

243
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:21,760
important or we demean ourselves or critical of ourselves or

244
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,960
don't have you know this care and valuing of ourselves

245
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:33,280
then actually we have less to offer others than when we meet someone else we're not really meeting them

246
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:38,720
fully they don't feel the full goodness of who we are they feel a kind of goodness if we're

247
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:44,000
trying to be nice but it's not really full and it might be a little bit

248
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,119
trying too hard sometimes but to relax deeply and be at ease and

249
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:55,680
be at home in oneself and to feel uh that you know regardless of one's

250
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:01,440
foibles regardless of our shortcomings that we are completely deserved and

251
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:07,680
appropriate for us to love and care for this being that being here for ourselves

252
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:14,480
it isn't like everyone in the world deserves love and care except there's one exception one person

253
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:20,160
who it just doesn't make it the cut and that's oneself it doesn't work that way

254
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:27,200
everyone is so this practice of mindfulness is practice living kindness is a practice of

255
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:34,560
including caring for oneself and mindfulness is a self-care process

256
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:40,400
so the idea is um to um to care for ourselves and love for

257
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,760
ourselves see ourselves as important and really learn how to

258
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:50,960
soften and relax the ways in which we suffer the ways which we

259
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:57,599
close down and diminish ourselves so we have more to give others

260
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:03,520
you can't teach a foreign language unless you learn the language first yourself

261
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:08,720
you can't um there's many situations where you you can't learn

262
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:14,720
a teacher a path of freedom unless you've been on that path for yourself

263
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:21,440
and and you can't know love you can't offer love unless you really know it here for

264
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:27,680
yourself and so to really it's okay to benefit

265
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:32,720
from the practice of love of kindness and all that

266
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:38,880
um now it's not selfish this focus here

267
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,920
and this love for ourselves because um it's possible

268
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:49,599
um one of the great delights of i think a spiritual life and i've heard other

269
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:56,079
people in other religions say this outside of buddhism that

270
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:03,359
it's possible to have lots of love for others warmth kindness friendship

271
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:10,000
good will whatever those words work for you and not need

272
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,200
to have it come back so not be that our well-being doesn't

273
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:22,720
have to be dependent on being loved by others we have a bigger need to love as adults

274
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:28,319
we have a bigger need to love than we do to be loved

275
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:35,440
and and if we have a strong need to be loved chances are that that need i want to

276
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:41,280
respect the need for sure that that need is most uh

277
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:48,480
benefit most benefits or is more profound or resolved if we're the one who love ourselves if

278
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:55,440
we can learn to offer care and kindness and goodwill to this person here

279
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:01,760
and if we do this if we practice the practice of loving kindness or just practice more good will in our life and

280
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:07,680
learn to explore it and feel it and appreciate it when it's there and

281
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:13,520
expand it to enhance it whenever we can the

282
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:20,880
the buddhist tradition lists seven eleven benefits that come from doing loving kindness

283
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:26,880
and the ancient description of this

284
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:33,680
specifies it's really developing this to a high degree but i think we get some of these benefits even if we just start doing it

285
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:39,040
in small ways so it's kind of a delightful list and i wanted to read the list of 11 benefits

286
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:45,680
of loving kindness one sleeps happily

287
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:52,720
one wakes happily one has no bad dreams

288
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:58,079
one is loved by others so one doesn't need to be loved by others

289
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:04,400
but one is loved by others so that's kind of a nice balance

290
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:10,640
and one is loved by non-humans so maybe that means animals

291
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:17,440
or maybe it means the devas buddhism believes in all these kind of

292
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:23,119
kind of devas that are floating around and because the next one is one is

293
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:30,000
guarded by the devas and i think that when one practices uh kindness and friendliness and goodwill

294
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,280
that there are seen unseen ways in which the situation the people around us then

295
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:40,720
treat us differently and there is a kind of protection that comes with it

296
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:48,079
a fire poison or sword won't touch one so i don't know about that but uh it's

297
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:55,200
quite a wonderful benefit if it's true that you're protected from fire and poison and weapons

298
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:01,359
uh the next one is good for meditators one's mind becomes

299
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:06,400
concentrated quickly someone's mind becomes concentrated

300
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:11,440
quickly because you have less to be agitated for or less to be upset about if

301
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:16,960
if there's more love and and so it's easier to kind of get settled

302
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:24,160
and then uh it says here number nine is once complexion becomes clear

303
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:32,240
so that's nice it's a lot cheaper than other ways of getting a clear complexion

304
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:38,000
one dies with the mind free from confusion now this is a real benefit i

305
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,119
think how we die is i just see it as such a to die well to die

306
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:48,640
at ease at peace to die with kind of an open heart

307
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:53,760
without confusion is one of the great potentials or possibilities

308
00:47:53,760 --> 00:48:01,599
and mindfulness is said to support that but so does this good will this method

309
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:09,359
and then the eleventh one if there's no higher attainment is reached one is reborn in the brahma realms

310
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:15,839
and so some of these benefits speak to some of us us moderns and some of us don't but i

311
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:21,280
just delight in this grand list of wonderful benefits of it all

312
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:28,240
i'll read you one more that it says that

313
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:34,760
a wonderful quote that um

314
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:46,040
where is it maybe i don't have it here um yes

315
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:57,680
