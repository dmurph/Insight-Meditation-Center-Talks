00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:07,600
hello and welcome to happier everyone dear sangha lovely to be with you i'm

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:14,480
happy already just sitting in community sitting in community both the zoom

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,080
community youtube community and the sangha leader

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,279
you will join us on audiodharma

5
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,199
so [Music] for today

6
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:37,440
the invitation is to consider that metta could be explored in so many different

7
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,640
ways of course the practice of meta cultivating loving kindness as

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:50,000
many of you have witnessed both with happy hour so many different ways i

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,480
explore it i offer it in creative ways as well as diana offers it

10
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:03,600
and also different teachers so there's so many different ways there's not one way to practice metta

11
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,000
and sometimes creativity is a good thing and sometimes being settled in just the

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,080
continuity of breath body the the utterances the phrases might be helpful

13
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:24,840
so using our judgment using our clarity

14
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,720
um we can tell we can discern actually the word i want to use isn't judgment is

15
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,960
discernment i think that's a better word here because judgment can be misconstrued as judgment and self-judgment but

16
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,960
discernment using clear comprehension some pagania

17
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,119
discernment we can discern what is the appropriate way

18
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:55,840
perhaps for a given time to which tool in the tool bag

19
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:02,159
to to use for both different practices and different practices of metta so the

20
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,720
particular practice that i want to to highlight tonight is meta

21
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:15,760
as non-doing interesting what does she mean meta as

22
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,599
non-doing how can non-doing be meta it can be so

23
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,800
in the following way so sometimes and again it really depends on

24
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,840
our discernment discerning what is appropriate so

25
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:38,239
so think of times when you've been with a friend perhaps

26
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:44,590
and maybe the friend has been upset or we're suffering and um

27
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:50,879
[Music] and all they want you to do is for you to listen

28
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:57,599
just hold presents listen just hold presence with patience with metta with care

29
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:04,480
not to rush it to give him advice to make it better to make it go away because sometimes that

30
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:10,400
impulse to make it go away is actually our own fear

31
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:17,599
our own fear of discomfort because when somebody else is uncomfortable it can make us uncomfortable so notice

32
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:24,480
if that's the reason like okay jumping to do something instead of first the non-doing

33
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,599
the meta of non-doing the meta of holding space

34
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:35,280
similarly for ourselves there are times that maybe a

35
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,120
challenge a difficulty comes up in the body in the mind in the heart let's say

36
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,120
it's a challenging emotion and

37
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,640
something and and notice if the mind wants to whip up active meta active meta

38
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,640
may you be well maybe happy maybe well make it go away make it all better

39
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,920
see if there is if there might be sometimes

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,319
this this conflictual relationship make it go away this is not good this is bad

41
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:17,280
this is so there's so much doing there's so much forcing and i hear that's from so many

42
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,919
practitioners that they discover that after a while they've been practicing meta that they're they've been perhaps

43
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,440
doing jackhammer meta or or hammer metals like they're just

44
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,880
hammering this difficulty away like okay

45
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:42,560
so it's it's good to be aware to know with

46
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,840
discernment what is appropriate sometimes it is appropriate to just be

47
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:55,040
to just be with what is give it space don't push it force it

48
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:01,280
away the same way that if there's a little child crying

49
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,600
um you know say okay stop stop it's uh it's fine it's it stop stop crying like it's okay sweetie it's okay you hold

50
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,880
them you hold them you can't be rushed you hold them

51
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:21,840
it's the meta that shows up with patience with non-doing with clear awareness clear presence

52
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,280
so i said plenty that's the frame for today's practice

53
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,639
so let's do some non-doing together

54
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,600
let's let's non-do together let's begin

55
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,199
landing releasing

56
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,400
in this body and this breath nowhere to go nothing to do in this

57
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:01,840
moment opening up

58
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,120
opening up to awareness

59
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,639
just holding presence

60
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,160
awareness

61
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,680
the sensations this body the breath

62
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,639
not doing the breath or the breathing

63
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:57,919
relax let the breathing unfold on its own the body knows how to breathe

64
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,560
don't get in the way

65
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,319
as if you were thawing as if your body was thawing

66
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,319
ah

67
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,039
awareness

68
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:03,599
permeating through the body and the breath

69
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,759
knowing simply knowing

70
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,400
whatever is arising in this moment

71
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:35,519
settling the breath with the body

72
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,240
awareness

73
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:49,680
expansively holding the entire body

74
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:57,120
the breath whatever's pleasant unpleasant thoughts are rising and passing

75
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:06,240
ah it can all be can all be

76
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:13,399
awareness patient kind expansive

77
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,480
if you find the mind as resting on thoughts entangled in

78
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,839
thoughts that's okay that's okay

79
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,279
let whatever is arising whatever thought entanglement

80
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:21,279
sadness memory dukkha whatever it might be let it be clearly known

81
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:29,760
with kindness oh yes yes this this too this too is arising in this moment

82
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,880
let it be held in kind awareness doesn't have to go

83
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,200
away it doesn't have to be jackhammered away

84
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:54,880
kind awareness can be soothing expansive just enough

85
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,880
plenty

86
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:26,160
and you may come back to this realization

87
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:33,680
to this kind awareness rekindle it a hundred times it's okay do it every

88
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:41,120
time smilingly it's not a problem it's the bare bones of this practice

89
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:50,319
it's okay give thanks every time you come back

90
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,880
smilingly because after all

91
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:03,839
you never leave it's just the metaphor it's always here

92
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:12,600
ready to be recognized to be invoked

93
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,760
let it be a non-doing non-effortful

94
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:50,959
invocation recognition it's just there

95
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,519
it's just here

96
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:08,680
kindly spaciously knowing

97
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:43,200
if judgmental thoughts doubting thoughts arise i don't know what i'm doing

98
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:49,039
maybe simply know this

99
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:57,679
thought with kindness ah shine the light

100
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:04,880
shine the light of kind awareness ah

101
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:11,520
give it space it's a lot of space

102
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,840
for it to just be known

103
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,720
it's like this

104
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:31,520
see if this way of kind awareness practice

105
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:37,760
gentle non-forced can be nourishing

106
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:44,559
with a heart and mind whatever is painful or difficult right

107
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:50,320
now it can hold it without pushing it away or falling into

108
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,320
it

109
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,480
so

110
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:08,080
this non-doing meta could also be expressed

111
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:13,520
with an inner smile just holding

112
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:21,280
knowing experience with good will of smile friendliness

113
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:31,840
you can also wear an outer smile to encourage an inner smile

114
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:19,919
as if you are sitting in space spacious kindness

115
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:26,559
sphere everything your body your breath

116
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:31,919
thoughts everything is held

117
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:39,080
in this kind awareness

118
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,760
a whole experience that is known

119
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:09,880
and this moment is okay held with mental

120
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,679
doesn't need to be pushed away

121
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:47,240
now turning the practice outward

122
00:27:53,600 --> 00:28:00,200
imagining you're with a friend maybe someone from this saga

123
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:14,559
they want you to just be present old present just listen

124
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,080
with kindness with care

125
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:51,279
this moment it's not for you to fix it and just

126
00:28:51,279 --> 00:29:00,480
hold presents with menta with care with good will

127
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,080
with patience

128
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:17,200
maybe you're breathing mental with every breath for them maybe you say the phrases for them it's

129
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:23,320
your choice see what feels right

130
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,720
this

131
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:43,639
you're invited to invite more friends

132
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:49,120
more dear beings

133
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:56,760
in your circle of meta a holding presence

134
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:20,280
and for the last minutes of this practice period

135
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,878
see if you can open up a sense of holding presence with meta

136
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:35,720
with care with knowing with awareness not turning away

137
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,118
for the world

138
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,960
and notice if this feels similar in some ways to the practice of equanimity for

139
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,599
you or different

140
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:05,839
if it gets too heady you can drop that comparison just open it up

141
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,800
for all beings

142
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,160
may all beings everywhere

143
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,280
be safe

144
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,520
may they be well

145
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,920
may they have ease

146
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:40,799
[Music]

147
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:59,119
thank you for this practice for your practice

148
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,440
so

149
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:13,280
way of practicing this met us holding presence non-doing

150
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:19,760
can be very healing and soothing um you can also

151
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:26,000
also for some for many different times can also be not having enough of an

152
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,640
anchor not having the phrases as an anchor not having the

153
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:38,720
other being so much as an anchor so so mind can can wander a little more but

154
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:45,599
it's okay it's all held it's all okay it's all okay so it's just a different way of practicing

155
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:51,280
um so if your experience was that oh yeah the mind was a little more distracted and

156
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,480
that's okay that's a part of this way of practicing it comes with this more open

157
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,920
spacious awareness of being

158
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:09,200
so we have time for reflections

159
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:14,800
questions comments complaints it's all okay it's all

160

00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:02,720
in small groups so small groups of roughly size three

239
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:09,359
and we'll start with 15 seconds of silent meta take care of yourselves

240
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:13,920
take care of each other and

241
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:21,599

242
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,839
are created here we go

243
