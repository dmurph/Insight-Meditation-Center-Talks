1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:07,200
hello and welcome and

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,040
uh today we'll do the last uh exploration of mindfulness of

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,560
emotions and I hope that the course of this week that

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,920
uh I've managed to convey a deep respect for emotions that emotions have an

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,960
important role and place in our lives and that uh learning how to be

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:38,360
mindful of them is a tremendous uh beneficial art and I call it an art

7
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,920
rather than a technique because it has to do with our inner life the depths of

8
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:51,480
it the fullness of it the range of it and uh something which constantly shifting and changing and understanding

9
00:00:51,480 --> 00:01:00,079
how to be with emotions how to respect them how to learn from them how to um uh

10
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:07,400
Plum into the depths of their potential is a constantly shifting uh phenomenon

11
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:13,119
we're finding our way we're discovering and um and it's important not to have a

12
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:18,240
simplistic idea that that there's a simple technique for just not knowing

13
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,799
how to be with emotions it's uh if there is a simplistic idea it's

14
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,640
the idea that uh we want to be able to show up for them and discover have the

15
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:37,200
capacity to be able to be with emotions without being swamped by them controlled

16
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:45,000
by them um resisting them troubled by them uh overly

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,399
um succumbing to them but to be able to see them clearly

18
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:58,880
so that we can uh find the wisdom and find Freedom that uh they point to and

19
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,439
what's possible so in the course of this week the one of

20
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:09,759
the things was the idea of um like yesterday giving lots of

21
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:15,160
space to our emotions and so this analogy I've given

22
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:20,400
before that I think is very powerful is that sometimes when people

23
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:27,120
think that they're supposed to concentrate on something with mindfulness really bore into something really look

24
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,360
at it carefully or study it it's kind of like the mind everything a lot of mind

25
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:38,680
kind of contracts and becomes kind of tight like all my fingers coming together to kind of a point in order to

26
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:46,159
address something and uh and but this movement in the mind to gather together and focus

27
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:52,280
and causes a strain there kind of a tension involved in that and um the

28
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:59,800
alternative is to keep the Mind relaxed keep the awareness soft open receptive

29
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:05,560
in some sense maybe broad not not to tense up anything in the mind but also

30
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:12,080
not to stay broad like this because if you stay broad we don't necessarily see

31
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,879
carefully and see well and be able to see through something or see behind it

32
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:25,640
or see the roots of it and so the idea is to uh to come not not go like this to

33
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:33,720
a point but have a different kind of one-pointedness where whatever we're looking at comes and is the mo comes and

34
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:42,920
just touches the most sensitive part of the mind just like a sensitive part of the hand is uh maybe the palm and um and

35
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:48,040
when we like this that the Palm is not available to sense and

36
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:54,280
feel and so this way so stay soft so as we go like this sometimes the mind will

37
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,439
go tighten up and so we want to pay attention that we don't do that and

38
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:05,280
rather we come and just kind of gently touch and so and what this means is to

39
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,400
put ourselves right in the middle of the emotion put ourselves right there we get

40
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,840
really close to it and that's where mindfulness of the body is so helpful

41
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:24,080
because what we put ourselves close to is the place in the body where the emotion is most expressed the way the

42
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,720
most sensations of the emotion are present and in a sense to put ourselves

43
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:37,400
right in the middle of that maybe in this way that we're kind of just creating a place for the emotion to rest

44
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,560
in the palm of our hands Kind of Wonderful metaphor but so so it rests

45
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,360
and be supported or as if um uh you know the

46
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,840
the the important place is this the point of contact between awareness and

47
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:00,320
the mind and and the emotion and and just reside right here like just this

48
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:08,160
becomes a place to just feel and be absorbed and be present so it's very intimate very close to the sensations of

49
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:15,479
the emotion and and that movement can be like this we can touch in difficult

50
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:21,160
emotions touch into it and the image I have for that is uh that sometimes when

51
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:27,560
there's really difficult emotions that uh awareness is like a soft cotton ball

52
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:34,919
that just comes gently and Taps but we don't tense up we don't resist we

53
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:40,360
just kind of keep relaxed open mind and experiment with how close can we get and

54
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:47,000
keep it relaxed you don't have to go all the way just go as far as you can that

55
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,800
before you start tensing up and it might be that you have to stay quite far away to be aware of it and that's okay if if

56
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,039
you're going to tense or resist or get afraid or something maybe stay far away

57
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:06,160
way but over time to learn how to bring that soft cotton ball it's that

58
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:15,960
sensitivity just right into the middle of the emotion really be there and um

59
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:21,160
and then maybe it's too many metaphors but I find it useful sometimes to

60
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:26,599
imagine there's a chair right in the middle of the emotions and the physical

61
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:33,280
sensations of it and then I just sit there to be with and accompany the

62
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,360
emotion so this intimacy this closeness it's not always the right thing to do

63
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:47,240
but uh that's one of the ways to be mindful of emotions so to assume a meditation

64
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:53,479
posture and this is where with emotions it's actually very significant the

65
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:58,520
posture you take and so really be thoughtful and

66
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:07,520
careful about what the posture Expresses in terms of how to attend

67
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,979
to an emotion how to [Music]

68
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:22,240
be to be able to respectfully make room for the emotion make contact with the

69
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:28,319
emotion some people find it's particularly useful to be

70
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:37,240
grounded so with the eyes closed maybe on the exhale to

71
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:46,560
feel the weight of your body being supported by a chair a couch s a

72
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:54,159
cushion a bed whatever it is that supports the

73
00:07:54,159 --> 00:08:02,960
weight of the body on the exhale ground yourself there settle

74
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:10,919
there as if this place that you're sitting is a refuge for

75
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:16,919
you the actual place that receives your

76
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,120
weight is a place of safety and

77
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,839
grounding and then to ground yourself a little bit into

78
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,360
your body gently take some deeper breaths

79
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,519
feeling as much as the body that's easy especially the

80
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:51,120
Torso and relaxing as you

81
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
exhale

82
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:24,959
and then letting your breathing return to normal and it's easier to relax the

83
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:31,920
mind if we first relax the body and if relaxing is

84
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:39,040
too challenging maybe a softening softening around the tension

85
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,160
and the holding and with every

86
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,079
exhale softening

87
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,440
relaxing different parts of the

88
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
body

89
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
for

90
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,279
and then to also notice what tension and holding

91
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:49,800
there is in the mind the thinking

92
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:57,240
muscle any forcefulness or tightness

93
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:05,680
pressure associated with thinking or maybe with even

94
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,279
emoting wanting something and not

95
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:22,560
wanting and on the exhale to relax soften the

96
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,959
Mind soften the energy

97
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:35,440
agitation pressure of wanting and not

98
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:42,800
wanting of thinking and planning and remembering

99
00:11:52,959 --> 00:12:00,959
and softening and relaxing the energy of being self-concerned

100
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:25,560
burn and then centering yourself on the breathing in whatever way the body is

101
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,600
experience of breathing might be comforting for you or

102
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:37,680
settling or grounding just go look around and

103
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,480
see in what way can you feel the physical experience of

104
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:50,480
breathing is there a location for that in the belly the chest the rib cage the

105
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,320
nostrils the back rib

106
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,839
cage where it feels grounding or

107
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,600
settling to accompany the body

108
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
breathing

109
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
for

110
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
e

111
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,000
and then to notice

112
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:10,079
recognize how you're feeling in terms of emotion a mood and

113
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:20,560
mental state how you're feeling in your inner

114
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:36,519
being it might be quite subtle it might be strong either is

115
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:44,120
fine and see if you can recognize if there's

116
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:50,839
any location in the body that's the center of how you

117
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:01,279
feel any part of your body that's little more active ated or where there are

118
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,639
Sensations that seem to be part and parcel of your

119
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,800
emotion your state of

120
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:26,519
being some subtle meditative states can feel like they extend beyond the edges

121
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:32,759
of the body some emot difficult emotions can seem

122
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:40,279
like they're throughout the body but whatever it is is

123
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:45,000
there a center of gravity for

124
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:54,639
it and if there is let your awareness hold it spaciously

125
00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:00,680
maybe from a distance and allow your

126
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:09,959
breathing to accompany your emotion your state as if you're breathing through

127
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,160
it or alongside of

128
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:24,159
it and your breathing gets close to it but you don't not

129
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
yet

130
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
for

131
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
for

132
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:38,440
and then to begin centering yourself on

133
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:43,240
where on the middle of the

134
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,720
emotion getting closer with your awareness so you begin feeling it

135
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,960
sensing it carefully and

136
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:05,840
receptively almost as like you bring yourself right up against it or right into the

137
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:13,240
middle at whatever Center there is for how you're

138
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,159
feeling maybe with an awareness that's like a soft cotton

139
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:26,080
ball maybe all you can do is tap your emotional state

140
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:33,880
gently feel it stroke it

141
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,600
gently and then pull

142
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:49,039
away or maybe you can open your hand wide your mind open and

143
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:01,159
relaxed and receive the emotion in the open mind mind open

144
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:21,400
hand or placing yourself in the middle of your emotional

145
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:30,158
state your mind state state of being whatever it might be

146
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:39,880
and sit right in the middle just being

147
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:45,240
with not fixing or judging or

148
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:50,600
analyzing being a good friend who just sits in the middle of it lets it

149
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:56,640
be ACC companying feeling

150
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:04,880
sensing the physicality of the emotion maybe it's an ephemeral

151
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,919
sensation whatever it is

152
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:17,799
gently let yourself be in the middle of it all and see what

153
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
happens

154
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,520
and as you do so keep an

155
00:21:54,520 --> 00:22:00,919
eye on whether the mind is Contracting or

156
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:11,880
tightening see if the mind can stay relaxed with a relaxed attention relaxed

157
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,880
connecting relaxed

158
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:26,919
receiving while you're centered

159
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:34,799
grounded in whatever seems to be the middle of your emotional

160
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
state

161
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
for

162
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
for

163
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
for

164
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:43,679
and then as we come to the end of the meditation to end the way we

165
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:52,200
began let yourself be grounded in the place where you're

166
00:24:52,200 --> 00:25:00,278
sitting whatever receives the weight of your body feel feel that

167
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:07,399
support of the floor your cushion chair couch

168
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:12,960
bed and whatever part of your body is touching the surface that's carrying

169
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:20,880
your weight feel the solidity of that feel the grounding of

170
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:26,679
it in a way it prevents you from Free

171
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:32,360
Falling being pulled by the by

172
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:39,760
gravity and taking some long slow deep

173
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:46,240
breaths and on the exhale feeling the grounding of the weight of your body

174
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,480
this substantiality of your body Here and

175
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,679
Now

176
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:13,600
and then take a few last few moments here to appreciate your

177
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:21,039
mind even if sometimes it acts in ways that are not so helpful for

178
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:26,120
you mostly this mind of ours most of it

179
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:31,399
operates kind of with without recognition without knowing to take care

180
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:36,480
of so many of the different functions that takes us to be

181
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:43,440
alive even if our thinking is not always so helpful

182
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:50,200
99.9% of the mental functioning supports us all day

183
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:59,880
long appreciating the Mind appreciating your

184
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:14,720
heart and then turning your attention outward into the world and no one needs to know you're

185
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:22,880
doing this doesn't require mean you have to do anything or talk to anyone or help

186
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:28,600
anyone but you can just now for a few moments

187
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:36,039
spread your good will out into the world that yes it would be a great thing if

188
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:41,559
there was more [Music] peace more well-being less

189
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:48,760
hunger more people being supported out of poverty

190
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:54,159
and despair and oppression it would be a good place this

191
00:27:54,159 --> 00:28:00,159
world if people didn't suffer so much may it be

192
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:06,640
so may all beings be

193
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:12,240
happy may all beings be

194
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:21,760
safe may all beings be peaceful may all beings be

195
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,720
free and may my good will find a way

196
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,760
to spread into this world nourishing it supporting it making

197
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:39,960
a difference for this to be a better world for everyone for

198
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:53,018
[Music]

199
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,399
everyone

200
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,360
thank

201
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,840
you and uh while I drink my water and prepare for a little talk if some of you

202
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:20,880
would like to say a few words just a few words so I can track them all about what

203
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:28,200
that meditation was like for you was it helpful was it challenging was it what way might have been helpful or something

204
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:35,240
and that might help me understand how then to do this teaching in the next few

205
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,320
minutes

206
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,240
e

207
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:17,039
so thank you for the comments and I'll read more of them at the end and I

208
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:23,840
certainly sympathize with those people who felt there was a lot of words during that meditation and um but that's the

209
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:33,000
tradeoff uh between being able to be silence that helps us to settle versus um receiving

210
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:40,840
some teachings and some approaches that um rather than explaining them in a in a

211
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:45,880
talk afterwards but some little bit kind of going along and feeling them here and

212
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:55,880
there's a long history of receiving teachings like this that and then going off to meditate with them um so

213
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:03,799
um and and um so this week uh mindfulness of

214
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:11,120
emotions uh I hope offered both different perspectives of how to be present for emotions so the art of it

215
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:17,240
you can kind of have different choices of how to be and with with them in different different times in different

216
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:22,440
ways and um but also was a little bit Progressive it was creating a building

217
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:27,600
the container building the context so that we can do something which is often

218
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:33,159
quite difficult and that is to sit in the middle of our emotional

219
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:40,399
life but sit in the middle without being uh caught in it or entangled or reactive

220
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:46,960
or without feeling that the we're victims of our emotions that we're collapsing under the weight of

221
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:54,600
them and um to find a way to sit in the Middle where we feel at ease or we feel

222
00:33:54,600 --> 00:34:00,480
free or we feel uh strong we feel um

223
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:07,679
capable um we have the capacity to be with them and be present and and then to be able to get

224
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:14,878
to really when the time is right to really be intimate with them to really

225
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:21,320
feel closely what exactly is the experience the present moment

226
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:27,720
experience often with emotions especially with difficult emotions there's often a very strong

227
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:35,720
connection to thinking and reacting and believing or interpreting or predicting

228
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:43,358
or um somehow relating what the emotion to our our sense of self what this means

229
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:50,638
for me and uh how this defines me or what I have to do or something and the

230
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:57,240
idea in mindfulness practice is to learn a radical Simplicity where so much of of the

231
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:05,920
reactive interpretive uh judging analytical ways of being with emotions that that gets uh

232
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:11,320
let's kind of recedes into the background or becomes quiet it's kind of

233
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:16,400
like uh you've been doing some kind of craft at home but there's a loud radio

234
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:26,079
going on kind of blaring all kinds of stuff that maybe it's political speeches and and um opinions and and um and it's

235
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:31,160
just kind of difficult to kind of be absorbed in your craft or in reading your nice

236
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:36,400
book and so um the um uh so the radio

237
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:43,760
goes off for the radio gets turned down and now you can really be with what you're doing and so to really be with

238
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,920
the emotion and whether it's sitting in the middle of it or coming from

239
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:57,200
underneath it or in some kind of intimate way uh being the emotion making

240
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:05,520
room for it to kind of be all of us if it's really strong and everything but all these ways uh with a Simplicity of

241
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:11,920
attention with a capacity not to react not to judge not to interpret um but

242
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:19,599
just to breathe with it or make room for it to be what it is and that intimacy and that capacity

243
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:29,319
is invaluable I would suggest for two today for two main reasons um one is that uh our body the

244
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:36,760
emotional body that we have has a lot of wisdom about how to uh in a healthy way

245
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:42,240
to let our emotional life unfold and uh sometimes our emotional

246
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:49,319
body has much more wisdom than our thinking mind has where we predict and judge and interpret based on life

247
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:55,040
experience and so if we can relax enough feel safe enough to drop into our body

248
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:01,119
and just feel intimately what's happening then um uh the inner wisdom

249
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:07,079
the the process which emotions are emotions are can process themselves in a

250
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:13,599
healthy way so that's one advantage of doing this and the more close we're connected

251
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:19,000
sometimes the easier it is for to really allow the depth of what's happening to

252
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,760
unfold the other which is also sometimes maybe even more important at times is

253
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:32,119
that that intimacy and presence an attention to the emotion that's close in we start seeing that actually in the

254
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:37,319
cracks of it or underneath it or behind it or something we start seeing that

255
00:37:37,319 --> 00:37:43,760
whatever the emotion is that we're that was going on is is in a certain way is

256
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:49,280
the surface emotion or is the the U the

257
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:55,599
louder expression of something that's more core that underlying Source

258
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:02,720
underneath so for example when there's a lot of anger uh sometimes what's underneath the

259
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:10,160
anger is fear uh or maybe it's um a sense of hurt

260
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:16,319
and so so this they have been close to it and feeling it closely and um so that

261
00:38:16,319 --> 00:38:23,079
it can we can begin seeing I like sometimes I think of is the message underneath it what's really

262
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:29,760
going on underneath and that can be a GameChanger well we thought we were dealing with anger and we had opinions

263
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:35,160
about anger and important is to express it and you're going to give people a piece of your mind and you have right to

264
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:40,760
do that all this stuff is just really on this kind of a surface thing if you

265
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:46,119
really want if you're able to drop into a deeper Wellspring deeper what's really

266
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:51,880
bubbling and going on and activated in a deeper place within you want to be able

267
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:57,160
to see below that maybe see the hurt or the fear

268
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:05,359
and that is more primary that's more useful to deal with sometimes sadness um sometimes uh

269
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:10,400
uh anger isn't there's not fear or hurt under anything sometimes it's a deep

270
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:16,800
sorrow and grief and the anger is a kind of uh kind of might be directed outwards

271
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,079
to others but it's a kind of ricocheting off the difficulty of being with our own

272
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:27,200
grief and pain and certainly we want to be very respectful how diffult it is and

273
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:33,240
not rush to then connect to it but there might be feeling it from a distance or

274
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:40,599
soft cotton ball that gently touches it and pets it you know Strokes it I know you're there and then pull it

275
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:47,160
away so these two uh very helpful processes that can happen one is that

276
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:53,440
the emotion can unfold the way it will naturally do and generally emotions

277
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:59,839
unfold in appropriate ways they know how to unfold if we get out of the way and allow them to be there without being

278
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:08,720
fueled by stories and beliefs and reactivity and um the second is that um

279
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:14,800
uh we start seeing through them to what's actually deeper and the examples I gave now were

280
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:22,640
all kind of you maybe difficult emotions but sometimes underneath might be something beautiful so maybe there's

281
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:28,800
anger but we find that underneath there there's love and somehow the love the

282
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:34,200
care the compassion for some reason has taken direction of anger but there's

283
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:40,000
really compassion underneath there and maybe there's another way rather than

284
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,119
anger to let the compassion be expressed um maybe sadness underneath

285
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:54,319
that is um is also love or care or um maybe there's a sadness that our

286
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:59,640
generosity or our friendship is not received or

287
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:06,520
something so um sometimes there's beautiful things to discover and um uh

288
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:12,680
you know sometimes um fear underneath the fear there might be a very wholesome

289
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:18,119
sense of wanting to protect oneself care and support for one's own

290
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:24,200
well-being that feels uh very satisfying to touch into

291
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:30,200
and to feel that underlying care and desire to be safe independent of the

292
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:38,240
fear can be also a GameChanger and we can ask ourselves then well is there another way of uh becoming safe if

293
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:43,680
that's what I what what I want as opposed to somehow contending with a

294
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:51,400
fear so the world of our emotions is a very rich world and um and as we learn in

295
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:56,760
mindfulness meditation to be present for it in a mindful non-reactive

296
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:03,200
way the the uh greatest potential in for mindfulness meditation of learning how

297
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:09,599
to do this is that emotions become just one more thing to be aware of as things

298
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:14,960
unfold and move through us and it isn't that the emotions then at some point are

299
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:24,119
more validated or more important than anything else but rather the ability to settle down set be simple and whatever

300
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:29,880
arises in attention we just say oh that's what it is this is going on now

301
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:36,520
and leave it that simple so that the capacity for simple ongoing

302
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:42,200
recognition presence to what's happening in the present moment uh becomes

303
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:49,240
uninterrupted without the emotions um being as I said prioritized or or taken

304
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:55,079
to be uh um more important than anything else it's just one more thing to

305
00:42:55,079 --> 00:43:01,520
recognize and know and that Simplicity of just letting emotions be that way allows for this

306
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:09,160
deeper settling and con uh into um the uh the path of

307
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:15,200
mindfulness so I hope all this uh supportive um remember that how

308
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:21,160
important that uh I've emphasizing respect is for your emotions respect

309
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:28,240
them and care for them and and be wise about them don't uh and uh no hopefully

310
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:33,960
what we done this week helps you to understand how to better take care of yourself when these emotions are here

311
