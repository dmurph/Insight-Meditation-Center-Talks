00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:09,520
warm greetings from Insight Meditation Center here in Redwood City California

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,320
and and I prefer to introduce myself that way but just

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:21,359
saying that I'm here on this Earth with all of you all

4
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:28,400
of us together it's widespread so thank you for being

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,360
here this week we I'm discussing attitude attitudes and

6
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:42,960
these are the background moods background filters through which we how we see how we speak how we um act in the

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,840
world that uh are often not brought into Consciousness kind of an underlying

8
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:56,160
attitude that pervades everything and one of those can be um

9
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,280
the attitude that we know that uh

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:07,320
that our thinking the way we understand things is accurate and so if we know something

11
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,799
which is not a hard fact but an opinion which

12
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:19,000
is a judgment or an evaluation uh and we treat it as fact

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,159
then we can get into trouble and uh sometimes these are

14
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:30,479
opinions we have about ourselves that uh sometimes there's delusions of grandeur sometimes there's

15
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:39,880
a delusion of of uh the opposite of that uh uh sometimes it has to do with

16
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:45,920
delusions about uh the world around us that we know something we think we know

17
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:53,159
somebody we know their motivations their intentions we know uh you know just a lot of knowing

18
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:59,439
and in meditation as well there can be this attitude like that I know what's supposed to happen I know what is

19
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:07,119
happening and one of the useful attitudes is the attitude um not

20
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:14,280
knowing not so that you're ignorant not so that you are are

21
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:20,840
um um somehow allow something to P persist

22
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:27,319
that is harmful for you but rather that you don't harm yourself we don't harm

23
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:32,720
ourselves with the so called knowledge we have the opinions we have the

24
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,959
understandings we have so that we have room to see more

25
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:45,920
clearly more widely so we don't see through the filters of what we are preconceived

26
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:52,000
ideas we don't see through the filter of our opinions we don't feel we don't see

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,720
through the um the filter of the ways that we're hurt or angry or we want

28
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,599
something and through those filters think think that we actually know what we're

29
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:11,959
seeing um and to not know is to have the

30
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:19,159
mind be open the heart be open is to be fresh it's to be curious and interested

31
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:25,080
what is what's here let's take another look and in fact I love some of you know

32
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,239
I've said this often enough that I'm very fond of the word respect

33
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:39,439
ECT as a kind of a synonym for mindfulness practice because uh the spe of respect

34
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:45,560
is like spectac spectac spectacles uh to see comes to the the

35
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:52,599
Latin word to see and so to respect is to see again take a second look

36
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:58,680
mindfulness is always to take a second look and a third look what is it with a mind that doesn't

37
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:06,680
know doesn't impose or overlay our knowing on

38
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:12,840
top of a situation so to assume a meditation

39
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,319
posture that's right for

40
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:25,240
you and there spent some time maybe twisting around or wiggling around and

41
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,600
kind of moving the shoulders rocking back and forth

42
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:37,600
uh forward and backwards to find a posture that you feel the most

43
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,560
aligned your body aligned with

44
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:56,360
itself and to lower your gaze and let your gaze be

45
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,560
relaxed not looking at anything in particular

46
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:07,320
almost as if you're not looking or looking through

47
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,120
the peripheral

48
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,319
vision looking just to without seeing

49
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:24,319
anything knowing without knowing what you

50
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:31,479
see and then gently closing your eyes

51
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,319
and feeling the glow the hum the

52
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:47,360
tensions sensations of your body in some Global

53
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:56,840
Way not knowing not imposing your preconceived ideas

54
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:02,880
and but as if it's a brand new world to enter the world of your

55
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,000
body allowing the body to show itself to

56
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,360
you and let the different Sensations be

57
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:27,440
simple without entangling them with knowing

58
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,400
attitudes beliefs

59
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:42,560
predictions even memories as if you're knowing these

60
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,960
Sensations for the first

61
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:02,800
time and in a way that is enjoyable for you take take a little deeper

62
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:11,120
breaths and then a longer exhale relaxing your

63
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:30,960
body simple very simple enjoyment or pleasure in breathing a little bit more

64
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,759
consciously

65
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:41,039
fully

66
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,720
relaxing and letting the breathing return to

67
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:05,520
normal and once again seeing if there's a little bit of pleasure or enjoyment to

68
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,800
be found somewhere in the cycle of breathing in and breathing

69
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,279
out and as you

70
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,360
exhale to relax different parts of your

71
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
body

72
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
for

73
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:46,920
relaxing the thinking mind the thinking

74
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
muscle

75
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,839
when we're too involved in understanding or believing having

76
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:17,160
opinions it can be felt as a tension in the

77
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:24,200
mind a pressure in the forehead or on the eyes

78
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:31,040
the Jaws shoulders even down

79
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:41,079
that extra layer of believing and knowing and

80
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:49,680
reacting let it all relax and for this

81
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,720
meditation allow yourself not to

82
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,040
know being present attentive

83
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:13,839
without interpretation story meaning

84
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,959
predictions experiencing closely what is

85
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:30,959
here not knowing what it is

if there's anything uncomfortable or difficult as you

101
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:42,240
meditate notice whether you have an opinion about that

102
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:50,039
or you believe something about it that's an extra

103
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:03,240
layer an alternative point of view that allows for something unknown to be

104
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:10,159
there is that whatever is challenging whatever that's going on

105
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:15,000
which is not what you know it should

106
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:24,080
be that something new is being born something new is

107
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:30,240
occurring provided you get out of the way

108
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,720
let your thinking relax and

109
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:44,919
quiet and with a not knowing mind feel and sense more

110
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:50,720
deeply What's Happening Here in the body with

111
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,679
emotions allowing things to be without

112
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
imposing

113
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
knowing

114
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120

and then as we come to the end of this [Applause]

124
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:47,559
sitting to suspend our preconceived ideas about

125
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:53,760
this moment what's happening and

126
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,679
instead be curious as if you don't know

127
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:06,039
not knowing can

128
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:10,320
be an expression of

129
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:19,399
respect where we put aside preconceived ideas so that we can be open to discover

130
00:26:19,399 --> 00:26:24,000
a new what is here right

131
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,600
now

132
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:41,520
and to gaze out upon the world out upon all the people we know

133
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,440
and will be seeing these next few

134
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,960
days and to offer them their

135
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,960
respect seeing them fresh thinking of them a new so you can better

136
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:09,039
know how they are as if every day someone is different every

137
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:17,520
hour and in the changing ways in which people unfold

138
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:25,360
and evolve they do have the capacity to be

139
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:33,279
happy they do have the capacity to be feel at home in themselves and be

140
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,919
peaceful and may we wish that for

141
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:50,720
everyone May the people in our lives and may all people be

142
00:27:51,679 --> 00:28:00,440
happy may they be healthy May may they be

143
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:11,639
safe may they be peaceful may they be

144
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:19,320
free may they too rest in the

145
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,518
joy of not always

146
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:32,919
knowing and may we support

147
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:42,480
others in their capacity to grow and to change and to

148
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:49,320
become better people by not imposing our preconceived

149
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,720
ideas may all beings be

150
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:03,690
happy [Music]

151
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,720
so thank you very

152
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,320
much

153
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:29,279
so hello everyone and Welcome to our third talk on

154
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:37,320
attitudes and specifically more specifically the to to move

155
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:44,600
from unskillful attitudes to skillful ones and the unskillful one that is very

156
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:51,399
common in this world is uh ill will or

157
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:58,880
aversion takes many forms right now I'm thinking about resentment as a form form of

158
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:07,360
it and um the um living with resentment with kind of a

159
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:13,799
hurt anger and hostile

160
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:22,240
hurt uh but uh to be critical complaining is a form of

161
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:29,200
aversion or hostility to be complaining about people about things too much all too it all too

162
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:38,399
easily carries with it some kind of ill will and um and it isn't that there to

163
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:45,279
deny that there are things that are hurtful that happen in the world or things that we need to take into account

164
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:51,679
that they're not helpful or skillful to what people are doing but to see but to

165
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:57,880
have aversion or ill will be uh an attitude

166
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:06,240
and um the um a pervasive way in which we see the world we go into a new space

167
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:12,840
in a new room with no you know people we maybe we don't know we've known them before but it's we're steing into a new

168
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:19,679
situation and we carry with us a a mood or an attitude of resentment or aversion

169
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,799
or ill will or criticalness you know where we we have the idea something is

170
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:31,639
wrong even as we step into the room and we have to figure out what that is and we have to figure out what to fix or

171
00:32:31,639 --> 00:32:37,799
what to avoid and um who are the people who are the bad people the wrong people

172
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:43,360
and who are the people who are not there's kind of built-in kind of mood of

173
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:49,039
a verion that can be there and most people don't think that they have that

174
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:55,720
but um there was a time in my life you know many years ago almost 50 years ago where

175
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:02,080
um um my friend friends would say Gil you you seem to always be angry and um I

176
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:09,279
didn't think I was angry at all but somehow there was a mood underlying mood of and it was probably something like

177
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:16,720
resentment that things were difficult or challenging and I was upset about it and uh it took me a while to kind of

178
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:23,559
see that that was the case and some of it I was able to see only by doing starting to meditate regularly and then

179
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:28,799
slowly I started to see that under underneath my ordinary kind of way of

180
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:36,120
being in the world thinking about the world in fact there was a kind of anger or aversion that was operating there and

181
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:42,200
uh slowly that began to relax and hopefully now there's very little of it

182
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:48,399
left and um the um so to uh part of the

183
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:55,639
function of meditation practice is in fact to discover these kinds of things and if we're too enamored

184
00:33:55,639 --> 00:34:02,840
with uh becoming calm having pleasure in meditation we might not notice if we're

185
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:08,158
too uh caught up in trying to avoid tension and stress when we meditate we

186
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:13,760
might not stop to take a good look respectful look at the tension we have

187
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:20,919
the stress the strains we have in order to identify what is really going on here for us and uh so we can see the

188
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:27,118
underlying mood that might be operating attitude and then once we see something

189
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:33,398
it's like then there's opportunity then there's a almost like space has cre create been created that now something

190
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:39,280
can begin to unfold or relax or evolve or change in a healthy way but without

191
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:45,280
knowing uh things can often be kind of locked in but knowing begins the process of

192
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:51,878
changing so knowing is quite important and not knowing is important

193
00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:57,320
so to recognize something and then not know what's supposed to happen not not

194
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:04,960
know a judgment and not know an opinion that we overlay on top of it and um uh

195
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,400
kind of to make room for something that we can't predict to allow it to happen

196
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:16,040
many times in my life I've been surprised that things evolve differently than way I thought they were supposed to

197
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:21,800
evolve sometimes I thought they turn were going in the wrong direction sometimes I thought they were going in a

198
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:27,320
good direction and um then they would go opposite of what I thought

199
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:32,720
but what I've discovered is that if I show up to be present for the situation

200
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:39,920
it tends to move things in a good direction certainly tends to move me in a good direction this this simple

201
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,359
presence and that simple presence can be characterized by not

202
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:51,599
knowing um uh the respect of being present without bringing our

203
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:59,960
preconceived ideas our memories our expectations of what is we're going to see or be with so I would like to offer

204
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:05,480
an alternative to aversion to ill will if we have this simmering background

205
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:13,240
kind of ill will or aversion or complaining or criticalness that's going on and um or we have resentment towards

206
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:18,359
some even anger towards someone that we know and it's very clear it's not like a

207
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:30,400
attitude it's just like when we see that person that's what comes up is um the um uh an alternative is be

208
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:37,000
curious when you feel aversion when you feel hostility

209
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:43,119
criticalness shift over to a curious State a curious attitude what's

210
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:50,800
happening here what's going on here I think this is a time to understand better this is a time to have a kind of

211
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:56,319
beginner's mind I don't really know but let me study let me pay attention what's happening to this person what's

212
00:36:56,319 --> 00:37:03,319
happening to this situation so that we're kind of stepping forward interested as opposed to

213
00:37:03,319 --> 00:37:08,400
stepping forward critical and uh so even if if we're

214
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:17,119
angry with someone maybe there's good reason for it if it's safe enough for you to do it um is to step forward and

215
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:22,240
say and find out what's happening with you what's going on or how are you or uh

216
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:27,400
just be show your interest and curiosity um

217
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:32,880
and this is a way of coming forward with some modum of a not knowing mind

218
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,200
genuinely curious what's going on here but also when we step forward with the

219
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:43,640
Curiosity with interest we're actually creating space for the other person to

220
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:50,640
change um but if we could step forward with them with our criticalness with our preconceived ideas uh people feel that

221
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:57,520
and they feel boxed in they feel like they have to defend themselves or react or take a stand or something but if we

222
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:04,640
come forward kind of with the equivalent in our attitude with open

223
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:10,359
arms uh tell me more i' like to know more how are you what's going on uh it

224
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:17,200
can uh disarm people which is a powerful powerful metaphor that uh we use that

225
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:25,280
sometimes um that we can uh catch people off guard they uh most people are uh

226
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:32,760
relaxed if we show genuine interest in them and maybe we begin discovering something deeper about the situation the

227
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:40,280
person than we would if we stayed in our critical stance uh stayed in our anger only and

228
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:45,920
I'm not saying it's easy to put aside anger there might still be there but see

229
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:51,200
if you canot let it be the attitude by which you operate instead have an

230
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:58,079
attitude of curiosity step forward what's happening here what's going on on here and that

231
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:05,119
could be a gift in a sense many people um uh don't get enough experience of

232
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:10,440
people who are interested in really knowing what's happening with them what's going on some people don't want

233
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:16,800
you to probe but um but to you know to come with a beginner with a not knowing

234
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:24,720
mind and oh hi what's happening with you how are you today and how have you been and and

235
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:30,720
um and uh making space and then perhaps some of the things that some of the

236
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:35,880
reasons why we're critical of someone maybe that person begins to relax and

237
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:42,280
some of those reasons won't be the present in the moment maybe the past issues are still there but in the moment

238
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:48,920
maybe that they begin operating in the way that's difficult for you and certainly I think it's much better for

239
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:55,839
us as practitioners to come forward with curiosity and interest than it is to

240
00:39:55,839 --> 00:40:02,000
come forward with aversion and resentment and anger and uh and maybe the person who

241
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,839
becomes disarmed is ourselves and um and maybe in some kind

242
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:15,560
of way uh it's healthier for us it's safer for us it's uh it's um has greater

243
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:21,680
benefits for us to be that way than it is for others maybe that's what you can also

244
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:27,359
discover how you are what happens to you curious

245
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:34,040
when you come forward curious about others so if you have occasion to be

246
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:39,119
about around uh other people these next few days and especially for Thanksgiving

247
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:47,560
where there might be a number of people family members who are challenging perhaps friends who are challenging um

248
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:52,880
um see what it's like to come forward with interest in

249
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:58,400
curiosity so thank you very much and and uh I'll be here tomorrow morning which
