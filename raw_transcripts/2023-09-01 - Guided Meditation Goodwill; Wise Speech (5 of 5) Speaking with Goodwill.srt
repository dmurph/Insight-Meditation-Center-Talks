1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:08,519
so hello everyone and welcome to this Friday and um

2
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,860
Pride Friday morning meditation in California and

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:19,199
I appreciate all the time zones that people are in it's a kind of different way of feeling

4
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:26,580
connected around the globe thinking about it and I appreciate seeing the names with the greetings so here on

5
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:34,620
the YouTube chat and it's nice to see all the names and it's and nice to see the names that you know

6
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:41,640
become familiar with now over time so welcome

7
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,739
there's a I think in I don't know maybe ancient maybe not so

8
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:53,399
ancient saying that um when meditating

9
00:00:53,399 --> 00:01:03,440
watch your mind when in the world watch your speech

10
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:10,260
and the two these two watchings these two

11
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:17,700
ways of being mindful are closely connected because what we say is closely connected

12
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,920
to what's happening in our minds and hearts in our life

13
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:29,159
often it's a manifestation of it and one way to get a sense of your

14
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:35,880
quality the characteristics the mood of your inner life is to notice how

15
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,159
you're speaking and when we're watching our mind in

16
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,740
meditation it's also possible to watch how we're speaking to ourselves

17
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:55,020
they kind of thoughts we have and the quality their tone of the thoughts and the and the

18
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:00,600
attitude that's in their thoughts and sometimes those can be quite

19
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,840
um they can be quite um

20
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,140
friendly and sometimes the way we think inside can be harsh

21
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:20,040
sometimes they can be confident and sometimes to get me anxious sometimes they can be critical and other

22
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:28,319
times they can be appreciative sometimes they are consumed with in a

23
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:38,459
painful way around thoughts about me myself and mine but I and sometimes they're thoughts which are

24
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:46,739
free of I or a lightness and ease around the

25
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:52,620
the eye that they might the thoughts might be about so watching the mind

26
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:59,420
and this uh watching the mind becomes a

27
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:03,200
appreciation of

28
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:11,459
uh observation of how good it is just to be

29
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:17,760
aware just to be mindful but maybe to do so with a friendly

30
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:25,680
attitude that sometimes it's possible to see that

31
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,440
the alternative to a friendly attitudes towards oneself and

32
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:39,000
meditation his painful it's not really it's stressful

33
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,640
so if that's the case why not be friendly why not be kind

34
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:52,220
why not have kind thoughts friendly thoughts so

35
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,500
to begin by you know

36
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:06,440
excuse me so to begin and um

37
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:15,420
intentional way to do so mindfully thoughtfully

38
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:20,940
to enter into a meditation posture and even if you're already in such a

39
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:27,500
posture maybe there's some small ways to adjust

40
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,380
the way your head is on your shoulders

41
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,198
the openness in the chest

42
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:46,919
maybe there's a way that the spine can be a little bit more alert

43
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:50,960
by elongating it a teeny bit

44
00:04:53,880 --> 00:05:01,080
and seeing if the hands fingers can be in a relaxed way soft

45
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,460
and lowering the Gaze and

46
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,720
closing your eyes

47
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:25,560
taking you a few long slow deep breaths in a slow gentle way as if it's a

48
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:32,479
friendly greeting that you give yourself hi

49
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:41,400
and then that deeper breath than usual to greet and to meet

50
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,880
a greater range of your embodied experience

51
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:05,759
and then to exhale a little bit Fuller than usual

52
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,820
in a friendly way almost as if or as if

53
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,740
you're saying appreciatively ah

54
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,940
as you exhale

55
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:40,860
breathing normally in with a normal breath

56
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:49,400
in a friendly way to relax parts of your body

57
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:56,840
is if you're offering kindness or Good Will to each part of your body that relaxes

58
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:11,060
even if it feels strange to be friendly to parts of your body

59
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:23,180
it's good for the heart for us to be friendly to all things

60
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,638
and then to settle into your breathing

61
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:12,740
as if you're meeting each inhale and each exhale

62
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,539
with friendliness with good will

63
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:24,360
that you're not trying to you you use the breath for your purposes

64
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:31,699
or manipulate the breath or be aggressive with your breath

65
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,979
they're not even holding on to the breath

66
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,899
put a continual Act of friendly warm-hearted

67
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:45,740
attention

68
00:08:53,700 --> 00:09:01,940
allowing the breath to be as it is and in your friendly gaze

69
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,339
maybe the breathing can just settle relax

70
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:19,200
maybe the breathing can breathe more easily because it doesn't have to satisfy

71
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,519
any of your desires or wishes for anything

72
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:32,420
breathing just breathes in you a friendly Observer

73
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:40,100
accompanying breathing a friendly companion

74
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,160
right there alongside each breath

75
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,399
foreign

76
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,440
foreign

77
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:51,779
perhaps for the purposes of this meditation to assume that all the different ways

78
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:57,180
you can be fit into two categories

79
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:02,480
either there's a General Goodwill

80
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:06,438
or the absence of Goodwill

81
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:14,899
and in whatever way you recognize the absence of Goodwill or the opposite of Goodwill

82
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:23,600
meet that with kindness meet that with a kind of friendly Goodwill

83
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:29,059
perhaps a kind of Goodwill

84
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:39,080
that allows a thinking mind to relax become quiet

85
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:21,440
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

86
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:27,919
to imagine that your awareness

87
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:38,580
is like Midas Touch that whatever you touch with awareness

88
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:47,720
whatever you're aware of whatever you know that your awareness is touching it

89
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:53,779
with whatever deeper attitude you have

90
00:27:54,779 --> 00:28:01,940
it has an influence on the world with what touch

91
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:07,580
you're aware of it with what way you know it

92
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:16,440
and perhaps as the end of this meditation turn your attention outward now into the

93
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:23,419
world around you in your immediate neighborhood

94
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,799
The Wider Community you're in

95
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:35,120
The Wider Circles of neighbors and friends and Families

96
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:44,299
A Wider Circle of people out across the lands

97
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:52,980
and to have that attention to the wider World spreading outward

98
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:59,340
for it to be an expression of Good Will well wishing

99
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:05,400
for everyone as if you're you are touching everyone

100
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:11,580
lightly Softly maybe with a small

101
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:19,020
touch on the back upper back I'm here with you I care for you I wish

102
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,440
you well

103
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:34,020
to live dedicated to finding ways to have good will

104
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:40,440
for all beings may all beings

105
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:46,278
be the beneficiaries of our good will

106
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:52,039
may all beings become happier

107
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:00,320
knowing there are those who have good will to them

108
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:05,240
may all beings feel safer

109
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:15,860
in the circles of our good will

110
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:22,620
may all beings be more at peace

111
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:31,279
knowing through with people who have good will care and love

112
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:38,039
and may all beings be free of sorrow and suffering and stress and

113
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:45,019
despair knowing

114
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:52,159
that they are supported by those who have good will for them wish them well

115
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:58,919
may we live this day offering our good will

116
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:05,539
to all that we meet may all beings be happy

117
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,319
[Music]

118
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:28,340
thank you

119
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,580
so

120
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:31,020
we come to the fifth of these five talks on a wise speech and these are five

121
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:36,659
Reflections that we can do before we speak or after we speak

122
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:44,340
and not because others should they were obligated to be this way but because these are five ways that

123
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:51,360
we can flourish our hearts can flourish them are the Dharma path can flourish in

124
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:57,539
US and their ways of supporting the flourishing of others

125
00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:04,700
so to speak when it's timely the right time

126
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:10,860
do not rush to speak or avoid speaking but to consider what's the right time is

127
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:20,600
it now is it some other time and to speak honestly speak the truth

128
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:27,720
where we're not in no way trying to deceive anyone or manipulate anyone with our speech

129
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:33,500
to speak in a way that is um

130
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:39,240
touches the heart the pleasant way but deeper than just pleasure something that

131
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:44,700
pleases the heart our heart and that of others

132
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:51,000
to speak what's beneficial what's helpful if it's not helpful if it's

133
00:33:51,000 --> 00:34:00,419
if it's the opposite of beneficial maybe don't say it and then today to speak with Goodwill

134
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:05,940
with Mehta with loving kindness or kindness with friendliness like all

135
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:11,580
words that Translate and uh one of the remarkable things that

136
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:18,260
for me personally that I discovered as I went through this Buddhist practice is that um

137
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:23,780
when I do not have a good will when I'm not

138
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:29,460
open-hearted to be with people that uh to use that metaphor then I'm

139
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:36,240
close-hearted there's a way in which I'm not that way that I'm not really fully

140
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:43,320
myself or in the coming from a place where I feel most at home or comfortable or free

141
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:49,618
and it isn't that I'm supposed to always be have good will necessarily there's challenging situations to be and

142
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:56,580
but that for any extended period of time to not have good will means I'm somehow

143
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:02,760
caught in something or stuck in something and not that I have to have supposed to

144
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,920
have good will for others I just don't want to be limited by the opposite that

145
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:13,619
I want to be the suffering or the strain or the stress it doesn't feel good to perpetuate that

146
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:20,460
and to live that way and so I learned that um that uh and I

147
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:27,300
came to have a profound trust in that it's in theory possible to have good will for everyone

148
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:35,700
and I'm motivated to live that way or to find that way or to practice to attain that not as an attainment

149
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:44,280
exactly but more as as a way of arriving or being fully here in myself with the

150
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:50,880
world free and so the reference point for that is is there Goodwill or not if there's not

151
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:56,880
then there's work to be done there's practice to be done and uh internally not to force myself to

152
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:03,720
have good will and um and and so

153
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:10,140
but that but to speak with Goodwill has benefits for oneself

154
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:16,560
I said earlier that there's this Axiom that in meditation watch your mind in

155
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:21,900
speech in the world watch your speech and when there's a reciprocal

156
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:27,180
relationship between the mind and our speech that the the how our mind is is

157
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:32,940
often how we speak influences are speaking but how we speak will have an influence

158
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:40,200
on the mind so if we speak angrily if we're angry and speak Angry Words that will usually

159
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:46,260
kind of often reinforce the mind's tendency The Habit to be angry

160
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:52,320
if we speak if we if we feel friendly and we speak in a friendly way that

161
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:58,320
reinforces the tendency the the disposition of the mind to be friendly

162
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:03,720
so and sometimes it's okay to speak with

163
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:10,680
friendly ways in Goodwill if it feels sincere enough so that it benefits ourselves

164
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:16,680
and that's one of the reasons to do it is a self-benefit that comes and I keep emphasizing this so that we

165
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:24,119
don't take it as a moral obligation to be ethical or live from Good Will

166
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:29,359
and by having a moral obligation kind of to to to

167
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:37,380
um kind of fake it or kind of uh force it or kind of pretend or it becomes kind of

168
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:44,660
a Sacrament surfacey kind of Goodwill but I say that that so that

169
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:51,660
we benefit from it it's really in Buddhist practice we want to always check in with ourselves and how are we

170
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:57,300
right now and is this really serving me is this beneficial for me

171
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:02,339
and um and does this touch my heart in a deep way

172
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:07,380
and um and if we kind of use that as a reference point then it's a lot easier

173
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:13,500
to want to find the way to live with an open heart with freedom with good will

174
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:19,500
and as we then Express that good will then that is more likely to support it

175
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:27,060
than if we don't continue that benefit for ourselves and we get the added bonus that's very

176
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:33,540
important and maybe it's a primary motivation for sometimes is we're actually wishing well for others we want

177
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:39,960
others to be well and good but we're not overriding ourselves and just trying to sacrifice ourselves for

178
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:46,079
others well-being at all costs we are caring for ourselves as much as we're

179
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:53,760
caring for others we're using the reference point of our own Freedom or our own lack of Freedom as a guide for

180
00:38:53,760 --> 00:39:00,240
how to be in the world in a useful way for others because how we are

181
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:06,720
is as important as what we say and so that's why when we ask ourselves

182
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:13,320
is it the right time one of the things we check in with uh how is how I am the

183
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:19,800
way that the best for me to be able to speak right now maybe I need to go walk around the block and meditate a little

184
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:27,839
bit because so I can be in a better place to speak how I am uh you know is uh is where the

185
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:35,280
truth comes from you have much more clearer sense of what's true if how you are settled and calm and and attentive

186
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:40,440
sensitive and how we are if we are in a in a

187
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:48,060
friendly place a kind place a compassionate Place loving place then it's easier for us to speak words that

188
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:54,720
touch the heart of others that are gentle and then is it beneficial

189
00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:00,599
and I would like to propose that sometimes the content of the words what we actually the words we're actually

190
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:07,440
saying and what they mean has less to do about what's beneficial than how we say it

191
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,540
and I think it's been said that in many settings people who can speak with

192
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:20,400
respect for others with kindness for others with support with a certain level of confidence and presence can have a

193
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,800
much bigger impact than those people who say the same thing but don't have a

194
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:33,180
sense of confidence or care or respect for who they're speaking to so how we are might actually be more

195
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:39,839
important uh if a part of the communication than what we're actually saying

196
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:48,180
and then is there good will this again has to do with how we are is are we is is are we

197
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:54,720
expressing or manifesting Good Will in our speech for friendliness in our speech

198
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:01,440
and um and if we do it's good for us it's healing for us

199
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,660
so these five criteria of speech

200
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:15,420
and um and I'd like to end the series by uh a teaching by tiknar Han about our

201
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:22,859
right speech but I think his context has to do with the precept of not having not

202
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:28,520
not lying and it's a lovely kind of thing

203
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:34,619
oh where of the suffering caused by unmindful speech

204
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:41,040
and the inability to listen to others I vow to cultivate loving speech

205
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:46,079
and deep listening in order to bring joy and happiness to others

206
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:51,420
and to relieve others of their suffering knowing that words can create happiness

207
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:57,000
or suffering I vow to learn to speak truthfully

208
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,460
with words that Inspire self-confidence joy and Hope

209
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:08,579
I am determined not to spread news that I do not know to be certain

210
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:15,960
and not to criticize or condemn things of which I am not sure I will refrain from uttering words that

211
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:21,000
can cause division or Discord or that can cause the family or the

212
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:29,280
community to break I will make all efforts to reconcile and resolve all conflicts however small

213
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:35,160
and I took this from a book a particular Hans called for a future to be possible

214
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:40,440
I just love the title um so we want to live and speak in a way

215
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:47,099
that makes a good future possible for all of us and um

216
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:55,440
so uh I hope that um this week on why speech has given you

217
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:01,680
something to think about and for today and maybe through the weekend maybe you

218
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:07,800
can use the concept nothing else the concept and you're

219
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:14,099
history of good history any kind of good history you've had of Goodwill friendliness kindness

220
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:19,859
and use that as a reference point to Simply Be Like a mirror to see yourself

221
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:25,680
better and if you just use that as the mirror to understand yourself better I wonder

222
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:32,099
whether you'll actually move towards having more good will even without

223
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:39,119
intentionally wanting at her potentially making it happen I have a tremendous trust in the power

224
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:45,839
of looking at ourselves deeply that if we do so we'll naturally want to move to

225
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:53,400
a way of being which is better for ourselves and others so uh

226
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:59,359
thank you and I look forward to being here with you again on Monday
