1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:09,080
welcome welcome before I turned on the recording I was just I don't know having a delight

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:15,519
and how many of us are coming together for these practices it's such a beautiful thing we're doing together

3
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:22,039
thank you for that and today I'll continue on this

4
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:28,960
theme of faculties for fearlessness fine five faculties for

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,440
fearlessness forever and uh I'm sure we can make up

6
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,120
all kinds of alliterations but we'll start with a guided meditation and then

7
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:47,480
we'll introduce the fourth faculty and when I'm saying the fourth it's not necessarily the fourth faculty in the

8
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:53,520
traditional listing of the five faculties I'm choosing to do them in a

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,920
different order and to emphasize particular aspects of the faculty so not

10
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,280
in the most common conventional

11
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:10,240
way so start our

12
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:18,280
meditation just tuning into the

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,880
posture whether you're sitting on the floor sitting on a

14
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:31,600
chair or even lying down can there be a sense

15
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:39,520
of uprightness and not a way that is stiff

16
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,360
or forced but in a way that maybe conveys a

17
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,719
sense of respect for yourself for the

18
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:06,360
practice love ing the vertebrae of the spine to stuck one upon the

19
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:23,560
other and maybe moving the chin backwards just a tiny bit someone might

20
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:30,959
not even be able to see how much you move but it opens up the vertebrae or

21
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,160
the experience in the back of the

22
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:47,080
neck allows for a little bit more stability a bit more

23
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:50,879
openness this tiny

24
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:07,440
movement and then getting a sense of this

25
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:13,360
posture at this moment in general the sense of

26
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,920
uprightness the contact with the surface whatever contact whatever

27
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,120
surface the body is

28
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,680
contacting

29
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:52,519
ring into the bodily experience feeling grounded connected

30
00:03:52,519 --> 00:04:02,840
we're here and the body is in this

31
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:34,880
configuration and can you make

32
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:41,199
this bodily experience be a

33
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,199
container a

34
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:56,199
receptacle right now for a sense of kindness openness

35
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:01,560
spaciousness in whatever way that makes sense to you

36
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,880
you can we connect with a sense of openness maybe some softness or

37
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,479
relaxation

38
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:46,000
in a general sense not bracing ourselves

39
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,360
against what we imagine might happen but instead to have an attitude

40
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,638
of welcoming and warmth and

41
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,479
care

42
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:15,720
and can we connect with an acknowledgement that practice is a

43
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,080
movement of kindness and

44
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,240
Care way to honor and respect

45
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
ourselves

46
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:43,319
and with this attitude of care and warmth bringing attention to any areas

47
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:50,080
of the body that feel particularly tense or

48
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,720
tight I often mention the eyes and the

49
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,439
jaw they often have tension not

50
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:20,680
always the shoulders can rise up or get tight can

51
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,840
we allow the shoulder blades to slide down the

52
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
back

53
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,680
and softening the front of the

54
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,440
body the chest the

55
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
belly

56
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,199
bringing attention to the back of the

57
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:19,440
body if you're leaning against a back rest feeling the contact feeling the

58
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,879
contact on the buttocks the back of the

59
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:34,760
legs and feeling where there's not contact on the back of the body

60
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:53,839
also we're just noticing nothing in particular needs to

61
00:08:53,839 --> 00:09:01,200
be happening we're just bringing awareness bringing attention

62
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,480
the different parts of the

63
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:12,480
body different

64
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
experiences

65
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,620
recognizing that it can be [Music]

66
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,480
sounds just letting them be

67
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:01,040
there and then resting our attention on the sensations of

68
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:07,680
breathing the movements in the body as the body

69
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
breathes

70
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:41,600
the stretching in the chest and the release of the

71
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:54,800
stretch movement of the abdomen in and

72
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:03,480
out or feeling the different temperatures of

73
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,440
air as it enters and exits the

74
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:23,480
nose whichever of those locations is most comfortable most accessible to you

75
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:29,079
right now just rest attention there with this

76
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:31,800
sensations of

77
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
breathing

78
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:26,160
it's natural for the mind to wander unless you're in some very deep

79
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,880
meditative state

80
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:39,279
and so when we notice we just begin

81
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:45,959
again all judgments or evaluations of our

82
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:52,440
practice of ourselves that's extra and not

83
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:01,399
needed we just rest attention on the Sens sensations of

84
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
breathing

85
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,839
and we practice in such a

86
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:31,440
way that we're resting attention on the S sensations of

87
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:38,440
breathing and making

88
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:47,720
space for whatever arises making room for whatever shows

89
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:55,240
up might be sounds may be the bodily

90
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,680
experiences thoughts

91
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:12,160
sense of doing both resting with the sensations of

92
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:18,680
breathing and allowing room for whatever else is showing

93
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
up

94
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:29,809
[Music]

95
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:38,639
[Music]

96
00:28:42,120 --> 00:29:01,849
[Music]

97
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:22,159
morning good afternoon good evening welcome welcome as I explore the fourth session

98
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:30,600
on this uh theme of faculties for fearlessness and as maybe I'll say again

99
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:35,640
that I'm not using going through the faculties in the traditional order and

100
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:40,880
in this uh exploration of the faculties and fearlessness I'm emphasizing

101
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:46,320
different aspects of fearlessness it's kind of uh started

102
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:51,679
with I wanted to do something about fear and but I wanted to do something

103
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:59,320
uplifting about fear rather than just talking about fear and and so this idea of faculties

104
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:05,720
of fear like how can we use them as a support because it turns out that

105
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,880
naturally humans have fear sometimes it's really obvious and sometimes it's

106
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:18,200
really subtle because there's a way in that risk is just a part of human

107
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:25,279
life in fact if there were a life that's not open to the uncontrollable elements

108
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:31,679
in the world and therefore not subject to fear then that life would be a Divine

109
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:37,519
Life that would be like a god right Not a Human Being because human beings have

110
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:43,000
risks we're vulnerable whether's accident disease

111
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:49,200
impass humiliation loss failure these things happen to

112
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:56,320
humans and if we don't like maybe address them or acknowledge them there

113
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:01,880
can be this effect this long-term effect of like perpetually feeling fear and

114
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:07,200
there's a way that we just become habituated to it and not even noticing

115
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:15,679
the different ways it shows up and then this um impact of this like uh continuous or

116
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:20,760
long-term feeling of this subtle lowgrade fear maybe with spikes of a lot

117
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:26,159
of fear is affects our ability to take

118
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:31,200
risks which includes things like feeling

119
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:38,240
deeply feeling love feeling the loss we all have

120
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:44,639
losses and also affects our ability to think uh independently and not just be pushed

121
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:50,600
around by whatever sources we have in contact with whatever news sources or

122
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:56,360
social sources you know maybe there's a little bit if we just are so used to having some fear then we don't say like

123
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:02,760
no wait I'm going to think about this myself and also having this maybe a

124
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:09,960
long-term chronic lowgrade fear really impacts our ways to express

125
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:17,279
ourselves with creativity or innovation to bring something new into

126
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:24,080
the world not that we have to share it but even for ourselves and there's this powerful book

127
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:30,159
that I really like I'll just mention briefly it's by David biles b y l and

128
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:37,919
Ted Orland and it's called Art and fear art and fear by David biles and Ted

129
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:46,760
Orland and this this way that they really talk about this how fear kind of like a robs us as some of our

130
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:54,320
creativity so and there's a way that it can render us you know this fear a little bit more like passive so this is

131
00:32:54,320 --> 00:33:00,960
why part of the reason why I like to address fear then quickly I'll just do a review of

132
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:07,679
the preceding weeks the first week was Sati which I talked about noticing noticing our environment and noticing

133
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:14,480
our own experience then I did S as maybe collectiveness and

134
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:20,039
wholeheartedness bringing this centeredness or wholeheartedness to the

135
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:26,840
sense of no the resistance to the fear which is a little bit different

136
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:32,360
than do it to fear if you can do it with fear great but instead this sense of resistance to

137
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:39,399
fear and then yesterday was sadada or Sada is confidence and trust and this

138
00:33:39,399 --> 00:33:44,559
confidence in the practice this confidence in ourselves just enough

139
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:51,120
confidence but also a trust to this natural inner process that moves towards

140
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:57,399
greater freedom and wholeness and then way this trust that

141
00:33:57,399 --> 00:34:03,240
what's needed from us is to just get out of the way sometimes right sometimes

142
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:09,878
effort and now I like to introduce a fourth faculty and that is

143
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:17,040
Viria Viria is often associated with the power and virility of the warrior it's

144
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,679
this you know strength and hero and exertion to make extraordinary

145
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:28,118
accomplishments and we're not going to be talking about

146
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:33,800
that instead I'd like to focus on a different aspect of

147
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:39,240
Viria courage sometimes via can be translated

148
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:45,560
as courage and so courage is this capacity to face the

149
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:52,919
fear as best we can it's the power to stand one's ground

150
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:58,280
even though there's just exactly what we don't want is

151
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:03,760
there and being it's this courage is to be with the

152
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:10,240
fear and the resistance to the fear as best we can I've been talking

153
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:16,000
about how to work with the fear but it turns out we also need courage sometimes

154
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,560
we need courage just to notice or acknowledge that we have fear or just to

155
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:29,560
acknowledge that the resistance to the fear because it doesn't matter how many

156
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:35,400
Buddhist teachings we've heard it doesn't matter how much meditation experience we've had if we can't just be

157
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:42,599
with our experience in our daily life when these difficulties arise something difficult like fear and sometimes we

158
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:49,319
just need some courage courage to show up for what's

159
00:35:49,319 --> 00:35:55,560
happening as best we can bringing with us the tools or the knowledge that's

160
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:03,280
available to us at that time time because let's face it sometimes when fear is up we don't have access to

161
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,480
our greatest wisdom always we don't have access to a sense of groundedness and

162
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:14,720
presence always so sometimes courage is what's

163
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:21,800
needed and sometimes this courage shows up as the capacity to avoid

164
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:28,520
despair sometimes it's courage to not collapse in this tempted sometimes to

165
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:34,119
surrender and this collapse sometimes it takes courage

166
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:41,520
to stay upright to be with our

167
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:50,000
experience there's this way and we can like um refuse to be open to new ex

168
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,800
chances or new experiences and we have this Movement we just want to be closed

169
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:04,119
down and isolate and be secluded and in this way we might feel a little bit less

170
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:10,960
vulnerable but we need courage when terrible things are

171
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:20,280
happening so that we can acknowledge them as best we can notice them as best we can gather

172
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:29,160
ourselves around the resistance to them as best we can and to have some confidence and

173
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:35,839
Trust as best we can and not only is courage needed when

174
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:41,000
difficulties happen but sometimes we just need everyday courage to

175
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,720
expand we need everyday courage just to change yes I've been doing it this way

176
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:53,160
for a lifetime yes I've been having these beliefs for a lifetime but maybe

177
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:59,359
there's something different that's available ailable maybe there's something

178
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:05,720
more something more beautiful and there's no guarantees

179
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:13,160
right that if we open up and allow something more that there won't be difficulties as well so it takes some

180
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:18,960
courage so then the natural question is okay Diana you're talking about courage

181
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:26,640
how do we develop Courage the buunis texts don't really

182
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:32,040
help us out here they don't have anything specific to help us with

183
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:37,119
courage they have the stories of the Buddha towards um right before his

184
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:45,319
Awakening had this determination he was going to sit and find the way to complete freedom and as he did so Mara

185
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:51,440
the we might say is the embodiment of whatever gets in the way of

186
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,520
Freedom Mara assailed the Buddha the armies some of you might remember

187
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:03,960
remember a number of months ago I did some 7 AMS on Mara so there's stories of how the

188
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:11,760
Buddha was able to behave with courage there's also this story of the

189
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,839
Buddha even before with the mara he recognizing that when he went to

190
00:39:16,839 --> 00:39:24,720
meditate in the jungles sometimes he'd be afraid hearing sounds and thinking that some animal was going to come and

191
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:32,160
um eat him I guess attack him and he had the courage to bring

192
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:38,079
mindfulness to his bodily Sensations and to stay in those postures so we have

193
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:43,359
these stories but how do we develop

194
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:51,640
courage well one way is this connection between courage and

195
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:56,920
trust and I recognize trust is not always readily available either but is

196
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:02,760
there a way that we can connect with something bigger than

197
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:10,079
ourselves this might show up be different for different people maybe there's this way to take the refuges in

198
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:16,760
the Buddha Dharma and SAA we in fear is to help kind of have some courage can we

199
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:23,560
do some meta practice radiating sending good will out into the world and to

200
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:29,920
ourselves connecting with others in this way maybe there's some devotional practice whatever devotional practices

201
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:37,160
make sense to you some people do chanting practices some people do uh

202
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:44,440
bowing some people will spend some effort with setting up an altar and and putting on the altar

203
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:50,400
what's uh meaningful and important and uplifting for

204
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:58,800
them so this connection between courage and trust and this maybe openness of

205
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:06,480
heart and I appreciate that brne brown she's a I think she's a psychologist

206
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:12,839
sociologist I'm not exactly sure but she has this book entitled the gifts of

207
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:19,359
imperfection Renee Brown the gifts of imperfection and she writes that courage

208
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:26,880
is a habit it's a virtue and you get it by doing courageous Acts

209
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:33,000
just like you learn to swim by swimming you learn to Courage by [Music]

210
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:39,640
couraging so is there a way that we can show up for those small little

211
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:44,920
things the spiders for me it's spiders I used to be

212
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:53,359
really afraid of them but I'm so much better now can just show up with spiders so we practice with the small things

213
00:41:53,359 --> 00:42:01,240
maybe connecting with things that are bigger than us the refuges devotion

214
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:07,359
chanting and certainly we come to meditation practice thinking that it will lessen some of the difficulties we

215
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:13,079
have or that we'll gain some wisdom we'll gain some new understandings maybe even have some cool meditative

216
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:20,800
experiences and for all the reasons we come to this practice alleviate the suffering that we have practicing with

217
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:28,440
courage is probably not high on the list but and yet at part of what we're

218
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:34,520
practicing is courage you might have some different

219
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:43,240
experiences and showing up for them even though it might be unknown uncomfortable

220
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:50,280
unfamiliar a courage to face things in ourselves that we haven't seen before

221
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:55,920
with meditation practice the courage to face things one more time even though

222
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:01,440
we've seen them so many times before so we have been practicing courage in these

223
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:06,640
small ways so just by coming back to the

224
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:14,400
cushion again and again coming back to the breath again and again is a way that we've been practicing

225
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:23,119
courage so this fourth faculty of Viria I like to emphasize this idea of

226
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:29,760
Courage it's how we one way to work with fear is to acknowledge and be with the

227
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:36,640
fear and I didn't start these this series on the faculties of

228
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,760
for fearlessness with courage because if it were easy to Have Courage then you

229
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:48,400
wouldn't you know then you wouldn't need any of the other factors but I'm starting I'm introducing it as the

230
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:54,400
fourth just this recognition that you might need other things to be with the

231
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,559
not only the fear but the that resistance to

232
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:06,640
fear so today may you notice all the small ways in which courage is showing

233
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:13,119
up for yourself and can we notice what does it feel like to be willing to maybe be a

234
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:18,160
little bit more vulnerable to show up and maybe a little bit more spacious

235
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:25,440
open way so I'm wishing you all a wonderful rest of the day today and I look forward

236
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:34,880
to seeing you tomorrow as we exp explore the last faculty for fearlessness thank

237
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
you
