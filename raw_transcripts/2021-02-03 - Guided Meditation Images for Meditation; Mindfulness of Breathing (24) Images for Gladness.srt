1
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,160
so welcome

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,639
and a warm hello to all of you

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:21,119
and sometimes when seeing all the locations

4
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,640
where people are sending in their greetings on the chat

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,600
i have a kind of very kind of vague imagination of having a globe

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,640
in front of me and having lines drawn between all the places that are named and

7
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:47,120
take into account all the places that are not named and it'll be quite a net quite a

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,920
a interconnected net of community of people with similar

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,079
interests sitting here to meditate and doing a practice which i believe brings

10
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,360
out the best in people and so it's a wonderful act of

11
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,760
imagination and and that is the topic for this week

12
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:19,600
the ways in which imagination can support meditation rather than detract from it in a certain

13
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:26,560
kind of way if we don't use our imagination then we get used by it but

14
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:33,040
and but it's not just our own imagination we get used by but um there's a lot of people who

15
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,799
are trying to hijack our imagination or plant images and ideas in our mind

16
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,399
advertisers politicians you know all people who are providing us

17
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:50,560
with imagination imaginary scenarios that sometimes are done very cleverly to really kind of penetrate

18
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,079
deep inside of us and then they remain and and were used by them or influenced

19
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:01,119
by them and it's also possible to

20
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:08,720
use our imagination creatively or and use it for the purpose of meditation

21
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:15,680
and it takes wisdom to do that takes skill to do it in a way that's actually supports the mind to wake up to be

22
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,840
present to become stable and and then at different levels of

23
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,879
stability of stillness different forms of imagination might come into play

24
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,080
so that if you hear different instructions for imagination some of them might not work for you

25
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,360
because either because you don't have a reference point for them or because

26
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,840
they belong to different degree of stability either than you have

27
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,519
maybe less or more something but the buddha certainly

28
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:56,879
was his teachings are filled with what could be called images of the imagination images of

29
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,319
similes ideas and a basic one for meditation

30
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:08,800
is um the idea of sitting with the sitting as stable as

31
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,879
the earth or sitting as firm as a pillar

32
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:24,959
that it's planted deep in the ground so it's not going to wobble at all or being as calm as a surface of a still

33
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:31,680
lake and there's it goes on and on these kinds of images that buddha uses

34
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,040
which are tapping into the imagination and i'll say this later but part of the

35
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:43,440
purpose of this tapping into the imagination is because the imagination itself is

36
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,879
tapped into so many different aspects of our inner life the to our emotional life for

37
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:56,959
physical life kinesthetic life to our motivational life to um

38
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:03,439
to our thoughts and memories and things and so imagination somehow has a

39
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:09,360
capacity to contribute to the unification the integration that is samadhi

40
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,439
as we're getting more present and more collected in meditation the process of meditation

41
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,639
is a process of collectedness or unification or some people like to use the language

42
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:27,600
of becoming whole and imagination can be in the service of that because of what it evokes within us

43
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,440
it's certainly not true for everyone and everyone if people have different ranges of

44
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,919
relationship with imagination but for this week we're looking at the

45
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:46,720
building on the buddha's use of imagination in order to cultivate stability

46
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,639
but also presence but also gladness to have gladness or a certain degree of

47
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,919
joy in meditation so to take an

48
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:05,120
upright meditation posture and

49
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:13,280
to adjust your posture so it begins to feel stable

50
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:20,560
one of the advantages of sitting cross-legged is the stability of the legs and the buttocks on the

51
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,840
on your cushion a broad wide foundation

52
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:34,479
anything that supports you the weight of your body can provide a foundation of stability

53
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:42,000
and to imagine this body that you're sitting in is here like

54
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,639
a mountain

55
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,280
stable strong

56
00:05:53,280 --> 00:06:07,840
unfazed by the wind that flows by or the clouds that wash over

57
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:23,600
imagining that the mind is like a clear quiet lake calm wind not blowing

58
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,360
water still and the mind is broad and wide

59
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:35,840
like the wide broad lake

60
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,080
and imagining the moon the heart is like a full moon

61
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:52,800
fully exposed fully open fully here

62
00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:03,840
the heart shines its light peacefully on all things

63
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,520
and then the buddha uses an image for tuning into the breathing that one

64
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:26,400
uh tunes into breathing like a woodworker does on a

65
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:33,840
on a with a chisel on a lathe carving a piece of wood or maybe we

66
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:41,680
would say a potter turning clay on a wheel

67
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,080
and to make this contact with something which is moving around in

68
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,199
a circle the cycles of in-breath and out-breath

69
00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:00,639
and this image of a someone working a lathe or working

70
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:08,400
clay on a wheel is partly an image of making contact and

71
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,759
keeping the contact there

72
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:19,840
so to take a gently with his contact with the body breathing

73
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:27,840
taking a few long slow deep breaths

74
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:06,880
and as you exhale maybe like a dam which has opened its doors so water

75
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:13,600
can flow out to relax your body

76
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:24,320
so there can be a flow of vitality flow of ease calmness from the places where you relax

77
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:36,080
relaxing the shoulders

78
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,360
relaxing the arms and the elbows hands

79
00:09:47,440 --> 00:10:05,839
relaxing the chest the belly

80
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,880
and breathing easily be naturally

81
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:05,839
as if the piece of clay now has become smooth and round

82
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:12,839
bowl on the wheel and it just feels light and smooth and

83
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:18,640
easy to allow the turning of breathing in and

84
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:29,839
breathing out

85
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:45,279
your whole body is the bowl awareness is feeling

86
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:52,320
as you breathe breathing in and breathing out

87
00:11:52,320 --> 00:12:11,839
that kind of intimacy with a body breathing

88
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:44,160
and as you're sitting here bring to mind

89
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:52,000
gently quietly whatever sense of goodness or

90
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,839
gladness that comes from the simplicity of being here

91
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:06,480
meditating where you're somehow what's absent

92
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:16,079
is the busyness of the day

93
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:21,040
what's absence is the challenges of the day

94
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:31,839
the crowds of people

95
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:45,839
driving in traffic

96
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,079
and if you can stay quietly focused on the breathing

97
00:14:52,079 --> 00:15:01,519
and not giving in to thoughts of desire thoughts of ill will

98
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:13,839
thoughts of anxiety and regrets thoughts of doubt

99
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:27,199
this begins to feel like similar to being free of debt

100
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,800
or free of an illness

101
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,240
free of oppression

102
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,480
free of being lost in thought

103
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:52,639
and these ideas of this freedom from these things for the buddha it is meant to be a

104
00:15:52,639 --> 00:16:01,199
source of gladness to take a few moments to appreciate

105
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:11,519
what is not here right now that feels good to have put aside

106
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:18,959
and which gives you an intimacy and a peacefulness even if it's mildly so

107
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:23,839
with here and now and being present

108
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:33,120
feeling the goodness of this maybe being glad to have these moments to be free of

109
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,839
these things

110
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:35,840
perhaps making a small half smile

111
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:42,000
that maybe supports a gladness or a contentment

112
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:50,400
that's willing to be just here in whatever goodness whatever

113
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:57,039
pleasure or contentment that is available

114
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:07,520
as you turn the wheel of breathing in and breathing

115
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,840
out

116
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,960
in a sense smoothing out the bowl of your body

117
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:31,840
the bowl of clay on the wheel

118
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:05,360
with the image of a mountain feeling whatever stability is here in

119
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:13,360
your body resting in that stability as if you're a

120
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,840
mountain

121
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:35,200
as if your mind is a broad peaceful lake

122
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,760
feel whatever ways the mind might be that way

123
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:53,840
broad and still even if there are some waves on it

124
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:11,120
and then whatever way the heart feels like a full moon

125
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:21,039
exposed open floating in the air in the sky in space

126
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:35,840
feel that luminosity and freedom of the heart

127
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,440
and they're breathing like a gentle breeze

128
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:07,679
that blows here and there through the body through the mind through the heart

129
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:22,000
connecting you to stability and stillness

130
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:31,840
and freedom of the heart

131
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:49,919
and staying centered here in this mountain-like body

132
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:55,520
still mind and open heart

133
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,240
open the awareness up out into the world

134
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:09,440
as if the stability spreads out from the place you're sitting out across the

135
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,639
surface of the lands

136
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:21,440
as if a peaceful stillness spreads from your mind out across the

137
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,398
air and across the seas

138
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:36,080
and as if the freedom and luminosity of the full moon heart

139
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,840
shines all over the globe

140
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:49,360
and you for a few moments undisturbed by the

141
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:57,600
suffering of the world but in this undisturbed way

142
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:05,279
perhaps you can tap into a heartfelt wish of compassion care

143
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:09,440
wish for the welfare of all beings

144
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:23,200
may all beings be happy

145
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:32,720
may all beings be free of suffering

146
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:39,840
may all beings be safe from all forms of harm

147
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:47,840
physical mental emotional

148
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:53,760
may all beings be peaceful

149
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:02,159
sharing as we share our peacefulness with them

150
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,399
and may all beings be free

151
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,960
as we do not limit them box them in

152
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:20,640
with our ideas and desires expectations

153
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:33,200
may the benefit of this meditation together spread out into the world for the

154
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,440
welfare and benefit of all beings

155
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:46,960
and they do so through our deeds of body speech and mind

156
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:55,360
may today be a day for spreading for caring for the welfare

157
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,840
of others

158
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:08,730
[Music]

159
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:51,200
so there has a has been a strong tendency in the west i think to present the buddha's

160
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:58,640
teachings in a fairly rational way and to emphasize the the

161
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:04,000
empirical nature of it and it's really about seeing things as they are

162
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,960
in direct way and and in doing so sometimes we left behind

163
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:17,358
or go unnoticed the tremendous degree in which the buddha and the buddhist early buddhist tradition

164
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:24,158
is using its using imagination using creativity of images and ideas

165
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:30,560
and imagination uh to support the teachings but not just

166
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:35,839
the teachings but to provide us with a

167
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:45,040
a different reference point for both the teachings and the practice than simply ideas irrational ideas

168
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:51,839
logical ideas that the buddha uses lots of similes

169
00:34:51,839 --> 00:35:00,720
lots of poetry lots of images lots of little stories all of which touch into

170
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:07,520
other dimensions of our inner life than our rational cognitive understanding and um

171
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:13,040
it touches into our emotional life our kinesthetic life

172
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:18,480
our motivational life a lot that that part of it can be

173
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:24,240
inspired can be gladdened um it ties into our memory and our

174
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:29,920
associations and um so all these capacity and thinking as well

175
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:36,560
all these different faculties that we have get touched get awakened get somehow

176
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:43,280
brought into into the field of our dharma relationship with dharma practice

177
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:49,920
and this contributes the sense of unification that is samadhi cultivating samadhi

178
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,599
developing samadhi is really an important part in fact the buddha said that to see

179
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:01,520
things as they are cultivate samadhi and samadhi is unification

180
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:09,040
and unification is the is the bringing together of all our faculties together in a kind of whole working

181
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:15,119
dynamic working of the whole to really be in harmony that everything's in harmony

182
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:22,240
so using the imagination is a means to evoke that and elicit that

183
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:27,760
in support of the meditation practice or support of this freedom

184
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,960
and it is um so it has to be done of course carefully

185
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:39,920
it can be overdone and certainly people use their imagination for all kinds of things which are not

186
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:45,200
healthy or appropriate for dharma practice to spend a lot of time in fantasy and

187
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:51,440
and having a feeling of uh you know the delusions of grandeur of delusions of

188
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:58,079
great pleasure or you know just kind of you know kind of getting lost in the pleasure of fantasies and imagination or

189
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:04,640
getting lost in the fantasies of conflict and war and that we have towards with other

190
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:10,960
people all kinds of things uh you know goes you know really takes us away from this practice

191
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,720
and uh but the imagination that connects us to it we have to get a feel for it does it really connect does it really

192
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:22,720
help us be more settled more present for experience and it's using the imagination

193
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:29,359
to eventually go beyond the imagination um it's kind of a stepping stone and uh

194
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:35,920
and the kind of images that the buddha seems to use tend not to be stories or there's not

195
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:42,640
ongoing sagas that we're imagining they tend to be very simple like that of

196
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:49,440
a mountain or the earth or a lake um

197
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,800
the um you know so it's not like a story of things it's just kind of an image and sometimes it's the dynamic

198
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:00,960
image like the image of an underwater fountain from under in a lake the underwater spring

199
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:07,040
that's spreading spreading goodness throughout the body you know it's not a story it's just kind

200
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:12,320
of a dynamic image of what's happening another image that i love i'll do this

201
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:18,000
tomorrow some of these but so this integration process and as i

202
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,040
said before if we don't use our imagination it's all

203
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:29,760
too easy that our imagination gets used by others we internalize the images and imagination

204
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:36,640
that advertisements commercials politicians other people

205
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:44,000
make up and then we internalize them the way sometimes they're not beneficial for us actually it can be quite detrimental

206
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,599
imagining all kinds of terrible things that are happening in the world that

207
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:56,240
that uh that just kind of spiral us down and in a way that's not helpful

208
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:03,200
so it's not fantasy it's not uh to avoid or deny what's going on

209
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:09,680
run away from life as it actually is that we use imagination and buddhism but

210
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:17,119
it's really but it's with care about knowing how we do it so it really helps us supports us to be present

211
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:22,800
if it doesn't help us to be present there's no need to use it and it isn't like you're better buddhist

212
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:29,200
if you use your imagination but it is available to us support us to get kind of more focused

213
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:40,000
and so the one of the ways that the buddha

214
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:45,920
talks about developing gladness and meditation and gladness it leads to joy joy that

215
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:52,400
leads to tranquility tranquility leads to happiness happiness that leads to samadhi

216
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:58,160
is uh to appreciate what's absent as we sit and meditate

217
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:05,599
and in the the main the most common one thing that the buddha emphasizes is the absence of the

218
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:11,440
hindrances so when people are meditators they are often contending with

219
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:18,880
their hindrances the hindrance of desire aversion lethargy and resistance

220
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:24,960
agitation and regrets remorse and doubt these can be very strong very

221
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,560
compelling uh hooks in the mind to be caught up in thinking about these and involved in these

222
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:38,720
and we can get lost in desire fantasies and aversion fantasies and and you know caught up in resistance and

223
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:46,960
and our regrets and anxieties they really kind of get lost in these universes that these can create for us

224
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:52,960
and um and so as we settle down in meditation as we

225
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:59,680
kind of start getting more focused more relaxed more settled and start letting go of the force of preoccupation the

226
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:05,040
debate of all these kinds of thoughts that take us away from the present moment

227
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:10,560
and we're able to sit more a little bit more and more here here in the present moment there comes a

228
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:15,839
time when the hindrances have abated that they're not so strong anymore

229
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:21,599
and it becomes relatively easy to stay here and the image i used the other day of a

230
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:27,760
bowl large bowl i mean it's you know huge maybe a five foot diameter ball

231
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:33,760
that they have in some kind of children's museums and you put a marble

232
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:41,200
into that you drop a marble down the edge and that marble will move this way in that way and

233
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:48,960
until it momentum slows down and then eventually it falls through a hole at the bottom of the bowl or rests at the bottom of the bowl

234
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:55,520
but if you put a lean into the bowl and keep pushing the marble it keeps going and going going so to be caught in the hindrances is to

235
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,720
keep the marble spinning but to to finally settle down

236
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:06,880
and let the marbles all settle at the bottom of the bowl and rest you can feel in meditation so good the

237
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:12,240
mind just hear so at this at this point the buddha talks about

238
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:20,319
having gladness that one is no longer caught no longer hijacked by the mind no longer as

239
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:25,680
enslaved by the mind because the mind just pulls us away and has a mind of its own and we just pulled

240
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:31,920
along and we kind of lose a kind of freedom in the process and so to feel the gladness be glad

241
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:38,160
about this and here is where the buddha uses the uh teaches this as an act of imagination

242
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:44,720
an act of in a particular word that he uses that's translating as imagination here can be

243
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:51,599
a visualization and it has the word seeing anupasana in it

244
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:58,160
and it's some anupasana with seeing but it's not seeing through the physical eye but rather

245
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:04,079
through the mental eye of imagination and so he gives five similes for being

246
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:10,800
free of um of um the hindrances to be really here the

247
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:18,800
other absence and they are a person in debt who has become free of debt

248
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:26,800
a person who's terribly sick who has who is no longer sick a person who is in

249
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:32,880
prison and bondage in prison so even not just

250
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,880
in prison but in bondage you know tied down

251
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:45,040
who has become freed from prison a person who is enslaved who has become

252
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:52,240
freed of slavery and a person who has wandered in the desert for a long time

253
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:58,720
dangerous desert who has come out to the other side and is no longer lost free of wandering

254
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:06,640
in the desert and so buddha gives these five similes for being free of the hindrances

255
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:14,800
and it as the reason for these similes is to give a um a reference point

256
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:22,960
for something would be people would celebrate just be so happy you'd be so relieving so uh joyful

257
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:30,560
to be out of prison to be out of sickness and all these things unless we don't remember that we're

258
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:38,240
free of those things if we just like we're free of prison we just go on to the next preoccupation and concern and but to

259
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:43,920
take time not just to keep going back to the breath and back to the breath when we're present

260
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:50,560
but take time to really appreciate the goodness or the well-being or the

261
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:56,319
the delight that being free of the hindrances are being focused and present

262
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:02,000
so that the goodness of that becomes spreads through the body or opens up more widely or

263
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,520
brings a kind of a gladness that is part of this integration process this

264
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:13,839
unification process that we're beginning to not just keep doing the laser focus of the mind

265
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:19,040
if we ever did it that way and just kind of like staying focused focused focused but there's a kind of a

266
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:25,119
mellowing and opening and settling experience of just softening here

267
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:30,400
that the gladness can give birth to and as we allow this gladness to

268
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:36,640
this joy space for it we don't pump it up strongly we don't it's just kind of just natural hopefully

269
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:43,040
a natural kind of joy or gladness that is available when we take time to feel the goodness of

270
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:50,319
this what's happening in meditation then that is what uh allows the growth

271
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:56,800
then of joy and happiness um that is on the way to a strong samadhi

272
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:03,440
so um so another talk on the use of imagination

273
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:09,359
and and it takes some wisdom to know what kind of imagination when what to

274
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:14,800
use maybe when we first sit down what to use when the hindrances have abated but

275
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:21,280
and not to make a big project of it but to note this available to us and it's like a little aid a little

276
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:28,160
quiet support that it is meant to support us to to be inspired

277
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:34,079
to stay in the present moment and to feel the goodness the well-being that comes when we really settle down in

278
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:40,640
meditation uh we're allowed to be present here and now we're allowed to enjoy it

279
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:48,079
and uh and this is the stepping stone for going deeper and in some ways in a more powerful way

280
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:55,040
into this 16 steps of anapanasati which we'll be coming to and but for now

281
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:01,440
i'm just trying trying to introduce you to this territory of imagination which uh

282
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:07,520
can come into play when we start feeling settled in meditation that supports the further settling and

283
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:12,560
uh and absorption in the very practice we're doing

284
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:20,440
so thank you and i look forward to [Music]

285
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:23,440
tomorrow
