1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,920
so good day everyone

2
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:16,640
and welcome to our meditation time together and beginning of the week

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:23,760
and as a very brief overview of this practice of mindfulness of breathing

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:31,199
it begins with a training in attention and in a sense attention or

5
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,879
awareness sits at the middle of this practice

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:44,960
and that establishing this attention this mindfulness then uh and helping establish it more

7
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,000
consistently more thoroughly more fully

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,320
that awareness is centered on breathing and breathing stays at the center of

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:03,840
tension and breathing attention on breathing stays at the center and as the capacity to stay more in the

10
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,159
present moment more continuously with the breathing then either

11
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,159
intentionally or as a byproduct of that settling of attention

12
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:23,840
the attention begins to expand and open up to include more and it includes then the body

13
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,960
and the feelings of the body and eventually the mind and there's a kind of a natural order to

14
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,680
it that kind of moves outwards all along we're staying with the breathing we're

15
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:45,119
keeping breathing at the center it's like having a a home base or having a

16
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:51,759
secure place from which to be free to not get wrapped up in things cotton things and to stay with the

17
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:59,200
natural rhythm of breathing where we have to let go constantly and and accept the new in-breath and let go

18
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:06,880
of the old breath we're learning to kind of keep the mind the heart relax soft

19
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,400
free as we begin to open up into areas of our life that might be more difficult

20
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,800
and we're more likely to get caught in and entangled in so the continuity of saying with the

21
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:25,599
breath is a way of having an effective attention to the rest of our minds and the rest of our

22
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:31,680
being attention to the body being centered in the body makes it easier to be attenti

23
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,680
attentive to the mind and so forth and so with this week we'll begin with

24
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,720
uh moving into more more closely into

25
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:49,440
aspects of the mind and so to begin

26
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:59,760
to uh establish oneself in your place of meditation

27
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:07,360
really take a few moments to really feel maybe sway back and forth rock a little bit

28
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,720
to really feel the contact where your body is supported

29
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:19,120
from the pull of gravity and to be in that contact in a way that feels

30
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,560
supportive and solid

31
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,640
and then to gently close the eyes

32
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:40,799
and because attention and intention can be closely related

33
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:49,200
it's helpful at the very beginning to do some intentional breathing just for a little bit not the whole time

34
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,799
not really loud or anything but just a way of beginning to orient oneself to the breathing

35
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:02,959
and beginning to let go of other things so very gently maybe

36
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:10,319
let yourself breathe more deeply maybe three quarters full

37
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:16,880
don't you have to fill your lungs entirely two-thirds full three-quarters full

38
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:23,280
whatever feels kind of easy for you to do but to take a fuller breath than usual

39
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:30,240
but not too much and then as you exhale

40
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:38,479
exhale slowly not too slowly but just exhale slowly

41
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,840
so the exhale is longer than the inhale

42
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:10,960
and as you inhale a little more deeply fully let the attention let that filling of

43
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,960
the lungs and also be kind of a feeling of attention

44
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,840
in different places of your body where there is tension

45
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:30,800
in the long slower exhale let that be a draining of that tension

46
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:38,160
so letting your attention roam around your body as you breathe in

47
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:45,280
filling awareness into places of tension or holding

48
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:53,840
and relaxing as long exhale

49
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:07,840
especially it can be useful to soften the shoulders

50
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:15,120
and the belly so the belly hangs out tanks forward a

51
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:21,840
little bit forward and maybe down

52
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,800
and also as you exhale

53
00:06:46,800 --> 00:07:03,840
maybe there could be a global relaxation of the whole body

54
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,080
and then continuing with taking an in-breath which is maybe a little bit

55
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:30,479
more full than usual it doesn't have to be two-thirds full or

56
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:36,479
three-quarters full just a little bit more and with an exhale that's a little bit

57
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:45,840
more intentionally slow and long just a little bit

58
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,360
and then begin to count your exhales up to ten

59
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,240
and as you count one two the different for each one number for

60
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,520
each exhale

61
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,639
maybe you can say that number in the way that you would delightfully

62
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:16,800
and happily say the word yes to something

63
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:25,039
that tone of voice softly quietly but kind of an uplifting

64
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:32,800
happy intonation of one one

65
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:40,959
two and if you lose count no worry just

66
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:47,200
start over again at one and doing this counting is a way of

67
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:55,839
beginning to settle the attention down into the experience of breathing

68
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,600
and the counting is a way of giving the thinking mind something to think

69
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,640
so the rest of your thinking can become quieter

70
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:23,839
can fall away

71
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,240
uh and then if you'd like you continue with the counting

72
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,880
but let the breathing be now really natural

73
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:22,639
or you can let go of the counting and as you breathe

74
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:30,800
feel the whole body as you breathe in whatever way the global experience of

75
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:36,800
body is easy to experience it doesn't literally have to be all of

76
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,560
it just as globally as is available

77
00:13:44,240 --> 00:14:03,839
maybe as if breathing is a massage that moves through this global body

78
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:20,160
and as you experience the global body become aware also of any

79
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,520
thing that's pleasant or enjoyable

80
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:33,760
that comes from doing the meditation and it could be very mild

81
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:39,840
sometimes in meditation there's nothing but if there is

82
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,200
breathe with that include that in the breathing

83
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,240
the breathing that moves through the global body

84
00:17:50,640 --> 00:18:01,840
breathe with the pleasure the enjoyment

85
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:27,039
feeling a present moment well-being that encourages the mind to become

86
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,919
quieter thinking less

87
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,520
and more able to experience what's happening here and now in the

88
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:43,840
body breathing

89
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:51,039
breathing with the contentment of the body

90
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:57,840
the calmness

91
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:48,880
and then as you're breathing now on this basis of being rooted in your

92
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,720
body maybe feeling some well-being

93
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:05,120
also now become aware of the sensations associated with

94
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:11,039
the mind with the activities of the mind

95
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:18,880
in particular with thinking so there might be some sensations of

96
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:26,640
tension or pressure contraction

97
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:37,600
maybe an ache or maybe it's agitation or excitement

98
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:51,760
or maybe the mental activities is characterized by some emotion or mood

99
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:59,840
whatever sensations characterizes the mind

100
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:07,840
how the mind is active and involved let it completely be that way

101
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:17,039
no need to make it any different but let that be known

102
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:24,639
as you breathe with it stay rooted in your breathing

103
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:32,799
and in a simple easy way know the sensations connected to the

104
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,679
thinking mind

105
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:45,840
breathing through those sensations

106
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:52,000
staying rooted in your breathing breathing with the sensations

107
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,799
of body and mind being unconcerned with the details of

108
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:04,400
what you're thinking or what you're feeling any concern with the

109
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:10,240
why just for these simple minutes

110
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:17,120
breathe with the sensations the physical sensations of thinking and

111
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:23,520
feeling and emoting as if those sensations have complete

112
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:33,840
permission to be there and you just breathe with it

113
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:57,600
instead of thinking about or fixing anything with

114
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:09,760
mindfulness of breathing is just to breathe with what's here with a kind of intimacy or closeness

115
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,480
a calm careful willingness to just breathe with what is

116
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:22,240
here trusting that that's enough

117
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:31,039
for these few minutes just breathing with the sensations of bodies sensations of

118
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,840
mind

119
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:53,919
and then as we come to the end of the sitting and turn our attention

120
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:59,840
to the world outside of us ourselves

121
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:05,279
one of the profound things we can do for others

122
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:12,799
is to accompany them and if we learn to accompany ourselves

123
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:19,120
just breathing with our experience allowing our experience so whatever it

124
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,840
might be to be there

125
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:31,919
to unfold itself the way it wants to unfold but just accompany it

126
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:39,360
maybe it also teaches us how to accompany others without getting tense

127
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,398
or activated

128
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:51,600
to be able to offer a kind supportive presence

129
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:58,639
that allows others to relax cause others to be themselves

130
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:10,640
it allows others to be more attuned to themselves

131
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:17,279
so that they can move to greater health

132
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:28,480
and may it be that as we end this meditation that we dedicate the benefit and merit

133
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:36,080
of this practice to accompanying others

134
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,919
our goodness our calmness

135
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:50,000
our friendship

136
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,159
without being too complicated or

137
00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:05,840
too ambitious about what we can do for others company it can be one of the great gifts

138
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:13,600
and as we learn to accompany ourselves may we better accompany others

139
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:22,559
with the wish the aspiration that all beings may be happy

140
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:29,360
all beings may be safe

141
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,600
all beings may feel respected

142
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:42,080
beings may be peaceful

143
00:31:42,399 --> 00:32:01,840
and that all beings everywhere may be free

144
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,360
you
