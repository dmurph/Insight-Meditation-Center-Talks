1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,600
so good morning everyone and good day

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,400
and

3
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:25,279
i think most every time i sit down to meditate i feel lucky

4
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:31,679
i feel fortunate to be able to enter into this very

5
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,920
rich world of um

6
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:45,200
maybe i can say of health that

7
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:53,680
meditation is often associated with calm and peace but part of the function of relaxing and

8
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:00,480
becoming calm is not for the purpose of calm but it has other purposes

9
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,479
and one of the purposes is to allow our psychophysical system our body and mind

10
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,240
our hearts to

11
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,560
reorganize and to come into a kind of

12
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,680
health healthiness a kind of wholeness

13
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,320
a kind of harmonious working when it's not being interfered with

14
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:36,079
by our attachments our fears our projections our fantasies

15
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:41,360
and to come to this very sim kind of a radical simplicity of mind

16
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,520
where we're learning to leave our system alone in a wise way

17
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,720
and what makes it wise is a number of things but one is we

18
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,920
really understand well how we interfere how we get entangled

19
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:05,520
caught up and and it's a phenomenal process

20
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,039
because even if a person is physically sick and maybe even dying

21
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,560
there's a way in which to get out to have learned how to get out of one's own way

22
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,560
there can be a radical feeling of healthiness wholeness or harmony

23
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,959
that gathers together that settles here that is independent in a certain way of

24
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:36,760
being sick or even dying i have known people who are been phenomenally

25
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,280
spiritually psychologically as they die but they did not were not healed from

26
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,959
the illness that that they were dying with

27
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:55,920
so this idea of sitting then to get out of the way but also to allow

28
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,120
this rich valuable thing that this system we have to make space for it to

29
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,159
allow for it to you know move through us to

30
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:13,200
settle to reorganize come to all the puzzle pieces of our life can come together click together

31
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,920
and make a whole puzzle that can't be if we're spinning and juggling all the puzzle pieces

32
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,519
and uh and

33
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,959
so to stop spinning stop juggling stop running stop

34
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:37,640
pulling away and just to be here and make room for this

35
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:43,599
self-organizing self-healing self hole-making

36
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:49,920
hey w-h-o-l making that

37
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,680
that meditation can become so to

38
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,280
assume a um

39
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,840
upright

40
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:13,280
meditation posture and upright is very subjective so each of you even if you're

41
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:21,519
laying down to to be there in a way that feels

42
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:28,280
psychologically upright like here i am

43
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,520
and sometimes before letting go of attachments and

44
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:45,520
before relaxing it's good to when we sit down and assume the posture

45
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:54,080
to do so definitively to do so in clearly inhabiting

46
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:00,320
the space in which we're in even if it's just the space that the body fills

47
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:08,560
as if we have a right to be here as if there is a dignity and worthiness

48
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:16,639
self-respect a definitive feeling of yes i am here

49
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:24,160
and it's okay to be here without any movement of diminishing

50
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,720
oneself devaluing oneself and to begin with this definitiveness

51
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:39,240
here and that can be done with this posture taking a upright posture

52
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:47,360
and to begin a process of relaxing and

53
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:54,479
harmonizing with yourself you might begin by

54
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:01,440
taking a lowering your gaze

55
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,720
if you're looking at the screen maybe no longer looking at the screen but

56
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,560
rather letting your eyes go down 45 degrees

57
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,800
so the gaze is soft relaxed maybe unfocused

58
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,800
with nothing in particular you're looking at

59
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,000
and then gently closing your eyes

60
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,440
and sometimes taking these three or four deeper breaths at the beginning

61
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:52,960
can also be a kind of definitiveness that yes here i am and it's appropriate i'm here

62
00:06:52,960 --> 00:07:00,000
it's okay this is my place to inhabit this life

63
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:08,639
no diminishment of our value breathing in deeply

64
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:16,039
and as you exhale to let go into this kind of self-respect

65
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,400
definitiveness of being here

66
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,520
and then letting your breathing return to normal

67
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:01,919
and as you exhale relax your body

68
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,199
not a giving up but is settling into being completely

69
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:16,960
here in this body bringing things into harmony or

70
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,599
allowing the puzzle pieces to come together

71
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,440
relaxing the belly

72
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,599
relaxing the chest

73
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,720
relaxing the shoulders

74
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,160
and as you're exhaling softening the face

75
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,240
the face that carries so much of our emotions

76
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:34,600
so much of our concerns and our responses to the world

77
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:43,399
giving it a chance to rest to relax

78
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,240
and then in the mind relaxing any tension or pressure

79
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:05,000
contraction in the thinking muscle

80
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,640
that's associated with thinking

81
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:19,839
allowing your thinking to become quieter softer gentler

82
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,440
maybe even slower

83
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:40,399
and then to settle into the body breathing

84
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,920
and when you begin to exhale a little

85
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,200
small attitude of allowing

86
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,240
the exhale to unfold

87
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:14,399
as you beg inhale begins allow it

88
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,440
to appear allow the inhale to

89
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,680
get bigger

90
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,200
and it's not so much that you're you are directing here

91
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,160
it isn't so much that you're directing your attention

92
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:50,320
to the breathing as it is that you're allowing

93
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,560
the breathing to arrive into awareness

94
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,000
you're allowing breathing to occur

95
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:19,600
and if it's possible maybe that feeling of allowing

96
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:26,959
can be from the whole the body body allows for the inhale and

97
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,680
the exhale

98
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:40,480
the whole body allows the inhale the sensations of inhaling they can move

99
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,839
throughout the torso freely

100
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,480
the whole body allows for the exhale

101
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:15,200
and staying connected to breathing letting the breathing stay connected to

102
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:23,519
you in this generous open allowing

103
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,639
for whatever wants to reorganize or heal

104
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,880
come together

105
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,560
the allowing is a kind of getting out of the way

106
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:52,000
so the self-organizing self-healing capacity within us

107
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:58,279
can slowly unfold and find its way

108
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,160
so

109
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:54,559
letting go of your thoughts so there's space for your body and heart and mind

110
00:19:54,559 --> 00:20:00,799
to come into harmony

111
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:05,158
or at least to begin that process

112
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:12,240
letting go of your thoughts and allowing breathing

113
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:21,240
allowing the body to be allowing the heart to be

114
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,240
so

115
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,600
and coming to the end of this sitting

116
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:30,159
to once again feel yourself here in this body

117
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:38,398
definitively without apology without

118
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:45,600
diminishing yourself without puffing yourself up for

119
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:53,360
without conceit but really here definitively present

120
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:59,679
alive breathing so there can be clarity

121
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:07,120
that here is a person who can offer good will to others

122
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:13,279
here there's someone substantial caring

123
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:18,080
you can turn their attention outward into the world

124
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,080
and be present definitively

125
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,480
with kindness generosity

126
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:35,760
compassion love so that the good will the love the care

127
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:42,080
the generosity itself becomes more definitive

128
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:49,960
more embodied it's clear that it's here

129
00:29:54,080 --> 00:30:00,240
and to consider how coming out of meditation

130
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:06,320
you might be able to meet the world with greater good will

131
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:11,600
greater friendliness and for the people that you'll encounter

132
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,960
in the next 24 hours

133
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,120
may you meet them with a generosity of heart

134
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,760
good will

135
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:33,760
spreading your good will out into the world

136
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:41,200
may all beings be happy may all beings

137
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:50,039
be safe may all beings be peaceful

138
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:58,240
may all beings be free and may we contribute to that

139
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,240
possibility

140
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:15,758
so [Music]

141
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:32,600
continuing on the theme of breathing mindfulness of breathing for this week

142
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:44,080
it's a remarkable experience to be at the birth of some mammal animal or human

143
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:49,840
being and to witness the first breath

144
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,960
and the first time i saw that was the birth of a calf

145
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,399
and and i don't know what was going on with a

146
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:06,640
calf but it certainly didn't look alive when it came when it was born came out

147
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:14,200
but at some point it took a breath and the eyes opened and there was life

148
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:20,640
and uh sometimes uh life is marked by the first

149
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:27,200
breath and marked by the other end of the marked by the last breath the last

150
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:34,720
exhale and in between we have a lifetime of breathing but each breath is a kind of in-breath

151
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:41,279
is kind of the beginning each out-breath is kind of a something comes to an end

152
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:49,919
and in that rhythm there's a kind of renewal there's kind of rebirth that goes on

153
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:58,240
and one of the aspects of mindfulness of breathing is how this this kind of rebirth or this

154
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:04,080
restoring that goes on and the theme for today is restoring

155
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:09,600
and um as people settle into meditation and settle into just being with the breath

156
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:15,600
and are no longer scattered distracted preoccupied

157
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:21,840
no longer caught up in their whatever dramas going on in their life

158
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:29,039
not to disrespect the drama but no longer scattered by it or disconnected from it but the whole psychophysical

159
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:36,480
system begins to get organized healed the jigsaw puzzles come back together and get settled

160
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:43,600
there's a restoration of health uh spiritual health or kind of psychological health that

161
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:50,399
to call it psychological maybe implies a little bit too much just the mind but it's very embodied

162
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:58,320
a sense of embodied health and that could happen even when uh the parts of the body are sick

163
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:05,320
and now it's a different kind of health than what we usually think of as physical health

164
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,158
and um

165
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:22,398
let's see someone just walked in little bit distracted

166
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:27,520
and so um

167
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:34,960
[Music] so this physical health and this

168
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:41,280
psychological health or spiritual help and it can feel like um

169
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:49,040
this is this is what's healthy this is what's

170
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:54,240
normal this is uh and when we settle into meditation some people and i've had this experience

171
00:34:54,240 --> 00:35:00,400
where this feels like the most healthy appropriate nice way of being

172
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,680
and uh whereas the um the uh

173
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,800
the ordinary daily life can feel that's what feels extraordinary

174
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,920
that's what feels like an altered state compared to what's the healthy state or

175
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:22,560
the feels the really normal state uh the healthy normal said oh this is really what life

176
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:28,160
can be about and uh it's kind of like if you've been

177
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:35,599
exhausted from working a lot then you take a nap or sleep and you wake up and you feel ah i'm restored

178
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:41,599
and so in the same way as we allow ourselves to settle into meditation and and

179
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:47,200
the ordinary concerns of life fall away and we're just here focused simply on

180
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:54,480
the breath but not focused on a way that's tight or constricted or or greedy for something but it's more

181
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,920
this sense of allowing respecting making room for our

182
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,960
experience almost like getting out of the way but not getting out of the way so that

183
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,480
we are no longer connected and attentive

184
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:16,560
really attentive to the breathing to our experience allowing it to wash over us allow the

185
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:23,680
breathing to kind of occur so the breathing can restore itself the breathing can find its way into some

186
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,880
kind of healthy and healing so that um

187
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:34,880
and with the breathing because the breathing is so interconnected to our emotions our body our thoughts our

188
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:42,800
psychology our intentions the whole uh phenomena of it it feels like

189
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:50,320
like it moves to health it moves to wholeness to harmony

190
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:57,040
to and and one of the wonderful feelings is to feel the sense now this is normal

191
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:03,680
this is what the ordinary is like and stress stressful mind that with people

192
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:10,640
ordinarily living under that's not the ordinary that's extraordinary that's

193
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:17,520
losing touch with the normal the healthy and so this um so there's a restoration

194
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:24,560
that goes on and that is not a restoration that is only about letting go of things

195
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:31,359
but it's also about allowing something to grow allows me to cultivate something to spread and develop and kind of be

196
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:38,160
here for us and the um

197
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:46,880
so the uh i call it the restoration and uh and it's a restoration where

198
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:53,520
uh independent of buddhist ideas of deep letting go

199
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:59,599
independent of ideas of not-self or independent ideas of emptiness or

200
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:06,079
kind of disappearing somehow in in awareness that all kinds of things that that can happen

201
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:11,280
um if those things are overemphasized then um

202
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,640
sometimes it feels like we're subtly or maybe not so subtly diminishing the

203
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:22,800
definitiveness the clarity the value of being a human being

204
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,920
and the restoration process of meditation uh is uh

205
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:33,839
is uh def is an important part of this process that we're allowing yourself to

206
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:39,680
become whole harmonious allowing things to settle to drop away

207
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:45,440
so that there can be this emerging of a kind of inner confidence and inner

208
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:51,839
strength and inner definitiveness that

209
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:58,960
feels like everything is in harmony and peaceful in such a way that if there is conceit

210
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:05,839
if there is a diminishing ourselves or a kind of a denying part of ourselves you can feel how that

211
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:11,520
the effect of that is is is stressful is off it's not quite right because it it's

212
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:18,480
a loss of the harmony it's fragmenting again and so we can't get too caught up in we

213
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,680
can't have conceit but we also can't have devaluing there's a kind of a

214
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:29,520
embodied restoration of wholeness that can happen and maybe this language i'm

215
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:36,320
using is too strong to implies maybe it has to have kind of

216
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:44,000
you know you know some strong way of being it's kind of uh gentle also

217
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:51,359
it's kind of uh sneaks up on us it's not something you can force or insist on or spend a lot of

218
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:58,240
time looking for but uh as we just stay with the breath and let go of our thoughts let go of the

219
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:04,720
ways we diminish ourselves or fragment ourselves and and just settle in and allow allow

220
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:10,960
allow the breath to breathe itself allow the breath to breathe through the body allow the body to breathe allow the

221
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:16,880
whole experience everything to come into awareness uh you might find that there's a shift

222
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:25,040
and a settling and a movement towards healing and wholeness and fullness that happens

223
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:32,079
and to start getting a sense of that can give a lot of confidence that we

224
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:37,599
a lot of confidence in the value of not prioritizing

225
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:44,160
our neurosis not prioritizing our suffering not prioritizing our

226
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:49,920
challenges and our difficulties and saying it that way not prioritizing

227
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,920
it that it's not meant to deny that these things exist or to push

228
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:01,440
them away or say that they're not worthy of attention they are worthy of the whole they are

229
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:08,400
worthy of being recognized but there's a strong tendency to over prioritize those to limit ourselves and

230
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,839
to narrow our life to our neurosis to our fears to our our

231
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:19,520
you know to our suffering our challenges and this process of

232
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:26,560
just settling into breathing being with a breath kind of begins to shift those priorities

233
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:32,160
so that something can restore something can re-emerge something can

234
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:38,319
can become whole so um

235
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:46,319
i hope that made sense so monday was relax tuesday was recognition

236
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:53,680
yesterday was respect today is restore and tomorrow uh will be release that is

237
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:59,839
often more closely related to you know identified as part of buddhist practice

238
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:04,880
and um but uh all with all the first four processes

239
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:11,760
set the stage for kind of a healthy release and um that's the topic for tomorrow

240
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,839
so thank you all very much and i look forward to meeting tomorrow
