1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:07,759
well hello everyone and here we are and i'm delighted to be here

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:14,719
and see names new and familiar names on the

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,039
chat uh so

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,800
um

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,960
so meditation could be seen as a special place kind of unique

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,970
if you'd like where for the duration of the meditation you are

7
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:45,120
[Music] forgiven for everything

8
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:52,879
and for the duration of the meditation that you don't have to bring the past with you you don't have to carry it

9
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:59,280
you don't have to be under the burden of it if you think it's useful to do that then

10
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,640
you know think wisely and maybe it is sometimes but you really allow to put it

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,880
aside kind of as if you're forgiven and

12
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:18,159
and then imagine that for this meditation you're going to meditate uh

13
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:25,920
from the most ethical place that you know the place that you know where you're

14
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,720
least inclined to cause any harm to anyone intentionally or unintentionally

15
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:42,079
least inclined to be mean or spiteful or least inclined to be greedy

16
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,840
but that so like this is what you know i would call the most wholesome place that we know

17
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:55,119
maybe in english we could say the most ethical place and to assume that stance assume that

18
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:01,040
place that place that you might know already or in or that you intuit or that you

19
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,840
have some vague feeling for a place where you

20
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,479
uh is maybe the ethical source for yourself

21
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:22,160
and uh and from there that place meditate on your breathing that place as

22
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:30,560
if you're that's kind of like the central the central uh the center

23
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,959
of it all then gaze upon your experience be mindful of your breathing and

24
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:44,160
whatever else is going on so assuming a

25
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:54,879
posture even that may be it's a posture of being confident

26
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:04,800
in your ethics at least for these minutes of the meditation before and after is a whole other story

27
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:12,560
but for this time to sit and upright or meditate in a way that you feel

28
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:19,200
reassured in your ethical stance

29
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,800
and gently close your eyes

30
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:35,519
and without breathing deeply just breathing simply maybe

31
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:42,640
tenderly breathe with whatever ethical

32
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:49,680
sensibility sense feeling that might be here for you

33
00:03:50,400 --> 00:04:01,840
just here and now

34
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:16,479
perhaps as you exhale to relax any holding in your body

35
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:31,040
any holding from the busyness or activity of life or of the mind

36
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,600
and then to relax the body as a way of relaxing both the body and

37
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,919
the mind relaxing the belly softening in the

38
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,320
belly

39
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,600
relaxing in the chest

40
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,000
and as you relax and feel the relaxation

41
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,800
begin the process of quieting the mind

42
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,120
and relaxing softening around the

43
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,840
shoulders

44
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,759
and also softening relaxing in the face

45
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:07,840
the cheeks around the eyes

46
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:18,800
and perhaps softening relaxing the brain itself or the thinking mind

47
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,680
softening and thinking mind

48
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:34,400
if the thinking mind if thinking are waves in the mind letting those waves flatten out

49
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:40,639
so the mind becomes more like a flat surface of a quiet lake

50
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:49,840
broad and peaceful

51
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:04,240
and now take a few moments to see if you can connect to some place

52
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,039
in your body

53
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:16,720
that holds or manifests expresses

54
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,720
a feeling for being ethical

55
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:33,919
a place where there's appreciation for the absence of tension

56
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:42,560
that comes when we're not hateful or greedy mean

57
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,840
critical

58
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:59,840
the absence of contraction or tension the absence of fever or agitation

59
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:10,479
perhaps the presence of some sense of ease or openness

60
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:18,720
peacefulness some sense may be of care

61
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,840
respect valuing of others

62
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:40,560
and if there's a place in your body that this is associated with

63
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:47,440
breathe with that place breathe with that breathe through it

64
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:55,839
and let that place be a support a mutual support

65
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,440
with settling in with your breathing

66
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,839
settling into

67
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,560
accompany here breathing one breath at a time

68
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:28,720
letting the thinking mind get quieter maybe with every exhale letting go of

69
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:37,839
thoughts settling in

70
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:51,839
with the ethical goodness that lives within you

71
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,519
whatever you're aware of in meditation

72
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:10,399
see if you can be aware of it in a wholesome way

73
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:18,160
in the place of wholesome ethical wholesomeness

74
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:30,800
each thing meeting it without it with a dedication

75
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:39,839
to cause no harm to oneself or anything else

76
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,840
okay

77
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,320
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

78
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:15,640
to once again take a few moments here to see if you can sit quietly

79
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:23,600
acceptingly of your own wholesome core the place

80
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:30,799
inside that's the source of an ethical life

81
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:37,360
a motivation to attempt to not cause harm

82
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,840
to others and to oneself

83
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:56,720
and to appreciate that for this meditation

84
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:03,760
we're sitting in a wide circle of community of people who are touching in

85
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:09,840
considering their own core of goodness

86
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:14,880
their ethical core core of non-harming

87
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:22,080
and what a unique thing to be in relationship to such a

88
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:29,200
large group of people with a similar maybe similar orientation for these

89
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,600
minutes

90
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:41,039
and may it be that the connection we have to our ethical

91
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:48,720
core that it's a place that we stay close to

92
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,840
so that we can go through the world

93
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:02,880
in a way that supports the welfare and well-being of others

94
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:10,960
it supports other people's feeling of safety and support

95
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:19,200
and maybe even is a catalyst for other people

96
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:26,638
to recognize their own ethical core one that's so easy to lose touch with

97
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:34,800
in the busyness and activities of life challenges of life

98
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:40,878
may it be that our practice today spreads from us

99
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:48,480
as a catalyst for the welfare and happiness of others

100
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:56,158
that can come when we treat each other with respect and kindness and dedication to

101
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:04,960
non-harming may no beings be harmed

102
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:11,760
may no beings be disrespected

103
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:19,839
may no mean beings be marginalized or

104
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:31,040
diminished in value

105
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:38,079
may all beings be happy and safe peaceful and may they live

106
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:44,240
in such a way that they breathe easily and freely

107
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:52,960
and that their hearts sick can sail fly

108
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:59,839
on the winds of freedom

109
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:13,659
[Music]

110
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:14,560
so hello everyone and

111
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,920
welcome to this time for a dharma talk

112
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,839
and today um

113
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:32,160
i want to uh bring forth some teachings of the buddha which is

114
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:40,240
timeless teaching for our society and that as in our society in our world

115
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:47,200
maybe in many countries around the world and down through the ages there have been people who consider

116
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:55,520
themselves superior to other people and and lots of conflict arises from

117
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:03,359
that and lots of inequities arise from that people are superior will have

118
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:12,720
greater access to wealth and power and status and all kinds of things

119
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:18,240
and it was the same way the time of the buddha and in the time of the buddha there was

120
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:24,400
a particular we might call class of people

121
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:30,400
some people considered use the word caste in relationship to them

122
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:36,000
that were known as the brahmanas and the brahmins at least some of the

123
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:43,359
brahmins the time of the buddha thought of themselves as superior to others to be the only ones who were

124
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:50,320
somehow in the way that the universe was created or the world was created that they were

125
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:57,119
somehow the only ones who are really pure really came from

126
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:03,359
the divine in the this the divine source of life in a way that was superior to every

127
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:08,720
other form of life and they should be treated that way and should be treated with respect

128
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:14,160
and with power and with sense of that they were purer and than everybody

129
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:21,040
else and and what we find is the buddha

130
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:29,359
who is often called sometimes called a peaceful sage was very very definitive in

131
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:36,720
undermining or not standing for this kind of teaching that he was

132
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:44,640
very strong and direct to oppose this kind of idea it wasn't that he was accepting of

133
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:52,400
everything or was sat in the background just let these things go along without addressing it that he was very he

134
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:58,720
addressed it very forcefully i would say especially when people came to him and

135
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:04,079
asked him about it especially when the brahmanas came to ask him about it

136
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:09,040
and so i wanted to read first

137
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:18,240
a passage where uh the brahma brahman is being quoted uh for um claiming that they are

138
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:26,880
you know the best um the

139
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:39,839
uh

140
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:56,560
so sorry sorry i lost my page that i prepared here here someone comes to the buddha for

141
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:02,079
example a brahmana and said master gotama the brahmans

142
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:07,280
say thus brahmins are the highest caste

143
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:13,520
those of any other caste are inferior brahmanas are the fairest caste

144
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:19,359
those of any other caste are dark only brahmins are purified not

145
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:24,640
non-brahmanas brahmans alone are the sons of brahma

146
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:30,480
the offspring of brahma the great brahma who somehow the

147
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:38,560
beginning of life born of his mouth born of brahma created by brahma heirs

148
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:44,880
to brahma so that's the claim so it's a pretty confident bold thing to say

149
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,800
and and so people would come to the buddha and make this claim and then in this

150
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:56,480
case they said to the buddha afterwards what do you think of this and in the sutra that the majima

151
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:02,000
sutra number 93 where i quoted from he goes through a whole series of

152
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,280
arguments uh undermining that statement and uh

153
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,880
the person who's asking him uh making this asking this question just won't accept any of the buddha's

154
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:18,160
arguments and the buddhist keeps going and going and going and

155
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:26,160
opposing or undermining the argument that it's uh that uh it's by their birth that they

156
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:34,000
are born brahmanas it's by um they're purity it's by their

157
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:40,880
all kinds of things and so he just kind of step by step goes through it all but there's one uh suta which is um i

158
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:48,720
think it's very it's a i think it is a beautiful suta it's mostly poetry called the vasata suta it's number 98

159
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:54,880
in this middle length discourse and this issue of caste superiority of some

160
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:01,040
people is a big theme in the 90s in the number of these pseudos in the 1990s

161
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:08,640
in the middle length discourses and this one is 98 and and here

162
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:15,200
the two brahman students who are extremely learned in the

163
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:21,119
ramonical lore and know all the brahmanical texts and histories and everything

164
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:28,240
and um and so um

165
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:33,040
one of them says that um

166
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:41,359
they asked themselves a question how is one a brahmana

167
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:49,760
and one student says when one is well born on both maternal and paternal sides

168
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:57,280
of pure descent as far back as a seventh generation of ancestors unassailable and impeccable with respect

169
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:03,200
to birth then one is a brahmana so it's really a matter of birth how you're born makes

170
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:09,280
you a brahmana and if you had this pure descent from seven generations and maybe before that from

171
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:15,680
brahma the god brahma himself then you get to claim the superiority

172
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:22,400
then one is a brahmana now the other student his name is and that's the name of the

173
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:29,119
suttas of he has a different point of view he says

174
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:34,240
when one is when one is of good behavior

175
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:39,280
and proficient in the observances then one is a brahmana

176
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:45,680
so what makes a brahman is their behavior when their behavior is ethical and to be a brahmana maybe to know their

177
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:52,640
brahmanical observances and be able to do those rituals and things like that and

178
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:59,040
so they have an argument and they can't one can't convince the other so they decide to go see the buddha and

179
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:04,240
ask him the buddha they think is you know well respected he's wise and and

180
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:10,400
certainly he'll have some good things to say about this and so they ask him that question they

181
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:16,720
say a dispute has arisen between us over the doctrine of birth

182
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:25,040
one of us says one is a brahmana by birth but i say one is a brahmana by action

183
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:31,119
by what one does since neither of us is able to convince

184
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:38,480
the other we have come to ask you sir widely famed to be enlightened

185
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:45,440
so the buddha says i will clearly explain this to you

186
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:51,520
i will explain it to you both in proper sequence as they are the generic divisions of

187
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:59,599
living beings for their kinds differ from one another so he's going to describe kind of how each

188
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:07,040
the different species of beings are unique and special to themselves and they differentiated by species kind of

189
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:12,960
and some people actually translate what follows with the word species to distinguish them

190
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:19,359
and he begins by talking about the grasses and trees know the grasses and trees as well

191
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:25,200
though they do not even make any claims for themselves they can't speak for themselves

192
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:30,319
their distinctive mark is produced by birth in other words what makes them

193
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:36,079
distinctive uh their characteristic is comes along with being born in as

194
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:42,640
particular kinds of trees particular kinds of plants for and their kinds their different

195
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:50,000
their varieties their types differ from one another so they have lots of different species

196
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:56,480
next come the moth and the butterflies even through the various kinds of ants

197
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:02,560
their distinctive mark is produced by their birth for their kinds

198
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:09,520
differ from one another they know the four-footed beings both small and large their distinctive

199
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:14,800
mark is produced by birth their kinds differ from one another

200
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:21,599
know that those whose bellies are their feet that is the serpents those long back

201
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:27,760
creatures their distinctive mark is produced by birth for their kinds differ from one another

202
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,880
note to the fish that dwell in water next the birds who fly with their wings

203
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:38,160
in the sky so he's going through all these beings

204
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:43,920
and saying their distinctive mark is made by birth because the repetition of it the contrast of what he's going to say

205
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:49,280
probably stands out in this oral culture in which he was teaching before it's almost like a song that's being

206
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:54,770
being being spoken um

207
00:47:54,770 --> 00:48:00,720
[Music] while among the many kinds of beings their distinctive marks are determined

208
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:05,760
by birth among humans there are no distinctive

209
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:12,640
marks produced by their particular birth or to say it may be in plain english it's a little hard to know

210
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:20,480
exactly how to translate this into english the pali but there's no species differentiation there's no

211
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:27,680
significant differences produced by human being that's distinguishes one person as being superior to someone else

212
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:33,680
one person a brahmana over someone else based on how they're born

213
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:39,680
not by the hairs or the head not by the ears or the eyes not by the mouth or the

214
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:45,440
nose not by the lips or the brow not by the not by the neck or the shoulders

215
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:51,839
not by the belly or the back not by the buttock buttocks or the breast not by the anus or the

216
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:57,680
genitals not by the hands or the feet nor by the fingers or nails

217
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:04,960
not by the knees or the thighs nor by their collar or voice birth does not make a

218
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:10,000
distinctive mark as it does with other kinds of beings so there's no

219
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:17,440
no characteristic that we're born with that separates us out from other human beings as being better or superior

220
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,960
from others it makes us a brahmana

221
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:28,240
separately among human beings nothing distinctive is found in their bodies so of course we know there's lots of

222
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:33,599
differences in people's bodies but there's no inherent distinction

223
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:40,319
that is the source or the reason to classify people as being superior or

224
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:47,440
inferior the name makes an interesting statement classification among human beings

225
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:55,200
is spoken of by designation so um it's by convention by designation

226
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:00,960
by con the constructs of the mind that we classify people in particular

227
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:07,119
ways and as soon as you call it a designation then it becomes a product of the mind

228
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:12,960
and culture and not anything inherent and so classification of

229
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:19,440
people is has some usefulness but it's always going to be somewhat fragile it's always good since it is a designation

230
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:25,119
it's just an a it's just a concept that's overlaying on top of human beings

231
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:31,200
it's it's provisional it's contextual um it's something which doesn't really

232
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:38,240
fit uh you know 100 percent all the time and so how to be wise about the

233
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:43,680
conventions the designations the concept by which we understand each other

234
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:49,119
um so the buddha is going to say a little bit more about his orientation around this

235
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:56,160
kind of idea um the humans the humans who live by

236
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:01,760
husbandry you should know as farmers

237
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:07,599
those who earn their living through crafts you should know as a craftsperson

238
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:14,000
those who live by trade know them as a merchant those who live serving others should

239
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:20,559
know as a servant those who live by stealing you should know as a thief

240
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:28,240
those among human beings who earn their living by archery know them as a warrior

241
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:34,160
those who lives by priestly service

242
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:40,800
know them as a priest and those who rule or a village in realm know them as a

243
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:46,400
king and none of these he says are a brahmana

244
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:53,839
so here he's saying that the class of buddha's orientation is to classify people as a designation for people by their

245
00:51:53,839 --> 00:52:00,000
roles by what they do remember one of the arguments of the two brahmanas was people are brahmana by

246
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:06,160
their action and here buddha says by their action is what we call people

247
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:12,319
that means that it only really applies when they're doing that action um that's

248
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:18,400
when it really makes sense and people change what they do and in sense change their roles

249
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:24,559
um a significant moment with my first end senior teacher i was talking about my

250
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:30,880
relationship to my father and and he said to me that oh your father

251
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:36,160
your father was a human being before he was your father

252
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:42,800
before you were born and the way he said it was like oh don't only see this person who's your

253
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:48,960
father through the lens of being a father this person has a whole other way of being in the world that's

254
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:54,880
kind of free of being a father just being a person in a different kind of way and that kind of gave me a different

255
00:52:54,880 --> 00:53:01,040
perspective and i realized how much i had taken certainly my father acted like a

256
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:06,720
father like you're supposed to if your father i suppose and so it makes sense to call him a father

257
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:11,760
but someone is a father when they're fathering

258
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:18,000
someone is a a worker when they're working someone is a barber when they're

259
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:24,240
barbering someone is a you know a cook when they're cooking and

260
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:30,160
so and then people can shift to these roles shift these activities and in a sense take on different

261
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:35,280
designation different names for them that's a little bit how the buddha sees

262
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:41,040
it but all of that all of that is not does not make a person a brahmana

263
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:48,000
so now that the buddha is going to say this is what makes a brahmana so rather than rather than jettison

264
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:55,599
throwing away this concept they had an ancient india of the brahmana as somehow being worthy of respect or i

265
00:53:55,599 --> 00:54:03,440
don't know if superior is what the buddha would say but worthy of respect or having some kind of value special value

266
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:10,480
rather than throwing that notion away he redefined it in his own way for his own purposes

267
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,599
and this is how he said it

268
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:23,520
i do not call someone a brahmana based on genealogy or maternal birth

269
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:32,319
um one who without hatred

270
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:39,440
endures insults attacks and bondage whose power is patience

271
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:46,240
that is the one i call a brahmana one who is without anger observant of

272
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:54,240
good behavior tamed that is the one i call a brahmana

273
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:59,520
one who understands right here the destruction of suffering for oneself

274
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:07,119
that is the one i call a brahmana one who having put down weapons towards all beings frail and

275
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:15,839
firm is the one i call the brahmana not hostile among the hostile

276
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:24,799
peaceful among those who have taken up weapons not taking not taking

277
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:31,119
among those who take not killing or making others kill that is the one i

278
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:36,960
call the brahmana one who one from whom lust and hatred

279
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:44,720
conceit have dropped away that is the one i call a brahmana one

280
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:50,960
who utters no rough speech whose speech is articulate and truthful

281
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:58,798
by which he does not hurt one does not hurt anyone that is the one i call the brahmana

282
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:06,720
one here who does not take anything in the world not given that is the one i call a brahmana

283
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:13,599
one here who has abandoned craving who wanders without a home with craving and existence destroyed

284
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:19,359
that is the one i call the brahmana so many of these factors that the buddha

285
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:27,119
calls make someone a brahmana has to do with their ethical behavior their action and

286
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:33,920
these these passages appear a number of places in the suttas both the dhammapada and the sutuni pata so they must have

287
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:40,319
been popular in the ancient world and the so it's

288
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:47,359
people's ethics ethical behavior that the buddha is emphasizing and this is over and over again this is

289
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:53,839
what what the buddha is emphasizing and some of the arguments he makes for why shouldn't she take those who are

290
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:59,839
born into the brahmana caste class as being brought real brahmins

291
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:06,640
it has to do with their ethics that some of them kill and steal and and lie

292
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:13,520
and do all kinds of things and some of them don't some of the people in different

293
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:19,359
classes of society at that time lived very ethically and whoever lived ethically that was the

294
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:26,400
brahman even if there was a society put them at the lowest class the buddha wasn't going to see it that way

295
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:31,440
he saw them as being worthy and valuable human beings that

296
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:36,960
and so much so that when the buddha created a monastic community

297
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:43,920
in the community that community there was no differentiation between those who were of uh who came

298
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:49,040
into the monastic community from their brahmin class from the ruling class from the merchant

299
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:55,760
class from the worker class any class of life people came from they were folded in and they had equal

300
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:01,119
role status importance position there and it must have been quite remarkable

301
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:06,960
in the ancient world to come from a place where there were these social divisions and come together

302
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:13,760
into community where those divisions had evaporated and people live together without seeing those distinctions

303
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:20,000
and um so um i'm going to read a little bit more

304
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,839
from here

305
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:32,960
for whom name and clan ascribe to one are designation in the world having

306
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:38,240
originated by convention they are ascribed here and there here

307
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:44,559
again this uh this insight into there's nothing in that in the natural world in terms of

308
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:51,920
status and positions and places of people you know of people that uh

309
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:59,680
is inherent but these are designations and we know that in this you know that uh these horrible uh ways

310
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:06,000
of racism um the race in all kinds of ways was a designation was an invention

311
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,680
that then got kind of uh kind of such a solidified so strongly especially in the

312
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:17,040
united states that it's uh hundreds these hundreds of years of racism

313
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:22,559
difficult to shake off the the strength of these concepts these

314
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:32,000
designations and even people who we know now who consciously um

315
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:39,440
don't live by these designations there's a kind of and have inherited from a culture all kinds of unconscious and subliminal

316
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:46,559
ways in which um we still kind of live in this bifurcated societies of where there is

317
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:53,280
uh people are put in different positions and prejudice and bias is is a regular

318
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:59,599
experience for them one is not a brahmana by birth nor by

319
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:08,240
birth a non-brahmana by action one becomes a brahmana by action one becomes a non-brahmana

320
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:15,760
so that is how the wise see action as it really is seers of dependent origination skilled

321
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:21,760
in action and its result so skilled and dependent origination means

322
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:27,040
that they're really skilled in seeing how things occur and exist

323
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:33,280
independence on conditions that come together that there's nothing really inherent in

324
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:38,960
anything that um that is that doesn't change doesn't

325
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:45,760
disappear doesn't come and go and because of that they become skilled

326
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:50,880
in action the buddha was sometimes referred to

327
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:56,799
as a teacher of action because for the buddha was so important the

328
01:00:56,799 --> 01:01:02,160
action was the way to liberation it kind of more and more refined kind of

329
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:07,359
action more more peaceful kind of action way of living that led to freedom but

330
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:12,640
action how we live is what defines in a sense and for the

331
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:18,480
the worth of our human being and and the most worthy human being are

332
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:24,480
those who live most ethically and and those are the ones he calls a

333
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:31,359
brahmana and then he goes on to say

334
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:38,160
by action the world goes around by action this generation of people spin

335
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:44,240
around sentient beings are are fastened

336
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:49,440
tied up by their actions

337
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:54,480
which is like the linchpin of a moving chariot

338
01:01:56,319 --> 01:02:04,960
by the spiritual life by self-control and entertaining by this one becomes a brahmana

339
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:10,880
this is supreme brahminhood so i don't know how this sounds to some

340
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:19,200
of you i mean to me it's a little bit jarrings to put anyone you know claim that any

341
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:25,039
individual is his brahman is kind of more worthy than anybody else

342
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:32,480
and um but it's certainly a very powerful uh critique the buddha had on

343
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:39,920
the the the racism or the classism that existed

344
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:46,799
at his time and a very powerful teaching that

345
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:54,160
still resonates in india to this day among many people as a way of kind of

346
01:02:54,160 --> 01:03:00,319
stepping away from the caste system in 1950s there was a doctor named benkar one of the few

347
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:06,079
people who in my studies when i was younger i thought had the

348
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:12,400
moral stature or moral integrity or something to be critical of

349
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:18,720
mahatma gandhi gandhi was one of my heroes so it's a big thing to say that a bed car is one of the few people that

350
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:26,160
well if he has a critique i i'll listen and he belonged to the uh back then the

351
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:32,480
untouchable class this lowest caste in india and in 1954 i think

352
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:38,720
after a big search for a religion that wouldn't promote this caste system that hinduism

353
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:43,760
seemed to have promoted india he landed on buddhism and he he did

354
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:51,599
these mass conversions of the untouchables into buddhism because buddhism was so clearly

355
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:57,280
buddha was so clearly breaking down these caste divisions

356
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:02,319
and he was emphasizing ethics and so as i said i feel a little

357
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:09,200
uncomfortable by this idea of the brahman but i love the idea that

358
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:16,880
you know to break down these divisions and to emphasize our ethical life or good ethics

359
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:25,440
life of harmlessness and dedication to not stealing and killing and lying as being a common ground

360
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:30,640
in which these divisions can break down and soften and rather than thinking of ourselves as

361
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:39,119
higher or better than anybody else because of that maybe it frees us from thinking

362
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:45,760
in any kind of higher lesser language at all

363
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:52,720
but rather to have kind of simplicity and openness and to respect anyone

364
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:59,760
or to be able to look on everyone as a friend supporting everyone to kind of

365
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:08,000
maybe discover that in our hearts in our core deep inside is an ethical nature

366
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:14,079
a life that wants a heart that wants to live harmlessly and that all the ways that we

367
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:20,319
humans cause harm really come from more of a superficial surface area for life

368
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:25,359
that falls away when we settle deep down into ourselves

369
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:33,359
and uh and so that's part of the role for meditation to to shed this

370
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:40,880
you know superficial and settle into what's deep the place the origin for

371
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:46,079
a life of ethics goodness that dissolves where we can maybe

372
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:51,359
contribute to dissolving these painful divisions in our society

373
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:56,400
of some people being better than superior of more equal than

374
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:05,838
others it's needed in these times just as much as it's needed in the times of the buddha so thank you
