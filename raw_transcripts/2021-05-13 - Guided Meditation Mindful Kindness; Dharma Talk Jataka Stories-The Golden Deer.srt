1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:08,000
so my friends and welcome welcome to our meditation

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,639
session together and meditation

3
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:22,880
is a way that we care for ourselves and in doing so we care for others

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:31,599
we care for ourselves and that meditation is a time to to

5
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:38,079
heal to rest to open to discover kind of inner

6
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:44,079
harmony and health that comes when we're no longer in conflict with ourselves or no longer

7
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:50,640
chasing things and running away from things pushing things away and grabbing hold

8
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,760
and holding tight when all those things kind of bottle up

9
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,800
energy or limit us and tighten us

10
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:08,080
and to sit here and care for ourselves and allow all the conflicts and tensions to fall away and sit here

11
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,119
in a healthy present open way

12
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:22,240
then that disposes us to more likely to

13
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,320
meet people with in a way that cares for their humanity cares for their humanness cares for

14
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,079
their life and we're more likely to meet people without conflict and without

15
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,119
pushing away or holding on or without hostility or

16
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:46,720
or greed or something like that and so it's understood that this practice we do is really meant for

17
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,720
caring for self and for caring for others some people emphasize one more than the other some people are

18
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:59,360
inspired by the idea that meditation is a way to make us more more helpful for the world around

19
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,040
us in a way that's deeply uh helpful in the sense that

20
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:13,760
we know the best we know the healthiest we know that we know something what's possible

21
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,920
for happiness and some people do it for their own sake for their own hap well-being and

22
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,959
happiness but even though the choice might be for one or the other

23
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,720
you can't separate the two and the two come hand in hand as we benefit others this way we benefit

24
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:38,480
ourselves as we benefit ourselves this way we um we uh

25
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:46,800
we benefit others and so today as we sit uh perhaps uh

26
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:54,160
we sit here to benefit in all directions and we do so

27
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:00,319
by offering our care and our friendship our friendly attentiveness

28
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:07,040
to our breathing and that breathing

29
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:13,840
is a place where we offer our care offer

30
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:21,680
our kindness our compassion our it's a training ground for how we

31
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,879
can be present in a way that's clear and healthy and open and directed

32
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:33,280
it's not just a matter of learning how to stay with the breathing and be with the breathing a lot of it

33
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:41,440
has to do with learning how we can be with the breathing so as we sit here today

34
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:48,799
you might experiment and call upon your capacity for

35
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:56,720
kindness tenderness compassion truthfulness

36
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:03,680
clear unconflicted presence to really be here as a training ground

37
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,519
for a way of being with self and others that allows for this deep movement

38
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:15,120
towards spiritual and psychological health

39
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:22,320
so to us to adjust your body into a meditation

40
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:29,199
posture that is suitable for you to be both

41
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:35,759
alert and also to meet yourself be with yourself

42
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,680
as if you're going to be with a good friend you know maybe a little bit troubled and

43
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:57,840
needs the attention and care of of you

44
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:06,720
gently closing your eyes and feeling sensing being with yourself

45
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,840
checking in

46
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:20,160
without an agenda just check in with yourself your body your

47
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,840
mind your heart how are you

48
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,400
and then taking a few long slow deep breaths

49
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,680
and what you're offering as you take a deep breath is attentiveness

50
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,720
attentive to the body's experience of breathing

51
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:12,560
and the long exhale is a time to let go of the world of your thoughts and concerns

52
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,840
just for these minutes so you can be more fully here and

53
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,840
present for yourself

54
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:33,520
and letting your breathing return to normal and for a few of your your exhales

55
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,759
relax the different parts of your body

56
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,840
soften

57
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:59,759
as you exhale perhaps there can be a quieting gentling

58
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,840
of your mind

59
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,599
quieting of your thinking

60
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,840
a calming of the mind

61
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:36,160
and then to gather your attention around the body's experience of

62
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,759
breathing some people do some more in the belly moving

63
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:47,120
some people the chest some people more they are going in and

64
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,120
out through the nostrils and some kind of the global experience

65
00:07:53,120 --> 00:08:00,800
that includes all of those areas but the body's experience of breathing

66
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:13,520
and rather the id rather than the idea that you're now going to focus and stay concentrate on the

67
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:21,120
breathing the focus is more on sustaining

68
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:29,120
a friendly kind attention on the breathing

69
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:35,919
as you would if you were being with someone who was troubled

70
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:43,039
or sick or somehow challenged a friend of yours and you were going to

71
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,399
stay and be present

72
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:55,839
so focus on that offering of your presence kind presence

73
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:09,839
to your body breathing

74
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,480
not interfering with the breathing not interfering with your friend

75
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:26,160
but there to accompany to be present with

76
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:37,839
with a friendly presence a kind presence a caring presence

77
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:51,839
that says here my friend i'm with you

78
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,480
gently quietly

79
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,840
attending to the breathing

80
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,240
with kindness or compassion or care with

81
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:58,399
gentleness but really do attend stay there

82
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,400
stay nurturing yourself

83
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:19,840
with a simple experience of breathing in and breathing out

84
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:35,840
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

85
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,919
to turn your gaze outward

86
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:52,880
to the people of your life in your neighborhood your communities towns cities country

87
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:03,840
and to offer that and that gaze a kindness or friendliness

88
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:17,840
a gentle care caringness for all beings

89
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:25,200
and to consider how any benefits you received from today's

90
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:32,320
meditation anyways in which you feel calmer or better

91
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,759
how that can translate or be applied

92
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,240
to support the lives of others today

93
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:52,559
what can you do to make the lives of others a little better maybe some as simple as smiling or

94
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:59,840
small acts of kindness small words of appreciation

95
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,679
small words of thanks

96
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,120
well-wishing or bigger things

97
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:22,480
because of the mutual way in which caring for self and caring for others

98
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:29,440
reinforce each other then they benefit each other they grow together

99
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:43,120
if you care for yourself care for others may all beings be happy

100
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:49,440
may all beings be safe

101
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:59,520
may all beings be peaceful and may all beings everywhere be free

102
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,278
and may we contribute to that

103
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,840
possibility

104
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:40,000
so so i'll offer today another story

105
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:48,240
from the jataka tales details from the former births lives of the buddha

106
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:55,200
that are as i say kind of fables and um but they're fables which carry

107
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,559
the values that uh indian buddhists of

108
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:07,519
ancient times uh had and wanted to convey to others and some of

109
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:14,240
the you get a very different feeling for buddhism from the these stories that are told the

110
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:23,200
values in them and how do people relate to each other and and the virtues that are emphasized

111
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:31,120
and you get a sense of how you know what buddhism

112
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:38,240
is emphasizing for how to live a life as opposed to what to believe or what to

113
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:47,360
um you know understand philosophically or metaphysically or something like that

114
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,720
and um and they belong to the values of another time another place and sometimes maybe so

115
00:31:52,720 --> 00:32:00,080
some aspects of it a little hard for us in the modern world to appreciate but some of it seems universal and

116
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:07,840
and these wonderful fables so this one is about um a golden deer

117
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:15,200
and this is about a deer that was magnificent with the golden fur and

118
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:23,360
antlers of that were shining silver and eyes that were like kind of sparkling

119
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:28,480
radiant gems jewels

120
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:34,159
and because this uh and this deer was very wise

121
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:40,080
but because of its great beauty it was often searched for and hunters

122
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:47,840
wanted to have it and capture it as a trophy or something so it would go into deep woods and

123
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:54,000
hide in inaccessible places to be safe but it was content being there because

124
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:01,760
the deer liked to meditate and would sit there and meditate and become wiser and

125
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:08,480
and kinder in the process so there it was the deer in its hiding place and it happened to be the

126
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:16,720
thicket of woods where it hid was close to a river upriver at a city upriver

127
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:24,880
a wealthy merchant died and left his wealth to his son

128
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,600
and his son who was a bit of a

129
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:39,519
playboy and gambler and other things started to spend the money um quite

130
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:45,600
extravagantly for all kinds of things and uh pretty soon had spent up all the

131
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:51,679
money not only spent it up spent it but i had come into deep debt

132
00:33:51,679 --> 00:34:00,080
and the creditors came after this wealthy this this uh this son to get their money back

133
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:06,399
and but not having any money or anything to offer uh the the uh

134
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:14,079
the son had a little trick up his sleeve he thought that he kind of made up on the spot maybe an ill thought

135
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:19,200
out plan and that was come i'll i have money

136
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:25,118
for you i have a treasure that's buried in the sand next to the river and we'll go down there we'll dig it up

137
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:30,878
and you'll have your money back and so this crowd of creditors

138
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:36,158
because there's a lot of debt he had and this young man were walking down the

139
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:41,839
river and up the river and and uh on a sand embankment right kind

140
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:48,638
of that goes down to the river kind of steep and um and

141
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:55,440
the young man pretended to slip and slipped intentionally in the sand

142
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:01,040
and fell into the river with a raging water and the plan was to be swept away by the

143
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:06,800
river in this raging water and so that the creditors thought he would

144
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:12,800
died in the river through an accident of slipping and falling and would no longer be chasing after him

145
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:20,480
for their money and in a sense that's what happened the boy kind of feigned the slipping and

146
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:26,960
slipped down into the river and got swept away but what it turned out was the river was

147
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:33,200
quite strong and um and there was no way to get back onto the shore there's just like

148
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:39,119
big wide river with raging water carrying him down and it carried him down the river a long

149
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:44,960
ways and as after a while he felt like this is serious i'm i can't get back to shore i'm going to

150
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:50,880
drown i'm cold things are difficult here and greater rapids downriver

151
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:58,320
so the young man started calling out for help and in his in his screams for help

152
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:05,599
the golden deer hurt heard the cries for help and the deer said well as long as i'm

153
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:11,200
alive i'm not going to allow anyone to die that i can help and save

154
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:16,880
and um and so he he dashed out of his thicket in the woods and to the river

155
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:24,000
and dived and jumped into the river and swam out to where the young man was and kind of ducked under

156
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,400
the water and came up underneath the the man and picked him up on his back and and

157
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:38,559
then swam back to the shore by this time the young man was quite

158
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:47,599
cold hypothermia set in was quite weak and and so the deer brought him into his

159
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:54,000
thicket secret little place he had and over the next couple of days i nursed him back to health to

160
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,640
well-being brought him fruits and nuts from the forest water kept him warm and

161
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:07,280
and then the young man revived and felt good and and so the young man

162
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:14,000
thank the deer and this is quite something and and anything i can do in return and the

163
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,359
deer said yes i'll bring you back i'll take you back out to the road to you can go back

164
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:24,960
to your city but um please i promise that you will will not tell

165
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,400
anyone where i am so so i can stay safe here and the young

166
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:36,560
man said yes i promise so the deer carried him out to through the tickets and thickets of

167
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:43,359
woods and forest and showed them where the road was through the city and the boy then returned to the city

168
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:51,440
and by now um no one recognized him or maybe it was a different city or something and the capital of the of uh

169
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:57,680
this country now it happened that uh after a while the the queen of the

170
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:05,119
country had a dream and she dreamt of a great golden deer with silver antlers

171
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:11,599
and gem-like eyes who uh in her dream was very very wise

172
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:17,839
and she was intrigued and and desirous of that wisdom to be a teet to be a student of this

173
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:22,960
wise wise deer that she had dreamt about

174
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:30,960
so she asked her ministers to please go find this there and bring it to her so she can learn its wisdom but no one knew where

175
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,880
their stare was and so um a proclamation was sent out with people throughout the town

176
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:43,040
announcing if anyone could find this golden deer or find out where it is for them to uh that

177
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:49,440
they would receive a big treasure chest of treasure and so this

178
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:56,000
uh young man heard this and he said oh well i know where the deer golden deer is and so he went

179
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:04,720
to the queen and said i know where it is and i can bring you there breaking his promise to the deer and uh

180
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:11,200
so then they the queen assembled her soldiers and people together and they went maybe a little bit afraid to

181
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:17,520
go into the woods and came with their spears and arrows and started to kind of circle around the place where the deer

182
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:22,960
was and making a lot of noise and the deer could see through the trees the spears and the arrows and the

183
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:29,040
soldiers and and said oh i'm here to be captured

184
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:35,200
so he what he did was he got up in a stately calm way walked right to the queen who was with

185
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,320
the peep everyone and the queen got a little bit scared had this big

186
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:45,359
deer walking right up against her she pulled out her bow and arrow and was going to

187
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:50,720
protect herself but there's something about the non-threatening nature in which this big

188
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:57,040
deer came walking up to her that she didn't let the arrow fly and the deer stopped and said what are you

189
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:02,079
doing here and uh and who brought you here how do you find me

190
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:09,680
and the deer and the queen said oh it's this man here who the young man who that showed us the

191
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:16,640
way and showed us where you were and and the deer said oh there's an ancient

192
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:23,520
saying better to save a log better to rescue a log from the river

193
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,720
than someone like you and um and the queen didn't understand

194
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:37,200
that you know what are you talking about not saving someone and oh the dear said this man

195
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:44,400
he was drowning in the river i plunged into the great river and fought the rapids and brought him back

196
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,920
to the shore and nursed him back to health and then he promised he would never tell anyone

197
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:57,040
where i was in my safety and the queen was horrified to hear this hear both about that to hear that this

198
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:03,760
person who had missed this animal that risked its life to save another human being had been betrayed and that the young man

199
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:09,040
had made a promise and and the promise was betrayed and so she

200
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:14,720
took her bow and arrow and she said you're you know you're a traitor you're betrayed and this is terrible what you

201
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:20,000
did and the deer said no don't shoot don't shoot you promised the young man

202
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,160
that you would give him a treasure if he brought him to you he brought you he brought you to me and

203
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:32,079
he should be given the treasure and and but maybe you can banish him from the from the queendom

204
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:38,880
and so that's what the queen did and uh the man left with his treasure but never to come back to that country

205
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,920
and then the queen said please come with me to the palace i'd like to learn from you and your teachings

206
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:54,000
but i'll offer you a wish that's my payment any wish you want and the dear said please

207
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:02,319
pass a law that no one is allowed to injure or hurt or kill any animal

208
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:08,480
in this queendom and the queen said okay i offered you a wish and that's what you

209
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:13,839
take that's that'll be the new law and they went back to the to the palace

210
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:21,440
and the deer taught both the queen and the ministers and many of the people of the capital the virtues of kindness and

211
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:27,599
friendliness and generosity and um and truthfulness

212
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:32,640
and and all the wonderful virtues

213
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:38,800
and that all went well except that the farmers who've been that the animals started

214
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:45,760
eating the crops of the of the farmers and farmers couldn't chase them away or couldn't injure them or kill them to stop them

215
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:53,520
so it became an uproar from everyone about the problems they had and so the great golden year went out to

216
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:59,760
into the into the world and and told everyone told all the animals

217
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:06,079
don't eat the people's food they need to they need to be able to grow their own food and support them they're not going to kill

218
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:13,920
you but don't you take their their plants and crops and um and the animals agreed and in

219
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:20,318
this way the kingdom became vegetarian and the animals were safe

220
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:28,000
so there's a lot of kind of interesting kind of little lessons in this story uh maybe a

221
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:34,640
you know kind of fantastical story and fable but certainly the value of uh helping

222
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:40,160
others and preserving life and saving life and dedicating oneself to even

223
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:47,440
at the risk of one's own life to help others it's a huge value of ancient buddhism that you see in many of these stories and the

224
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:52,880
tremendous importance of truthfulness to speak the truth and then adhere to the truth especially if you made a

225
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:59,119
promise and and the value of not harming

226
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:04,319
and and it's there seems to have been a trend in certain parts of ancient indian

227
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:12,880
buddhism of kind of emphasizing or pointing towards vegetarianism as a so that no animals

228
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:20,800
nothing gets killed and injured so that's a story for today and

229
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:27,599
and just like the deer stayed in this quiet secret place so it could cultivate

230
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:33,599
its great compassion and care and wisdom so may you go to your

231
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:40,400
secret place of meditation and and be a place where you can develop your own kindness and compassion

232
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:47,440
and truthfulness and and care for this world may you be the

233
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,960
great golden deer that is wise

234
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:58,240
so thank you
