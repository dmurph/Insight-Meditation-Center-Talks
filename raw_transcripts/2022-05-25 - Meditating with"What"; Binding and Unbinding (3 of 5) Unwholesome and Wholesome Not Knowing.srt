1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,720
so good morning everyone welcome

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,519
and um

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:21,520
so today the meditation is about

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,519
knowing and not knowing

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,600
part of the challenge of meditation is all the meaning we assign the

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,040
significance the fantasies the illusions the ideas that we add on top

7
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:46,559
of our direct experience one of the ways is assigning personal meaning or personal

8
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,480
ideas about what it means for me and some of that's okay

9
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,840
but some of it is extra it's a lot of it can be delusion

10
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,520
and fantasy and one of the ways to meditate

11
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,200
is to meditate uh with part of what we do is

12
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:16,159
not know not try to figure things out not try to

13
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:22,159
explain them not try to assign meaning to them or ask why they're there

14
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,320
or how to fix them and um and so this commit practice with a

15
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,479
question just a simple statement what what what is this

16
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,680
but not trying to answer it almost like what

17
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,119
is the uh is what allows us to witness something

18
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:51,040
and see it fresh and see it anew and and really know kind of see let it

19
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:58,320
appear come to us so the to sit with a what

20
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,680
and then see what without needing to know the answer

21
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:11,120
to just sit with what's there not knowing what's there in a sense but letting it show itself to us

22
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,640
but not asserting or projecting our ideas on top of it

23
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,800
and this is so helpful for the living in our life to always to begin

24
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,640
with a question what and let the experience speak to you

25
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:36,760
rather than you you claiming the experience for yourself

26
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:43,040
so what so to begin

27
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,319
by assuming a

28
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,040
upright balanced posture

29
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,840
and entering into this posture as if you're not coming with a long

30
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,599
history of knowing exactly how you should sit exactly what's your way but to kind of

31
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:16,519
discover what the posture can be as if it's the first time

32
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,400
and then to lower your gaze

33
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,799
and perhaps close your eyes

34
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,760
and this what can begin right away

35
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:42,159
what is this experience of sitting here being present

36
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:49,280
when there's no overlay of shoulds or expectations or

37
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,799
ideas of where you're going in practice

38
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,080
just what to this experience

39
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:08,000
a willingness to not explain not even to know what it is but just to

40
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,560
feel and sense and allow it to be what it is

41
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:26,000
and to have this what for what's happening in

42
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,280
your mind thoughts the attitudes

43
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:39,759
the reactions and this what some deeper question

44
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:45,759
almost like what is here what is this mind about what's happening

45
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:52,240
here but perhaps not looking for answers

46
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,360
just being open to feel and see and cents

47
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,199
and then perhaps taking a few long slow deep breaths

48
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:20,520
to settle into your body to settle into your place

49
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,240
letting you your breath return to normal

50
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,840
and then relaxing your body a bit

51
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,680
the face the shoulders the belly and each time you relax

52
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:56,560
imagine that you asked the question what is this

53
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:03,440
as if you're discovering this part of your body for the first time what's happening as i relax

54
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,840
what is revealed

55
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,319
and then to let yourself settle into your breathing

56
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:46,160
the rhythm of breathing with a beginner's mind

57
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,039
with the best you can without

58
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,599
expectations or ideas of what should happen

59
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,039
what it's supposed to be like

60
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:11,560
just what what is this experience of sitting here breathing

61
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:24,479
where the question what implies a relaxation

62
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:31,919
of searching and looking it's just what and being open to whatever is here

63
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,880
open to breathing to body to mind

64
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,759
oh what a beginner's mind

65
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:55,759
that brings a receptivity and a willingness to just be here with this

66
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,120
not needing to make it into anything judge it

67
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,759
but just the what the question what that takes you away

68
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,080
from your discursive thinking

69
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,720
your fantasies

70
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:29,080
the what to what's happening now here just now

71
00:13:54,639 --> 00:14:03,199
sitting with an attitude of what that it opens you makes you curious

72
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:09,519
to this experience now while at the same time

73
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,800
not needing to know not needing to have it understood in

74
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:21,920
words or just an open

75
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,680
curiosity to this

76
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,438
so

77
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:46,080
when the mind wanders off in thought what is this

78
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:55,919
what is the question curiosity that quiets the mind

79
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:03,080
in a process of this silent discovery

80
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:25,360
one of the benefits of developing a mindfulness practice

81
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:31,919
can be a comfort level with not knowing

82
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,600
a comfortable comfort comfort comfort level being present for our direct

83
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:43,600
immediate experience and not needing to

84
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:50,640
have something to say something to explain not needing to know what one's supposed

85
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:56,000
to do just present

86
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:03,200
accompanying the experience allowing the experience to show itself

87
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:09,600
more fully without the filter of our ideas and

88
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,440
explanations and certainties

89
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:26,480
to ask the question what without looking for an answer

90
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:34,440
just looking for looking seeing more fully

91
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,919
and in this way perhaps we can

92
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,120
know people in a new way

93
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:54,480
fresh way not see them through the old filters and ideas and histories memories

94
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:01,000
not see them through the roles and ideas

95
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:10,399
by not knowing who they are we actually can get to know them more

96
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:17,440
fully in some way what is known

97
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,799
when we don't try to know

98
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:30,799
and perhaps the quiet stillness of the mind of mindfulness

99
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:36,158
can help us to

100
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:44,559
have greater good will and respect for others

101
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:51,600
may it be that as we come out of meditation whatever

102
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:59,480
ability we have to be present without needing to know needing to explain

103
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:06,720
generates greater care for the welfare and happiness of others

104
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:12,480
may all beings be happy may all beings

105
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:19,120
be safe may all beings be peaceful

106
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,960
may all beings be free

107
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:33,840
[Music] so

108
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:44,619
[Music]

109
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:54,480
so good morning and um

110
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,919
today the sunlight is quite bright for me so

111
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,080
so the um

112
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,679
one of the things that bind us that keeps people in

113
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:20,880
bondage can have a huge impact on others is delusion

114
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:27,120
and confusion and it's a very powerful

115
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:32,240
powerful word the word delusion and buddhism is considered to be one of the

116
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:37,440
important forms of bondage and poisons and

117
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:43,760
one of the ways to be caught is to be caught in delusion and it can be particularly

118
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:49,600
harmful because when we're deluded we don't really see the situation clearly

119
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:56,640
and so even if our intentions are good we might be causing harm in the world around us

120
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:03,279
but also with delusion we can be misinformed or misguided

121
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:08,640
in whatever we think is important if we think

122
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:14,720
you know there's a classic teaching in buddhism that someone who wants a fire

123
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:21,679
uh goes and chops up wood looking for the fire in the wood because in that where fire comes from

124
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:28,399
but it's not just enough to chop it up you have to uh you know create the fire

125
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:36,159
in the old days by rubbing something together and or the idea that you can get grape juice

126
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:42,960
by squeezing gravel if you're trying to accomplish something and you're deluded about the means and

127
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,880
what ways to do it then you're not going to get much result

128
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:54,480
so one of the delusions that buddhism emphasizes is

129
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:00,880
the the improper pursuit of happiness believing that what is not a source of

130
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:07,600
happiness is a source of happiness thinking that pleasure will bring happiness

131
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:14,960
thinking that power will bring happiness thinking that anger will bring happiness

132
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,559
thinking that criticizing others and blame will bring happiness

133
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:26,720
all kinds of ways in which we kind of you know thinking that i'll only be happy if

134
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:35,760
uh you know and have some idea far in the future that we want to put everything in place only then if only that can happen

135
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:41,279
and and so the um part of the function of buddhism is to

136
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:46,799
overcome delusion overcome confusion and ignorance

137
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:53,360
and the last binding bondage that we'll talk about on friday is ignorance so i want

138
00:33:53,360 --> 00:34:00,000
to save some of the obvious kind of opposites of confusion delusion

139
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,039
as but what i want to say now is that

140
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:10,158
in relationship to delusion and confusion

141
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:16,158
there's two things that can be kind of the the the

142
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:21,760
corollary the healthy wholesome corollary one of them is

143
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:29,118
a capacity and willingness to not know a willingness to

144
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:36,240
when we don't understand to not be confused and not to spin out

145
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:41,839
delusive ideas and theories conspiracy theories about how things are

146
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:47,520
but to be willing to not know to be comfortable with not knowing

147
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:53,520
and to be able to say i don't know and the

148
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:59,599
and so rather than not knowing and then becoming confused or adding confusion

149
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,800
and delusion on top of it by by coming up with theories and stretching

150
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,480
and and projecting ideas and solutions onto the situation

151
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:16,640
there's something very powerful about not understanding what's happening

152
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:23,200
and being resting and grounded in not knowing

153
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:30,720
and there's wholesome not knowing there's in some schools of buddhism emphasizes a

154
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:36,000
tremendous emphasis on cultivating a not knowing mind

155
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,800
sometimes it can be called a beginner's mind and and the value of this not knowing is not

156
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:50,079
that we become stupid and uninformed by things but rather that we see things fresh

157
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:56,240
we're willing to learn and see anew what's there so there's new possibilities

158
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:01,920
there's a great we're better informed by what's happening and we're not caught up

159
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:08,560
in suffering around not knowing it's not a crime to not know

160
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:14,960
i've met people who didn't was in a situation that was difficult they didn't know what was

161
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:21,680
happening they didn't know what to do but they said so and there was something about them being comfortable

162
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,960
with not knowing and not understanding that made such a huge difference to me

163
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:33,200
um like it inspired me wow you can do that you don't have to have answers you don't have to have solutions

164
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:39,520
and um just sit there and not know and take a take a stand in

165
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:46,240
in not necessarily and not knowing but taking a stand and not needing

166
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:52,160
to pretend it's otherwise not needing to rush ahead and try to

167
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:58,160
make things up or figure things out i think that it's a phenomenally

168
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:04,000
powerful thing to to be willing to not know

169
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,440
it's a protection from delusion from confusion i think there's a lot of pressure in our

170
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:15,839
society to know to have explanations to assign blame to um

171
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:22,960
to kind of live in a fantasy world of of what brings happiness and what is the

172
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:29,119
dangers we live in uh there's people lots of people who are spinning out

173
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:35,680
tales of where the danger is and who are the dangerous people that are it's elusive

174
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:41,599
and so there's this pressure to go along with that current of delusions social delusion

175
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:46,640
and to step back and not know be willing be comfortable with that

176
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,760
it's harder to get swept up in mass delusion or the collective delusion

177
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:58,079
of the people around us or the pressure to to to do anything and to do something

178
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:04,720
besides be able to not know but to not know can open doors to not

179
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:11,920
know can give us new perspective to not know can be freeing of something very profound within us

180
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:18,400
so as a healthy alternative to delusion

181
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:24,720
there's a possibility of not knowing the other a healthy

182
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:33,920
corollary wholesome corollary delusion is a commitment to building our life

183
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:41,280
from our lived experience in the moment that this is where the

184
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:48,560
where we discover how to live a wise life is a dedication to the present moment

185
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:53,760
because what we can start seeing here and now is

186
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,359
how we suffer how we create our suffering how we

187
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:06,560
get caught how we strain how we get contracted how we get resistant how we get caught in desires or caught

188
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:13,520
in fear any kind of cotness any kind of bondage and a commitment to hear

189
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:19,119
and then finding a way to be here without

190
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:24,880
believing that the way forward is through suffering

191
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:31,680
or the way forward is to do something that involves that brings suffering to us at the same

192
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,720
time so for example to be in a in a

193
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:43,040
challenging social situation and and then to use hostility

194
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:48,560
to clear the room to make everything kind of be safe maybe let people chase

195
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:54,079
people away maybe maybe it's effective for the situation

196
00:39:54,079 --> 00:40:00,160
but the hostility harms ourselves to think that what i need to do

197
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:07,359
is to become wealthy and the pursuit of wealth the very pursuit of his engagement in a greed that is a

198
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:15,760
tremendous amount of suffering for our own hearts somehow the the opposite corollary

199
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:22,079
to confusion and delusion is to be committed to tracking and

200
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:28,400
seeing very carefully discovering how to live a life now here

201
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:34,720
that's not built on things that are causing in the moment suffering to

202
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:40,240
ourselves and to see that as a sense of purpose

203
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:45,760
that gives clarity this is important it's not the final answer to everything

204
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:53,359
but it's the foundation that's the beginning of our life is the place where we can sit and be present

205
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:58,720
and know now i'm contributing suffering to my life now i'm not

206
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:04,839
and to be committed to that in a strong and a powerful

207
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:12,480
way um when i was i was thinking this morning about how when i was 14

208
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:18,480
i met a 14 year old woman that i was attracted to

209
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:24,800
and all i knew was her first name and the street that she lived on

210
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:31,599
and and so a friend of mine with a friend of mine we went through the telephone book of

211
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:38,560
the town i from the fro front and he from the back uh and we called everyone who lived on

212
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:44,880
that street and asked for for the you know using her name her first name asking for her

213
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:52,240
until somewhere i think was halfway through the in the middle of the book so we were kind of two of us were coming to the middle we finally found her street

214
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:57,280
and her through that way and i say that because of the drive the

215
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:05,599
seriousness the dedication to really be focused at that quest to find that woman

216
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:12,240
if you used if you used to use one tenth of that kind of dedication to dedication

217
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:17,280
to track yourself so that you don't get swept up in

218
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:23,280
confusion delusion needing to know the suffering of needing to know the suffering of

219
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:28,800
straining to have solutions but dedication to

220
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,920
staying in that place where we don't succumb

221
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:41,119
to to movements of mind and heart that cause us suffering here and now

222
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:45,838
with that dedication with that movement

223
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:52,560
and letting that be where the life is built from and and everything can be built from that

224
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:58,480
and a wonderful life can be built from that but it's not it's not a life that's built on

225
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:04,880
delusion or fantasy or or expectations and abstract ideas

226
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:10,079
it's a life that's built um that doesn't know about

227
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:16,240
is willing not to know about so many things but it does know

228
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:22,960
about tracking and staying close to that place where we don't contribute to our

229
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:28,800
suffering so

230
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:34,079
may you not be caught in delusion and confusion

231
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:41,520
may you discover the wonderfulness of a not knowing mind so as you go through the day today

232
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:47,440
you might see if some of your ideas explanations projections

233
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:53,440
might might somehow have some tinge of

234
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:59,680
delusion uh confusion some tinge of uh maybe it's not quite accurate what i'm

235
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:04,720
assuming here and see if instead of assuming things

236
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:10,960
you can practice not knowing the kind of not knowing that

237
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:17,200
that it doesn't ignore what's happening but then not knowing that allows you to

238
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:22,720
gaze upon it look upon it with fresh eyes and see what's actually going on including

239
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:29,920
what's going on in you and so that you can but in not knowing what's out there

240
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,960
you're more and not being confused by it or caught up in it you're more likely to

241
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:40,640
see what are you doing to contribute to your your suffering

242
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:47,599
and that that exploration will probably save you from a lot of delusion

243
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:51,838
so thank you
