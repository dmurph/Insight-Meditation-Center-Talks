1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:10,160
so greetings from

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:19,279
imc in redwood city and and i feel

3
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:28,160
quite contented to sit here this morning and quiet already

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:36,880
so it's our chance to discover all of us how to

5
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:43,840
be present for ourselves in a way that is supportive is

6
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:53,199
perhaps supports us with a quietude a quietness or with a peacefulness or with a clarity

7
00:00:53,199 --> 00:01:00,800
of the moment so to assume

8
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:07,759
a meditative posture meaning a posture that

9
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,720
supports your ability to be alert

10
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:22,720
and embodied alertness embodied attentiveness

11
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:32,159
so being careful that it's you're not over emphasizing relaxation or comfort

12
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,600
but also not underestimating or undervaluing the importance of relaxation and comfort

13
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:49,118
and to find that balance between alert or attentive in the posture

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,840
and you see that sometimes in animals or in small children especially

15
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:03,759
it's kind of there can be a relaxed clear attentiveness sometimes you see it

16
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,879
in the uprightness of the spine and the neck

17
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:15,360
and the clarity of or of the intentional

18
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,840
focus

19
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,640
and with a posture that's attentive and alert

20
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,799
to quietly calmly close your eyes

21
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,959
and to perhaps breathing in more deeply than usual

22
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,160
maybe three quarters full your lungs

23
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:52,319
so there's a real intentionality and a real renewed contact between you

24
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,640
and the body the torso that breathes

25
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:08,480
and at the end those after a deep inhale a long and gentle and maybe

26
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:18,000
tender exhale

27
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,760
maybe at the end of the exhale

28
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:33,840
allowing for a release that extends the exhale a little longer

29
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:46,400
a long exhale in which you also release the whole body relax the muscles

30
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:56,000
in a way the alertness the attentive body supports

31
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,920
relaxation without giving up the attentiveness

32
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,000
relax deeply

33
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,199
and then to let your breathing return to normal

34
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,040
and continuing the process of releasing relaxing the body

35
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:32,320
on the exhale softening relaxing the face

36
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,840
the forehead the temples

37
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,960
around the eyes and the cheeks

38
00:04:52,800 --> 00:05:00,160
and the jaws by letting the teeth fall a teeny bit

39
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:10,720
apart from each other they'll burn lower teeth

40
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,160
and on the exhale to soften relax the

41
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,800
shoulders maybe there's a small adjustment in the position of your hands

42
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:39,840
that allows the shoulders to release a little bit more

43
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:08,639
and then to soften also on the exhale in your chest and around your heart

44
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:21,840
and sometimes just relaxing on the exhale can also take the form of a reassurance

45
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:32,080
reassuring allowing us our tension and challenges of the heart

46
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,759
to be there and it's okay it's okay

47
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,840
and then also to soften relax around the belly

48
00:06:49,840 --> 00:07:03,840
soft belly breathing in breathing out

49
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,479
and there's a little bit of effort involved in relaxing at the beginning

50
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:31,280
and then recognizing that effort and letting go of it now

51
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,319
letting go and allowing yourself to simply be aware

52
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:45,840
of the body breathing

53
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:03,680
remarkably the body will breathe on its own without our needing to be

54
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:13,840
involved and it often does that through the day and through the night

55
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:26,000
breathing is always there accompanying us and now for these minutes

56
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:41,839
to allow your attention to accompany your breathing

57
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:01,680
thinking of breathing is a relaxed rhythm

58
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:09,200
that frees you from your thinking

59
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:15,760
frees you from being preoccupied caught up in involved in your thinking

60
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:23,839
your thinking might still go on in the background

61
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:33,200
but your attention and your intention your conscious involvement

62
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:38,480
is with the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out

63
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:46,800
riding floating on that rhythm on those sensations

64
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,920
perhaps allowing the thinking mind to get quieter and quieter

65
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,360
as it becomes less and less necessary to think

66
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,839
because we're just

67
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,600
intimate with experience of the body

68
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,839
breathing

69
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:09,920
it's okay it's more than okay to trust your breathing

70
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,600
to entrust yourself to just being with the experience of

71
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,680
breathing letting all other things be leave them

72
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,959
alone let them be in the background if

73
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,519
possible

74
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,440
and if it's not possible to leave things in the background

75
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:45,440
then see how simple you can be in your mindfulness of those things

76
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,680
the simplest possible awareness

77
00:15:50,959 --> 00:16:09,839
all as a way of not being entangled with things

78
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,840
so

79
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,840
so

80
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,840
so

81
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,840
so

82
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,840
so

83
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,840
mm-hmm

84
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:08,159
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

85
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:17,519
to recognize that sometimes in meditation

86
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:23,200
we become quieter calmer

87
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:29,840
more settled or more open

88
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,039
in some way or other we've

89
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:45,919
shifted our state of mind or state of heart in a good direction in those times when that

90
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:51,679
happens to recognize that it gives us a

91
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:58,720
different vantage point from which to care and to love

92
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:05,760
this world a different perspective from which

93
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:14,640
to be kind and friendly and respectful of the people in our lives

94
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,279
and people that we run into and

95
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:29,120
that it's an opportune time to consider

96
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:38,080
how to give expression to our care to our love

97
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:45,600
a respect and kindness generosity

98
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:53,840
wherever it is easy for it to be directed

99
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,320
and to give some voice

100
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:07,840
to the love or the care or the friendliness

101
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:16,638
that might arise out of or be supported by our meditative state

102
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,839
and that can be done

103
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:33,520
by simply expressing expressing the classic words

104
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:42,079
of loving-kindness of goodwill and let those words somehow give voice

105
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:49,838
to our care and our love as it comes out of our quiet

106
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,960
may all beings be happy

107
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,838
may all beings be safe

108
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:12,800
may all beings be peaceful

109
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:20,400
and may all beings everywhere be free

110
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:34,480
and may we as we live our lives contribute to that possibility

111
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:45,839
may we make a world a better place

112
00:35:56,030 --> 00:36:00,399
[Music]

113
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:59,920
so so it's certainly uh

114
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:08,000
it feels always an honor to be able to be with people and

115
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,760
in this form and in other ways to talk about the dharma to share the

116
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:20,320
dharma not just the words of the dharma but a little bit of the

117
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:26,480
experience of the dharma so here we are

118
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,119
and

119
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,119
i wasn't sure you know what topic to talk about today

120
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:42,480
partly because of what's happening nationally in the united states

121
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:48,560
and it feels like it's pretty for me pretty close in to where i practice the dharma what

122
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:56,800
the dharma is about and seems very alive all the various challenges this country has

123
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:04,640
and it's impressive statistic that for the last month there have been or so

124
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:10,960
there's been 45 mass shootings in this country

125
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:19,040
so it seems like it qualifies to be an epidemic we have the repeated and repeated and

126
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:25,920
repeated [Music] violence against african americans

127
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:34,320
some of the videos is quite graphic that you know it's painful to watch and see

128
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:41,920
and the asian americans who are also the recipient now of hate and

129
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,920
violence and now we have this there at the derrick siobhan's

130
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:54,480
trial which is coming to a head maybe this week and who knows what direction the jury

131
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:01,359
will go and maybe any either direction that your jury goes it seems like it's pretty

132
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:09,359
consequential and and what will happen to this country

133
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:16,000
so those things are certainly on my heart and in my mind and besides just bringing them up and other

134
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,040
things i just wanted to name them that they're certainly present for me

135
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:27,359
and that as i talk here about the dharma maybe i am addressing these issues

136
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:33,200
though it will not be direct not exactly intentionally but those are

137
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:40,480
definitely close by for me and what i want to begin by doing is talking about this

138
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,920
very famous analogy or parable

139
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:53,680
that many of you have heard before of the two arrows and i think this is such a profound

140
00:39:53,680 --> 00:40:01,680
teaching it's so evocative and and as such

141
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:10,240
it is a kind of a koan a kind of a wonderful dharma question and the question is

142
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:16,079
what is the second arrow where is the second arrow

143
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:21,920
so the two arrows are the idea is that things happen to us in our lives which

144
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:28,960
are painful and there's plenty of that in this human life

145
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:36,560
and and buddhism is not to deny that there's pain that happens and some of that pain

146
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:41,680
is physical and some of it is emotional psychological

147
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:47,920
and then that's called the first arrow and the second arrow which makes the

148
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:54,400
pain worse because being shot by two arrows is worse than being shot by one arrow

149
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:02,000
the second arrow is what we contribute is the arrow that we shoot at ourselves

150
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:09,599
implying that there's a way in which we react and respond to the occurrences of our life our daily

151
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:15,200
life which where we uh increase the amount of pain

152
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:23,280
that we experience and in one once or one side the second arrow

153
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:30,640
that pain that's the pain we call suffering the fact that there is pain in the world

154
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:39,040
that is allowed to be pain and we do the best we can with it and and now as wisely as we can

155
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:44,160
but the this very powerful significant word for buddhist the word suffering in

156
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,520
dukkha that's what happens with the second arrow

157
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:56,720
and that is something that we do to ourselves and so the question is what is that

158
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:02,960
second arrow that we that we shoot at ourselves

159
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:10,240
and so there's many things that we do one of them is for example

160
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:17,838
if we feel pain and then because of that we get angry

161
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,359
and hostile and that hostility can be directed towards others

162
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:30,640
who we think are the responsible for our pain or the hostility can be directed towards ourselves but

163
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:36,720
irregardless of where the hostility is directed the hostility itself is the arrow it is

164
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:43,440
the second arrow so certainly you can feel that if the hostility is directed towards oneself

165
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:49,119
maybe that's like two arrows extra there's the arrow of the hostility

166
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:54,960
itself and then that's what the what the arrow hits inside of us

167
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:00,079
and then the hostility is directed outward to someone else it still hurts the person's being

168
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:06,880
hostile it is a way of shooting arrows at oneself and maybe shooting arrows at someone

169
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:14,079
else causing them pain there can be um the second arrow can be

170
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:20,800
not seen as a as an arrow it can be a very strong desire that we

171
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:26,800
latch on attach on to things that we want and there's something about

172
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:34,160
the squeeze and the holding on of intense desire really wanting something which actually

173
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:39,920
feels painful if we really feel and they're sensitive to what it is going on here and we're shooting a

174
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:46,720
second arrow in ourselves there's uh jealousy and there's uh envy

175
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:52,800
and there's greed and there's um you know there's a list of things that we do

176
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:58,960
that are called the second arrow conceit is considered to be a second arrow the

177
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:05,599
conceit of uh of you know that where we latch on to we hold on to

178
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:11,280
tightly some idea of me myself and mine like i'm special i'm wonderful i'm different

179
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:18,160
than others i'm we compare ourselves to other and put ourselves in in that we're better than or they're worse

180
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:23,920
than to be very critical of oneself and have a negative view of oneself

181
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:29,599
is a is a second arrow and certainly life is difficult so this

182
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:34,960
teaching about the two arrows doesn't deny the difficulty of life it just makes this distinction between

183
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:42,560
where the pain is and where the suffering is where the first arrow is in the second arrow and can all

184
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:50,079
forms all these forms of conceit the buddha said that he could not he did not know of any

185
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:59,280
concept of self idea of self philosophy around who the self is that didn't bring on the second arrow

186
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:05,839
that's a powerful statement it's not the same thing as denying there is a self it's just that to be wrapped up around

187
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:11,280
the conceit of a self is a second hero and

188
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:18,880
there's second arrows around getting wrapped up around opinions and views and philosophies and politics that

189
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:25,119
being right and insisting on it that insistence of being right and

190
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:31,839
in asserting one's views even if the views are true and accurate the

191
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:38,480
assertion of them the attachment to them is a second arrow what happens when

192
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:47,039
people practice something like meditation mindfulness meditation we become more and more sensitive to

193
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:54,000
so we recognize better and better these second arrows people who don't have that sensitivity

194
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:01,119
don't see that hostility is hurting themselves don't see that the attachment to pleasure or to

195
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:09,119
views philosophies politics attachment to conceit is an attachment to themselves is a

196
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:15,760
second arrow because they're not attuned to where the pain is where the contraction the hardness is and

197
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,800
where the the the um the um

198
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:26,880
where we get hurt so easily so one of the challenge one of the

199
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:32,319
things about these second arrows is they often don't just live by themselves

200
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:39,119
a second arrow is a kind of agitation a second arrow kind of lives within us

201
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:44,640
and then you know if someone has an arrow stuck in them and someone comes along and wiggles that arrow

202
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:52,079
i probably it's going to hurt a lot more in the skin or whatever it's pushing in and so we have these second arrows and

203
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:58,720
there they can be embedded in such a way that all kinds of people can come along and

204
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:06,560
do things and say things that are shaking twisting that second arrow to make it

205
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:11,599
more and more difficult and the second arrows are

206
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:17,520
often sticking out the most so that they're the ones that the world around us

207
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:24,079
will often hit first that the difficulty of the world what people say to us and do to us

208
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:30,559
will often hit the second arrow not something deeper inside of us

209
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:37,839
because second arrows are what's sticking out so what i mean by this is that if if we have a kind of conceit for

210
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:43,280
example that i'm better than everyone else then uh the slightest little that's the

211
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:52,079
second arrow the slightest thing someone says that undermines that or or criticizes that will um

212
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:58,079
will threaten hurt agitate that second arrow of conceit

213
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:04,160
if we're angry or hostile towards someone or towards ourselves then

214
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:09,440
any threat to that hostility any trying to dampen it down or quiet it down or

215
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:17,520
any uh thing that difficult that happens around us kind of vibrates or affects

216
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:23,920
that hostility to kind of irritate it more and so we get more hostile strong

217
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:29,040
attachment or wanting something all kinds of things can happen to threaten that desire

218
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:36,000
or that attachment and so because it's threatened it hurts even more and and

219
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,839
so in each of these times when the second arrow is sticking out so far that's what the world hits when it hits

220
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:49,040
us um it's uh it is um we start adding more

221
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:55,359
than second arrows third arrows four four arrows and the more arrows we've added to ourselves

222
00:48:55,359 --> 00:49:03,839
the more we're become fragile the more we're ready to be irritated or be agitated or be

223
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:10,720
you know for all those arrows to be twisted in us even more so to be that so it's very important to

224
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:17,680
learn to recognize these second arrows and one of the ways to recognize them

225
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:24,000
is through agitation second arrows are always come with a degree of

226
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:30,559
agitation in fact it might even be fair to say if you're agitated

227
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:36,240
there's a second arrow operating and the task of mindfulness would be to

228
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:42,720
discover what is that second arrow or the task is to settle that agitation

229
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:48,000
and one of the functions of meditation is to quiet the agitation enough

230
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:55,440
so we can be more observant and see more clearly when agitation begins and not to give

231
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:01,280
authority to the agitation not to get swept away by it or treat it

232
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:07,280
as of course i'm agitated or taken for granted just agitation is just happening and i have to go along with it

233
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:12,720
i have to do something and run around and fix something or be angry or do something

234
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:18,559
but to really when we're agitated to stop and look

235
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:25,599
and uh because agitation as a second arrow is something that when the world comes

236
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:33,680
does something which is maybe unfortunate around us that if it hits our agitation hits our

237
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:38,720
second arrows our response is very different than if the

238
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:46,960
events of the world doesn't hit their agitation if this if the events of the world

239
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:53,200
are received in our peaceful heart our settled heart if the agitation the

240
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:59,359
difficulties of the world and what people do to us and say to us is received in our calmness and our

241
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:04,880
openness without any second arrows without any agitation

242
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:12,480
then it's an amazing thing begins to happening the amazing thing is that there's a way

243
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:20,400
in which we can feel as if those things don't touch us as if they go right through as if there

244
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:28,559
is a vast emptiness space if there's a a transparency

245
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:35,760
or there's a through which things occur they're still

246
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:41,839
known and felt and even painful things can be felt as pain but it feels like they're not

247
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:48,559
lingering or being held on to or being stuck anywhere it isn't like they're embedded they

248
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:54,240
the arrowhead hasn't been embedded anywhere and there's this wonderfulness when

249
00:51:54,240 --> 00:52:01,520
there's freedom like a vast open window that sees you sees clearly everything kind of the

250
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:06,960
breeze go through clearly wonderful spring breeze perhaps but

251
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:12,559
when the neighbor kid throws a baseball against the window it doesn't break the

252
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:18,640
glass it just goes right through hopefully there's nothing in the living room but

253
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:27,280
as a my and my kids in my home it wasn't so much the neighbor kids throwing a baseball

254
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:33,280
from outside out our window was my kids throwing the baseball inside and if the window is open they're not

255
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:39,520
going to you know we're going to hit anything outside that would break so the idea you know

256
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:44,640
to when there's no second arrows it's like the windows are all open

257
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:50,400
and then there's a room in the heart and the mind to experience the challenges of this

258
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:55,680
world and we know that we don't have that room for it

259
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:02,559
when we get agitated certainly we could have a lot of respect and care and

260
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:10,480
and compassion for our agitation but to recognize oh this is agitation

261
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:17,040
oh i'm agitated i've heard about that in buddhism agitation

262
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:24,640
is a very thing that's extra is the second arrow i don't know how this is a second arrow

263
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:29,760
it seems like it's pretty natural pretty obvious i don't know that of course you should be agitated in this

264
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:35,599
circumstance aren't you supposed to everyone i've ever known in my life they always got agitated when these things happened

265
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:42,960
so isn't this what human beings do they get agitated and yes many people do get agitated in

266
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:49,040
all kinds of ways many people do as a matter of natural course of how they live their lives

267
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:53,839
shoot a lot of second arrows but

268
00:53:54,480 --> 00:54:01,760
it's not necessary and so to know this not to be shoot another

269
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:08,839
arrow at yourself so i'm a bad person because i'm i'm agitated but to know this and get

270
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:17,440
curious and to and take the agitation as a as a strong encouragement

271
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:24,000
pay attention look see what's going on here where is the second arrow and the

272
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,040
agitation i think even though it might be a second arrow i think it's actually very

273
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:34,480
helpful to respect it and and see it as representing what's

274
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:39,760
important for us and if it represents what's important for us

275
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:46,559
then um then it's imp then it's the more agitated we are the more it gives us a purpose a

276
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:52,160
direction and now i know what to do

277
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:58,960
and that is either to look inside see what is this agitation get curious

278
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:04,720
sit and meditate get quiet and study and feel and really get to the bottom of this

279
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:10,160
agitation what is it and settle the agitation and see what happens then

280
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:16,000
or like for example if you're agitated about something in the world

281
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,440
maybe to get to get caught in that education

282
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:27,520
is to miss a golden opportunity it's to somehow get too involved in the

283
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:34,559
s in the second era we're doing to ourselves and not appreciate that maybe what we're

284
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:39,839
agitated about doesn't need our agitation but it does

285
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:45,599
need our attention so this way of respecting agitation it's either

286
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:51,520
it's a prompt to look inside more deeply or it's a prompt it gives direction and

287
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:56,720
meaning and purpose to look outwards and study be intent and

288
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:02,240
look and learn better what's going on with your friend if you're agitated by a friend you know

289
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:09,599
that maybe talk about that talk to them and find out what's going on for them and and you know really really be present if

290
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:15,200
it's appropriate if you're agitated about what's happening in the world

291
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:21,839
if you're really agitated enough then you have a sense of purpose you can

292
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:29,440
okay i'm gonna turn my focus of my attention to learn more about it don't

293
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:35,680
don't rely on social media don't rely even on the on the mainstream news articles if

294
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:42,799
you're agitated it's important enough that you should get to the bottom of it and understand and do some research and really learn as

295
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:50,079
opposed to just continue to kind of swim in the agitation and continue to read the kind of news

296
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:55,359
that only agitates you more then you're not really studying and getting through to it and

297
00:56:55,359 --> 00:57:03,040
doing research so um and so this is always

298
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:08,319
both these ways are ways of no longer living with the second arrow

299
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:13,359
and both of them are ways to offer something different to ourselves

300
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:20,640
than just twisting the second arrow more and more it's giving us something to do

301
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:26,640
and those two can be done together we can both look deeply inside and settle the agitation find out where

302
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:32,319
we're attached or we can and we can also

303
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:37,440
look and see and study and read about or learn about what's going on in the world

304
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:42,720
or even better we can actually bring our focus to do something about it

305
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:50,240
and even if it's a very very small thing to to act and do

306
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:56,559
because then we um we're going where that is sometimes a way of pulling out the arrow or that's

307
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:02,240
the way of not allowing the arrow to keep getting twisted more and more

308
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:10,160
so there's a marvelous thing that happens when we have started to pull out these second arrows

309
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:17,599
and um is that there's less and less that the world strikes there's less and

310
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:24,960
less windows for the world to break in our hearts the heart becomes more and more open

311
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:32,799
so we have to be very careful with these second arrows because there they are

312
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:40,000
oftentimes the primary source of more and more

313
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:45,359
pain and suffering so it's not just simply the inner one simple little arrow second arrow

314
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:52,160
that's gone in that's causing a suffering but the continued uh twisting of them and striking of them

315
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:59,200
and rubbing up against them that the world does and that we do makes them kind of more and more

316
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:06,000
more and more suffering arises and happens so to take out the second arrow to

317
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,119
understand this idea of second arrows and to understand that there's a whole

318
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:17,280
other way of living it's possible to live as a large open

319
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:24,160
window it's possible that the things of the world

320
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:32,720
that we can care we can be involved in we can respond to

321
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:40,799
but when we are aware of it when we know it when it comes to us when someone is angry with us

322
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:48,880
it's possible for that to just go right through and are the open window of our heart

323
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:58,079
and in doing so we can remain steadfast present

324
00:59:58,839 --> 01:00:04,960
looking maybe kindly but really looking at the challenge looking what's

325
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:10,000
happening looking at for example the angry person

326
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:20,400
sometimes it makes angry people more angry if they have no effect on us so

327
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:26,000
some people find that very satisfying but i think more importantly is that if

328
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:32,160
we have no reaction to people who are angry with us

329
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:37,359
maybe or to the difficulties and challenges of this world and politics and what's happening around

330
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:42,799
us i hope that

331
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:50,000
we get motivated to be wise about it to see it more clearly

332
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:56,799
to be curious and look to turn really and stay present with eyes open

333
01:00:56,799 --> 01:01:02,880
and looking in that direction seeing what is this having an open heart where nothing in

334
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:10,319
the world can touch because everything just goes right through does not mean that we become indifferent

335
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:18,799
it just gives a lot more room for our wisdom our care our interest and our love

336
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:26,000
our compassion to operate and those things love compassion

337
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:33,280
wisdom interest those are not second arrows and those do

338
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:42,720
not stick out in a way that people can twist and hurt us even more so

339
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:53,280
so in summary what i'm hoping in offering you this

340
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:58,960
talk is that uh you'll get interested and curious

341
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:05,520
about your second arrows what are they and

342
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:11,280
and if you're a little bit like me then perhaps sometimes you'll see clearly what it is

343
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:17,760
and sometimes you won't and you'll say what what is the second arrow i think there's a second arrow here

344
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:25,039
what's going on and get curious and and um and to keep this kind of on the

345
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:32,400
forefront maybe forever but maybe for this week maybe talk to friends and journal about it reflect on it

346
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:38,079
meditate with it what is my second arrows what are my second arrows

347
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:44,319
and in what way do my second arrows what way are those second arrows the

348
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:50,559
very things that the world keeps twisting and twisting and turning in

349
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:57,280
deeper and deeper so thank you everyone and thank you for

350
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:02,640
being here and and i hope that you have a wonderful

351
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:07,760
week and and when you've

352
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:14,319
pulled out your arrows um put them down don't put them in your

353
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:20,160
quiver put them down and retire them

354
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:25,920
