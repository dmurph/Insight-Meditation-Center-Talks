1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:09,040
good evening welcome welcome nice to see you

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:15,519
all yes you're welcome to move wherever you'd like to be

3
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:23,359
comfortable and so tonight I'd like to um Begin by talking a little about this

4
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,560
story yes I was uh while I was meditating I was thinking this Buddha

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:37,200
has this uh right with one uh hand down and um the the story behind that is

6
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:44,640
that oops is that the Buddha he had this um

7
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:51,559
idea that he wanted to sit and he was not going to move until he became awakened after he had uh renounced kind

8
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:59,079
of like all these indulgences and aestheticism he had made up his mind okay I'm going to sit and meditate and

9
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:04,838
I'm not going to move until I become awakened so with a a tremendous amount

10
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:10,799
of determination and resolve he sits down sorts meditating many of you might

11
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:17,960
know the story and then Mara shows up now who is Mara Mara it sounds like the

12
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:25,360
is the is the microphone going in and out no no okay maybe it's just

13
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:32,560
me that uh so Mara is uh tried to enticed the Buddha tried to you know get

14
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,799
him to not become awakened so I enticed him with things that he thought oh there

15
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,399
we go this microphone I'm going to use another microphone I think that's yeah

16
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,079
this one's just problematic

17
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:25,000
how is this sound does this this microphone work is it is it on I think so yeah it is on okay I'll use this

18
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:35,760
one so tries to entice the Buddha with you know all these beautiful things that

19
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:42,239
people humans get enticed by and when that didn't well that's one version of the story another version of the story

20
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:49,040
is that Mara attacked the Buddha with 10 different armies and these different armies uh

21
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,560
stand for different qualities that could cause a person to not become

22
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,840
awakened so to say a little bit about Mara I wouldn't say that he's a Satan IC

23
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,040
character sometime he's more he just doesn't want people to become awakened

24
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:13,200
so he'd be perfectly happy if humans were just rolling around in a sensal

25
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:20,080
pleasure all day every day so he has no interest in people going to hell or anything like that instead he would

26
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,959
prefer you know that they just have a certain amount of complacency but they just don't practice

27
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:33,799
or you know don't do anything like that so this is the mara character and he shows up in a number of different

28
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:39,200
settings um often like disguised as somebody else and then the the Buddha

29
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:46,360
will say I see you Mara and then Mara goes away and the nuns Mara shows up

30
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,400
tries to uh entice some of the nuns to no longer practice and they always see

31
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,120
him and say I see you Mara and then he goes away but what I want to talk about

32
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:05,239
tonight is uh one of these uh armies that get sent to the kind of

33
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:10,519
dissuade the Buddha from practicing and in particular you know can we turn up

34
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:16,680
that volume just a tiny bit I feel like I'm I'm having to project my voice and this will only last for so long and then

35
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,959
I'll lose my voice yeah so maybe that's yeah there we go thank

36
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,560
you so there's a very creative individual I appreciate this so much his

37
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:37,400
name is aan Kun Adamo he's a monk at the Forest River Arrow River Arrow River

38
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:44,440
Forest Hermitage in Northern Ontario Canada he's in the aan cha lineage and

39
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,680
he wrote stories about this for modern

40
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,919
audiences modern being I think he wrote These in the early 2000s I think if he

41
00:04:54,919 --> 00:05:00,720
had wrote them like this last year he would it would include a lot of texting and YouTube WR you know something like

42
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,680
this but it doesn't include that so these stories are of Mara

43
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,960
writing letters to his 10 different armies like encouraging them like here's

44
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:21,280
how to dissuade this Buddha character and not only the Buddha character I would say actually the letters are set

45
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:28,560
in modern times so how to just it didn't work for the Buddha but maybe Mara and

46
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:36,720
his armies can suade us today and it's uh written kind of uh

47
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:43,039
it's well in this particular one it's a little bit harsh the uh language that uh

48
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:48,639
Mar that aanad puts into the mouth of

49
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:55,160
Mara so these are letters from Mara there are 10 letters and um I'm just

50
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:01,639
going to read one as an introduction to uh what I want to talk about tonight

51
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:11,720
so uh here's the letter goes my sixth Army so the sixth Army is the army of

52
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:19,400
cowardice so this is Mara writing to the members of this Army who encourage

53
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:25,720
cowardness and others my sixth Army you have a special

54
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,759
place in the task of keeping beings in a state of bondage

55
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:37,160
you weaken the being whom you attack and render them vulnerable to my terrible

56
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:44,520
aspect I prefer to charm and Delight but I will tolerate No opposition and those

57
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:51,080
few who fail to be seduced must be terrorized into submission so this is

58
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:56,879
Mara saying you know I'd rather just make a humans just be seduced into doing

59
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:02,800
something that feels good and never practicing or anything like that but for those people who won't do that he's what

60
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,879
does he say he wants to terrorize us into submission so then uh he continues and

61
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:15,680
he says physical cardice is useful in its place but it is the spiritual and

62
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,199
moral type of cowardice that is most suitable for our

63
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:28,360
purposes being must be koled into clutching at a sense of

64
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:34,800
security this this is the trick we must play of course you and I know there is

65
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,960
no security but and all beings are subject to the awful realities of birth sickness

66
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:48,560
old age and death but no matter the dream of security may be a hopeless one

67
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:55,159
but it is powerful being everywhere are afraid to

68
00:07:55,159 --> 00:08:00,919
risk what they have and can be reduced to spiritual impetus by that that

69
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:06,840
fear encourage them often to not take

70
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:14,080
risks if they risk they may grow and if they grow they may awaken so it takes great courage to

71
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,240
plunge into the voidness and this we can undermine this is after all the golden

72
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,280
age of cowardice we can encourage the humans to

73
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,919
make a virtue of their cardice they can call it Prudence or

74
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:37,200
they can call it responsibility they will get up every morning and put on their hats and take

75
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:44,600
the subway to their dull grind of a job and carefully planned for their retirement and by that time they'll be

76
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,839
so beaten down that they will slide easily and thoughtlessly the rest of the

77
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:56,200
way to the Grave ouch this is kind of harsh this is

78
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:03,120
kind of harsh you know I kind of like this creative way way he's putting it but uh so this uh

79
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,160
auno up there in Canada when he's writing these letters he's having Mara

80
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:14,720
saying that um being must be ConEd into clutching at a sense of

81
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:21,519
security we all want to have a sense of security we want to feel safe of course we do and I'm going to talk about this a

82
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:28,000
little bit more but part of this is the clutching part you know like this holding on so

83
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,320
tightly we all know that holding on tightly is not the way to Greater Freedom doesn't matter what you're

84
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:41,200
holding on just the whole activity of just um clinging clutching is not the

85
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:47,200
way towards greater freedom and there's this way we can say

86
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,519
clutching at a sense of security that we might say that we clutch at wanting to

87
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:58,920
feel comfortable all the time not willing to maybe like take some risks or

88
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:05,079
do something a little bit different or maybe even to recognize that we don't

89
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:10,200
control as much as we think we do or to

90
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:16,920
recognize that you know old age sickness and death is you know nobody is immune

91
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:22,800
from this it's going to happen to all of us but instead we want to feel security

92
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,959
you know secure or I'll put in the word comfortable so we kind of like uh grab on to these things going to help us feel

93
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:34,079
comfortable able and then in this uh letter to his

94
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:40,720
army Mara saying encourage people to not take risks I'll talk a little bit more about

95
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:48,079
that uh this evening too but it's risky to take

96
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:55,360
risks right and sometimes we just don't feel like we want that we want things that are controllable and predictable

97
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,680
and you know we just want to go straight line and get whatever we want

98
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:07,399
but you know life doesn't unfold that way we all know that there's a part of us that recognizes that no matter how

99
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:14,000
much we might wish for things to be comfortable and predictable or

100
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,079
controllable at least and then this continues with encourage them to make a virtue of their

101
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:27,800
caradus I mean this is uh you know some of the things that maybe we hide behind

102
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:35,320
or um I mean this idea of being responsible of course is important and being prudent of

103
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:42,279
course is important but is there a way in which we hide behind that and not take a little

104
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:48,760
bit of risks or maybe not um feel some of the comfortable uncomfortableness

105
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:55,800
I'll talk a little bit more about that this evening so if we're not going to succumb

106
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:02,040
to uh Mara's Army of cowardness we might say it was to be to be

107
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:07,839
courageous to Have Courage so what what does that mean to

108
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:14,800
have courage we might say that it's the capacity to face

109
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:22,000
fear face uncomfortableness face fear including you know fear of

110
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,519
humiliation or danger or you know some of these things like this so it doesn't

111
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:36,320
have to be you know the obvious things that are fearful being accosted or natural

112
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,519
disasters or you know some of these things and I'll talk a little bit more

113
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:48,839
about that I feel like I'm saying that a lot I'll talk about this and I'm not actually talking about them yet but first I just want to def say a little

114
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:56,160
bit more about this whole idea of Courage because as long as human beings

115
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:04,320
have something to lose or have the idea that they have something to lose as long as High human

116
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:11,560
beings are exposed to uncertainty as long as human beings are exposed to risk

117
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,920
fear will be a part of the human

118
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,800
experience it's just part of The Human Experience if you if there were a life

119
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,120
that had absolutely no fear then and it was completely predictable and

120
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,199
controllable then that's actually a life of a God not of a

121
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:41,519
human so this is the experience that we are having as being a human so I would

122
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:50,079
say like the maybe the ideal for a human life is not the absence of fear but can

123
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:57,399
we meet it or work with it can we have some courage in these so many different

124
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:03,120
ways so the stereotypical idea of Courage of course is the superhero that

125
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,519
is uh standing up to the Beast this

126
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:14,040
um and maybe we might even say that the story that I just told about the Buddha

127
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:20,839
sitting down to meditate and uh Mara accosting him with all of his uh those

128
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:28,120
10 armies and the Buddha continues to sit Mara asks him who says that you can

129
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:36,279
get awakened and that when the Buddha touches the ground and says the Earth is my witness I I'm worthy I can I'm going to

130
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:42,680
become awakened so and so in Buddhism we have

131
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:49,079
this idea of this kind of stereotypical idea of what courage is

132
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:55,519
but we might say the part of Courage is having the

133
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:01,040
fear that's in proportion to the actual Danger

134
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:08,600
sometimes we fear we have a lot of fear for things that maybe aren't that

135
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,920
dangerous but you know our stories our life history all these things you know

136
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:20,880
sometimes these get out of proportion so part of Courage maybe is to

137
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,839
recognize it's maybe not so dangerous and I say that recognizing that that's

138
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:33,560
like a logical statement but so often when it comes to fear logic doesn't work

139
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:39,079
at least for me it doesn't I am much bigger than

140
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:45,839
spiders but I don't know they give I they I don't I can't explain it they don't uh scare me as much as they used

141
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:52,040
to but uh you know and I can co- with them but uh yeah there's a way in which

142
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:59,759
spiders kind of make me feel uncomfortable but you know logic says there's no reason for that whatsoever

143
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:09,160
so part of this practice a big part of I would say the Buddhist practice is um

144
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:16,639
this recognition of suffering difficulties Dua

145
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:22,440
uncomfortableness and then we might say that courage is is order to be with the

146
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:29,880
suffering to turn towards it to recognize it to acknowledge it so often

147
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:36,480
we want to turn away we want to avoid the suffering maybe it's due to fear maybe

148
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:43,680
it's due to Habit whatever the reason I think having

149
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,319
a certain amount of Courage is a way in which to like just turn towards Yep this

150
00:16:49,319 --> 00:16:55,480
is Dua it's really terrible what's happening and to allow ourselves to

151
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:03,360
experience that in a way that feels appropriate not to tip us into overwhelm but in a way that acknowledges the truth

152
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:10,038
of what's actually happening without sugar coating or pretending that it's

153
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:15,558
different and to be sure I'm not saying that we have to like indulge in in uh

154
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:22,038
the difficulties and suffering there's beautiful things that are happening in the world as well so maybe if I to would

155
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:29,640
to broaden the statement I would say big part of practice is to see things as they really are the beautiful and the

156
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:35,240
Really the suffering but so often the suffering we bounce off of we I I kind

157
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:41,200
of like it like this like you know like when there when there's uh when there's a little bit of moisture on the finger

158
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:49,760
that hits a hot iron or something it's just this idea that we just jump right off so part of Courage is to be with

159
00:17:49,760 --> 00:18:00,520
some of the difficulties to do anything that's different than our habitual turning away or or habitual

160
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:07,919
not even um acknowledging it maybe and so that turns

161
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:15,480
to this notion of the maybe just courage to overcome this pervasive but often not

162
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,919
really conscious for us fear in everyday

163
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:28,919
life this way that we to to notice and be sensitive to that there are things

164
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:36,880
are risky and fearful because humans are

165
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:43,240
vulnerable we are it's it's the truth we're vulnerable in so many ways

166
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:49,600
physical ways illness aging accidents disease all these

167
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,840
things certainly something the pandemic uh taught us right how many people died

168
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:00,720
it's heartbreaking that humans are vulnerable

169
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:08,919
and so risk is just an essential it's a a component of life it's just the way

170
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:14,400
that it is even though we often try to uh not acknowledge that but no matter

171
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:21,840
how confident we are no matter how Brave we are or no matter what privileges we

172
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:32,520
have in our life or privileges we don't have in our life risk is a part of the human

173
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:41,880
experience and so we are all aware of this of this risk and is there a way

174
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:48,640
that we can acknowledge that without collapsing without kind of

175
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:57,120
like shutting down without as um retreating you know um pulling back from

176
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:04,400
life can we have the courage to say yeah

177
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:14,720
things aren't controllable and predictable in the way that we would like and that's okay and that's

178
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:21,880
okay so often we think we need courage for these giant obvious things

179
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:30,240
but maybe we really need it for some of these everyday life things as well

180
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:38,840
we don't know guarantees about our health no guarantees about um car

181
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:44,760
accidents or these types of things it's quite

182
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:53,240
something but if we allow this the fear to be felt and then to maybe like

183
00:20:53,240 --> 00:21:00,880
overtake us or scare us in a way that uh really

184
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:08,520
causes us to collapse then there's this way in which the these long-term effects of like just

185
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:14,600
perpetually feeling fear you know feeling afraid then we just start having this

186
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:21,279
inability to take risks this inability to be

187
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:26,840
Innovative in ability to be creative or inability to feel

188
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,520
deeply to feel our

189
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:38,240
emotions an inability to maybe like think independently have a mind of our

190
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:44,640
own as opposed to just uh following the group think or something like

191
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,640
this so This PR this practice is asking us to acknowledge their risks not to

192
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,919
pretend that they're not there and yet to meet them with what I'm calling

193
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:02,120
courage to meet them say yeah there are no

194
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,799
guarantees and to live a life fully

195
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:14,400
anyway and to grow and develop and cultivate wholesome qualities

196
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,000
anyway even though there aren't any

197
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:26,799
guarantees and so we might say that courage is needed

198
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:34,120
to feel Joy Joy or to experience

199
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:40,480
Beauty there's a way to say yes I'm aware of you know how things

200
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:46,360
are and I'm choosing to tune into and feel

201
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:51,679
Joy when it's available to experience the beauty and

202
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,440
be uplifted when the beauty is

203
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:03,600
available so maybe courage ends uh turns out to be something like uh avoiding

204
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:12,080
despair when we feel like there's no hope because sometimes this happens right we we experience loss we

205
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:17,360
experience failure that's part of the human experience it's

206
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,880
guaranteed and so there might be this way in which we' be tempted to as I said

207
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:31,320
kind of collapse or maybe just to close down and refuse to open up to any new

208
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:38,279
chances I know uh somebody it was really heartbreaking for

209
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:45,159
me to see that I just really loved uh his dog you know they they were just

210
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:50,440
Pals they were just uh friends you know just uh spend all this time together and

211
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:56,080
went for walks together and all these types of things and then the dog had ended up

212
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:02,120
with an autoimmune disease and Di died early oh it was so

213
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:08,440
sad and then a year later just in conversation with this individual was

214
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,600
like saying something about uh dogs it's like no no dogs die I'm never getting

215
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,960
one again it's like oh and then you know maybe two years later like nope I'm

216
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:26,919
never doing that again it's a heartbreak the heart the first heartbreak of um having this beloved family member die

217
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:35,559
but a second heartbreak of kind of like closing down and not being open to the joy that having a beloved pet can

218
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:42,279
bring so maybe courage is the capacity to avoid the despair when it feels

219
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:48,320
hopeless maybe courage is to instead of having this what wanting to close down

220
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:54,080
or be secluded or pretend to be or want to feel like

221
00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:01,279
we're completely invulnerable trying to get rid of anything that might make us uh

222
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:07,679
vulnerable maybe courage is just uh instead kind like including the energy

223
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:14,840
to live our life to have a this um energy to make a

224
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:22,399
new beginning often this doesn't sound like something we would call courage but it

225
00:25:22,399 --> 00:25:28,440
does take a certain amount of courage to allow the heart and the mind

226
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:34,399
to be open so you might say well how do we

227
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:42,200
develop courage how can we cultivate this so that it can be a part of our lives and help us to

228
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:47,360
meet this Human Experience

229
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:54,600
and sometimes um I'll say that Viria this is a poly word that often most often gets translated as

230
00:25:54,600 --> 00:26:02,520
energy but it also can get translated as courage are is related to the word for warrior

231
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:10,200
and it's like you know somebody who does what a warrior does I guess you know goes into battle or something like this

232
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:17,520
but related to that is this um idea of Courage so then the question is well how do we cultivate

233
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:25,080
this first of all say there's a connection between courage and

234
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:31,840
Trust they're like really tightly uh weed and then the question naturally

235
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:40,159
arises well trust what what can we trust and this is maybe for all of us to

236
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:47,919
discover for ourselves rather than somebody saying here you know trust this and if you do

237
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:54,480
you're a good practitioner if you don't you're a bad practitioner or something like this I'll offer a few things that some

238
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:00,880
people find helpful and maybe they'll resonate for you and if they don't resonate for you just an encouragement

239
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:07,919
to find something that's like bigger than yourself that you feel like you can

240
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:14,880
trust so some people trust mindfulness they trust this idea okay if I can be

241
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:22,279
with the experience then it's not it's then it's going to be okay like it's not going to

242
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:29,559
uh um I'm not going to get blindsided by things or it's a if I can like be with

243
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:35,080
my bodily experience and know what my thoughts are doing then then I'm not going to tip into overwhelm so some

244
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:41,200
people trust just mindfulness practice some people have a regular

245
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:47,159
practice of taking the refuges refuge in budha Dharma and sa I haven't talked

246
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:52,840
about that so much um here on Monday nights those of you many of you may be

247
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:59,320
familiar with this but this is just uh this idea of I mean like orienting our

248
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:05,320
life we might say towards the Buddha we could say represents the potential for

249
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:12,880
awakening the Dharma the teachings that can help that Awakening and SAA other

250
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:18,840
practitioners that are such a important part of this practice so to like Orient

251
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:26,720
our life in that direction Buddha dharman SAA some people trust in uh the effects

252
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,760
of like meta practice doing some loving kindness

253
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:37,919
practice this warmhearted wish for good will for other people there's a way in

254
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:45,159
which uh and I can I speak from experience having done um certain amount of this doing regular L and kindness

255
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:50,720
practice just softens the heart and opens the mind and then there's just uh

256
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:56,240
less fear and more trust or

257
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,399
more connection Maybe with others less being closed something

258
00:29:01,399 --> 00:29:09,720
like this some people have a devotional practice maybe they chant or bow or

259
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:15,440
light incense or make offerings or you know something like

260
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:21,880
this so an encouragement to see if there is something that trust that's bigger

261
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:28,320
than just you because I mean it's this Human Experience is not always easy and

262
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:35,679
it's nice to sometimes say you know what I don't actually know what to do next or

263
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:40,960
I don't I can't I don't have Clarity or I don't have energy or something and

264
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:48,440
then there's a way in which can we dare I say this word surrender to something

265
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:53,960
bigger than ourselves because there's a way in which if we feel like I have to

266
00:29:53,960 --> 00:30:01,000
do everything myself that's exhausting and we just don't always have access to

267
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,799
that we don't always have the energy or the clarity or

268
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:15,000
the the wish to do that so one way courage is to develop

269
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:22,600
you know to feel into for you what is something that you can trust that's meaningful for you and that can help

270
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:28,000
with courage and bne brown some of you might

271
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:35,399
might know she's a best-selling author and has a a number of uh books she

272
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:41,960
writes courage is a habit a virtue you get it by doing

273
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:50,840
courageous X it's like you learn to swim by swimming you learn Courage by

274
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:57,440
couraging so are there some small little things that you know I don't really want to do this this makes me feel a bit

275
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:05,159
uncomfortable but to make friends with the spiders I'm speaking to myself is there

276
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:10,240
you know take small risks where the stakes are not very

277
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:17,480
high it's absolutely true that we start to gain a little bit you know more confidence if we take small risks

278
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:25,039
doesn't mean that everything's going to turn out great we might have some failures and some losses but often we learn the most from

279
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:32,360
those even though they tend they are the most uncomfortable but is there a way that you

280
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:38,679
can stretch yourself a little bit to act with courage when things are a little

281
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:45,159
bit frightening in a wise way of course it's so great to practice when

282
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:50,880
the stakes are low because there will be times in your life when the stakes will

283
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,120
be high maybe it's having a very difficult

284
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:02,799
conversation with somebody and it may take a lot of courage to say

285
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:09,200
what's needed to be said but having practiced in places where there's lower Stakes will make

286
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:16,240
that easier maybe the courage to say

287
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,399
goodbye you know loss is part of life

288
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:27,960
and people are we have to say goodbye in so many different ways

289
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:34,360
but to say it you know with a open heart and to meet what it is that driving to

290
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:40,360
say goodbye so we often we come to

291
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:46,519
meditation practice we come to uh this Buddhist practice thinking that it's going to lessen the difficulties we have

292
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:53,279
of course we do we come here think like okay this is going to make me feel better less stress or something like

293
00:32:53,279 --> 00:33:01,480
this maybe we thinking we'll have some wisdom or some new understandings or maybe even some some cool meditative

294
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:07,880
experiences chances are that um whatever reason brought you here

295
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:14,519
tonight or to this practice in general you probably weren't thinking like okay I want to you know learn how to be more

296
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:20,840
courageous or something like that but I would say courage is a part

297
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:27,320
of meeting aspects of ourselves that maybe we haven't seen before seeing

298
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:33,679
parts of ourselves that maybe aren't so flattering I know that was hard for me

299
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:40,440
to realize oh yeah I really yeah I didn't handle that well at all you know

300
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:45,480
to just to see that whereas before I had felt like how dare they treat me this

301
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:51,039
way you know early in practice I kept on seeing all these aspects of myself that

302
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:56,120
weren't so flattering takes a certain amount of courage to admit that like oh

303
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:02,200
yeah I thought I was always in the right turns out I'm not as in the right all

304
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:11,480
the time so this idea of Courage is part of

305
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:16,878
practice this idea of not that we get to get rid of all

306
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:24,200
fear but that uh we don't allow it to shut us down or close us down but show

307
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:31,280
up anyway and that we can learn Courage by

308
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:39,200
couraging so with that I'll open it up to see if there's any questions and comments thank

309
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:47,520
you does anybody have something they'd like to say or question about

310
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:55,878
this this idea of Courage as a way to counter this Army of cowardice

311
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:07,680
is quite something he says could jol into clutching at a sense of security

312
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:14,079
like ouch I think all of us want to feel security right but is there a way that we're clutching so much that it's

313
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:21,839
inhibiting our growth or getting in our way and this is part of what it means to be wise right is to recognize okay what

314
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:28,480
risks are prudent which ones aren't

315
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,760
and can we stretch ourselves a little

316
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:47,440
bit maybe I I'll share that is there a question while it goes there I'll say

317
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:55,359
that um I was talking with Gil and he was encouraging me Dan you you should give uh talks without

318
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:03,520
notes I was like that's scary I I think I'm going to do this so um I'm

319
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:08,960
I'm not here next week but uh I I'm gonna do some without notes so we we'll

320
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:15,200
see how that goes this is Diana trying to be brave have some courage so yes

321
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:22,079
your comment um yeah I was just going to say I really enjoyed the talk this evening um I think two aspects and then

322
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:28,079
I had a question so the first aspect I really like the story about the man and his dog um

323
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:34,200
it just it reminded me a lot and maybe a lot of people had this experience like I remember when I was in a very serious

324
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:41,560
relationship and I was like oh no never again I never want to feel lost again and you know and like then later I Found

325
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:49,920
the courage to um so but it took a tremendous amount of courage to like open yourself up to vulnerability again

326
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:57,680
um so I thought that really resonated with me and then the second part too was speaking about um brne Brown um and a

327
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:03,880
lot of her talks and her her her research on on courage and vulnerability

328
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:09,520
um I think it's incredibly powerful but I was I was sort of curious like how

329
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:16,000
does this practice um help one cultivate courage I'm just trying to figure out I

330
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,160
I think that there's a there there but I just I'm not exactly how how they're so

331
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:27,040
interrelated yeah that's a great question and I didn't uh lay out a lot of things specifically but one thing

332
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:32,599
I'll just say here is um there's a number of things we can do

333
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:38,599
and one is this raft practice that I've uh talked about before R is recognize so

334
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:44,960
recognize like oh wow there's a lot of fear a is to allow like allow it and

335
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:52,720
it's just like okay the fear is here like not to push it away just to recognize it's here and then the third f

336
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:59,240
is to feel it in the body this turns out to be enormously powerful to feel the

337
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:05,640
lump in the throat to feel the restlessness the wish to run away to feel whatever it is there's a way in

338
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:14,240
which when we feel in the body makes it a little bit more tangible and it's not quite as um scary it's just an

339
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:20,119
uncomfortable bodily sensation the mind is going to be making up all kinds of stories and we let the mind just do what

340
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:25,520
it we just let the Mind do what it wants to and we're just going to focus on the

341
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:31,359
bodily experience the fear and then might be um helpful

342
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:36,920
to um feel like the pressure of whatever you're sitting on or feel your feet on

343
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:45,119
the ground so that you feel grounded and this is a tremendous way great way to like meet fear so raft recognize allow

344
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:51,520
feel in the body and then the T I'm going to say is trust and the trust here

345
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:57,760
is trust that you don't have to fix it at precisely this moment fix fix it

346
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,800
another moment but precisely this moment you're just going to recognize allow and

347
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:08,160
feel in the body and this is a great way to meet things that are

348
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:13,280
scary thank you you're welcome anybody else have a comment oh

349
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,800
yes over

350
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:27,880
here thank you so much for the talk it really resonated um and I think talk now

351
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:35,680
like taking risk of fear of public humiliation um so the question I had is

352
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:44,240
um why do we have this clinging towards security or really this need for

353
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:49,880
security when logically there is no security but still there is that need

354
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:56,040
that somehow even in old age I need to plan things I'm sorry I missed the last part

355
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:03,280
the uh like in old age even though logically I know there is no security but there is this oh I need to plan

356
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:10,640
things so that bad things don't happen but I know they're going to happen anyway but that need is always there to

357
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:16,520
somehow cling to security I don't have the answer to this

358
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:24,240
like why I don't know why humans do this I know that we do it seems logical that if I had to

359
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:30,280
guess I would say evolutionary biology those individuals that survived the

360
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:35,839
saber Tigers Etc were the ones that planned and you know and were able to

361
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:42,280
protect themselves and so this is something that we've inherited but um I don't have a good

362
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:47,800
answer exactly why maybe also say that logic turns out not to be as persuasive

363
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:53,359
as we think it should be right I so you know things that are logical but we see

364
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:59,599
humans doing illogical things all the time just and I would say like why

365
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:05,000
because they feel uncomfortable and they'll just want to do anything to feel more comfortable and sometimes that what

366
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:11,839
they're doing to feel more comfortable is just illogical this is this is my

367
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,318
assumption yeah thank

368
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:27,640
you thank you that was wonderful um talking about couraging so um I res it a

369
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:33,680
lot with the way you express the concept of just acknowledging the fear that

370
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:39,560
you're going through so for example I'm going through a difficult phase in my life right now and just acknowledging

371
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:46,079
that yeah and being with it versus trying to say no hey everything's fine

372
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:53,160
so acknowledging it and then respecting it and then somewhat to your point surrendering to you to it in a regular

373
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:59,720
basis and trusting there's something else out there that will take care of it at some point point I think uh that

374
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:05,520
really resonated and uh maybe one just thought is a book that I have been

375
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:13,800
reading which has been really helpful in that is a a book called The Surrender experiment oh and that is literally the

376
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:19,200
theme of the book which is how do you surrender every day oh very interesting

377
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:24,599
and who's the author Michael Singer oh okay great thank you the surrender

378
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:30,799
experiment great great thank you thank you thank

379
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:40,640
you I have time maybe for one more comment or

380
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:47,720
sure I forget what I do do I hold it do something just talk yeah you said having your feet on the

381
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:53,119
ground or something like that um well I when I was breaking up with a boyfriend

382
00:42:53,119 --> 00:43:00,119
all I had to do was stand that's feet on the ground for sure and then I could express myself because I'm didn't

383
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:07,160
here you know it's amazing right how our bodily

384
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:13,680
posture what an impact it has yeah yeah great thank you thank

385
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,160
you okay so thank you all and I wish you a wonderful rest of the evening thank

386
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,160
