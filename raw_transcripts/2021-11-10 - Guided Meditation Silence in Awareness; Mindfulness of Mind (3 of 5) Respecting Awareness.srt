1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,160
so good morning and welcome

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,679
and um so this week

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,680
when i'm entitled to kind of mindfulness of mind is not the same as uh what we did some

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,760
weeks ago with we did the third foundation of mindfulness where that was also mindfulness of mind

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,840
it's a mindfulness mind is kind of like a little sometimes used these days as a

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,280
almost synonymous with mindfulness of awareness it has other meanings as well

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,200
but uh the ability to notice awareness

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,640
not just the objects of awareness is uh one of the great delights that can

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:56,239
come along with this practice and uh it's also uh very helpful for

10
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:04,478
kind of feeling your way to freedom freedom from clinging to the objects of awareness

11
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:09,840
and so there's a kind of a paradigm shift that goes on in meditation

12
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,960
and it's a little bit like this that um

13
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,240
or very much like this is starting to become aware of the

14
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,439
silence of awareness or the spaciousness

15
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:32,640
the vast space of awareness or the stillness of awareness and these are kind of metaphors so it's

16
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,079
not exactly we are kind of experiencing it but we don't want to make it into something too

17
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:45,680
solid or fixed ideas but for example

18
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:57,200
when you taste a strawberry

19
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,920
and it's the taste the tasting on the tongue

20
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,280
is very distinct from the idea of strawberry the ideas of liking the

21
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,360
strawberry the taste is the tasting

22
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,720
has no words as part of the tasting the words come as

23
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:27,520
a response to the taste and so sometimes when we really want to taste something well

24
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,959
we let we even close our eyes we reduce our senses and we even let the thinking mind become

25
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,400
quiet so we can really sense what's happening

26
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,560
the tasting is silent but the mind might not might not be there might

27
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:51,640
be immediately a cascade of thoughts about wanting more strawberries

28
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,760
when we see the seeing itself is silent

29
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:04,959
the words and stories ideas and the mind are secondary they come after the seeing

30
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,920
but the seeing itself happens in silence

31
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,440
uh the um if you uh

32
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,840
or spend a cold day and

33
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:30,239
then maybe working hard outdoors and you come home and take a warm bath and really want to feel the

34
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:36,799
wonderfulness of the warm bath and really let it soak in and relax

35
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:43,040
the sensations of the body the relaxation the warmth this comfort

36
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:50,640
the sensing there in the body is silent of chatter of thoughts of ideas

37
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:57,360
and there again if you want to really feel this the pleasure the comfort the relaxation of

38
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,640
the path you might even kind of put aside all your thoughts and concerns for a few

39
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:09,040
moments and just really luxuriate in the silence of it and the silent mind

40
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,360
so there is this paradigm shift where we are capable of meditation to also sense

41
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:22,880
and feel things in silence it's also possible to be aware

42
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,919
by thinking about it by having cognition and thoughts and

43
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:34,960
labels recognitions oh this is warmth this is a strawberry and this is also this in a simple way

44
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,320
this is also part of mindfulness but

45
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,919
mindfulness of awareness is closer to

46
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:52,720
being aware of the silence in which we're aware the space in which we're aware the

47
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,759
stillness in which we're aware and it's a radical shift

48
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,880
from being concerned with the content of our thoughts

49
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:10,720
with the things we're thinking about or things we are aware of so even if you're aware of your body

50
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,479
there's a shift to not only being aware of the sensations but being aware of the

51
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:22,000
awareness that is aware an awareness which is

52
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,520
coterminous with stillness with silence with spaciousness

53
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,520
so i hope this makes some sense and if not don't worry about it

54
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:42,160
except that it might be good to file this away because someday it might be relevant

55
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:49,120
so to assume a meditation posture and to

56
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,280
relax your gaze lower your gaze

57
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,000
and to gently close your eyes

58
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:22,720
and to appreciate the sensations of your body

59
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,960
whatever they might be and how the body experience them

60
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:37,360
experiences them silently the body is not a thought

61
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,000
the body feels and senses

62
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,599
and to gently take a few long slow deep breaths

63
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:57,479
and relax let go as you exhale

64
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:16,680
into and then let your breathing return to normal

65
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,039
and become aware of the silent way in which the body senses breathing

66
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:34,080
in and of itself there's no thoughts in the lungs in the diaphragm and the

67
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:40,000
belly but there are sensations

68
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:48,400
that maybe become a little bit more vivid when the thinking mind becomes quiet

69
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,120
or more with vivid as we feel the silence

70
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,120
around those sensations

71
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,759
and then as you exhale to relax some more

72
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:25,000
throughout your body wherever it feels good to relax relax and soften

73
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,440
relaxing your thinking mind

74
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:26,800
softening the pressure the tension associated with thinking

75
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:40,480
gently as you exhale allowing the agitation of thinking

76
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,199
to settle down

77
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:23,279
and is there a silent way of noticing thinking

78
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,800
a silent knowing or sensing

79
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,320
the mind involved in its thoughts

80
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,360
and then again feeling your breathing

81
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,800
and perhaps a silent awareness of breathing

82
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:29,320
silent that's free of wanting and not wanting anything

83
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:48,480
silent silent from ideas of time before and after

84
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,680
the silence that allows us to just sense

85
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:03,320
feel the breathing of the moment

86
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,560
and if you feel any silence quiet

87
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:41,760
quietness that silence is inseparable

88
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:48,720
from a certain kind of awareness a silent awareness

89
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,240
the silent knowing

90
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,800
that's receptive

91
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:11,800
it has space for breathing to arise within

92
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,839
and the practice is the meeting of the breathing

93
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:38,639
in the silent awareness and as my thinking mind gets quieter and

94
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:46,800
more focused each of these becomes more vivid

95
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:53,760
the breathing becomes more vivid in the body and the awareness that silently is aware

96
00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:01,199
of breathing becomes more vivid to the meeting of these two

97
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:06,639
breathing and awareness stay there

98
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:13,519
let the rhythm of breathing keep you connected

99
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,839
to awareness

100
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,519
like the waves on the ocean wash up across the sandy shore

101
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,160
back and forth

102
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,720
foreign

103
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:46,080
sometimes our attention is directed

104
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,720
sometimes attention is receptive

105
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:59,120
when there's a lot of thinking a lot of desires and

106
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:06,440
efforts to do attention tends to be directed

107
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,840
but sometimes it's nice to meet our friends our family our neighbors

108
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:21,840
strangers with the receptive awareness

109
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,640
one that's not carrying a lot of judgments ideas bias

110
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,640
history

111
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,760
maybe even awareness that's a little bit silent

112
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:47,520
of thoughts just present

113
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:53,279
open available to feel to sense

114
00:27:53,279 --> 00:28:02,519
to be aware and kind of silent awareness of another person of others

115
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,840
sometimes that's a way of experiencing others

116
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:15,039
more fully without

117
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:19,840
the limitations of our preconceived ideas

118
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:31,600
it's respectful of others to be receptive of how they are in their

119
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:38,398
own terms rather than coming with our preconceived ideas

120
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:50,240
and may it be that this practice that we do fosters this kind of respect

121
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:56,880
the respect that we allow people to be themselves

122
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,799
at least until we've taken them in the fullness of who they are

123
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:10,159
in a receptive awareness maybe even a kind of silent awareness

124
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,840
silent of agendas

125
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:26,120
and maybe it's in this fuller awareness of others

126
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:32,720
that our care is born our love

127
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,360
our generosity our kindness

128
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:47,200
and maybe our kindness is transmitted more fully

129
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,120
in a mind that's not filled with preconceived ideas

130
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,440
a mind that is quieter and receptive

131
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:06,080
may it be that through this meditation practice

132
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:13,520
that we have a more vivid awareness of others

133
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:19,679
and in doing so may we contribute to their welfare and

134
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:25,520
happiness may we contribute to the welfare and

135
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,120
happiness of the whole world

136
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:36,799
may it be that this meditation practice we do supports

137
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:43,840
the happiness safety peace and freedom of others

138
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:49,360
may all beings be happy

139
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,840
may all beings be safe

140
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:59,519
may all beings be peaceful

141
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,398
and may all beings be free

142
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:58,960
thank you for letting me know so we have lots of silence

143
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:04,159
and uh the um

144
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:14,640
all these buttons to push let's see still there's messages of no sound maybe

145
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:19,600
see if you start hearing me

146
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:30,559
so still no sound maybe there's just a lot of people who typed in it takes a while for it to upload

147
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:37,720
so you should be hearing me now there we go thank you

148
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:44,799
so sometimes just being quietly

149
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:51,600
in the present moment i'm not tracking everything so all these

150
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,240
buttons to push so sorry about that

151
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:08,158
so to this morning the perspective for the topic is that of respect

152
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:14,158
and as probably you've heard me say many times that i really like the word respect

153
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:20,560
actually inspired by it partly because of its etymological meaning that it means to

154
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:27,200
look again to inspect again in the latin roots and this idea of having a willingness to

155
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,839
not just barrel ahead into the future and keep doing and doing but to

156
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:38,560
um but to also um uh

157
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:44,800
you know take a deeper look maybe our life our experience

158
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:50,878
is warrants a second look a better look sustained attention what is really

159
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:56,720
happening here so we don't take the first impression of things but we really kind of take time

160
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:01,839
to experience and feel it more deeply and then as we do this one of the

161
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:08,800
benefits of it is we begin appreciating um the looking itself

162
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,839
the the ability to give a second look that there's something

163
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:20,560
about looking again looking seeing in a relaxed and open receptive way

164
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:27,359
that's a little bit free or very free of our preconceived ideas our agendas our

165
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:34,720
preferences our bias all kinds of things that so easily comes along if we just go rapidly from one

166
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:40,560
thing to another but this thing of consciously deciding let me look more carefully here let me

167
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:46,320
take be more open let me take in this experience more fully

168
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:52,560
that's a kind of sidestepping or kind of putting aside slightly

169
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:58,800
the automatic preconceived ideas that kind of get carried along

170
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:05,920
ideas and thoughts and agendas that are directing attention often i want this i want that i want this

171
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:12,640
and that some of us can experience kind of acutely if we're surfing on the web on the computer just kind of going from

172
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:18,000
one thing to the other seeing this and that and looking and there's its mind is being directed all

173
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,839
the time but to step back and and be willing to look again look more

174
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:30,160
carefully at some point the looking becomes the fact that we're looking the

175
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:37,119
act of looking becomes kind of special you know i've been in places where

176
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:44,400
wonderful vistas great vistas you know maybe high up in the mountains with the great fist views of the

177
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:50,320
landscape or below or on on the beach looking out across the ocean

178
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:55,839
and for me at least there's something about the panoramic view of lots of space and

179
00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:01,839
openness and then kind of relaxed looking that i just enjoy looking

180
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:09,200
and after a while certainly i'm appreciating what i see but i also appreciate the relaxed open

181
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:14,480
kind of receptive just looking and gazing and it's almost like they're

182
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:19,839
they're both they're both separate and not so separate the looking and what's being seen

183
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:25,200
but how they're separate is that looking now uh stands out and highlights oh

184
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:32,079
there's seeing happening and that seeing is so relaxed and spacious and open and i could just stay

185
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:37,359
here looking at these clouds drifting the sky for a long time or looking at the river

186
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:43,119
flowing by i can just look and look and just feel so relaxed and settling to do this looking

187
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:48,640
and as opposed to writing every cloud and saying well that cloud

188
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:56,079
is a little bit too big it has too much of a bump here or that one is a nice shape and i like to keep it that way

189
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:03,200
and work you know let me find a better cloud to look at because this one's getting kind of boring um you know to constantly be involved in

190
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:09,359
this directedness it's a very different exp tends to we lose sight of the fact that we're looking

191
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:15,520
we look more at our preferences the cloud should be that way not this way and

192
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:21,680
and so this respect looking again and again is partly what we're doing in

193
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:27,680
mindfulness practice we're learning not to ride the waves of our

194
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:34,240
preferences our agendas what we always want but step back take a look at we do that

195
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:39,839
but when we step back take another look take another look at some point

196
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:47,520
the looking the mindfulness begins to stand out and highlight oh it's so good to be mindful in being mindful there's

197
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:53,040
freedom there's spaciousness there's a relaxation there's an ease and that

198
00:38:53,040 --> 00:39:00,720
this is good and we start becoming aware of awareness itself

199
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:06,000
now this topic of awareness is a big topic and um

200
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,640
and uh i think that uh i kind of like you to use the word

201
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:21,200
as a vague word because different people have different reference point for what awareness means

202
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,760
and so some people when you talk about awareness

203
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:32,400
for them the way they know things is much more through their thinking and so it they're thinking about things

204
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:39,200
that's how they're aware some people it's more a sensing they're aware to come through their body

205
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:44,720
and their sensing some people it's more of a silent knowing

206
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:49,920
where they don't not really aware of any active cognitive movement of the mind to

207
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:57,838
know but there's a silence just they know kind of intuitively or something so there's many ways to know

208
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:03,680
and um and uh in the mindfulness tradition

209
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:10,319
one of the there's a variety of different kinds of knowing that operate at different times but what

210
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:15,440
can happen with each one of them regardless of what your way of knowing is you're what you think awareness is

211
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:22,800
for yourself at some point it gets it gets highlighted it stands out a

212
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:29,760
little bit and highlight oh here is something this is the uh this is not the object or

213
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:37,440
what i'm thinking about this is the receptivity or the the experience of knowing it

214
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:43,200
and and then we can become aware of the attitudes like we talked about yesterday

215
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:48,400
that go along with it desires the contractions the that kind of

216
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,599
a part of being aware but then we take a second look

217
00:40:53,599 --> 00:41:01,040
in a second look until we begin seeing experiencing awareness knowing sensing

218
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:08,400
feeling observing whatever it might be kind of uh at ease open

219
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,680
a certain kind of silence a certain kind of spaciousness

220
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:19,280
even when there's thinking there can be a silence that knows it

221
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:26,000
one of my first entry points to uh the world of kind of spiritual life

222
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,480
was spending a week in solitude and uh it was a beautiful place and a

223
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:38,800
farm and nature and um and in the course it wasn't meditating

224
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:44,160
but in the course of the week because i had no social contact no talking with anyone it was kind of like

225
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:50,319
being on a meditation retreat without being on one and um

226
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:57,280
and i became acutely aware of myself thinking and i had no thought that i had

227
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:02,560
judgments about the fact that i was thinking but i had it was that the clarity

228
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:08,720
by which i knew i was thinking that clarity oh there's a thought it was like really

229
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:14,800
it's just like wow it's kind of there's a beauty there's a clarity there's a cleanliness there's a openness

230
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:21,520
there's a distinctness that i'd never seen before it was kind of like uh the old days the

231
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:27,760
radio would be out of tune and then suddenly it came into uh a tune you're tuning in the radio

232
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:34,720
station and you got it into tune and then suddenly it would become clear so it's kind of like that oh suddenly

233
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:39,920
the wavelength i found the wavelength my mind and i was clearly aware i knew

234
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:45,839
and that clarity of knowing that clarity that

235
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:52,400
is kind of what for some people the clarity is they call awareness

236
00:42:52,400 --> 00:43:00,160
and it's not different than awareness but it's not exactly awareness but it's coterminous with awareness

237
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:05,520
and the clarity is so beautiful so wonderful

238
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:12,800
and the clear so i became aware of this clarity that let me see my my my cognitive thoughts my words my

239
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:19,359
mind was such clarity and i appreciated the freedom the ease that was there

240
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:25,119
so to respect to be mindful mindful of awareness mindful of

241
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:30,800
the process of being aware is one of the ways supports of coming to

242
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:37,760
a place of clarity in the meditation just now i talked about silence

243
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:43,359
and that's another word i think so it's you know even though i was thinking when i was alone that week

244
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:49,920
um and that thinking became kind of acutely acutely clear each thought

245
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:55,920
i was aware of it in kind of a larger silence sometimes

246
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:01,040
what's this mindfulness awareness associated for some people is stillness

247
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:06,839
the awareness that's uh vividly softly wonderfully velvety

248
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:14,000
still or sometimes it's spaciousness just lots of space for it

249
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,040
and um and it isn't so much like that's so

250
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:25,520
the ultimate thing space or stillness or silence or clarity

251
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:31,280
but it's how it helps us to relax more deeply it's how it teaches us about non-clinging

252
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:37,680
how it helps us to see where the remaining clinging is and and you get a feeling for freedom

253
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:44,160
there's freedom in the clarity of awareness there's freedom in the stillness the silence of awareness

254
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:50,480
and so oh you get to feel like a little hint the smell the doors open for that's where freedom

255
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:56,960
is found so um finally i'll give you another analogy

256
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:02,560
that from my childhood that maybe for some of you if you're old

257
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,839
enough and did this kind of thing

258
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:14,160
when i was a little kid sometimes my parents would take their car to a car wash

259
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:19,680
and it was such that you could go in through the in the stay in the cars it

260
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:24,720
went through the car wash you know and pulled along and and all these uh

261
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:30,079
water and suds and brushes are spraying and it was kind of chaotic

262
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:35,760
outside the car and coming against the windows but inside the car

263
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:41,440
it felt so safe and quiet and peaceful and the contrast

264
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:47,599
was so that was one of the reasons i loved going through these car washes because i felt it so acutely

265
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:54,560
the highlighted the peace the quiet the stillness the safety there being inside the car

266
00:45:54,560 --> 00:46:02,720
with the chaos outside and so that's a reference point for me of how it can be in the mind sometimes

267
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:09,520
where i'm resting in awareness and there's a peace there's a quiet there's an openness

268
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:14,960
and independent of the chaos that might be happening around me

269
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:21,680
carry our peace with us so um

270
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:29,200
it's a little bit esoteric a little bit you know what i'm talking about today and

271
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:34,720
and i'm trusting that for those of you who don't quite understand what i'm saying which i wouldn't of when i was

272
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:41,599
first introduced to meditation that um just relax with it and but keep it in

273
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:47,119
mind keep it filed away and at some point you might have an experience oh that's what gill is

274
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:53,359
talking about and that might help you appreciate it and and get the benefits of that kind of

275
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:58,400
experience so thank you very much and

276
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,079
i look forward to continuing this tomorrow
