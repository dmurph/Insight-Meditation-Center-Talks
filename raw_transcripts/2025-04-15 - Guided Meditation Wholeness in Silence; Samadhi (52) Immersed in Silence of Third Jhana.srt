00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:38,360
[Music]

2
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,919
[Music]

3
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:23,079
so hello from Spirit Rock i'll be here one more day

4
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:28,760
tomorrow and uh

5
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:36,720
delightful kind of comfortably cool kind of foggy cloudy weather the

6
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:43,440
the clouds the fog should burn off today and we'll have a beautiful blue sky

7
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:51,399
and um and I'm here for a meditation

8
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:57,920
retreat so maybe a little bit more than usual i

9
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:05,560
am kind of I don't know maybe I could say in

10
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:13,519
love with what it's like to be alive when

11
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:21,160
I live living close to the world of this this unified

12
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:28,279
harmonious collected movement in

13
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:33,839
meditation and I've been reminded here because of one of the co-teers

14
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:40,600
uh Kairo Jewel Lingo who's a was a nun in the Tiknadhan tradition for 15 years

15
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:46,839
and before that lived in spiritual communities

16
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:54,720
about growing up in uh Italy and having and just enough contact with Catholic

17
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:03,399
monasteries there and um to feel the same kind of

18
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:09,279
unification coziness warmth kind of centered in my body

19
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:17,000
um in those monasteries as she has felt and as I feel

20
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,920
here so when we come to this third Janna one characteristic that's

21
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:30,320
important to keep in mind is that there's no discursive thinking and many

22
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:36,560
of us understand our life make sense of our life through the thinking mind through having

23
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:43,720
conversation explaining things to ourselves um understanding connections between

24
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:52,959
things and it's inconceivable that we could have a rich valuable safe life

25
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:58,240
without negotiating it through thinking a lot

26
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:05,560
as we come into the third Janna uh the thinking mind kind of goes

27
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:12,600
offline however it's not going into a trance uh there's actually a greater

28
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,920
clarity it's kind of like the without the thinking mind the discursive

29
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:24,959
thinking mind the conversational mind commentarial mind without going quiet and becoming

30
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:30,360
peaceful there's actually a greater sense of

31
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:38,240
clarity greater sense of clear knowing a greater sense of u kind of a

32
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,760
certain kind of healthy intelligence that the mind is capable of even though

33
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:51,000
there's very little content so one of the ways to um kind

34
00:14:51,000 --> 00:15:00,120
of appreciate this thana whether you go into it or not is um the

35
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:07,519
goodness of nonverbal thinking

36
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:14,720
most of the knowing most of the conceiving that we have through the day

37
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,839
is not done verbally or in images there's a

38
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:27,839
deeper there's a deeper uh kind of capacity that humans and

39
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:36,880
probably animals have to know that does not require a lot of thinking

40
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,920
i suspect that some of you saw the turkeys going by a little while

41
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:49,560
ago there's an intelligence in them but I suspect they're not thinking

42
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,959
about all kinds of things i don't even know how much there's a past and future

43
00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:01,440
probably some but um so many of the kind of thoughts that

44
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,920
you have um would be inconceivable for a

45
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:12,480
turkey but the turkey knows

46
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:19,680
sees and and knows enough to stay alive

47
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:26,920
so I'm not saying that you be like a turkey but I'm saying that it's kind of built into us that we have a a kind of a

48
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:32,000
nonverbal knowing a nondiscursive non-con

49
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,040
conversational knowing that in the

50
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:43,360
uh is called clear recognition

51
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:49,360
sana and even sati mindfulness or awareness

52
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,440
is a kind of silent awareness more than it is labeling

53
00:16:54,440 --> 00:17:02,399
or verbally recognizing what's happening it's a silent

54
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:10,400
recognition so this idea of a noble silence is part of moving into the Janna

55
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,959
this beautiful clarity and intelligence so for this sitting perhaps

56
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:22,160
um you can kind of attune

57
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:29,880
yourself to how there is a nonverbal clarity nonverbal awareness of

58
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:35,080
experience that is a doorway for a deeper

59
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:40,679
intimacy so assuming a meditation posture

60
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:51,799
kind of maybe rocking back and forth a little bit swaying back and

61
00:17:51,799 --> 00:18:00,600
forth kind of feeling into your posture to feel how to align

62
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:09,399
it center it have the chest a little bit more open

63
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,640
maybe adjust the head a little bit so there's a lifting at the very back of

64
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:26,280
the head it's tipping the head forward slightly and creating a little bit more

65
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:31,600
stretching little bit at the back of the

66
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:39,679
neck and a good part of the feeling into your posture and adjusting it is

67
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:45,919
probably happening with a nonverbal

68
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:53,840
knowing or a very rudimentary verbal knowing very very

69
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:58,880
simple that's coming from a different place

70
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:10,000
inside then discursive thinking about stories and events and what should

71
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:21,160
happen and then in your posture let there be a few

72
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:26,280
deeper inhales and in a relaxed

73
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:31,400
way extended exhales

74
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,120
relaxing as you

75
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:13,080
exhale allowing for relaxation as you exhale and so there's a knowing

76
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:19,200
nonverbal knowing maybe a kind of

77
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:25,240
feeling of subtle places in your body that release

78
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:31,720
relax soften you don't have to think about

79
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:41,400
them it's enough just that they're known without any comments

80
00:20:53,280 --> 00:21:00,039
allowing your breathing to return to normal and on the exhale

81
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:05,440
continue to allow the body to

82
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:11,080
relax no commentary needed

83
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,159
and see if there can be a silent

84
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:25,559
awareness of your body of the tensions in your

85
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:30,919
body of the softening in your Ready

86
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:27,000
and then centering yourself on your breathing maybe if it's possible center

87
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,159
yourself on the grounding place the settling

88
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:41,240
place deep at the beginning of the inhale and at the end of the exhale

89
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,559
let there be a nonverbal

90
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:58,919
knowing silent awareness at the end of every

91
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:07,960
exhale of that settling place grounding place deep within

92
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:28,919
and as the inhale begins allowing the inhale

93
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:34,080
to arise spread through your

94
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:40,200
body where the sense of allowing

95
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:46,640
is silent no words images

96
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:55,760
needed receiving the sensations of breathing

97
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,360
in allowing the exhale

98
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:22,279
and allowing which is also silent it's almost like an

99
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:31,799
opening up the door window to allow the sensations of exhale

100
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,960
allowing the exhale to

101
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:55,520
unfold and maybe without discursive

102
00:24:55,559 --> 00:25:02,400
thinking there's no right and wrong with however way you're breathing

103
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:15,640
there's no project it's

104
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:22,880
simply a quiet silent knowing of

105
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:28,278
breath knowing of breathing

106
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:40,158
from some deep place inside that is

107
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:52,120
content to rest in a silent knowing silent awareness

108
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:04,070
[Music]

109
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,449
[Music]

110
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,710
[Music]

111
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,559
a silent

112
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:17,840
awareness that is a bit like being

113
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:25,120
surrounded by refreshing water pool of water

114
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:35,559
[Music] floating and thoughts are let go like

115
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:39,440
bubbles floating to the

116
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:50,360
surface resting in the

117
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:58,440
body in the bodies Silent awareness

118
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:54,720
if there is thinking maybe you can feel how the

119
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,720
thinking has tension in it or

120
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:07,120
pressure maybe you can understand that here and

121
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:13,399
now the thinking is not needed

122
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:22,360
there's a better alternative to trust the

123
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:28,360
meditation to trust the silent awareness

124
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:38,380
[Music]

125
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,760
maybe arising out of the body

126
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:53,719
[Music]

127
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:01,659
[Music]

128
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:04,000
and if there is anything that's pleasant

129
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:12,960
delightful about resting here and Now in the

130
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,440
body allowing

131
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:27,720
receiving whatever is happening into this

132
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,720
nonverbal

133
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:40,720
knowing this silent awareness that can include

134
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:45,960
everything no thinking needed

135
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:26,720
a silent awareness the nondiscursive nonverbal way of

136
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:33,920
knowing is a way to leave ourselves

137
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:43,079
alone to not be a project to not be something to judge

138
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:53,200
it's phenomenally generous and kind to hold ourselves in

139
00:36:54,839 --> 00:37:01,880
awareness without anything extra as if we're our best

140
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:07,599
friend who's silent silently accompanying

141
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:18,599
us not commenting or judging or trying to fix us just we know we're not alone

142
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:27,119
so to sit with this silent awareness of

143
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,640
ourselves as being our own

144
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
friend heat

145
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:34,839
and then learning how to be a friend for all

146
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:41,320
people the value of accompanying the

147
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:46,640
world without discursive thinking without

148
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:54,240
making anything into a project without

149
00:38:54,839 --> 00:39:00,880
judging a silent awareness that has an intimacy a

150
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:09,960
friendliness a care that allows so much to be

151
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:15,560
communicated more than words could ever do

152
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:29,680
to trust the love the kindness the

153
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:39,359
friendliness that can be there with silence silent

154
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:45,520
accompanyment with clear

155
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:52,720
companionship and as we end this

156
00:39:54,440 --> 00:40:02,480
sitting to let the silent awareness spread our goodwill out into

157
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:10,440
the world may all beings be

158
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:17,520
happy may all beings be safe

159
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:23,920
may all beings be

160
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:29,599
peaceful may all beings be

161
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:39,119
free and may others feel

162
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:47,160
recognize that we're showing up with a simple

163
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:55,280
friendliness care and kindness for them and for all

164
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:02,960
beings whether we agree with them or not may all

165
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:11,280
beings experience profound

166
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:23,079
well-being so thank you very much and again there's no bell i will

167
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:31,280
bow in appreciation thanks thank you

00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:54,839
so good morning and welcome to this next talk on

169
00:41:54,839 --> 00:42:01,839
samadei and Um and this week we're exploring the

170
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:10,359
third Janna that is um basically the second and third

171
00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:18,319
are recognized as a form of noble silence and um silence of course in our

172
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:24,880
society could there could be a dictionary of silence uh all the different meanings what's

173
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:32,359
conveyed in silence many of it which is not kind and uh sometimes is

174
00:42:32,359 --> 00:42:37,640
offputting but this is called a particular kind of silence called noble

175
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:46,720
silence um a sil a silent treasure a treasure

176
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:52,319
silence and um that where it feels cozy it feels

177
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:58,000
wonderful it feels like um nothing is needed and there's a remarkable thing

178
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,359
that happens when discursive thinking stops conversational thinking stops rumination

179
00:43:04,359 --> 00:43:11,400
stops not not just a few times often for many

180
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:18,960
people rumination obs obsessing about things with the mind storytelling telling

181
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:25,200
ourselves stories repeating the same idea over and over again commentating judging

182
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:30,920
uh having thoughts which are mean or thoughts which are scary or thoughts which

183
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:38,680
are filled with desires all these limit us all these narrow the

184
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:44,599
window narrow the wholeness they divide us they keep

185
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:50,800
us not really deeply in touch in a holistic way with ourselves from the

186
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:56,480
inside out there's in fact even though thinking can be quite pleasant at times

187
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:01,760
or quite compelling seemingly very important

188
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:11,040
uh involves a tremendous sacrifice tremendous loss and um oddly enough sometimes the

189
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:17,920
people who are most worried about the Buddhist teachings of renunciation letting go which these

190
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:23,200
janna have a lot to do but letting go in the meditation

191
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:28,319
The people who are most worried about it most troubled by it are the ones who are

192
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:33,680
most involved in their thinking mind discursive mind and there's good reason

193
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:40,480
for that because that's the mind that tells us uh stories about all the things we need and

194
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:49,720
should have or don't have and all the ways that um you know we've been offended or

195
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:56,440
hurt and of course thinking is valuable of course some of the things we think about are true

196
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:03,599
enough but it's unfortunate if it disconnects us from the wholeness of

197
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:08,960
who we are and some of the deeper capacities of knowing and intelligence

198
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:16,000
that we have that uh are waiting for us are there kind of below the level of

199
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,680
discursive thinking below the level of conversational thinking

200
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:30,000
and um and so going into this third Janna it can feel very silent in there

201
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:36,880
but it's not a silence that is being silenced being ignored it's not a

202
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:42,240
silence of being disconnected there's a feeling of like

203
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:48,480
almost a feeling of of uh to be alive is enough someone on this retreat that I'm

204
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:55,119
teaching ask me very very sincerely and a question of what's the

205
00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:01,359
meaning of life and sometimes if someone asks that questions it's not really

206
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:07,280
asking for an answer or it maybe too philosophical or something but there was

207
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:12,480
such a sincerity that this was really important for the person so I was

208
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:18,400
careful about how I responded so there was an example I was using a kind of

209
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:26,319
discursive thinking conversation to think about that but it arose from that silent place inside it wasn't arising

210
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:32,000
from fear or ambition it was more kind of the place where creativity or

211
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,040
intuition arises maybe so I thought about it for a while

212
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:42,079
and I lived with it for a while and the answer I came back with is that the

213
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:48,760
meaning of life is to discover the expression of

214
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:53,920
life what is it that's wants to be expressed what is it that's flowing and

215
00:46:53,920 --> 00:47:03,200
growing and knowing from deep inside that um you you can never know if

216
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:11,280
you ask answer the question what is the meaning of life with a philosophical answer uh with a answer that even is

217
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:16,359
logical or um somehow rational or

218
00:47:16,359 --> 00:47:24,119
somehow conceptual um it's like asking someone

219
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:32,240
um you know if they're involved in some wonderful playing of music or doing a

220
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:38,960
dance or or maybe just going with for the walk

221
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:45,599
with a friend in a delightful walk what's the meaning of friendship what's the meaning

222
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:52,839
of playing music what's the meaning of dance while you're doing

223
00:47:52,839 --> 00:47:57,920
it it's not needed in fact to assign

224
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:06,160
meaning to it during the activity takes you out of the activity and so to drop in and let the

225
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:12,640
expression of the music the music making of the dance of the friendship that the

226
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:19,040
expression of it that is the meaning of life so in the in these deeper genres it

227
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:26,280
can feel that way there's no need for meaning we're so fully alive so fully

228
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:31,760
here so fully quieted the discursive ruminating

229
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:37,760
mind that tells us otherwise it's part of the delight for

230
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:43,599
it so um so and and it's also very

231
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:49,480
satisfying to go through this uh process of feeling a lot of joy and happiness in

232
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:57,119
the first and second Janna and then having the joy quiet and then uh

233
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:03,920
inviting this very deeper happiness with this deeper embodied happiness again is

234
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:09,559
not a verbal it doesn't have a verbal source it doesn't have a source from

235
00:49:09,559 --> 00:49:16,000
ideas many people's emotions and sense of happiness and sadness is so dependent

236
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:22,720
on the thinking mind and whatever direction thoughts go that's the way we feel

237
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:28,000
and here there's a whole different source for happiness for joy that wells

238
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:33,359
up from deep inside and um that exists deep inside

239
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:41,000
that just feels satisfying feels like this is being alive and

240
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:49,519
uh so uh I want to read the metaphor or the simile for the third

241
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:59,839
Janna and uh it uses uh in this metaphor uh a pool of water that's cool water and

242
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:06,400
you have to appreciate that maybe imagine that it's one of the warmest days you've ever been in hottest days

243
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:11,839
you've ever been in because this was the these metaphors were uh created in India

244
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:19,599
in the hot climate of India it was um in the Buddha's enlightenment Buddha i

245
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:24,880
think I was there in June it was the hot season it was the hottest season boy

246
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:30,960
there's no one else there it was so hot and um and the Buddha didn't get enlightened in the peak of the hot

247
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:37,680
season but he was he was getting close to it when he was sitting under the bodhic tree there

248
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:44,400
and um and in the context of a very hot day it's just a delight to go into and

249
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:50,800
soothing and satisfying to go into a cool pool of water and so it's in that

250
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:59,200
context you'll see that coolness is used uh as part of the metaphor and lotus flowers are used and

251
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:06,800
lotus flowers can be quite beautiful and so it's a it's a metaphor for something that's quite beautiful in ourselves in

252
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:15,960
our experience so the third Janna is like a pool filled with blue

253
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:23,520
lotuses or red lotuses or white lotuses where some of the blue red and

254
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:31,680
white lotuses would be born in the water would grow in the water would be

255
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:39,880
nourished by the water without ever rising up above the water above the

256
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:46,839
surface the cool water would fill pervade saturate and permeate those

257
00:51:46,839 --> 00:51:55,760
lotuses from their tips to their roots so no part of the blue red or white lotuses

258
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:01,280
would not be touched with cool water

259
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:06,800
so the practitioner pervades and saturates and permeates

260
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:12,119
this body with happiness

261
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:19,880
freed of joy so that no part of the body is not

262
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:27,559
touched so a couple of things about this simile i just find it delightful this expression

263
00:52:27,559 --> 00:52:35,920
um the uh this body is permeated with happiness freed of joy have you ever

264
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:41,240
heard of such a thing um why would you want to free yourself from

265
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:47,800
joy and because there's a happiness which is better

266
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:57,240
uh sick pure happiness in a very deep embodied satisfying way uh lacks the the

267
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:03,960
excitement the thrill of uh of joy and of course that thrill and

268
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:10,160
excitement is quite wonderful at first um but if it goes on and on and on and

269
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:17,079
on it's exhausting it's tiring and so to be able to drop into this deeper state of

270
00:53:17,079 --> 00:53:23,280
happiness and the metaphor is one of being immersed in the water cool

271
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:30,599
refreshing water when I was young we lived by the

272
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:37,680
seashore and uh excuse me I lived by the seashore and I spent a

273
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:44,960
lot of time in the summer not only in the water but under the water uh I I had

274
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:51,119
a snorkels and mask and I would dive under the water maybe to about six feet

275
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:58,160
or so five six feet and flip myself over my back and try to stay down there as

276
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:04,680
long as I could uh and there were gentle waves coming in uh in the sea that I was

277
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:10,880
at and I'd be underneath looking up at the waves coming into the shore and it

278
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:15,920
was so delightful to be down there there was this wonderful silence there was

279
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:21,760
this wonderful being kind of enveloped uh hugged it was kind of like being all

280
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:27,680
cozy in a nest perhaps or cozy in a nice

281
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:33,240
uh comforterfilled bed or something and

282
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:40,559
um and uh the world was had disappeared down there um the world of expectations

283
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:45,599
the world of needs the world of comparing myself to others and wanting

284
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:51,920
things to be different the world was so still and quiet down there so satisfying

285
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:58,000
um and it felt I felt more alive on my back under the water looking up than I

286
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:04,119
did almost any other time no part of my body was not touched by this wonderful

287
00:55:04,119 --> 00:55:11,480
environment of the water so as we go into these deep absorption absorptive

288
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:18,960
states many people will actually use the simile of dipping underwater briefly or

289
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:24,559
a while uh when they're in these deep absorption and then if they come out it

290
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:31,200
feels like they're surfacing out of it and uh there was a time in my practice where I would go into these

291
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:36,240
deep states and that I needed to felt like I needed to just kind of make sure

292
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:41,520
everything was okay that I wasn't straining or things were that I knew the

293
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:48,160
time i knew my environment and I would surface out of the water and check out

294
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:54,680
what was going on make sure everything was good and then I would dip down back

295
00:55:54,680 --> 00:56:00,559
in and then in this state everything we experience all the

296
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:07,520
sensations whatever we it goes on feelings any feeling goes on uh is

297
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:15,200
seen as beautiful is seen as kind of wonderful like lotuses each thing is distinct each

298
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:21,520
thing is its own thing floating in this water so you might feel sensations of breathing and it's just delightful like

299
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:26,920
it's its own lotus floating in the water you might even feel

300
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:33,359
some happiness sensations of happiness different parts of the body

301
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:41,040
anything and uh and there's a silent knowing a silent awareness nonverbal

302
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:46,400
knowing of all this it's tremendous clarity and now you don't you're not

303
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:54,119
thinking about it but you know it you come out of it you might think about it some but not in this state

304
00:56:54,119 --> 00:57:00,319
so uh I hope that this metaphor and these words give you a feel a sense

305
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:06,480
maybe through your imagination of what it's like and um and if uh the idea of

306
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:12,960
being in a pool of water is not welcoming for you maybe there's some other way another metaphor that you have

307
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:22,040
that can be comparable um one of the first times I experienced this kind of thing was uh going into a

308
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:27,920
thousand-year-old chapel in France and um and just it was on top of

309
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:33,319
a m little hill and being in that chapel I was

310
00:57:33,319 --> 00:57:43,000
enveloped by a kind of goodness a kind of peace that was new to me

311
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:49,640
so the second Janna thank you

312
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:53,359
um I hope that

313
00:57:56,119 --> 00:58:02,200
um you somehow go through the day exploring

314
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:08,440
considering feeling into the ways in which you can have nonverbal

315
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:15,839
knowing the ways that awareness mindfulness can be silent and that you

316
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:25,160
find that very satisfying so thank you very much
