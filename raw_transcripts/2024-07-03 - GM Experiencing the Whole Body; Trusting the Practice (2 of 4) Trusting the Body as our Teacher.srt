00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:08,000
greetings everyone I'm happy to be here with you and thank you for your comments uh

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,080
in the chat today we'll um end the

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:25,439
meditation just with a bow rather than having the IMC audiovisual team ring a virtual

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,398
Bell so yesterday in our meditation I drew on the first two steps of the

5
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,079
anapanasati suta the Buddha's foundational discourse

6
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:44,680
on using the breathing to establish cultivate and

7
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:50,719
strengthen our ability to maintain embodied

8
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:57,640
awareness the task being to keep our focus on the whole process of

9
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,760
breathing being interested in and knowing in

10
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:12,680
detail the texture of our lived experience during each inhale and each

11
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,920
outaleb moment for many of

12
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:25,200
us this isn't easy because the mind has such a strong

13
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,280
tendency to revert to discursive thinking you usually in the form of

14
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,118
stories about me myself in

15
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:43,520
mind so be patient with yourself you may have heard the

16
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,320
expression that nature upor a [Music]

17
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:57,039
vacuum well so does the human mind when it's not advanced in meditation

18
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:06,960
practice so the invitation is to undertake this meditation without worrying about the

19
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:12,160
result we recognize that the monkey mind will want

20
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,800
to run off reating stories about the past and

21
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:26,560
future and when that happens we smile and say thank you no thank you

22
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,200
monkey mind because we know that we're here to

23
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:38,840
cultivate a peaceful mind but don't underestimate the Pres

24
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:46,879
the importance of that smile when you say no thank you to your

25
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,159
distractions we also need to be kind to

26
00:02:52,640 --> 00:03:02,200
ourselves and we just gently with care and kindness bring our awareness back to the

27
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:09,280
breathing yesterday in our meditation the focus was on the first two steps of

28
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,480
anapanasati in which the practice is to Simply know

29
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:21,319
intimately the quality of each in breath and each out

30
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:28,879
breath today we'll practice the third step in which the Buddha teaches us one

31
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:34,640
trains I will breathe in experiencing the whole

32
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:43,159
body one trains I will breathe out experiencing the whole

33
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:51,720
body so we move from knowing to the more active practice of

34
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:58,959
training we still May Tain a connection with a breath but the focus today is on

35
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:06,599
experiencing the body the whole body and all the while staying with a

36
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:09,959
breath in the

37
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:19,880
background so begin by gently closing the

38
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:30,080
eyes leaving all your concerns outside the door no need for them now

39
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,080
and enjoying the luxury of dropping down into your lived

40
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:51,800
experience in the present moment now take a moment to formulate

41
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,120
your deepest intention for yourself and all

42
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,840
beings what brings you to medit Med

43
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:31,919
itate assuming a posture that expresses the nobility of your ins

44
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:41,240
spiration taking a moment to visualize your body and saying thank you for

45
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:47,680
supporting me all these years send your body however imperfect

46
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,919
it may be a wave of gratitude for all the incredible

47
00:05:53,919 --> 00:06:00,840
functions it's been performing to keep you alive

48
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:09,280
giving a bit of a stretch to the spine it's

49
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:15,880
helpful to lengthen the back of the neck by moving the chin in slightly towards

50
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:21,520
the back so that the head is more

51
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:29,639
balanced and being supported more easily by the spinal column

52
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:39,360
so let's do a brief scan bringing care to every part of the

53
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,560
body starting with the crown of the head and moving

54
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:53,199
downward gently carefully bringing awareness imbued with

55
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:59,680
kindness to the scalp the face

56
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,639
the eyes the cheeks the

57
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:09,000
mouth and the

58
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:18,319
jaw softly down the net softening the

59
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,440
shoulders arms and

60
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:31,520
hands and moving Our Kind attention down the Torso

61
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,840
through the pelvis the upper

62
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:42,280
legs the lower legs and the

63
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:47,319
feet now take a moment to establish your mental

64
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:56,520
posture perhaps letting go of having to be someone and being patient with your

65
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:04,360
difficulties have having established

66
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:12,720
awareness in the body and mind take a long satisfying deep

67
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:19,440
breath carefully observing how the body experiences

68
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:28,280
breathing as it returns to its normal Rhythm and texture

69
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:36,279
our Focus today is to feel the

70
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,560
breath through the vehicle of the whole

71
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:50,959
body and the task is to become aware of how the body

72
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:57,600
experiences each in breath and each out breath

73
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:07,920
trusting the body to be your guide and to support you as you

74
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,360
meditate e

75
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:32,839
staying close to your body like a parent carefully keeping an eye on their

76
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:41,279
child experiencing the whole body as a way to love and care for

77
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:48,399
yourself as you sit feel the sensations of the body

78
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:57,720
breathing and let your mind be spacious and your heart be kind and

79
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,279
soft e

80
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:03,480
if the mind wander ask yourself if you can

81
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:10,360
trust that it's okay just to stay with the body

82
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,160
breathing e

83
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:32,279
let your eyes be soft and relaxed

84
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:41,720
enough to clearly see the changing nature of your present moment

85
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:49,199
experience feeling the whole body as it

86
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:56,480
breathes seeing the Dharma in the body

87
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040

00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:46,399
Care for ourselves for everyone here meditating

115
00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:51,240

117
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:08,200

joined I bow to each of you honoring the sincerity of your practice

122
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,799
what

123
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:58,278
greetings everyone it's good to be here with you

124
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:08,320
I'd like to share with you that um I really hate relying on notes for

125
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:16,399
speaking uh because it's not so spontaneous and a year ago I could add

126
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:22,279
live no problem but the truth is that I'm not

127
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:30,840
100% recovered from my illness and my memory is not great

128
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:40,919
so I'm just more comfortable um teaching with notes and so I ask your

129
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:49,440
forgiveness the theme for this week is trusting the

130
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:58,120
practice and the poly word for trusting is Sada which literally means supporting

131
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:06,679
the heart and in addition to trust Sada is

132
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:12,320
also translated as confidence

133
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:20,000
conviction Faith the ability to trust is the first

134
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,600
of the five faculties which everyone has to some

135
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:32,679
degree and sadada has the benefit of controlling

136
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:38,120
doubt and when it Masters the hindrance of

137
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:43,879
Doubt sadada becomes the first of the five

138
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:50,159
powers though the faculty of trust is well worth

139
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:59,320
cultivating and when it becomes strong it's a tremendous asset in our practice

140
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:06,360
yesterday we looked at trusting the breath and trusting our beautiful

141
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:13,080
mind and in our practice trust or faith means surrendering to things the way

142
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:18,880
they are in Buddhism this surrender is by no

143
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:26,440
means based on Blind Faith on the contrary it's based on

144
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:33,480
confidence born of conviction and in this practice we're

145
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:39,279
encouraged to experiment to try things out in order to

146
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:44,480
find out what works best for us

147
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,240
personally and in this way little by

148
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:56,000
little we become able to be our own

149
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:04,399
teacher and if we still with this gradual practice we'll know for ourselves when

150
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:10,240
it's beneficial and this in turn inspires us

151
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:18,960
to trust the practice one thing that inspires me

152
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:27,360
personally is to just take a little pause and remember that I'm doing my

153
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:33,559
best to walk in the footsteps of the

154
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:44,000
Buddha what a beautiful thing and doing our best is good

155
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,679
enough the Buddha put tremendous importance on cultivating

156
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:58,760
awareness and in particular embodied awareness

157
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,240
is at the heart of our

158
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:11,120
practice today I'm going to share with you a number of citations from many different sources

159
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:19,240
about trusting the body we know from the ancient texts that

160
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:26,440
when the Buddha died his close disciple Ananda who had memorized all of the

161
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:31,880
Buddhist teachings was asked where do we go for

162
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:37,159
teaching now that the Buddha is no longer with

163
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:45,559
us and Ananda replied mindfulness of the

164
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:51,519
body so it's quite extraordinary that the early texts

165
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:58,559
suggest that the best replacement for the Buddhist teaching

166
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:02,200
is being aware of our own

167
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:13,358
body and it's true that our bodies however imperfect do have their own

168
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,800
wisdom after the passing away of the Buddha Ananda also

169
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:30,480
said awareness of the body is a source of joy and can be truly considered One's

170
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:37,320
best [Music] friend and I love uh payma

00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:43,240
children's teaching that it's helpful to realize that this

172
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:52,040
very body right here right now with all its aches and its Pleasures is exactly

173
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:58,320
what we need to be fully human fully awake

174
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:05,520
Fully Alive and Gil seems to agree with

175
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:11,880
that when he says all the practice can be found in

176
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:18,599
this body over the months and years as you do

177
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:25,920
meditation you'll probably find that your body will become more and more

178
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,000
awake and more and more are the source of

179
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:37,440
intelligence understanding love and

180
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:42,920
compassion many of the best qualities of the human

181
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:47,040
being come through being

182
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:58,960
embodied thank you Gil we already have exactly what we need

183
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:07,640
and to paraphrase the Buddha within this very fathom long

184
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:14,880
body with its perceptions and inner senses lies the whole

185
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:20,680
world the cause of the world the sensation of the

186
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:29,560
world and the path that leads to the station of clinging to this world

187
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:39,599
in the same vein aun moon from the forest Tha Forest tradition exhorts

188
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:48,000
us never allow the mind to Desert the body in your investigation of the

189
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,839
world examine its nature see the elements that comprise

190
00:36:54,839 --> 00:37:02,119
it see the impermanence The Suffering The

191
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:09,520
selflessness of the body while sitting standing walking or

192
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:14,960
lying down when the body is true nature is

193
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:21,078
seen the wonders of the world will become

194
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:28,440
clear and the purity of the mind can shine forth

195
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,680
let that sink

196
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:54,000
in the last quote I'll share is from Jack cornfield who to my great

197
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,720
surprise first encouraged me to teach and then authorized me as a Dharma

198
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,760
teacher and fortunately I was able to then train

199
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,880
with Gil for another six years before he agreed with

200
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:17,599
Jack and authorized me as a Dharma teacher as

201
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:23,680
well so here's something that Jack cornfield shared on a long

202
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:33,720
retreat the human body at peace with itself is more precious than the rarest

203
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:40,800
gem cherish your body it's yours for this one time

204
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:49,560
only the human form is one with great difficulty it's easy to

205
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:59,280
lose all worldly things are brief like lightning in the sky

206
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:06,079
this life you must know as the tiny splash of a

207
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:14,760
raindrop a thing of beauty that disappears even as it comes into

208
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:21,800
being therefore set your aspiration and make use of every day and

209
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:26,520
night to achieve it

210
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:36,760
many teachers stress that our physical bodily experience is the key to practicing

211
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:44,520
mindfulness awareness and one of the reasons for this is because when the mind is paying

212
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:50,480
attention to the body we're by definition in the present

213
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:57,720
moment and not indulging in distractions from the past or the future

214
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:06,079
whenever you're experiencing your body you're in your lived

215
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:15,240
experience another reason that the body is such a great teacher is because since it's

216
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:24,200
created and conditioned by the mind it can function as a draw away to wisdom to

217
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:29,318
understanding what's going on deep inside us

218
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:39,200
mindfulness awareness is to be present with what is without

219
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:45,760
reacting our awareness needs to be broad not narrow and its main characteristic

220
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:52,160
is to be embodied so trusting the

221
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:59,240
practice as Gil says with B the body as our Monastery our refuge

222
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:06,680
for me the body served as a refuge throughout my whole life as a

223
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:13,079
kid and a trauma victim I loved being absorbed in swimming canoeing biking in

224
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:19,240
the woods as a teenager I became a modern dancer and really learned how to

225
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:24,760
pay close attention to my body and I was so surprised when I first

226
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:31,839
performed on stage that didn't have stage fright and this was simply because

227
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:38,640
I was completely in the body with no thoughts about myself and I think this is why when I

228
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:44,440
started practicing Zen at the age of 21 I felt so at

229
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:49,490
home and my faith in the practice quickly became

230
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:54,800
[Music] unshakable I can assure you that just

231
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,960
being totally in the body and in the present moment opens the

232
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:05,160
doors to penetrate the truth of the Buddhist

233
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:12,880
teachings and I'm convinced that the more you know and trust your body the more at home you'll

234
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:19,920
feel in your life the body also teaches us to

235
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,599
penetrate Inc constancy which reveals in turn the

236
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:31,480
truth of not self and this for me has had tremendous

237
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:37,720
healing powers while close with a poem on the

238
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:44,839
theme of trusting and constancy by the Polish American poet

239
00:42:44,839 --> 00:42:52,680
jesla milash he writes the word of faith means

240
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:58,359
when someone sees a de drop or a Floating Leaf

241
00:42:58,359 --> 00:43:03,720
and knows that they are because they have to

242
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:12,079
be never allow the m and even if you dreamed or closed your eyes and wished

243
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:19,040
the world would still be what it was and the leaf would still be carried

244
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,440
down the

245
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:31,440
river so also on the idea of trusting the body as perhaps our greatest

246
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:37,440
teacher yesterday the homework was to reflect on what it might be like to live

247
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:44,000
in Beauty to move in

248
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,440
Beauty and for me I feel like I'm living in Beauty when I step out of being in a

249
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:56,240
hurry and slow down a little and then when I bring full

250
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:03,240
awareness to how I'm moving through the day the active mind gives way to a mind

251
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:11,599
that's empty empty enough to be fully aware and that feels just

252
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:17,640
lovely we have such full busy lives so if you'd like a little homework

253
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:25,800
for the next 24 hours you might try slowing down just a little bit in your everyday

254
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:33,520
activities and bring awareness to how you're inhabiting your

255
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:42,119
body when you're reaching for something in the kitchen or opening a door or using the

256
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:47,800
toilet bring your full awareness to how the body is

257
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:51,000
experiencing what you

258
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:03,760
do thank you for your attention and thank you for your practice
