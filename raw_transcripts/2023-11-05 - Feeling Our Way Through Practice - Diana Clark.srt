you good morning it's nice to see you all and

14
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:37,680
it's nice to be here some of you may know me I'm Diana Clark I teach her on Monday nights and

15
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,640
uh here I am on a Sunday

16
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,320
morning and some of you may be listening to gills 7 a and you may know that I

17
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:55,880
substitute for him a couple of weeks ago when I talked a little bit about poetry

18
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:02,920
and practice and I like to like extend a little bit what I spoke about then and

19
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:09,679
if you didn't hear that it's perfectly fine too but what I'd like to talk about is

20
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:16,440
the way that uh practice meets our life and I know certainly for me at the

21
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:24,560
beginning there was a clear distinction between practice and life I would uh listen to Dharma talks

22
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,040
or read Dharma books and they really touched me and felt like some something

23
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:38,400
really powerful was there but then I would just go off into my life my regular life right whatever that

24
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,360
was but as the more I read Dharma books listened to Dharma

25
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,599
talks and meditated the more I started to see that

26
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:57,720
these two things kind of like practice and life started to come closer and closer together and the distinction

27
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,000
between them started to blur and things that I thought were you know

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,280
like these conceptual understandings that I had started to just show up in the way

29
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,519
that I was being in the world and I've told this story a number

30
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:22,799
of times but uh a really clear example for me is this idea of Behaving

31
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:31,000
ethically I thought of myself as an ethical person I wasn't going around stealing things or harming people

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,400
but I was doing an awful lot of Little White

33
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:45,560
Lies just to you know when I looked at it to make myself look better or not to hurt the feelings of other people

34
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:51,280
and and so when I started to like take seriously well what is this thing about

35
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,519
the Buddhist life talking about you know behaving ethically and this wish to not

36
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:04,159
harm others and I said okay I'm going to stop these little white

37
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:13,959
lies such as oh I'm sorry I'm late the traffic was really bad the traffic wasn't bad I just was

38
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:22,240
disorganized and then when I realized that I okay I'm going to have to say why I'm really

39
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,759
late I started to get more organized because I didn't want to have to lie and

40
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:33,919
there's all these small ways in which I just started to you know treat the people that I were meeting with respect

41
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:40,199
showing up on time and that just started to shift a little bit my life and how the way that

42
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:45,240
I was showing up so this small thing was kind of like

43
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,039
how my practice and life started to come together and you know how we now here we

44
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:58,560
are all these years later and I find myself in the seat as a Dharma teacher certainly not expecting that way back

45
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,960
when so I'd like to talk a little bit about this you know when practice meets

46
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:11,759
life and what does that mean how does it show

47
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,240
up and first of all I'd like to say that there's a way in which we can practice

48
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,639
there's different ways in which we might approach practice or understand

49
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,960
practice one way is that there's particular steps there's directions

50
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:36,280
there's things that we do 16 steps of anapanasati one two three and go through

51
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:42,919
the way or maybe there's like we have to balance the five faculties okay is energy concentration wait what was the

52
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:51,319
other one you know often we can't keep them in our minds or this real clear set of there's lists and there's a ways to

53
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:59,960
practice and we have a certain direction and a certain approach in which we practice and certainly this Works in

54
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,160
other areas of our lives in our professional life in our educational

55
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:13,840
life and it it works in our practice life too until it doesn't right so that's

56
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:20,919
certainly one way to practice beneficial supportive appropriate but I also want to mention

57
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:26,800
that there's another way to practice and this is with the same

58
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:33,960
directionality with the same sense of more freedom freom and more ease but instead

59
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:40,680
being I don't being supported by lists and directions it's more supported by a

60
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:46,360
sense of feeling

61
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:53,680
experience this way leads to more freedom and when I behave or experience

62
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,639
things this way it leads to less Freedom more Dua this way feels more spacial

63
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:06,360
ious easeful open expansive this other way

64
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:14,960
feels a little more forced and pushing so feeling our way with

65
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,360
practice not so much a conceptual understanding but more just

66
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:29,759
experiencing then I want to say that the Buddha before his uh Awakening right before he had this insight into the Four

67
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:37,720
Noble Truth that characterized his Awakening this understanding about Dua he describes what it was like right

68
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:44,120
before he had this lifechanging insight and he describes that his mind

69
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:51,639
was malleable and wieldy so there's this sense that

70
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:57,120
there's not just one way but the sense of

71
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,400
flexibility to what's appropriate what's happening so there's a way that which we

72
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:09,319
can practice in which it is about the directions and these numbered lists and these conceptual

73
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:15,520
understandings and a way in which we're feeling experiencing our way towards

74
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,639
greater peace ease and freedom and part of practice is to be

75
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:28,240
able to do both and chances are all of us have preferences for one way or the

76
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,399
other but can we practice in a way in such that we stretch our Bend we stretch

77
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:42,120
what's comfortable for us so that we can do both so that we can find our way to the

78
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,200
greatest ease and freedom using whichever approach is appropriate at

79
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,959
that time so these two different ways kind of

80
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:58,680
one I'm calling maybe feeling or experiencing versus more of a conceptual

81
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:04,320
understanding we might say has some similarity in which

82
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:11,279
poetry is more about feeling experiencing versus Pros Or List just

83
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:18,440
more maybe conceptual understanding to be sure we need both but I like something that e

84
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:24,519
said many of you all know he's a famous American poet in the 20th

85
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:30,120
century and he said or wrote

86
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:36,160
a poet is somebody who feels and who expresses their feelings

87
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,160
through words this may sound easy it isn't a lot

88
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:48,839
of people think or believe or know they feel but that's thinking or believing or

89
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:56,040
knowing not feeling and poetry is

90
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,240
feeling so in this way i' like to talk of a little bit about poetry and

91
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,440
practice and how practice meets our life you think kind of poems or a

92
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:15,839
poem to help maybe point the way in which we might feel this

93
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:24,480
way so the poem I'd like to talk about is the one that I dropped in during our guided meditation is called

94
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,680
Tree by Jane hersfield Jane hershfield is an American poet she

95
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:37,959
lives here in Marin County she is a Zen practitioner she lived at tsah hor in

96
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:44,519
fact I think she uh overlapped with Gil down in tahar at the same time and she practiced at San Francisco Zen Center

97
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:50,959
and green gge farm so I kind of like to think that she's uh one of our Brethren one of part of our

98
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:57,399
community she's a also a translator she translates or helps she she with another

99
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:04,079
person translates po poems from Japanese poems from about a thousand years ago of

100
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:12,440
some women poets some of their Awakening poems she has a books of her poems but

101
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:18,800
she also has books about poetry so here's Jane Hirshfield's poem

102
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,639
called tree it is

103
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:30,959
foolish to let a young Redwood grow next to a house

104
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:39,440
even in this one lifetime you will have to choose that great calm

105
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:45,839
being this clutter of soup pots and

106
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:52,040
books already the first Branch chips brush at the

107
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:57,320
window softly calmly

108
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,320
immensity TAPS at your your

109
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,279
life those of you couldn't hear I tried to tap here and this if it wasn't that loud

110
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:14,360
but what does this mean this idea of a

111
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:20,519
tree we know like for the Buddha he sat underneath a bodh tree and a Bodhi Tree

112
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:27,120
has a lot of significance in Buddhism the kind of like the icon for inside Meditation Center this place is a little

113
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,680
B Leaf from a b tree for Jane herfield here in the Bay

114
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,760
Area and Marin County here is a redwood tree we have a redwood trees you know

115
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:45,680
just right out here and something that I I love about redwood trees maybe all of you do too

116
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:51,839
there's something Majestic about them there's something they also like Cathedral like

117
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:58,040
when you're in a Grove of redwood trees the RO redwood trees are so

118
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:03,279
powerful too some of you may know that just a I don't

119
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:08,320
know how many years ago maybe 5 years ago the redwood tree out here in front

120
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:15,880
was causing the sidewalk to buckle The Roots were getting in the way and it was a tripping Hazard and we thought okay we

121
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:23,800
we have to take care of this we don't want people to trip on the sidewalk so we uh partnered with the

122
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:31,360
city to come in and redo the sidewalk sidewalk I think everybody was as small

123
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,720
I should say I was very surprised the city was quite

124
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:44,800
wise they didn't build a sidewalk over the tree roots they built around it they

125
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:51,240
recognize the power of these trees to like disrupt Whatever Gets in their ways they weren't going to set up a battle

126
00:13:51,240 --> 00:14:00,759
with this tree they just went around so if you go out there right now you'll notice at the sidewalk around this tree

127
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:07,560
so there's this way in which you know a tree can represent practice in which

128
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:13,199
that it grows and certainly we have in the teachings this idea of something that

129
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:20,519
gets cultivated and developed in the same way that trees get cultivated and developed and

130
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:29,360
grow and then this idea of that to let a young rud would grow next to a house for

131
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:35,440
a house where you see in the Buddhist teachings the Buddha after his Awakening

132
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:43,040
I spoke a little bit about before his Awakening his mind being wieldy and after his Awakening the tradition holds

133
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,279
that he said this short verse kind of describing the experience

134
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:53,279
of Awakening this is captured in the

135
00:14:53,759 --> 00:15:00,519
dapada houseb Builder you are seen you will not build a house house again all

136
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:06,399
the rafters are broken the ridgepole dismantled this mind gone to the

137
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:13,440
unconstructed has reached the end of craving so the Buddha is kind of like uh

138
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,639
equating this Awakening with the end of the houseb Builder that house is a way

139
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:26,199
can represent the sense of self this thing that we create and that we believe that we're

140
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:31,680
inhabiting in something that we that protects us and we can hide behind and

141
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,680
but all the while maybe not recognizing that it is

142
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,480
constructed and that it doesn't have to be there but we are so accustomed to it

143
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:48,959
of course we have houses and we want to have houses but there's a way in which a house can also be this way in which we

144
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:55,079
set up our identities the things that define who we are which in the same way

145
00:15:55,079 --> 00:16:00,600
limit Who We Are

146
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,880
it is foolish to let a young Redwood grow next to a

147
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:13,000
house this idea of foolish I like in pully the language of

148
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:20,000
the Buddhist scriptures of the early Buddhism they use the same word in poly

149
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,639
means foolish and child so it's just the same way that

150
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:31,519
somebody doesn't know yet they just have learned yet somebody a fool who just

151
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:37,399
hasn't you know gained some particular knowledge or some particular

152
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:44,399
wisdom it is foolish to let a young Redwood grow next to a

153
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,560
house even in this one lifetime you all have to

154
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:57,480
choose that great calm being this clutter of soup pots and

155
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,880
books so practice disrupts the way that we

156
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:11,798
consider ourselves even in this one time we will have to choose this recognition that if

157
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:18,240
we want to continue to practice we can't have our life be exactly the way that it was including this house this way that

158
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,640
we consider ourselves so often we want to be exactly the same not change things but just want

159
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:31,840
less suffering of course we do but not recognizing that having less

160
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:37,600
suffering means that some things have to shift and change about ourselves the way that we think about ourselves the way we

161
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:44,440
think about the world think about others way that we feel about ourselves feel about others that's where the real

162
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:51,200
Freedom comes and part of practice is to help us

163
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,400
to gain the confidence that we can make these

164
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,480
changes part of practicing is to help us to

165
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,760
feel more clearly what is the direction for more

166
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:12,440
spaciousness and ease and freedom what is the direction for leads

167
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:18,360
to more Dua more suffering there's so many ways that

168
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:24,720
certainly for me when I first started practice I had no idea all the settle ways in which I was holding on to these

169
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:32,600
ideas of myself I was still working in Corporate America I had a great job and I didn't

170
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:37,880
realize how I was identified with that job and how every little slight thing

171
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:44,840
that didn't go well really kind of like really rocked me but practice is a way that it kind of

172
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:51,320
like grows and we start to see see more clearly maybe gain more wisdom and feel

173
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:56,720
more clearly and not only that have the confidence to maybe let go of some of

174
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:05,520
the ways that we think about ourselves or we think about the world or the way we set up of Me versus you US versus

175
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:11,000
them and we start to see how that is such a great source of

176
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:18,840
suffering for us for everybody but you have to choose that

177
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:26,440
great calm being this tree say trees have especially redwood

178
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:34,559
trees in my view have a certain Mobility steadiness calmness

179
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:40,840
stability maybe this is something that you've touched into with your meditation practice recognize oh yeah there this

180
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:48,400
calmness is possible it's available I'm not saying it's always easy and we always have access to it but

181
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:54,320
to even recognize that that is possible for our

182
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:00,240
lives and possible to be more and more in our life

183
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:10,760
this clutter of soup pots and books I love this line in my mind it's a

184
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:19,400
little bit autobiographical in my mind Jane herfield has a kitchen full of all kinds of pots and and books being a poet

185
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:24,840
it's not surprising maybe she has a lot of books I have a lot of books I can't help

186
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:31,280
myself and so practice isn't asking us to let go of all of our soup pots and

187
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,919
books whatever the equivalent of that might be for you practice isn't saying that you can't

188
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:42,840
have any of those things instead I think what the keyw

189
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:48,559
here is clutter things that aren't tended

190
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:55,360
to things that are like getting in the way of something else that we want to do maybe getting in the way of some of this

191
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,120
calmness or stability that we know is possible

192
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:07,320
so it's not so much that we have to get rid of all these objects in our life that fill up our

193
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:15,360
house instead it's about a shift in our relationship to them maybe we're not

194
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:21,080
clinging or maybe we're not dishonoring them and just letting them fill up our

195
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:28,400
life instead of taking care of them so the Clutter maybe it's literally

196
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,720
maybe it's figuratively but this kind of like

197
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:40,679
choosing recognizing seeing feeling yeah there's this uh something deep inside

198
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:47,360
maybe it's not even deep inside maybe it's just found when we go for a

199
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:56,640
walk versus some of the agitation that we feel in so many areas of our life

200
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:05,360
possibly we might ask ourselves what is our life filled with that's the opposite of

201
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:11,840
calm can we choose what would it mean to choose choose the

202
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,240
calm not the

203
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:29,400
clitter and so there's also this way in which practice asks us to

204
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:36,200
soften let go of all the ways in which we build these

205
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:44,120
selves ways in which we limit ourselves and instead to feel the freedom that is

206
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:49,919
available maybe we've all had just a glimpse of what's available chances are you have otherwise you wouldn't like be

207
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:58,039
coming to a place like this so here's another poem that's a

208
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:06,679
very short this one's translated by Jane herfield the same poet who wrote the other poem she translated this with Maro

209
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:15,440
aratani and this poem was written in Japanese by isumi shiku around the year

210
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:23,919
1000 I love this poem it's very uses metaphor and it's very evocative I think

211
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:32,080
and the poem goes like this although the wind blows terribly

212
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:40,559
here the Moonlight also leaks between the roof planks of this ruined

213
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:48,400
house although the wind blows terribly here the

214
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:54,919
Moonlight also leaks between the roof planks of this ruined

215
00:23:54,919 --> 00:24:00,520
house this ruined house maybe this way of we're letting our sense of self or

216
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:08,600
this identity these things that we hide behind maybe we're letting some uh ruined planks the roof isn't quite

217
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:14,960
as tight as it used to be and Moonlight is shining

218
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:22,159
in some of you know like in Buddhism often the full moon is a symbol of Awakening

219
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:28,360
Enlightenment but no matter about that if there's something at least I feel this when I go outside

220
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:33,640
oh it's a full moon I've done that a number of times here when I taught on a Monday nights

221
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:39,200
and uh to walk outside after teaching and to see this big moon it just feels

222
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:47,240
like oh something's special and so the way that this when

223
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:53,360
this house kind of starts to crack and the roof still has leaks in it maybe

224
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:59,760
it's windy which means we feel things

225
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:06,559
but their Moonlight is shining through there's this way in which there's this

226
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:14,039
um sense of freedom and Beauty possibility that the full moon can

227
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:21,600
represent although the wind blows terribly here the Moonlight also leaks

228
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:28,559
between the roof planks of this ruined house by isumi

229
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:35,159
iabo another woman poet so then returning back to this poem

230
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:43,120
Tree by Jane hersfield it continues and it says already the first Branch tips brush

231
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:49,840
at the window by the time I read with tree the

232
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:56,399
branch tips are brushing on the window the roots are already underneath right they're in the sewage system they're

233
00:25:56,399 --> 00:26:04,000
under the house they're making their sidewalk buckle you know hear at IMC we have to call RoR rder on a regular basis

234
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,760
because that red with tree out there is like getting into our

235
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:15,120
pipes so maybe before by the time we already notice that something's here

236
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,880
it's already touched us it's already a part of our life in

237
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:28,360
some way but maybe it's under we haven't quite seen it the way that Roots we don't see it maybe until they are

238
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,320
disruptive or something like

239
00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:40,200
this also this idea of Branch the branch tips uh meeting the

240
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:48,120
house so much about practices about meeting meeting

241
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:55,559
ourselves maybe in a way that we haven't before and let's be honest it's not

242
00:26:55,559 --> 00:27:02,120
always good news I know for me it wasn't always always good news noticing all these wh lies I was doing and all these

243
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:08,120
ways in which I was holding and Clinging On to these ideas about myself and I wanted people to make sure that they saw

244
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:14,679
me in one particular way and certainly not this other particular way which I was trying to secretly

245
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:21,399
hide but I also like this expression that Jack cornfield uses kind of like

246
00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:26,919
meeting ourselves he uses this expression The Unfinished Business of

247
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:33,760
the heart there's a way in which meeting ourselves is a way of recognizing this unfinished

248
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:40,000
business of the heart and maybe it allows this business of the heart to get

249
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,799
finished to be metabolized and worked through and met and

250
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:53,760
seen so often we're trying to discard or disown or somehow excise the these

251
00:27:53,760 --> 00:28:00,000
portions of ourselves because they're painful or they're ugly or whatever it might be we

252
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:07,000
think that it might be but so much about practice is meeting

253
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,200
all of these aspects of ourselves when we're

254
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:17,360
ready when we're ready we don't have to jump into the

255
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:25,840
most difficult parts of our lives at the outset instead we allow practice to

256
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,880
grow we water it we let it have sunshine

257
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:37,120
good soil and then practice grows as it grows we don't have to make it

258
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:43,720
grow maybe it's just a way in which we come back we come to MC on Sunday mornings or whatever it might be listen

259
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:51,000
to YouTube and

260
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,760
then there's this way in which this poem ends for me it's kind of like powerful I

261
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:02,919
love this line softly calmly

262
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:07,158
immensity TAPS at your

263
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,960
life this invitation for all of us to maybe like

264
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:23,000
step into the what's possible for us our biggest life our best

265
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:28,720
life and it's softly calmly

266
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:35,158
it's not with a sledge Hammer sometimes it feels that

267
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:41,279
way but maybe you know there's a maybe a certain

268
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:48,519
insistence of an invitation asking us to be the best

269
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:58,679
versions of ourselves the bringing our best wisdom bringing our best compassion to whatever life brings us

270
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:05,880
after all what else can we do we can't control the whole world I know we try certainly I

271
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:12,960
try it doesn't work we know that and instead there can be this

272
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,519
invitation to bring our best

273
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:25,480
selves and I love this word immensity like maybe it's bigger than what we can

274
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:31,320
imagine maybe it's bigger than what we suspect is

275
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:36,158
available or what it would be like to have more

276
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,720
freedom and in this way in this poem and I would say in practice this freedom is

277
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:50,200
in is tied up with this house that we're building and constructing and you know

278
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:56,240
renovating maybe but still you know having constructed it's a way in which

279
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:02,519
it can be a in inhibition to Freedom so freedom is a way of maybe we let some of

280
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:07,679
this building just naturally deteriorate we wouldn't want to do this

281
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:13,639
in our actual houses but in these sense of selves is there a way that we can let

282
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:19,519
some of these Moon beams of Freedom shine

283
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:24,760
in and allowing ourselves to be touched by

284
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:31,519
it softly calmly

285
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:36,120
immensity TAPS at your

286
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,000
life thank

287
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,480
you and so maybe as an ending here can

288
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:54,480
just turn to some people near you and let's all take care of each other let's not let anybody be left behind with

289
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:01,519
nobody's talking to them we don't want that and just say what did you think of this poem maybe it's like poetry is just

290
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:08,519
not your cup of tea perfectly fine or maybe you're like I don't know I don't get it that's perfectly fine too or you

291
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:14,960
might feel like I don't know I'm kind of curious I'm going to go outside look at this tree now or whatever it might be

292
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:20,960
whatever it might be just turn to somebody and maybe say a little bit about how this poem touched you thank

293
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,960
you
