meditation and I change the settings so that accidental unmuting won't be

possible we'll keep all the channels quiet especially the chat for this duration please don't send personal

so um or or today's uh practice I wanted to see

32
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:24,600
something into seed this couple of things actually one is this sense of um

33
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,900
this invitation for um but considering that Our intention

34
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:37,500
really everything that we Lead With Our intention with everything in in our

35
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,720
lives in the world with Our intention and and

36
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:49,440
um and intending inviting ourselves for this

37
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,860
cultivation um is is really the very first step so I

38
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:01,020
want to share a poem that's

39
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:07,740
um that's written by someone a a practitioner who um

40
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:14,340
um I'd love to share with you it's inspiring it's beautiful the poem is called a prayer for awakening so the

41
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:19,919
sense of intention this this prayer for awakening so so here we go and I'll

42
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:25,500
share it when we're practicing but just to drop it in May my mind be expansive enough

43
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:31,740
to hold whatever comes to visit may my heart be brave enough to face all

44
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:38,220
that is before me may my eyes be sharp enough to see whatever is there

45
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:45,360
may my ears be Keen enough to hear all that is said and may my arms may my arms

46
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,880
be long enough to embrace all that needs comforting hmm

47
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:58,740
this invocation this invocation of may I may I cultivate may I cultivate my

48
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:04,680
heart myself in these beautiful ways so I might you to consider may I you know

49
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,560
what invocation do you have the invocation you have for um

50
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,680
your heart your life as a practitioner and

51
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,319
um another thing I wanted to see is um besides this idea of in touch

52
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:29,280
actually connecting it with intention is that tomorrow in the west especially in

53
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:36,900
the US it's considered the same to Valentine's Day and and that actually can bring some

54
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:42,500
sadness for many people oh I don't have a valentine a

55
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:48,380
partner and um there's so many beautiful ways to

56
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:56,340
construe to perceive this idea of of love so let's celebrate

57
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:03,960
Saint Valentine's Day tonight being the eve of it tomorrow the day of it as a way as a way to celebrate self-love as a

58
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:10,199
day to celebrate this beloved that is ourselves this this being that we

59
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:15,720
usually forsake for another we just forget like there's this wonderful being

60
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:21,240
that that needs and appreciates love the first and foremost and also to celebrate

61
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:28,319
it as a day for Universal love doesn't have to just be this one person

62
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:36,000

64
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:51,180
good well meta as good will a sense of interconnection we have with

65
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:56,580
every human being instead of just thinking this in this

66
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:02,880
limited way of just one in a particular way Etc so really expanding expanding

67

74
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,019
from a fellow practitioner

75
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:06,740

77
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:20,160
expensive enough to hold whatever comes who is it

78
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,819
foreign

79
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:40,040
resting ah breathing with that yes

80
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:48,180
may my eyes my inner eyes be sharp enough open enough internally to see

81
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:53,779
whatever is there whatever is arises

82
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,459
whatever is here

83
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,379

84
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:23,360
may my Years be Keen enough to hear all that is said all that is communicated

85
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:32,720
internally externally deep listening deep listening to myself

86
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:38,000
to the universe to others

87
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:45,600
and may my arms thy proverbial arms be long enough to

88
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,600
embrace all that needs comforting

89
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:58,200
which might start with my own heart myself I

90
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:03,740
may need comforting in this moment this body This Heart

91
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,839
as well as others

92
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,579
nothing connecting with the body with Our intention

93
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:29,540
for the breath

94
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,680
may my heart be Limitless

95
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,640

connecting with the breath with the body with intentions with good will

100
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:37,500
your thoughts are arising entangled if you find yourself entangled in Fall

101
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,579
it's okay

102
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,019
and we gently let them go and reconnect with Our intention our

103
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:54,540

104
00:13:54,540 --> 00:14:00,060

110
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,640

121
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:18,480

122
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:25,700
just for a moment risking it for just a moment

123
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:40,820

as a valentine as this seeing their goodness seeing their

130
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:36,360
Humanity it is said that the Dalai Lama

131
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:42,000
whenever he meets someone that person feels like they're the most important

132
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,900
person in the world

133
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:52,860

thanks for your practice everyone [Music] foreign

163
00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:48,600
like to invite us consider your intentions why are we here

164
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:54,600
why are we here why are we practicing why are we here why are we here tonight

165
00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:02,340
why are we practicing why are we showing up why is that

166
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:11,039
I'm feeling to that why and what can be the beautiful expression

167
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:17,880
the beautiful way of saying that as I shared with the poem prayer for awakening what is your prayer

168
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:25,260
for awakening what is your prayer for awakening may I may I meet the moment of kindness

169
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:32,520
may I be awake may I be kinder to myself and others may I whatever it is what is

170
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:41,640
your prayer for awakening so it's powerful to know to see our Our

171
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:49,919
intention our prayer for awakening it actually makes gives it more

172
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:56,100
more prominence when it's seen and it's even more prominent prominent

173
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:03,360
and not only when it's seen by us but it's when it's seen by others when it's held Witness by friendly eyes recognize

174
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,820
shared by friendly eyes and we're going to do that for ourselves now

175
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:14,340
in the small group so the invitation is we wanted to share something about your

176
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:21,779
intention let it be honored let yourself honor your intention let yourself be held witness be accountable

177
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:27,299
may I wake up in this very life may I be kind I know there are a lot of

178
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:32,940
challenges and maybe I lose my temper in these ways may I may I have more ease in

179
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:40,799
the midst of that or whatever it might be there's no right or wrong it's just beautiful to to see our intentions and

180
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:46,580
if you like to speak to it as much as you like or as little as you like

181
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:52,700
honoring each other and also if you want to show up with silence that's fine so

182
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:58,200
in small groups one person the first first person will share

183
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:06,059
something about their intention uh just a short maybe 30 seconds

184
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:11,280
um or at most amended and then the next person and then the next person will come back to you so we'll go around and

185
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,378
around make sure everybody has time to share only speak from your experience

186
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:21,658
not guiding not directing asking questions from others just show up as

187
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:27,599
you are and if you want to say pass or hold space silent space that's perfectly

188
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:33,800
fine um but such a beautiful opportunity for

189
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:40,980
perceiving support giving support recognizing acknowledging just very

190
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:47,580
um take advantage take advantage of this so so I'm going to create the breakout

191
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:52,618
rooms and take care of yourselves with kindness take care of each other with

192
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:58,338
kindness Okay so here we go

193
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:48,960

200
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:33,060
rose especially if you haven't spoken in this group ever or for a while you're

welcome to uh share your Reflections to step forward

202
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:43,280
I'll take one or two reflections

203
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:52,980
Ellie please hi thanks Nikki for doing this and

204
00:44:52,980 --> 00:45:00,000
creating this space for us so uh it's it's interesting because uh with

205
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,720
the inner critic and all that that I love to participate oh that I have

206
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:12,720
organically you know I do mindfulness and then the loving kindness arises out of that I don't repeat the pattern I

207
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:18,119
mean the sayings that much but then added a blue for some reason I started

208
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:23,520
uh kissing my own hand like this I have no idea where it came from or

209
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:29,160
what it came through but I I I like it but when I remember you

210
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:34,500
know to be kind to myself I I don't know where that gesture came from I don't know maybe I cooked for myself so much

211
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:41,280
that's why oh I started kiss you know kissing my own like this but that's a nice gesture I've never had it

212
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,980
before and then the other uh inside they came that I just immediately

213
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:53,760
went to find out where that came from and all that that's not really important at this point I mean I'm just enjoying

214
00:45:53,760 --> 00:46:00,359
it well I remember to do it that's sweet that is so sweet thank you for sharing

216
00:46:05,819 --> 00:46:13,200

217
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:19,079
and and oh this is oh I just tried it it's so lovely just so sweetheart thank

224

amazing practice I am so excited for Saint meta day oh that's great I love that thank you for that Jesse yeah maybe

225
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:13,440
we'll make space for one last reflection if anybody wants to share or ask a question

226
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:21,240
are we close and for those who haven't been to happier for a while I'm experimenting

227
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:28,380
with a you know 50 minute five zero minute format instead of one hour just to see what it feels like in so far it

228
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:34,920
felt a little lighter and felt when so the other quick Reflections questions

229
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:41,700
what was it like for you to have your your intention witnessed

230
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:45,500
or shared by others

231
00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:57,740
was it empowering supportive scary

232
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:05,299
I know you have thoughts red please

233
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:14,720
thank you Nikki yeah I find it um powerful and important actually

234
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:19,740
say I I want to live with a more open heart

235
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:26,760
to to have an aspiration that's really unrelated to any that I might have had

236
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:34,619
as a younger person that has nothing to do with um you know acquiring or you know building

237
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:41,940
a career or anything like that and and that there's a kind of seriousness about the intention

238
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:47,160
that um is increased by by stating it and by

239
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:52,800
you know stating it in public that yes this is actually what I want to do with my life now

240
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:58,200
um there's sort of a boldness about that and and I like that

241
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:03,900
thank you yeah yeah beautiful thank you Fred there is a

242
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:10,859
boldness about that yeah yes may may we all be bold I see a

243
00:49:10,859 --> 00:49:16,380
couple more hands and so let's just honor those and and then close but I'll

244
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:22,920
ask um see clear and even before that I think people are in chat are telling me that Jeannie is waving her physical hand but

245
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:28,619
Genie I don't see everyone so can you possibly oh here I see you there okay

246
00:49:28,619 --> 00:49:36,060
you can unmute there you go yes I don't know how to do this hand

247
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:44,700
raising I've got this little iPad so um well I was just my experience was that

248
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:51,780
um my partner was a very gracious listened to me it was really nice to share my kind of a new understanding of

249
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:56,880
thought I had and then I was going listen wanting to listen to him and um

250
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:03,180
but we ran out of time and so I did you know I so I'm not

251
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:08,520
used to the time thing I haven't regulated it well to so that you know we

252
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:14,460
kind of know internally how much time we have and how to you know when to

253
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:20,400
change off or switch yeah yeah I hear that I hear you appreciate that they

254
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:26,700
listen to you with care and and there's a regret I still wanted to listen and like oh I wish I had regulated my time

255
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:33,599
or I still haven't got that done I think what helps Genie for you and also for everyone else

256
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:40,500
um is what we're doing here in in the group is is to um to

257
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:45,599
um turn to um before we used to do monologues like

258
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:52,800
one person would talk for a while but now we've changed that so so it's more a spiral so each person as I mentioned

259
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:59,280
shares just 30 seconds or at most a minute just a tiny little nugget yeah

260
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:05,339
yeah and then the next person person shares and then the next person so that everybody has time

261
00:51:05,339 --> 00:51:11,819
but I I do appreciate your your wish to have honored them so I'm glad that you

262
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:16,640
said that so I could uh bring that out

263
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:22,559
sure okay you get the last word Claire and welcome Stuart for the first time

264
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:28,040
here live rather than a recording yay how wonderful welcome this is great

265
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:33,800
yay live is good all right Claire

266
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:39,480
uh just to follow up on your discussion of the way that groups work we were a

267
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:46,020
three-person group and in fact we did sort of stick to the 32nd principle but

268
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:52,440
what was really nice was that each person seemed to build on the person preceding them it really was sort of an

269
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:58,740
upward spiral it was really very lovely beautiful we all felt that we were

270
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:04,440
giving each other something to each other yeah great you couldn't have said it

271
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:10,079
better the the idea of this the beauty of the Spiral is is the uplift that

272
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:16,579
happens especially when you talk about your intentions so beautiful like it just it's it's a virtuous

273
00:52:16,579 --> 00:52:23,579
cycle it just keeps going around and we give each other gifts so that's exactly the idea thank you Claire for sharing

274
00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:30,420
how beautifully that that worked lovely so so thank you all thank you all for

275
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:36,540
your practice and thank you Jerry happy Metta all year round exactly all year
