1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:07,440
so welcome to this meditation session

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,400
and to

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,920
evoke a theme for this meditation

4
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:28,400
some of you may have seen that it's not it's fairly common for statues of the buddha

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,559
for the buddha to have a small smile on his face

6
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,600
it's not dramatic just a little upturn of the lips

7
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,559
and while he's sitting in a posture that represents both alertness

8
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,320
and tranquility and i think of this smile the buddha

9
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,239
to be a tranquil smile represented tranquil joy

10
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,079
or a joyful tranquility

11
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:11,439
and so to sit with tranquility to sit calmly is often associated with

12
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:17,600
meditation and one of the ways of

13
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,360
supporting tranquility and meditation is to recognize the tranquility that's

14
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:30,000
here the buddha said that the nourishment for tranquility

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,759
is tranquility that might seem

16
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,799
making it impossible if you don't feel any tranquility at all how can you

17
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,280
benefit from tranquility which is absent

18
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,680
but i suspect that

19
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:57,280
if you take your meditation posture that you will

20
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,880
if you search around find something within you that feels like it's

21
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,560
calm or tranquil or it could just be a hint

22
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:17,520
and that can be the basis for the growth of more tranquility

23
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,879
so assuming a meditation posture

24
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,400
one that maybe will support the body

25
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,360
to be tranquil calm

26
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:44,280
certainly not with the agitation of running around

27
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,120
and to

28
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,720
gently close your eyes

29
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,280
and to feel as you sit here is there within you

30
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,040
any physical tranquility anything that qualifies as physical

31
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:36,239
calmness maybe already a bit of relaxation

32
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,640
where in your body do you feel that calmness or tranquility the most

33
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,560
even if much of you is agitated

34
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,720
where is at least agitated

35
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,200
take a few moments to breathe with the place of calmness of

36
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,640
tranquility breathe through it breathe with it

37
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,799
just so you can feel the calmness more fully

38
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,960
and is there some simple way to allow that calmness to expand outwards

39
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,319
into more of your body

40
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,800
maybe there's relaxing around the calmness

41
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,199
maybe even a small adjustment in your posture

42
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,479
allows the calmness to spread a bit

43
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:20,160
and is there some way that whatever calmness or tranquility you have however small

44
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:31,280
that it could also be found or expressed in your breathing

45
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,479
is there any any part of your cycle of breathing

46
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:47,919
that has some quality of relaxation relaxer relaxing

47
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,840
tranquility peace calm

48
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:11,280
is there any part of the cycle of breathing that qualifies as being the most

49
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,759
calm the most at ease

50
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,639
the end of the exhale maybe

51
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,759
the end of the inhale

52
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,520
if there's a pause between the exhale and inhale

53
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:53,479
there's something about that pause that feels tranquil and calm

54
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,759
or is there something about the tempo of breathing

55
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:17,720
that feels easy and calm even if there's only a little hint of it

56
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:31,360
and as you exhale now to relax your body

57
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,360
soften

58
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:03,198
tranquility of the body is associated with the softness of body

59
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:09,160
in a lightness a body feels light

60
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:19,599
and as you exhale relaxing the body to soften

61
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,400
the edges of it

62
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,680
to ease up on the heaviness of the body

63
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,719
to feel a lightness

64
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,040
relaxing releasing the muscles of the face

65
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:09,839
relaxing releasing tension in your shoulders

66
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,720
softening the belly

67
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,600
and similarly can you find any hints of tranquility in your mind

68
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:50,399
even if the mind is agitated underneath the agitation behind it

69
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:59,519
to the side the mind or at the heart the center of the mind

70
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,839
is there any feelings of calm

71
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
he's

72
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:35,120
the tranquility of the mind is also associated with the softness soft mind

73
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,480
and a lightness of mind

74
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,440
and if there's a if you recognize any tranquility of mind

75
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,760
can you allow that to expand as you

76
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:03,600
breathe relaxing the mind

77
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:10,680
quieting it quieting the thinking

78
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:31,839
as you exhale relaxing any tension or pressure associated with

79
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:38,640
thinking so that the calmness of mind

80
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,880
can spread

81
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:15,680
i associate calmness with a very still

82
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:22,240
lake at dawn with no wind hardly

83
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:29,519
very peaceful surface of the lake air is clear and still

84
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:37,000
quiet before the activities of the day have begun

85
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:44,320
and for the body and mind to be tranquil like that

86
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,839
and the breathing to be maybe a very gentle breeze

87
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,959
that touches down across the surface of that lake

88
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,560
like a light feather it brushes

89
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,720
the surface of the lake that breeze doesn't disturb the lake

90
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:21,839
the movements are breathing soft and light like a feather

91
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:45,040
breathing with whatever tranquility of body and mind that's here

92
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:51,279
not worrying about the agitation that there might be

93
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:03,120
making room to feel and experience whatever peacefulness that's here

94
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:10,240
breathing with it letting it have its time

95
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:18,000
to expand to grow to nourish you

96
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,399
the nourishment of tranquility and peace

97
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:37,600
if there is any tranquility for you let there also be a willingness

98
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:44,000
to feel the tranquility and openness to it

99
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
receptivity

100
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:56,200
as you breathe with the tranquility of mind and body

101
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,799
if the mind is starting to get activated and thinking a lot

102
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:33,440
calmly recognize that's the that's the case

103
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:39,200
let your mindfulness be calm and tranquil about what it knows

104
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,559
there's no hurry in mindfulness

105
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:51,279
calmly bring what's happening into focus

106
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:59,840
and then recognize whatever tranquility and calmness that's present

107
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:11,559
in return to breathing breathing

108
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:19,120
together with whatever calmness is here

109
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:24,320
with whatever nourishing nourishment there is

110
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,080
in being peaceful and tranquil

111
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:39,440
and as the body feels tranquil and peaceful

112
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:45,279
might there be hints of some happiness

113
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:51,398
or some sense of contentment or ease

114
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:02,440
happiness or contentment in the body

115
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:10,080
and if there is hints of that let that expand

116
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:16,080
let that open to that

117
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:22,320
breathe with the contentment the happiness the ease

118
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,000
that might be there with the tranquility

119
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:41,120
a happiness contentment

120
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,840
that makes it easier to quiet the mind more

121
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,960
a still quiet tranquil mind

122
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:04,840
might itself have a mental contentment and happiness

123
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,640
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

124
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:30,800
may it be that this meditation is a support for the world

125
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:38,240
that the benefits of sitting and meditating will spread out from

126
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,040
us individually and us collectively

127
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:50,640
among those who are agitated

128
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:57,680
may we spread tranquility

129
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:07,440
among those who are in conflict may we provide peace

130
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:17,240
among those who are tense may we provide relaxation

131
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:28,760
among those who are discontented may we provide contentment

132
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:40,599
and for those who need reassurance may we be reassuring

133
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:51,838
that it's good to be at rest and at peace in one's own heart

134
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:02,400
may all beings be happy

135
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:08,240
may all beings be safe

136
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:16,160
may all beings be peaceful

137
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:22,400
may all beings be free

138
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:33,599
and in this way may all beings feel deeply at home

139
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:39,599
in this world of ours and in their own hearts

140
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:44,359
may all beings be happy

141
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:07,409
[Music]

142
00:44:54,480 --> 00:45:01,920
so continuing to discuss the seven factors of awakening

143
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:08,880
following the joy factor of awakening comes the tranquility factor of

144
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:14,400
awakening and

145
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:20,720
in the teachings of the buddha that pattern repeats itself many times

146
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:26,799
that first there's joy and then there's tranquility

147
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:32,800
and one of the common phrases in the suttas

148
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:38,960
is that when the mind is joyful the body becomes tranquil

149
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:44,800
and when the body is tranquil there arises happiness

150
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:51,280
so exactly how this works i can't tell you it depends a little bit of what we think

151
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:57,680
joy is but i think it's in part something that's

152
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:03,119
very reassuring that somehow to begin experiencing some

153
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:09,119
feeling of delight joy happiness goodness

154
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:15,359
in meditation then it's reassuring something can

155
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:21,599
release something and relax oh this is good i'm here i'm starting to be home

156
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:26,800
this is a good place to be it's okay not to be running around

157
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:33,280
searching wanting fighting resisting hoping

158
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:41,078
it's okay to kind of be reassuring just to be here and settled and relaxed

159
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:48,240
and and the function of this tranquility in

160
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:54,000
the buddhist path of meditation is not tranquility for its own sake

161
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,200
but tranquility for the sake of happiness

162
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:04,560
that joy precedes tranquility and then that opens

163
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:09,599
up the possibility for a deeper happiness and exactly what we mean by

164
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:15,839
happiness maybe is each of us will have a different idea but it's something that opens up

165
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:22,079
throughout the body it's often considered to be an embodied feeling of contentment or

166
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:27,280
happiness warmth goodness

167
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:33,359
that the tranquility enables because tranquility

168
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:39,440
kind of is something that's meant to spread through your body open your body so the tensions of your body are not

169
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:46,319
holding things in check and so as the body opens up more and more and

170
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:54,720
and we get feel and open to the body then there's more room for a well-being

171
00:47:54,720 --> 00:48:00,480
an embodied sense of well-being that doesn't really depend on what's

172
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:09,040
happening in the world it doesn't really depend on having our desires met or

173
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:15,280
having you know an evaluation doesn't depend on someone praising us or

174
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:22,720
having worldly success but comes from the state of mind

175
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:29,599
and body that we've kind of settled into in a meditative way

176
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:36,480
it's not easy to experience this and um so this is in terms of the factors of awakening

177
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:43,280
you know this tranquility is now step five and uh

178
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:48,800
i think that uh just with on as with anapanasati you know we're all

179
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:55,280
whether we consciously know it or not we're all kind of moving through these factors uh different days and different ones are

180
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:01,599
salient and but i think that percentage-wise but

181
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:07,520
average meditator spends much more time on the first one mindfulness

182
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:13,920
a little bit and then somewhat less time with investigation somewhat less time with maybe with i

183
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:20,160
don't know if the effort took outfits but less time with feeling joy and less time with feeling tranquility

184
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:25,599
and less time feeling to see that good happiness and then samadhi concentration and then

185
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:30,880
equanimity so i'm saying this so we don't set ourselves up and think that it has to be

186
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:37,119
linear it has to be like more and more of the good good stuff

187
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:42,480
you know the meditation is a lot to do with starting over and working with you know

188
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:48,240
working with what's we have and what's going on and then slowly you know that

189
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:54,319
we might find ourselves developing and moving into the direction of that these seven factors awakening

190
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:59,720
are pointing to but tranquility

191
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:08,319
in mid-1970s when the first

192
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:14,559
american vipassana teachers in our lineage who kind of establishing vipassana in the united

193
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:20,400
states they were going to look for a retreat center to have

194
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:27,079
first retreat center and they came across a

195
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:34,240
i guess it was a closed monastery kind of place in a place called barry massachusetts

196
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:40,400
small little town and as they were driving through town to see the place

197
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:47,280
in the middle of town there's a little statue or little yeah i think it's a statue from the kind of commemorating the colonial times

198
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:52,800
or the clone the revolutionary war or something something like that maybe but anyway had

199
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:59,520
the the motto of the town is tranquil and alert

200
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:05,280
and they said oh this is our place this is the place from meditation center

201
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:12,480
tranquil and alert so certainly the tranquility that comes

202
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:20,000
along with alertness not bright energetic alertness but the kind of clarity and simplicity

203
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:26,880
of alertness it's really here present so not a tranquility where we get lethargic or dull or start falling

204
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:32,960
asleep which is a little bit the danger with tranquility it's easy to

205
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:38,880
linger in it rest in it it's easy to indulge in it in such a way that we kind of it

206
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:46,000
actually becomes soperific it puts us asleep and the art of meditation is to be able to

207
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:52,319
stay alert and clear while being this deep tranquility

208
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:57,680
and that's why i like this myself this this lake metaphor image for tranquility

209
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:03,359
that early in the morning when the air is completely still and quiet and very clear

210
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:10,000
at dawn and everything and that surface of the lake is so still and quiet and peaceful

211
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:16,640
but completely um clears like and so this clarity

212
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:22,319
that comes with tranquility so it's about it's important when there's a lot of tranquility

213
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:28,079
to kind of bring into balance these factors of awakening so it might be a little more energy is

214
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:34,640
needed to keep that clarity or that's maybe the part of the function of the joy is to keep a little bit

215
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:40,079
brightness there so the mind can be soft

216
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:45,119
light and bright at the same time and so we're kind of tracking ourselves

217
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:50,480
and and so it's very important in any kind of meditation state when there's some nourishing qualities that are

218
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:56,160
present uh to not um kind of it's

219
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:02,319
the art of not indulging in it or resting it in a certain kind of way or

220
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:08,160
savoring it in a way that um but also allowing ourselves to be nourished by it

221
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:15,440
allowing us ourselves to feel the goodness of it without leaning into it or holding on to it or or becoming

222
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:20,559
complacent i think as people get calmer in

223
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:25,680
meditation and a lot of their tensions and anxieties and different things settle

224
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:32,640
down it's very easy to fall into a complacency and um and just kind of just be content

225
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:38,400
to kind of feel calm and relaxed and the mind wanders off and fall asleep and

226
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:45,119
because there's not really the little brightness of practice of engagement

227
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:50,640
so this bright tranquility this bright serenity or peace

228
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:56,800
that comes along and um right you know

229
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:03,200
tranquil and alert and then uh as i've maybe said already

230
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:09,520
that for the buddha each of these factors of awakening have something that

231
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:17,839
nourishes them and then in the case of tranquility tranquility nourishes tranquility

232
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:24,800
so if you want to be tranquil go find something for fine tranquility

233
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:31,760
because that tranquility feeds us or influence us or something so it could be mean you know going into

234
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:38,079
some people find have tranquil places they go there are places believe it or not

235
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:43,599
buildings that are tranquil buildings i used to go sometimes into some of the

236
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:50,079
churches in europe when i lived there i just sit quietly some of them were quite tranquil and peaceful and just

237
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:55,839
it was wonderful to go you know hustle and bustle of town come across this wonderful little church and go in and be

238
00:54:55,839 --> 00:55:01,520
so peaceful and just sit there for a while and take it in and it felt like nourishing to take it

239
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:06,960
in the um many people associated with places in

240
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:12,559
nature even if it's a very small little park

241
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:17,839
you know that can be a tranquil place so yesterday i was in a park and

242
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:23,359
and there was a piece of the park just a few trees that thought this is a peaceful place it was nice just to be

243
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:29,200
there and take it in or maybe a tranquility can be found with a cup of

244
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:34,799
tea it doesn't you know just to contentedly drink the tea to drink

245
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:40,160
the tea as if this is meant to be a place to

246
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:45,920
drink tranquility it's a little bit

247
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:54,240
a footnote that the word pity p-i-t-i that's the word for joy also in pali means to drink

248
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:59,200
so nourishment drinking in something

249
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:05,359
and then and then when you sit meditate

250
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:11,599
can you support yourself with tranquility as you meditate um do you just take it to chance you

251
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:17,920
just gamble that today i'm gonna sit down and maybe it'll be some tranquility or do you sit down in a place that's

252
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:24,319
tranquil sometimes people find that just straightening out their room before they

253
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:30,079
meditate it just seems to kind of support a little more tranquility rather than a

254
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:35,359
messy room and a clean place

255
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:41,680
and then to take some time to value tranquility try calmness

256
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:46,798
and so to sit down and see if there's any any of it here

257
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:53,839
so tranquility nourishes tranquility so the ability to recognize it and allow

258
00:56:53,839 --> 00:57:01,200
ourselves to feel it when it is there than to avail ourselves of that and and i love the term nourishment

259
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:06,880
to be nourished by this it goes along with translating

260
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:12,160
kusala the word for skillful or wholesome translating as wholesome

261
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:17,359
because one of the things wholesomes mean i think in english is a kind of something which is healthy for us it's

262
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:22,400
nourishing for us like wholesome bread or something and

263
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:27,440
and so this idea that what we're doing this buddhist path is we're nourishing

264
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:32,799
ourselves with what's wholesome and that's a very different paradigm

265
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:38,160
for meditation practice in buddhist practice than the acquisitive paradigm

266
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:43,760
and i got to do it and i gotta work at it and you know get concentrated and

267
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:49,839
make something happen and get something to happen to me and you know it's it's a there can be a lot

268
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:56,640
of um uh unhealthy unnourishing attitudes that we bring to meditation

269
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:01,920
so is there a nourishing attitude is there an attitude is kind of

270
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:08,079
touch and do this practice engage in our life live our life so the very way that we live our life

271
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:15,040
feels nourishing feels wholesome feels supportive that is onward leading

272
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:22,480
just to these each of these factors of awakening is onward leading tranquility when you practice is not a

273
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:30,480
dead end when you're practicing mindfulness and sincerely tranquility itself is onward leading its

274
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:36,640
support to go it to um to kind of happiness and contentment

275
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:43,599
which then becomes a support for samadhi for concentration and if we take samadhi to be a

276
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:50,640
unification of mind where we're feeling of becoming whole then this tranquility that allows us to

277
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:55,760
kind of be at ease in our whole body and mind that kind of that supports us to be

278
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:02,319
kind of really centered in here in a deep way without the tensions and the conflicts and the divisions that

279
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:09,680
that um you know prevents us from feeling a wholeness then we understand how this tranquility

280
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:15,359
being tranquil is a support for the wholeness feeling of wholeness or unification

281
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:21,040
that comes with samadhi which will be the topic for these

282
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:26,960
early morning tomorrow and

283
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:32,640
and so for now

284
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:38,799
you're left with tranquility can't be that bad

285
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:43,079
thank you
