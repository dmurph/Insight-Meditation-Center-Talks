1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,560
so try again here and welcome you again to this

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:14,879
morning and of meditation and as I started to say that

3
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:20,279
we had um some of the emphasis last couple of days has been on the wise use

4
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:26,760
of no as a support for meditation and uh today I'd like to

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,078
suggest that uh the little phrase that you can use in the meditation either say

6
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:38,640
it or just keep remembering it as you go along maybe at every exhale you can or

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,719
beginning of the inhale somehow just have some reminder to say this and see what effect it has on

8
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:52,160
you and uh and this is the two words no

9
00:00:52,160 --> 00:01:01,160
comment whatever is happening to you no comment Let It Be

10
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:09,320
and uh let it be alone and uh uh don't get involved with it don't

11
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:16,159
be or against it don't accept it don't reject it and

12
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:23,600
don't participate in it no comment just leave it alone so you might have the most wonderful thought ever and it's

13
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,720
tempting to keep thinking about it no comment you might have an awful thought

14
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:36,520
and you might be horrified and want to kind of get involved with how terrible it is to have those kinds of thinking

15
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:42,159
and rather in meditation no comment the meditation is going really

16
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:49,920
really well no comment it's going really badly if such if if that is

17
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,799
possible no comment just stay present stay with what's

18
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:04,360
happening uh no need to comment on it just stay aware stay here with what

19
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:12,280
is so to assume a meditation posture and

20
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:19,560
to maybe lower your gaze 45 degrees to the

21
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,959
floor letting the eyes relax and be

22
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:31,640
soft and if it's comfortable for you to close your eyes

23
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:40,040
and maybe feel whatever tension or agitation there might be in the

24
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:46,680
eyes no comment but you might want to see if you

25
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,560
can let your eyes rest in their

26
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:58,120
sockets sometimes I've imagine that I'm looking backwards and down the 45 degree

27
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:04,360
angle in my head backwards that there's a way of doing

28
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:12,640
that that helps me settle into the back of the eye socket here relax to the

29
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,360
eyes no need to be looking at

30
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,760
anything including with the Mind's Eye

31
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:40,239
and as you exhale relax any bodily agitation

32
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,720
or tension you might have in

33
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:53,959
your maybe feeling it on the inhale and exhaling on releasing relaxing on the

34
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:56,959
exhale

35
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:12,720
it might be after feeling and relaxing the body for a few

36
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:20,600
breaths you might want to readjust your posture a little bit maybe the position of your hands and

37
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:28,199
your arms like just now I just brought my hands back on my thigh a little

38
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:34,800
bit that allow allow something to release in the shoulders and even in the

39
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:57,919
belly and let the inhale continue a little bit longer than

40
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:05,400
usual just a brief few moments almost like you're enjoying it

41
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,639
and just linger with

42
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:19,039
it and the same with the exhale linger with the

43
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:26,919
end so almost on its own it continues for a couple of moments more

44
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:37,039
not an effort to have longer breaths but just linger and allow

45
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:45,280
it you're allowing inhale and exhale to be more complete

46
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,720
and to be with breathing for a few for a little while

47
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:24,360
now with no comment which includes no judgment about

48
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:30,360
the breathing and if there is

49
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:36,840
in spite of yourself commentary that arises in the

50
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,919
mind think of it as a almost like another person who's

51
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:47,880
speaking and your reply is no

52
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,759
comment and return to breathing

53
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:23,919
to be making comments and judgments stories about what's

54
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:32,000
happening is to be entrenched is is to

55
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,198
be under the influence of what's

56
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:43,160
happening to say no

57
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:52,080
comment is to stay independent stay

58
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:02,759
free not living under the influence of how things are

59
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:10,638
going but instead living aware of what's going on

60
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:20,520
without being under its influence no

61
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440

preoccupied let that help you listen better to

00:27:56,279 --> 00:28:02,399
um so you'll see me there and then the other is that um at this

119
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:08,039
time of year as many organizations we have an end of the year letter that goes

120
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:13,120
out and uh fundraising letter and um and

121
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:19,360
some of you might be interested in Reading what I wrote It's a letter from me about IMC

122
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:28,279
IRC and uh it's uh the link to it is on the YouTube um under the title of this

123
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:34,720
this uh YouTube event uh right there uh there's a link and also you'll find a

124
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:41,600
link to the letter on imc's website on the homepage um under what's new and I

125
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:48,640
believe irc's website has it also so um you might be interested in seeing yeah

126
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:55,159
kind of the The Wider bigger picture of uh that we're connected to through this

127
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:59,600
YouTube um teaching

128
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:10,840
um so today uh we're talking about the third theme in this ancient text

129
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:16,799
called that I I kind of uh well my translation of it I call the Buddha before

130
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:24,519
Buddhism uh and um it is um the First theme was uh not

131
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:31,240
clinging to any of views the second is uh not clinging to any sensual desires

132
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:36,440
and the third theme that goes through the book is a description of the

133
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:42,559
sage one of the primary uh names of someone who's mature in this practice

134
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:48,880
and what the Buddha is teaching is called a wise person a sage and a monei

135
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:58,559
sometimes the Buddha is called shakya monei the money the wise person of the shakya clan that he was born into

136
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:04,640
and um and what stands out to me as I translated this text is that

137
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:10,440
um the um uh lot of the other later

138
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:17,960
descriptions of people who mature in this practice uh uh have uh a

139
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:24,240
descriptive of things which are not directly connected to the practice and the realization itself so for example we

140
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:32,000
have uh the word arot for people who are fully enlightened but uh I don't know if

141
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,360
the atmology is that important but that comes from the word to be worthy to be

142
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:43,799
worthy of respect to be worthy of of donations and so it's a word that uh has

143
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:50,760
it Source in the social relationships we have um people who are not quite fully

144
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:57,159
enlightened sometimes are called um once returners and non- returners uh once

145
00:30:57,159 --> 00:31:03,159
returner is someone who will die and then be reborn one more time before they become fully enlightened is is what they

146
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:08,679
say and then the non-r returner is not fully enlightened but will will somehow

147
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:15,840
finish that work after they die and never be returned as a human again and here so here again it's not

148
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:21,960
descriptive of the what the person is now but rather has to do with some ideas

149
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:28,639
and theories of rebirth that are used to describe what they've attained in the

150
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:37,080
in this book of eights this uh book that I translated um it's a wise person and um

151
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:44,480
and the descriptive of the person is always in U in uh some some quality they

152
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:50,519
have here and now so even the wise the Mooney translated a

153
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:56,600
sage uh what are they wise about and so there's descriptions of what what they're like what they what wisdom

154
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:02,639
they've attained and interesting the wisdom they attain is always

155
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:08,639
described they're wise about delusion they're wise about how they get caught

156
00:32:08,639 --> 00:32:15,440
they're wise about clinging and um and uh and so in that

157
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:21,240
wisdom they can learn how not to cling not to get attached it's not wisdom

158
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:27,279
about emptiness or wisdom about not self wisdom about some metaphysical or

159
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:33,679
Supernatural ual thing it's uh really a wisdom about how we suffer and the

160
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:39,320
causes of suffering and to have wisdom about that is is what makes the person

161
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:48,320
wise especially if they're wise enough not to get caught and um so it keeps coming back to

162
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:55,480
the describing the person the practice the realizations the insights what they do that's very naturalistic it's what

163
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:02,880
very humanistic it's just what what you see what you live in what humans are like in their life directly without any

164
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:11,480
recourse to metaphysical ideas doctrines that are kind of abstract that uh uh

165
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:16,919
something you have to take on faith and belief without really know being able to

166
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:22,240
experience it for yourself maybe or something Supernatural so it's a remarkable kind

167
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:29,120
of uh humanistic or naturalistic description of the sage of the wise

168
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:35,200
person so I'm going to read to you some um of these

169
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,200
um

170
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:55,360
um so here the introduction a significant attribute of

171
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:02,440
sages is their ability to know and see and sometimes their name their title

172
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:09,599
is uh the ones who know they do not see the nature of Ultimate Reality or some form of

173
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:15,118
ultimate Consciousness rather sages know and see the ways in which people

174
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:22,118
struggle they know what is not harmonious and what is dangerous they know the problems that come from pride

175
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:28,118
and holding on to opinions they see how people selfishly trash about get a lated

176
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:33,919
and deflated in their disputes speak with arrogance and cling to teachings by

177
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:39,158
having insight into these afflictive states a wise person knows not to get

178
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:44,398
involved with them and to and instead to let go of

179
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:49,760
them um being at peace and having overcome

180
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:59,280
Cravings sages become independent knowing the Dharma through their own direct insight and experience

181
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:06,240
so here so someone asks the Buddha question

182
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:14,599
the question is seeing what and behaving how is one said to be at

183
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:20,200
peace uh talk about this Gama when you are asked about the

184
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:26,040
Supreme people then the Buddha said free of

185
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:32,320
craving before they die independent of past and

186
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:39,720
future not making up anything in the present they Revere

187
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:49,160
nothing it's almost like the whole religiosity of religions that have sacred and reverence and um is kind of

188
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:56,200
uh put aside for the fa for in favor of just becoming confident and present in a

189
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:03,040
peaceful way free of anger free of fear not boasting

190
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:11,000
not worrying they are sages who when speaking teach without

191
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,079
agitation not clinging to the Future nor grieving the past they see seclusion in

192
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:23,400
the midst of sense contexts and are not Guided by

193
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:30,319
views they are neither clinging nor deceitful not greedy or stingy neither

194
00:36:30,319 --> 00:36:35,440
impudent nor offensive and don't engage in malicious

195
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:41,560
speech neither addicted to what's Pleasant nor given to arrogance gentle

196
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:47,880
and intelligent they are faithless and don't free themselves from

197
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:55,119
Passion they are faithless it's fascinating uh uh here they are

198
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:01,480
faithless means they don't require Faith they don't have to believe in something because they know themselves faithless

199
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:07,800
has a kind of a I think even back in Ancient India I think it was kind of like probably a little shocking to refer

200
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:14,480
to someone who's a sage as faithless uh because uh I think it just as in English

201
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:22,440
that means someone who's maybe dishonest or betrays or something but here free of

202
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,440
Faith um

203
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:38,760
and then this also says they don't free themselves from Passion uh it's also kind of you know shocking to to say but

204
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:44,079
the reason they say this it's a kind of a pun or a play of words or a kind of a

205
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:49,680
little Zinger is that um uh they don't have to free themselves from Passion

206
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:58,319
because they're already free um they are not upset with lack of

207
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:04,480
possessions they are not hindered by Cravings they don't covet tasty

208
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,880
Foods always equanimous and mindful in this world they don't think of

209
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:17,920
themselves as equal Superior or inferior they have no swollen

210
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:25,720
Pride depending on nothing having known the Dharma they are

211
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:33,960
independent they have no C saving for becoming and non- becoming for living or

212
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:40,880
dying I say they are at peace they who are concerned with sensual Pleasures they who are not

213
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:48,640
concerned with sensual Pleasures they have no bonds and have crossed Beyond

214
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:57,480
attachments not greedy nor selfish sages don't claim to be superior equal or in

215
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:04,520
inferior to others being free of comparisons they do not compare even

216
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:12,240
saying we're equal is a comparison taking nothing in the world as their own having no sorrow for what

217
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:20,119
doesn't exist and uninvolved in doctrines they are called

218
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:27,000
peaceful so the idea that they're peaceful uh this is what describes them

219
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:34,839
and only these other ways might seem pretty far out pretty unattainable in some ways um but they are things that're

220
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:42,599
very humanistic something part or parcel of human life that we can kind of see for ourselves see it in others and we

221
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:49,160
can see degrees of it in people some people are really greedy really attached some people are less so and so it's part

222
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:58,960
of the normal world we live in uh and uh even though it seems pretty extraordinary maybe but uh it's free of

223
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:06,880
you know doctrines and beliefs and Supernatural and great states of meditation and and something much more

224
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:13,280
direct here and now um so

225
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:22,079
um so there's a way then in this way to

226
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:28,319
understand that this can be about you that you can be a sage you can be a

227
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:36,040
peaceful one uh what you need to understand to be a sage is not endless studies of

228
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:41,760
Buddhist texts and doctrines and but rather it's to really understand

229
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:49,119
yourself the Dharma book that we study in Buddhism is in your own heart and your own minds understanding how you get

230
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:56,880
caught and knowing how not to be caught the place to find the Dharma for

231
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:02,720
yourself self is when you find a degree of Peace Here and Now peace from all

232
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:09,520
these things comparisons and conceit and arrogance and and uh fear

233
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:14,560
and so this is the message of this ancient text this is the perhaps the

234
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:19,640
earliest message that the Buddha made once he set forth to teach uh what he

235
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:25,760
had discovered with his Enlightenment so thank you very much and

236
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:35,839
uh I look forward to seeing you in um from IRC tomorrow
