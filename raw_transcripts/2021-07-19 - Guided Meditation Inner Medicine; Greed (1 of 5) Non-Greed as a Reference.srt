1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,559
so warm greetings i'm happy to be back and

2
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:20,400
i had a wonderful time backpacking uh long hikes beautiful places

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,720
and adventures with california fires and mostly the smokes and a

4
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:33,200
closed trail because of the fires and now i'm happy to be back happy to be

5
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,920
here with you all

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,559
and so in the kind of meditation world

7
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:53,199
that uh we practice in this kind of spiritual inner spiritual

8
00:00:53,199 --> 00:01:02,000
life or this inner life that we develop and turn inside out there's a principle that

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,880
wherever there's an illness there is the medicine and now we're talking about kind of a

10
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:16,000
spiritual or dharmic illness but that if you can recognize where the

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,799
suffering is the dukkha the illnesses that the recognition is clear enough

12
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:29,920
that you could also it's possible to find the medicine right there so if you clearly recognize

13
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,320
your mind is agitated chances are right next to it close by

14
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,399
is the medicine which is a calm mind calm attention

15
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:49,759
if you're caught up in greed the clear recognition of it

16
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,920
you'll can see or feel that potential or that place in the mind the heart

17
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:04,799
where there's no greed that's the medicine for greed same for hatred and delusion

18
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:12,720
and to some degree it's also true for fear if you can this the capacity to clearly recognize fear

19
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,760
and then to look around and not be contracted or not be fixated on the fear preoccupied by the

20
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,879
fear but to see it clearly but then look around a lot along the

21
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:31,920
edges of it beyond beyond underneath it or below it somewhere within and you'll see that

22
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,239
there is the medicine for it there is courage there is confidence

23
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,840
and or there's peace something that's non-fear

24
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,760
and so this clearly involves recognizing what is going on inside

25
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:56,000
without that there's no medicine but the medicine comes with a clear recognition

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,280
so it's kind of a wonderful good news that each of you each of us has within us the medicine

27
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,920
the spirit the spiritual medicine or the mental medicine that we need for

28
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:19,120
spiritual illnesses and but it's a little hard to

29
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,159
pull ourselves away enough from the illness the so-called illness the so-called dharmic

30
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:31,440
dukkha that we might have to pull away or to disengage or not

31
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:39,440
be overly preoccupied with it so we have the capacity to see something else

32
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:47,360
and so one of the things that we can do in meditation is find something that feels basically

33
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,799
healthy and appropriate or good to focus on that's very simple something like the

34
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:59,840
breathing or some people use clear recognition itself the simplest clear recognition of

35
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,840
what's happening and as a way of of

36
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:13,760
not giving our the energy of attention to the illness to feed it even more

37
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,600
to kind of not feed these mental kind of preoccupations that

38
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,160
we call you know illnesses or dukkha and just stay with the breathing stay

39
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:33,199
with the breathing and then slowly the interest the preoccupation the feeding of this kinds

40
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:39,759
of spiritual illnesses abates without us having to do anything

41
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:46,160
without using the medicine even until we find ourselves settled enough calm

42
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:54,720
enough un agitated enough that the medicine kind of spreads through through us throughout

43
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,759
the medicine of peace the calm of non-reactivity the medicine of non-greed non-hatred and

44
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:07,600
non-delusion so taking a

45
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:15,280
comfortable posture that will also promote your capacity for

46
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,919
attention for clear recognition

47
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:27,919
and to gently close your eyes

48
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,880
and take a few long slow deep breaths

49
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,919
and if you take those long deep breaths unhurriedly

50
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:53,840
it can be start being medicine for our hearts and our inner life

51
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:01,360
as you take a deep breath maybe relax and soften the body

52
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,840
as you exhale

53
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:14,000
perhaps allow your body to settle as you exhale

54
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,840
and then letting your breathing return to normal

55
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:37,680
and as you exhale now the medicine of relaxation

56
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:49,840
on the exhale softening the face softening around the eyes

57
00:06:50,800 --> 00:07:03,840
as you exhale softening the shoulders

58
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:17,840
as you exhale softening the belly

59
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:25,599
and gently as you exhale to soften in the mind

60
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:35,759
relax the thinking muscle whatever contraction or tightness that's

61
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:45,840
there associated with thinking

62
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:05,199
maybe you can identify in your mind your heart somewhere within

63
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:11,039
some something that has the potential to be medicine

64
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:17,360
for your for whatever ails you spiritually

65
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:24,800
mentally maybe there's some spaciousness

66
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,879
or calm or peacefulness

67
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,320
or compassion

68
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,479
care inner respect for yourself

69
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,839
and then to settle into your body breathing

70
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,600
simple caring attention

71
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,639
to breathing in and breathing out

72
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:22,320
caringly receiving the inhale

73
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,639
caringly allowing for the exhale

74
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:41,360
receiving and allowing inhaling and exhaling

75
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:51,839
one after another

76
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,839
so

77
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,840
you

78
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:33,760
if you can recognize it the medicine you need is always within

79
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:43,840
the dharmic medicine

80
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,840
so

81
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:46,399
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

82
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:55,279
when we learn to recognize the inner medicine

83
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:03,840
the heart's medicine for what ails the heart

84
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:16,880
that very medicine is the medicine that the world needs as well

85
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:24,880
and to appreciate the value of your inner medicine as a contribution to

86
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:31,520
this world when we are unagitated it's medicine for

87
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:38,240
the agitation of the world when we have compassion and love it's

88
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:44,720
medicine for the world's hate when we have generosity and contentment

89
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:51,919
it's medicine for the world's greed when we have wisdom

90
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:59,840
clear seeing and recognition it's medicine for the world's delusion

91
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:09,200
and when we encounter the suffering of the world it's medicine to see it honestly and

92
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:17,760
clearly and caringly without being oppressed by it

93
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:22,799
or de-stressed by it

94
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,240
and may it be that this meditation that we do today and

95
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:35,919
may or may it be medicine for the world knowingly and unknowingly intentionally

96
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:42,000
and unintentionally intentionally we live our lives

97
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,080
so that we make this world a better place

98
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:56,960
so that all beings may be happy all beings may be free of suffering

99
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:03,600
all beings may be free of fear and distress

100
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:09,840
that all beings may be free of oppression

101
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:18,000
may all beings be happy may all beings be well

102
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:37,840
may all beings be peaceful and may all beings everywhere be free

103
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:41,390
[Music]

104
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:51,840
thank you

105
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:41,360
so good morning again and welcome to the beginning of the week and beginning of a series

106
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:47,120
and uh the series for this week and actually for the next three weeks

107
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:54,960
address is an issue which is huge for human beings both personally and socially

108
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,720
so in terms of an illness that spreads within and without

109
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:09,440
and has a big bearing on the buddha the buddhist spiritual life the topic is greed hatred and delusion

110
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:15,279
and uh i'll say in a little bit about why i you know there was a time in my life

111
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:20,960
where i would hesitate to spend so much time talking about this and maybe that will support some of you

112
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,000
for whom that's uh maybe a little bit i don't know not inspiring to hear that

113
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:33,440
that's this is going to be the topic for the next few weeks and the plan is to um

114
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:39,840
each week to have a same pattern of five talks related to each one and

115
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:45,679
we'll see if plans work out but the idea is to first the first day on monday to talk

116
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:51,039
about the opposite the absence of the particular of greed or hatred or

117
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:58,240
delusion and this wonderfulness then the medicine of non-greed the medicine of non-hate

118
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:05,200
non-delusion the value of it as a reference point for studying this topic

119
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:11,200
then on tuesday to talk about a particular topic itself and i've done

120
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:18,399
this recently and hopefully can do it in a different way and and then on wednesday to talk about

121
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:24,960
the basic vipassana practice in relationship to it each of these on thursday to talk about

122
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:31,440
composting each of the composting greed composting hatred and delusion

123
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:37,200
and what composting mean and transforming and then on friday to talk about

124
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:43,279
liberation from each of these and and living

125
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:50,240
as a living a life that promotes the ending of greed hate and delusion and others as well

126
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:57,519
to support others to uh in this world of ours to um diminish the

127
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:03,760
the the greed and hatred and delusion which is rampant and you know some way or other needs to

128
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:10,480
be addressed and maybe we can be a agent of change

129
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:16,480
in this particular focus so um

130
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:24,960
so for this week it's uh the topic is greed and and

131
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,800
so i want to start with the idea of non-greed and part of the value of this importance

132
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:36,638
of it for me personally is that when i was younger when i was first kind of encountered theravadin buddhism and

133
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:43,200
there was all these talks over and over again in reference point to the greed hate and delusion and at that time

134
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:49,839
when i heard it i saw this is being reductionalistic i felt like i was being reduced

135
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:56,079
to this kind of and felt puritanical and moralistic and kind of like who i was was being reduced

136
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:03,839
to this very kind of limited unsavory kind of thing of being someone

137
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:09,760
who has a lot of greed hate and delusion and you're supposed to uproot it

138
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:17,440
and it just didn't resonate with me in fact it was a little bit off-putting for me to have this emphasis and

139
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:25,359
but i went along and did the practice of mindfulness and and and what i discovered and

140
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:30,960
now in retrospect i can say i discovered non-greed non-hatred and non-delusion

141
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:37,119
i discovered a capacity for inner health and well-being that um became a very important

142
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:42,960
reference point for understanding myself and my life to unders to have a capacity for

143
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:51,040
you know a strong capacity or touch in strongly to a non-agitated mind a mind that's

144
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:56,880
peaceful and calm that seems to be operating in a healthy way

145
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:03,599
to tap into a capacity for a confident mind a clear mind

146
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:09,040
a loving mind or heart to start discovering this wealth of

147
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:14,800
beauty that we have within and that is not reductionistic which is actually

148
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:22,720
enhancing or fully or filling um

149
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:28,000
and there's a nun in the early buddhist tradition her name was punna

150
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,280
which meant uh full like and she said she's full like the full moon

151
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:40,960
and this idea of becoming full of beautiful things and radiance so to start to do the practice

152
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:47,599
and start discovering these wellsprings within of well-being um and then to start wrecking this is

153
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:52,880
what happened to me and start recognizing when i had creed

154
00:36:52,880 --> 00:37:00,480
that was what was reductionistic that's what that was diminishing me when i had hate

155
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,920
i would eclipse this beauty i would lose it and i would be diminished i'd be reduced

156
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:13,440
to something that wasn't very pleasant and if i caught an delusion that that also limit me and in some ways

157
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:19,359
i was very alienating alienating to be in delusion it kind of separated me from myself separated me

158
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:26,720
from the world around me and so understanding this non-greed

159
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:34,160
helped me to understand the the shortcomings the danger of

160
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:40,000
having greed and and then it became much more interesting the teachings on

161
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,480
greed hatred and delusion it be more interesting to understand greed in a deeper way it became interesting to practice with

162
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,680
greed practiced overcome it learned how to

163
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:57,040
compost it and learn how to you know live a life liberated from it

164
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:02,800
because i could recognize how the limitations the suffering the dukkha

165
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:08,160
the distress the the the the way in which i was

166
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:14,000
shortcoming myself when i got pulled into greed or hatred and delusion

167
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,079
and that's not an easy thing to see because these are these forces are very compelling

168
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:26,960
and any resistance any restraint to having them flow through us freely can that can feel

169
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:33,599
just uncomfortable that can feel like our freedom is limited and if we're supposed to be free let

170
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:38,640
these things roll let them flow through us you know greed you know it's

171
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:44,640
it's so almost valued in much of our society that uh it just

172
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:50,640
seems like it's all good to be greedy and certain kinds of greed are not recognized as greed

173
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:58,960
uh you know i think i think that it seems like every 10 years or so the 80s late 90s late

174
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:06,320
first decade of this century and maybe i don't know but now but uh there was this huge economic

175
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:12,240
collapses in this country that um that uh we discovered that there

176
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:18,480
was these bankers and other people who were operating our tremendous avariciousness

177
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:24,800
and and you know illegally or unethically acquiring huge wealth at

178
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,839
the well at the expense of other people but did we use greed did they understand

179
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:36,560
themselves as being greedy or was this the american way to just kind of get more acquire more and more

180
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:44,079
more wealth and material things and um and uh

181
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:52,000
so to begin understanding how the unabated

182
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,960
unrestrained kind of giving ourselves over to greed to hatred and to our delusions um

183
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:05,520
it is not an expression of real freedom it's actually an expression of

184
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:11,920
being in bondage being caught being enslaved

185
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:18,160
by forces inside of us that have taken control and pushing us and that

186
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:24,240
what we're looking for is how not to be an automatic pilot not to be compelled by

187
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:31,920
these strong human instinct instincts or drives but also not to hold them restrained in

188
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:39,119
a way that can feel very uncomfortable and a lot of work to do but to allow them to just uh to learn

189
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:44,400
how to dissipate them or or come into the op the other end of other side of them

190
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:50,720
where there is peace and and uh and um you know the inner beauty begins to

191
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:58,880
shine forth or we feel full and enhanced now one of the reasons why people might

192
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:07,280
be very resistant to the idea of non-greed non-hate and non-delusion is that the drive the compulsion for

193
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:14,480
desires for wanting for pushing away and having a hospital hostile are there

194
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:19,839
for a reason try to get what we want and the idea of not having them can

195
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:27,280
people can feel like there's no motivation that we can't take care of ourselves or get what we need or protect us from ourselves from the

196
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:32,880
encroaching masses which are going to destroy our life or something

197
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:39,760
but um you know if we do when we start discovering this beautiful capacity for peace for

198
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:45,040
calm for inner well-being uh what we also start discovering

199
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:52,480
is that we can take care of ourselves we can act in the world without greed and

200
00:41:52,480 --> 00:42:02,000
act beneficially there can be wholesome desires there can be desires to do good

201
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,160
to be generous there can be um it's they said that faith in buddhism is

202
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:14,400
a kind of desire because buddhist faith is the desire to develop the fullness to develop the freedom

203
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,839
that we have and and so there are there's a there can be

204
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:25,839
tremendous beautiful motivations coming from a peaceful heart coming from a heart of well-being

205
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:33,359
that is not agitated not pushing not resisting

206
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:40,319
not you know fighting this world of ours and feeling good to fight and for everything

207
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:46,000
we can get but there's this kind of movement of aikido a movement of kind of

208
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,680
of not resisting not fighting but discovering the wellsprings of a

209
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:57,599
different kind of wisdom a different kind of a wisdom a generosity

210
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:04,079
love a compassion a sense of peace where there's a tremendous capacity for

211
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:09,920
creativity engagement but it's not one that's so centered on

212
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:17,119
self me myself and mine the idea of a personal identity who i am what i

213
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:22,960
need what i have to do what i have to do to care for myself protect myself

214
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:28,079
the excessive focus on i excessive focus on one's personal

215
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:33,760
identity and maintaining it is part of the what complicates greed

216
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:40,319
hate and delusion and makes it really mucky and dangerous even

217
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:47,760
and to discover there are motivations beautiful motivations within that are not self-centric

218
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:55,119
they're certainly within us so in that sense they're part of ourselves but they're not centered on the egotism

219
00:43:55,119 --> 00:44:00,240
or the conceit or the selfishness that often goes along with greed hatred and

220
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:07,119
delusion and so one of the reasons to not want to give up greed hate and delusion

221
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:13,440
it seems like then we're giving up self giving up self identity because people maybe are rooted in

222
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:21,920
some contracted sense of self and self identity but to discover the that which is not

223
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:27,040
self within non-contracted self the place of non

224
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:32,640
preoccupation with identity to discover this beauty inside the fullness inside

225
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:38,480
where motivations can well up from this wellspring of goodness within from the wellsprings of beauty

226
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:43,680
within without this preoccupation with self

227
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:50,000
this is a fantastic thing and so this inner beauty is the reference

228
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:57,119
point for one reference point for becoming interested in studying and understanding greed and

229
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:02,160
hatred and delusion because it um because then we really

230
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:10,560
understand how greed and hatred delusion diminishes us reduces us limits us

231
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:17,359
and how much more wonderful this we are and oddly enough

232
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:24,000
the world is when we live without great hatred and delusion

233
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:30,560
so that's uh so we'll i'll continue then tomorrow on this topic of greed and

234
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:37,599
we'll take our journey uh our five-day journey through this these three topics and um

235
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:42,800
and hopefully you'll appreciate why uh this is such a valuable topic in buddhism

236
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:48,240
and um and how the liberation from greed and hidden

237
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:53,920
delusion is one of the most potent and expressions of what liberation is in

238
00:45:53,920 --> 00:46:01,838
buddhism so um thank you very much
