1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:12,400
so good day everyone and welcome to this meditation session

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,520
and one of the functions of buddhist meditation

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,880
is to place ourselves

4
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:30,480
squarely fully into the vibrant

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:37,360
and dynamic pulsing [Music]

6
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:45,440
experience of life of being alive that um

7
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,520
all the sensations that you experience whatever they might be pleasant or

8
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:58,079
unpleasant they come and they go they're dynamic they vibrate they are

9
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,559
flashing in and out of existence moment by moment

10
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:10,240
that all the experiences sensations that you have you have because you're alive once

11
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,320
you're dead your body is no longer energized or

12
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,439
animated with the whatever the life force is within us

13
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:29,280
there are no sensations whatsoever and um and the sensations we experience

14
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,079
are proof of the living livingness in us the dynamic and

15
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:41,600
active quality of the natural world the energies of the natural world that

16
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:48,560
how they flow through us and manifest in us and so to sit in

17
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:55,439
the middle of our body and with anapanasati and to be able to be

18
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,320
centered unified collected

19
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:08,399
liberated from distractions and really he be here to feel and sense and

20
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:16,000
be intimate with the dynamism of change dynamism of the

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,560
the coming and going appearing and disappearing of phenomena everything to be called

22
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,640
experience in a certain way what it doesn't change

23
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,959
are concepts platonic concepts of things which their ideas of

24
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:42,000
them which stay constant ideas of self ideas of others ideas of what has

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,959
happened to us and even some kind of funny way what will happen to us these ideas give the semblance that

26
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:55,280
things are continuous maybe in some things are in certain kind of way

27
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,480
but to drop into the flow of experience

28
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,959
to the direct direct immediate perception knowing experiencing

29
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:14,480
of life as it flows in that little window little kind of

30
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:22,640
where they vast past and vast future of you know coming and going

31
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:29,840
we have this idea i think in in english sometimes that we're moving into the future and i think

32
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,760
in ancient india they had the idea more the idea that the future was coming towards us

33
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:44,319
in this river of you know just time just flows and when and we know the future

34
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:52,480
only in the experience as it becomes the present and as we know it it already vanishes

35
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,080
there's something about the immediacy it already vanishes here

36
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:06,000
so assuming a meditation posture a posture to

37
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:14,400
embody inhabit the lived experience of the moment

38
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,880
and perhaps to close your eyes in order to

39
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,320
be inside to sense and feel inside your life

40
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:40,840
your body sometimes with the eyes open we're looking at things externally and pulled into the external

41
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,160
world the eyes closed the idea is to

42
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:55,680
come into this intimate world of our physical embodied experience

43
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,360
in the immediacy of here

44
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:11,680
and to gently maybe lovingly kindly slowly take some deeper breaths

45
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,120
maybe three quarters full

46
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:25,600
taking deeper breaths so slow and careful enough that you almost like you're savoring and enjoying

47
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:38,880
this the feelings in your body of the chest expanding the belly expanding

48
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:45,120
and then a longer exhale than usual not so much maybe that you're forcing

49
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,320
the air out but you let go you release

50
00:05:50,320 --> 00:06:07,840
the muscles around your diaphragm your chest so that the exhale extends itself

51
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:20,960
as you have these long exhales also relax other parts of your body

52
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,199
relaxing into your body

53
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,800
and then again lovingly gently

54
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:42,639
allow your breathing to return to normal without the need for any

55
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:49,120
clear idea of what normal is just allow your breathing to breathe

56
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,599
itself

57
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:08,080
and also continue this relaxing softening the face

58
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,840
softening the shoulders

59
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:31,840
releasing the belly

60
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:46,000
and somehow maybe even releasing all the holding the global holding of the body

61
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,319
holding it all together no need to in meditation

62
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,599
to relax release

63
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:06,720
releasing into this body to feel and sense

64
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:13,840
the immediacy of our lived life

65
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:27,840
the experience of sensations

66
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:41,839
and then kindly gently maybe even tenderly

67
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:50,640
and determinedly center yourself on the experience of

68
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,839
breathing

69
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:08,080
breathing is often taken as a sign of being alive

70
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,240
and the inconstant shifting changing sensations of breathing

71
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,080
sensations of breathing in are different than breathing out

72
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:28,880
sensations of breathing in disappear so that sensations of exhale can begin

73
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:37,839
and vice versa

74
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,519
regardless of how pleasant or unpleasant your breathing is

75
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:19,440
to feel it and experience it to center yourself in it

76
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:33,839
is to enter into the intimacy and of being really here with our lived life

77
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:32,959
and then as you're with your breathing and maybe that's mostly what you do

78
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:43,839
to feel the inconstancy of all the sensations that flow through that appear and disappear

79
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:51,120
and perhaps as you do so you relax and open all everything around

80
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:59,040
the breathing perhaps as they just get more and more

81
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:06,560
intimate there will be some experience that everything

82
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:13,440
is shifting changing arising disappearing

83
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,839
in the immediacy of how they are felt and experienced

84
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,839
if we recede into thoughts and ideas of things

85
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,600
we begin projecting ideas of constancy and

86
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:40,800
permanence but as a thinking mind gets quieter

87
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,519
we just feel and sense experience

88
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,320
breathing in and breathing out

89
00:12:51,519 --> 00:13:07,839
with all the inconstancy of things coming and going

90
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:36,080
the experience of thinking if we intimate with the actual

91
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,440
experience thoughts are also inconstant they come

92
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:50,320
and they go rather than being involved in thoughts

93
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,880
to settle further in and just see thoughts as

94
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,360
arising and passing coming and going

95
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:11,840
individual words or images that appear come and they go

96
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:21,039
in the intimacy of the moment everything

97
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:39,840
is part of a field of appearing and disappearing phenomenon

98
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,559
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

99
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,960
there's something about being at rest

100
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:09,600
in the middle of change settling back as if we're sitting in an

101
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:15,440
easy chair allowing everything to

102
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,720
move and change and peer and disappear

103
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:26,880
freely without us interfering with them

104
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:34,559
feeling safe and comfortable just letting the things everything come

105
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,158
and go everything

106
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:50,880
it can be uncomfortable to do this but it also can open up

107
00:27:50,880 --> 00:28:00,000
the barriers to feeling tender love and kindness

108
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:06,000
to feel compassion care

109
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:13,200
for this changing buzzing flowing world

110
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:21,440
because what that gets in the way of our love is something we're holding on to

111
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:27,679
something that we are that blocks or covers over

112
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:35,600
but when everything is buzzing and changing and but we're at rest with awareness

113
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:46,320
there can be a greater capacity for compassion for all this

114
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:59,840
to be still and gaze upon everything kindly

115
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,000
to be still in the middle of all the

116
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:18,320
change and to feel compassion for

117
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:23,360
the challenges that everyone has in this changing world

118
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:32,399
to feel the joy budita that because things change things also

119
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,600
get better for people

120
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:46,880
and because we're not holding on to anything there can be kindness

121
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:58,159
may all beings be free of suffering

122
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:09,679
may all beings celebrate

123
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,519
their capacity for freedom

124
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:25,679
may all beings live in a world of kindness and friendliness

125
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:37,840
may all beings be the kind and friendly ones

126
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:50,559
may all beings be peaceful

127
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:59,039
and may all beings contribute to the peacefulness of this world

128
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:09,600
may all beings be free and may all beings

129
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:19,840
support the freedom of others

130
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:28,399
may we all share in love and kindness and friendliness

131
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:35,279
in living this buzzing changing

132
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:47,840
impermanent life that we find ourselves in

133
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,919
so in this process of anapanasati

134
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:19,679
mindfulness of breathing in mindfulness of breathing out we've come to the core

135
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:25,360
heart of it the insight aspect of it

136
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:32,799
and and the purpose of insight is to liberate us to free us

137
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:41,120
and it involves a very clear centering ourselves in the core

138
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:46,399
dynamism core aspect of how this life is

139
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,080
and all the steps before in a sense are preparing us

140
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:57,840
and preparing us and i don't want to

141
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:03,039
i want to emphasize how important this preparation is

142
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:09,279
certainly preparation for what we're doing in the last steps but

143
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:16,480
what we're doing the last steps is also preparing ourselves or our willingness to meet this world as it

144
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:22,320
is the ability to really be in this suffering world

145
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:29,760
and to be prepared for that to have really developed the qualities of

146
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:37,919
attention and concentration and persistence and and and well-being and

147
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:44,000
purified ourselves got to work through some of the hindrances all the hindrances work through our

148
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,799
are the attitudes and the

149
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:55,919
places where where we kind of can you need to be healed

150
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:03,440
and and settled and this is a beautiful and

151
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:11,118
profound process and we need this for it to be available to be available to care for the suffering world

152
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:18,839
and so then we come to this 13th step where we're experiencing

153
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:25,919
um observing impermanence or in constancy

154
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:32,720
and this has um three different aspects that things are changing and inconstant one is there

155
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:38,720
is loss things disappear but also the very fact

156
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:44,879
that things change allows for new beginnings

157
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:52,878
the fall gives birth to the winter the winter bring gives birth to the spring things pass away in the fall die

158
00:34:52,879 --> 00:35:00,960
away and then get reborn in the spring and now we need this cycle is what we need

159
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:08,480
and so we live in a world of tremendous suffering and uh so much that we've experienced in

160
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:15,920
the news now for so long and you know the amount of hate that

161
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:22,480
gets expressed in violence and killing is astounding

162
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:28,079
and and it's been going on since the time of the buddha

163
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,359
and so how do we address this how do we meet this and so anapanasati is this beautiful

164
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:38,960
practice of profound practice maybe i shouldn't use beautiful in this context but

165
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:46,960
profound helpful and healing practice that just to stay the stay constant within

166
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:53,680
constancy of breathing the rhythm of breathing frees us from this the

167
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:58,720
contractions the resistance the fears the preoccupations the distractions of

168
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:04,240
the mind it allows something to uh be settled and and to be

169
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:09,920
come into kind of harmony and ease that allows for the self-healing

170
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:15,839
qualities of this human body and heart to operate it makes room for some of the

171
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:21,599
most beautiful qualities of who we are to surface and come forward

172
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:28,880
and so to really be able to dip into the inconstancy and the changing nature of it is to have a

173
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:35,040
direct confrontation with what's most difficult with human life but also with what's most

174
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:42,560
wonderful and healing in this human life as well and and because things have changed not

175
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:48,800
only is it filters loss and there's also the disappearing of things which are

176
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:55,440
not useful or that are that are painful and difficult suffering disappears as well and so part

177
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:03,040
of the inconstancy and the changing and permanent nature of all this is a rich rich world of so many things

178
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:10,160
that we enter into sometimes simultaneously where there is loss but with loss

179
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:15,359
there's also gain we or in the sense that we also lose our suffering at times

180
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:21,440
um and uh with the new arising of things appearing of things some things that

181
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:27,520
appear are not good but also there's possibility of good things and then the teachings of the

182
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:36,400
buddha to really see and feel and be in this current of change gives us some agency

183
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:42,960
to shape how we experience and how we are in this world and we certainly can't

184
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:49,119
change the world dramatically most of us but we can't change our immediate world we can't

185
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:54,400
change ourselves and the practice has a lot to do with

186
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:01,440
with understanding change and finding a way to harmonize

187
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:08,320
with it and work with it so that we cultivate ourselves we develop ourselves

188
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:15,119
to become better people so to prepare ourselves for this world so that we have resiliency we

189
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:21,359
have openheartedness we have non-clinging we have non-hostility

190
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:27,920
it's a it's a powerful thing to uh you know to work with

191
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:33,920
the changing nature of this world in the in vipassana practice we're working with that changing nature

192
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:39,280
of the world all the time but it's not all often emphasized but now on this thirteenth step of

193
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:44,800
anapanasati this is the part of the world that we're really working with this is the

194
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:51,760
we're entering into this flow and the change and um it's easy it may be easy to at

195
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:58,320
least for a teacher to say what i'm about to say but maybe much more difficult to do it and that is

196
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:04,960
that to really enter into this this part of what the buddha was emphasizing to really

197
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,880
to really observe in constancy means that we're no longer in the sway

198
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:17,680
or caught in or seeing the reality through the lens of our concepts and

199
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,720
ideas our stories uh and all the

200
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:30,240
those also are part of the inconstant world the changing world and and stories come and go they arise

201
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:37,119
and they pass there's all this change and flow and movement in the story making mind and the concept

202
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:42,320
concept making mind everything is flowing and changing and so

203
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:48,880
how do we really get to really get into that and really rest in it the buddha taught

204
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:55,920
that because it's liberating that's where freedom is found and it's a

205
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:03,040
the core insight of the buddhist teachings uh over and over again is to see in

206
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:08,319
constancy is to see change is to see

207
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:15,200
maybe we can say the word impermanence and um and uh it represented by

208
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:20,960
a number of things kind of the first person who was enlightened

209
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:28,400
after the buddha was hearing the buddhist teachings exclaimed kind of proclaimed his awakening with the

210
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:35,839
statement everything that has the nature to arise has the nature to pass away

211
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:42,400
everything that arises passes away the buddha explained that everything is

212
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:47,520
inconstant everything that is an experience

213
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:54,880
concepts might not be and the ancient greeks you know had a lot of

214
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:01,280
controversy debates about the nature of impermanence and change and constancy in this world it's a common topic for

215
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:08,400
philosophers and the famous philosopher plato wasn't that comfortable with that everything was changing and he

216
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,839
wanted to have something that was permanent and i believe a little bit i know about him that he settled on the said he has

217
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:20,160
platonic concepts there's ideas that are unchanging

218
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:26,720
but the ideas are not direct experience and the buddha over and over again was placing ourselves in direct experience

219
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:33,760
breathing with it being mindful of it feeling it and really entering into this

220
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:40,800
inconstant world to know it because that is the way to freedom so i

221
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,960
said the first person was enlightened said that everything has everything that has a nature to arise is

222
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:52,880
a nature of passing away there's something about that insight that was liberating

223
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:58,960
the when the buddha died the the final statement that

224
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:07,440
the first statement i believe one of the first statements someone said when he died it became kind of the funeral chant for buddhists

225
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:16,000
it also became it's said to be the the um the sayings or the afrom the saying

226
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,240
the the saying of the our heart saying of the fully enlightened one

227
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:28,160
and it goes to chant in pali it's anitcha what the song

228
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:42,240
all things are inconstant they have the nature of arising and passing away

229
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:49,599
those who see deeply into this truth experience happiness

230
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:56,319
so but the happiness not of you know being totally delighted and

231
00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:05,040
happy all the time but a deeper happiness or contentment or satisfaction or

232
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:10,400
intimacy or something that we are in touch with what is real

233
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:16,400
in this real world of ours so even if we this world is full of suffering which it

234
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:21,520
is and the violence against the asian americans likely and

235
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:26,640
the shootings and so many places in this country but most recently

236
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:31,920
in boulder is um

237
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:41,200
you can't say we're happy in the relationship to that but there can be a feeling of rightness

238
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:47,599
that yes if this happens in the world we want to be present for it we want to

239
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:55,920
know it we want to it's right to be aware of it even if it's painful

240
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:02,319
even if it's what touches some of the deepest strings in our hearts but to have the capacity that's if this

241
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:07,520
is what's happening yes let's be present for it let's breathe with it

242
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:14,960
and all the steps of anapanasati can be relevant for this feeling that pain but to feel the pain

243
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:20,560
is not the same as i feel suffering and this freedom of this practice the

244
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:28,240
rightness of this practice to feel this world be present to this world without suffering but willingly feeling

245
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:34,079
the pain of this world so that we can also have compassion for

246
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:41,680
it and care so we prepare ourselves for all that what this world has to offer

247
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:49,760
so that we can offer ourselves as someone who is loving compassionate caring

248
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:55,440
and that we live in this world in a way that supports the betterment of all beings

249
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:01,599
out everywhere may all beings everywhere

250
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:11,200
be free thank you
