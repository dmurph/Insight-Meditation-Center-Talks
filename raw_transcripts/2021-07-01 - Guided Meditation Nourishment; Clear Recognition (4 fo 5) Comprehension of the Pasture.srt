1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:08,559
so i wanted to express again my great appreciation of coming here and reading all the names and chats

2
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:14,799
that uh in the chats and some names that i recognized from long ago and some

3
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:20,240
i'm recognizing from here this uh since we started doing this on youtube

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,240
so so wonderful to be with you

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:34,399
so um one of the important things to be mindful of

6
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:41,679
is or to be aware of is that what we do with our attention

7
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,760
has a big impact on how we are conditioned the habits we build up the dispositions

8
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,520
that we kind of build and create the kind of conditioning that influences us

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,680
and one way to see that is that where we direct our attention has a big

10
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,680
impact on what we register and therefore are conditioned by influence by

11
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,560
so if we spend our precious attention and spend a lot of time focusing on negative thinking that's kind of

12
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,560
debilitating or critical or a lot of hostility or resentment a lot

13
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:25,040
of self-criticism a lot of greed that we're kind of being reinforcing

14
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,799
that tendency so kind of influencing us it's kind of like smoothing the channels inside of us for

15
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:37,759
doing those things making it kind of normal almost and uh so we're more predisposed to have

16
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,880
those thoughts in the future if we bring our attention to something

17
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,960
which is wholesome then that's what we're cultivating and being influenced by

18
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:56,640
and of course we don't want to have blinders on and ignore what's negative the difficulties we have

19
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,398
and the way we take care of this and mindfulness is

20
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,879
it's the vehicle through which we're aware of both the positive and the negative

21
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:15,200
and so rather than being focusing on what's negative and being involved using attention to be

22
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,239
involved in it we can know it um through one of the four

23
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:26,400
foundations of mindfulness we can know it as a physical phenomenon in the present

24
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:33,120
we can know it as being unpleasant or pleasant whatever it is in the present we can know the mind

25
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,319
state as being kind of contracted or distracted or the or the

26
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,440
mind state that's settled calm and open we can know whether

27
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,000
in being involved in that we are entangled in something or whether we're kind of spacious around

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,239
it and so we're not actually bringing not ignoring what's happening

29
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,280
but we are recognizing um

30
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:08,480
it but through something which is wholesome through something which is a nourishment and that is what i want

31
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,319
to emphasize today is whatever is happening whatever you're meditating on today

32
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:20,000
can you kind of look around to see how how to feel it how to be with it in the

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,680
present moment in a way that's nourishing that feels good that is freeing and opening so even if you're

34
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:34,239
involved with something negative something difficult and there is a way that you can kind of look around in your

35
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,519
body your mind your heart and find out how is it you can hold it in a way

36
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,560
that the very holding it is a positive influence on you

37
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,840
so that's the task for today so

38
00:03:50,879 --> 00:04:01,840
uh so if you can uh um assume your meditation posture

39
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,319
and part of it is to take some long slow deep breaths so that you can

40
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:15,519
see if you can find a way to settle into this body

41
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:22,000
a settled body is a way to

42
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:30,479
connect to what is wholesome nourishing nurturing

43
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,199
even if there are difficult things happening

44
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,840
taking a deep breath in and settling your heart

45
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:08,080
and then we'll sit there quietly relaxing settling in

46
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,880
and stay whatever is happening in the present moment can you find a way to breathe with it to

47
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:22,479
be aware of it to attend to it in a way that is

48
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,240
beneficial nourishing

49
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,440
through the body through the heart

50
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,840
through an awareness that is opening

51
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,400
breathing in and breathing out here and

52
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,840
now

53
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,839
foreign

54
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,920
you

55
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,920
you

56
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,840
you

57
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:53,120
and then as we come to the end of the sitting to take a few moments to appreciate

58
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:58,320
that one of the really important aspect of

59
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:05,440
mindfulness practice is not what you're aware of

60
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,840
but how you're aware of it

61
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,559
it makes a big difference if you're aware

62
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,840
driven by greed or hatred resentment

63
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:31,840
fear anxiety or if the awareness is infused with

64
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:39,440
non-greed non-hatred non-resentment non-anxiety

65
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,799
if the awareness itself

66
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:54,960
is pleasant is enjoyable is appreciated

67
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:04,640
he's receptive and open he is not straining is

68
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,679
at ease and peaceful

69
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:19,840
to be aware in an open

70
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:26,480
useful way and as we come to the end of this

71
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,760
sitting perhaps that can be our gift

72
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:39,520
to the people we encounter that we are aware of them we meet them

73
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,720
and know them and are present for them

74
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:53,278
in a way that is non-violent non-harming

75
00:24:53,840 --> 00:25:00,000
in a way that is not imposing or

76
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:07,400
pressuring or not anxious or

77
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:12,400
preoccupied or closed

78
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:19,120
perhaps with a support of our mindfulness practice

79
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:26,840
we can be aware of others in a way that is nourishing for

80
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,919
ourselves and therefore

81
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:42,640
friendly and receptive and kind appreciated by others

82
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:49,440
may the very way in which we perceive and sense feel are aware of

83
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,840
others

84
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:02,480
be beneficial to ourselves and to others

85
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:09,200
before we have to figure out what to say or what to do

86
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:15,600
just how we're aware can be our gift

87
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:25,840
at ease in ourselves at ease in the eyes that look and see

88
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:40,960
may we walk through the world with gift bestowing eyes with gift

89
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,240
bestowing awareness

90
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:53,919
and in so doing may we contribute to the happiness the safety

91
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:59,039
the peace and the freedom of others

92
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:10,080
may we not underestimate the tremendous value

93
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:22,240
of non-harming awareness that is really present for others

94
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:35,840
may all beings be happy

95
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:50,559
thank you so for today's um

96
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:59,679
talk on clear comprehension some pajama clear recognition i would like to um

97
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:07,840
i'm happy to talk about the third form of clear comprehension which is uh clear understanding clear

98
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,880
recognition of the pasture and uh pastoralistic

99
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:18,159
strange expression but it's uh this is my i think my favorite of the clear

100
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:25,159
comprehensions and um pasture refers it's a word is gotchara

101
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:31,840
g-o-c-a-r-a and poly go is the uh word hollywood for cow and

102
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:39,840
probably it's a cognate kind of indo european languages have the same source and charo is what

103
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:45,919
means like means where the coarse the cherry at the mandala chariot but the

104
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:51,840
the um the course the place the place the location the field

105
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:58,640
the place where the cows go to eat so pasture and

106
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:05,520
uh so it's what what what feeds us what nourishes us and um

107
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:12,799
and so uh to recognize in as we do our activities

108
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:18,559
what is the pasture where is the nourishment that can come from anything that we do

109
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:25,520
the um because everything we do in a sense is conditioning us everything we do

110
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:34,000
isn't is the nourishment for something so in specifically the pasture in

111
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,480
is the four foundations of mindfulness that the body is a pasture for we get

112
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:46,799
nourished and supported if we know how to bring attention to it the attention to the feeling tones of

113
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:53,360
experience to the mind states to the dhammas the mental activities that go on in the mind

114
00:29:53,360 --> 00:30:00,240
all these things are nourishment for ourselves but the way at their

115
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:06,320
nourishment is when we're aware of them in and of themselves the the body

116
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:13,200
in the body the feelings and the feelings the mind states in the mind states and the mental activities in the mental

117
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,559
activities and what this means is a kind of expression from the suttas

118
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:24,480
and what what this means is that we're aware through the vehicle through the through

119
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:30,960
the the channels of direct experience through these four means

120
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,480
not through the thinking the proliferation of thoughts the ruminations

121
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:43,279
the fantasies the complaining the anxiety-producing thoughts that might be

122
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:48,559
spinning around for us and those are not nourishing

123
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:54,880
and even if the thoughts are wholesome they might not be the place of the greatest nourishment

124
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:00,399
but to be aware of whatever is happening through the channel of the body

125
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:07,039
and to learn how to through the body feel things in a way that feels wholesome so it's

126
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:12,799
how we're aware that's important but we can discover that sometimes through the body

127
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:19,440
and the body becomes the pasture we can become aware of it through the feeling tones whether things are

128
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,880
pleasant or unpleasant and even unpleasant things there's a way of knowing it

129
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:31,919
a way of being present for it that oddly enough can be beneficial and nourishing

130
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:37,360
if you're aware of unpleasant thing is unpleasant and we're reacting to it and contracting

131
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:43,120
around it and angry with it or despairing around it then it's not nourishing

132
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:48,720
but if we go through it and just feel the unpleasantness the unpleasantness and unpleasantness

133
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:54,960
independent of our reactivity oddly enough that those unpleasant things begin

134
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:02,080
entering into the beneficial mode they it provides good good conditioning for us good food for

135
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:07,679
us in a certain kind of way because we're becoming free of it

136
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:13,120
and then um the um if we're aware of the mind state that's

137
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:18,799
present so it's all having to do with present moment awareness of the mind state

138
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:24,240
and that present moment as soon as we're aware and clearly recognize the present momentness

139
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:30,559
of the mind state that recognition is no longer caught up in the other pasture we can

140
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:37,360
walk in the pasture of you know as i said rumination

141
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:46,720
complaining judgments fear anxiety the thoughts that are spinning and pulling us around negative self-thinking

142
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:52,000
is very harmful and it isn't that we should just push it away or be aversive

143
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:59,679
to it the magic of mindfulness practice is that we recognize it that's there

144
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:06,080
but we don't feed there we don't let it influence us and one way to do that is

145
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:11,840
to know where the pasture is a clear comprehension of the pasture

146
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:18,880
of the good place to be uh to be aware through the body where feelings and feelings to be aware

147
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:25,600
without through the without the channel of these spinning thoughts that we might have

148
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:31,519
and at different times different pastures are the most beneficial sometimes the

149
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:37,840
best pasture is the think is the body and we just really aware and sense and feel through the

150
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:43,919
body sometimes the pasture best pastures recognizing the feeling tones

151
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:49,840
uh the pleasant unpleasantness and neutrality of the experience sometimes just be aware of the mind

152
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:57,120
state the attitude how the mind how awareness holds it and sometimes it's uh better to be aware

153
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:04,640
of the the uh the operating of the mind the attachments the clinging the freedom the

154
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,760
the different wonderful qualities of mind that are present

155
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:15,200
and so uh to have clear comprehension of the pasture

156
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:21,358
where we feed from and as i said for the buddha the best pasture is the

157
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:27,440
four foundations of mindfulness and then i'll repeat because it's so important

158
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:33,440
how we're aware is where the best nourishment comes and so if we

159
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:41,200
don't have to avoid paying attention to what's difficult but how are we aware of it is that is the point

160
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:46,839
and if we're aware of it through these four pastures it can be beneficial in nourishing the

161
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:54,638
awareness not the negative states of mind not the negative thinking it's how we're aware which is nourishing

162
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,760
but then it's a little different with um wholesome states beneficial states

163
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:05,119
then there's a kind of double benefit that how we're aware of them would also not

164
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:12,000
wear without greed or holding on or expectations but how we're aware of them

165
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:19,359
is uh is beneficial and they themselves make good food they themselves are good

166
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:24,480
conditioning so it's a way of not being conditioned by the negative

167
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:31,200
but to make room to be conditioned by the positive all in the service in the traditional

168
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:37,839
buddhist sense of developing greater and greater uh strength of mindfulness stability of

169
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:43,359
attention in the present moment on the way to becoming free

170
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:49,520
and if we can become free in how we see become free and how we're aware uh

171
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:57,040
our atta our attention to others can become a gift um people can trust us that when we're

172
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:03,920
present with them that we don't have agendas of our own that we're imposing on them

173
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:11,680
we're there to see to be present and and share as

174
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:20,240
common human experience of being alive in this in this challenging and wondrous world

175
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:27,040
so thank you very much and um and how we're aware of the challenges of

176
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:34,079
the youtube and sound that's the art of it not whether or not the

177
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:39,359
video is choppy or not but we'll see if we can get it fixed for

178
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:43,920
tomorrow thank you
