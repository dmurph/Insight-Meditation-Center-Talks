15
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:07,860
bought by Sangha members some years ago about 20 years ago maybe 15 something like that

16
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:15,360
because um the group that have been coming together they were renting a church room and over time they just there was enough

17
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,480
of them and they all donated to buy a space to make

25
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:13,260
Buddhist to practice here and mindfulness doesn't require uh

26
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:19,080
signing up for any particular beliefs actually it's a very uh

27
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,599

28

so any religious affiliation you have keep it if you wish

29
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:37,099
welcome bring it into your practice nothing needs to be left out

30
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:48,560
so just um the this class is in a three-week series

31
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,819
starting tonight it's an abbreviated version of the introduction to

32
00:03:53,819 --> 00:04:00,840
mindfulness meditation course usually it's a five-week course I'll be doing the five-week course in

33
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:07,019
January and then through the first week of February so if you want to come back for

34
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:12,959
more please do absolutely do normally we had have week one would be

35
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:19,760
breath and just breath week two so it's sequentially taught right breath body

36
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:25,320
emotions thoughts and then open awareness in daily life

37
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:33,000
is week five so we will skip that last week we'll combine breath and body tonight

38
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,460
and that will be the focus of you know what I'll provide instructions on is how

39
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:44,820
to be mindful of breath and body and um

40
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:49,220
let's see so

41
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,040
it would be helpful for me if you would be willing to share kind of what your

42
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:03,060
what you're hoping for what you think you're what you're expecting you know why you're here a few words because then

43
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:09,120
I'll I'll try and tune into those things and and speak to them if possible during

44
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,580
the class so there's a microphone right there if you somebody would pick it up

45
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,860
and turn it on so we record the sessions

46
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:25,758
and so it's really helpful to speak into their microphone

47
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:32,340
we're also streaming on YouTube so pretty much all anybody can see right now is me just so you know you're not

48
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:39,320
you don't have to be have your image recorded although that can happen if you're you know okay with it

49
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:45,720
you don't need to say your names if you don't want to on the recording so

50
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:51,620
but would you be willing to tell me a few words about why you're here tonight

51
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:59,340
I'm just curious about the Buddhist practice meditation just learning

52
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:05,580
um that's I guess this is my second or third time so okay just stop enjoying it

53
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:11,160
and uh trying to do some of the meditation throughout the day so what was that last

54
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,919
time they're trying just to do some meditation throughout the day trying to do meditation throughout the day great

55
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,580
okay

56
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:28,199
hi my name's uh Michael I wanted to take on a new uh task or uh I don't want to

57
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:33,900
use our challenge but learn something new and then I hear a lot about the benefits of mindfulness practice so

58
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:41,940
something I want to try and learn and incorporate great and also the stress reduction aspect of it okay beautiful

59
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:50,460
thank you Michael oh yeah I'm just here to learn too great

60
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:57,840
that's it mostly I want to learn how to control my

61
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,380
thoughts control my thoughts Health focus better

62
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,500
hi I would like to learn how to be in the present moment instead of thinking

63
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:16,100
about the future all the time or worrying about the future great

64
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:25,099
I'm here uh in support of uh friends and also to reinvigorate my own practice too

65
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:31,680
I learned about meditation through a mindfulness stress reduction class and I

66
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,960
really enjoyed the formal practice and need to learn how to connect with my

67
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:43,319
body more I end up having um a lot of emotions and crying whenever

68
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:50,360
I do any type of body meditation and so I want to explore that more okay great

69
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:56,699
um I'm I'm here to um probably just like continue my practice

70
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:03,720
and like continue I like doing it in person with other people just like makes it um

71
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:09,240
easier to do and like better for me so yeah

72
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:15,840
um yeah that and just like yeah continue to develop like inner skills and knowledge in the pursuit of becoming a

73
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:23,419
better person beautiful on YouTube

74
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:31,680
when on YouTube just to check the stream as well so let me respond a little bit to what

75
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:39,599
you've shared um so let's see stress reduction

76
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,959
body emotions and you said something

77
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:51,420
that I want being in the present yes yes yes

78
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:57,740
big one great so

79
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:04,440
oh you know what the fan way out there is thank you it's

80
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,959
really loud sorry um

81
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:18,079
so the Mind mindfulness is about bringing and learning how to bring our attention to the present moment

82
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:24,240
um that is very much what it is about and

83
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,880
and part of the way the class is taught in these sequential ways is because if

84
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:36,899
you think about how a movie is made it's all these frames put together super fast

85
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:42,360
and it's got soundtrack and it's got the lighting and then whatever enhancements

86
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,459
right all these different things are melded together to create one image our

87
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:53,519
brains operate very similarly and so what we've got is all of these

88
00:09:53,519 --> 00:10:01,800
facets of our experience and we'll just the name I'll just name the ones we teach right breath body emotions and

89
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:08,339
thoughts are all kind of merged together like a movie right normally we're not sort of

90
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:13,380
aware of all these things as distinct parts of our experience

91
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:19,860
but it is possible to tune in very intimately to these different strands of

92
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:27,860
experience to bring more awareness into each one not as this kind of um

93
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:35,040
movie-like experience part of what happens in the movie making in the mind is that the mind is drawing

94
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,320
on past experience and making assumptions and interpreting

95
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,500
our experience including you know memories or things we've read and so in

96
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:53,519
mindfulness we're trying to simplify and do less and less of that and get more close to sort of this very direct

97
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,860
experience in this moment

98
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:06,300
it's not um complicated but it's not easy to do right like it's it's it's pretty simple

99
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:11,519
what we're going to try and do but it's not very easy to do it does that make

100
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:17,760
sense did I say that right um because the mind wants to weave

101
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:23,700
it wants to weave all of this stuff together our beliefs with our experience our

102
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:30,360
reactions all of these things get piled together and can make us very reactive

103
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,640
in our lives instead of responsive in our lives

104
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:40,980
so the way it might help with stress reduction

105
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:46,920
there are there are types of meditation that are specifically for relaxation

106
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:54,320
mindfulness meditation can be relaxing but it isn't its goal

107
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:00,959
it's more like if you think about the Buddha's teachings the Buddha sort of wants us to pay attention to suffering

108
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:08,040
right and so this is vipassana based So teravada based mindfulness meditation

109
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:14,940
this is the origins from which John cabotzin created the mindfulness-based stress reproduction program so you don't

110
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:21,899
have to believe in the Buddha or the Buddhist teachings but what I teach will reflect what the Buddha taught right and

111
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:27,959
so the Buddha said to pay attention to suffering and the reason we want to is

112
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:34,740
because it's a clue it's a clue that says oh something's going on here that doesn't need to be

113
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:42,060
going on here that's causing more difficulty for us so when we meditate sometimes we notice

114
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:48,180
things that are distressing or the body carries memories and when we

115
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:55,079
tend to the body and we're aware of the body sometimes that means emotional men memories which surface

116
00:12:55,079 --> 00:13:03,899
so it's not that I'm not going to teach you practices that are going to Bliss you out right but as we learn as we

117
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:11,880
practice we learn to be more simple with our experience and then we learn to have less reactivity and more choice and those

118
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,759
things all lead to more ease more relaxation

119
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:26,760
in terms of crying when you sit down I'll just tell you probably for the first year that I meditated I probably

120
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:32,279
spent five minutes meditating a day and I cried almost every time and I couldn't

121
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:38,639
do much more than five minutes it's just keep practicing keep

122
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:45,360
practicing and then there are different things that I can talk to you about if you continue to have issues things

123
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,820
different there's these other kinds of practices that might you might need to

124
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:56,220
do that are more of the soothing and calming things to help you

125
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:03,720
start to be able to sit and be able to stay with your experience so but you are

126
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:09,839
not alone You Are Not Alone okay

127
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:16,560
another thing to say is whatever comes up in your meditation we're not trying to get rid of anything that's kind of

128
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:26,220
one of the philosophies it's more about learning how to be with so you said you

129
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:33,360
want to control your thinking my experience is more that I have control because I now re know how to respond to

130
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:40,440
my thinking as opposed to being able to turn on and off what thoughts come or

131
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:46,560
how quickly or any of that it's more like oh I can start to see thinking as

132
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:53,639
thinking not who I am not my choice not you know something that I get to will

133
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:59,820
but rather oh unskillful thoughts okay watch that no I don't want to follow

134
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:05,339
that you know and that um to me that's where the freedom comes

135
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:11,040
right that I think you're wanting yeah

136
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,199
was there anything that I didn't address that you all shared or any areas you'd

137
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:22,620
like me to be more clear about please please your questions are so welcome so if there's anything at all

138
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:28,440
don't hesitate no I did perfectly okay

139
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:35,399
well I'm glad all right okay all right so

140
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:40,500
um a few just a little few things direct

141
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:45,720
experience we're going for Direct

142
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:52,440
experience how do we have direct experience in this live life what ways

143
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,480
do we have direct experience your senses right

144
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:03,600
we can directly contact the moment through Sensations in our body

145
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:10,019
right through seeing through hearing

146
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:18,360
this is how this is how we help ourselves be clear about what is direct

147
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,519
because the mind is making movies and it's real easy to fall into the

148
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,680
movies and not be with direct experience yeah

149
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:36,120
now this doesn't mean that um it doesn't mean that there's anything wrong with concentration practices that

150
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,699
you know maybe where we have these you know we Retreat to certain States in our

151
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:49,380
minds that are wonderful it's we're not I'm not there's I'm not being critical in any way about that it's wonderful

152
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:56,820
but the mindfulness based like meditation practice is very much about Here and Now Here and Now direct

153
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:03,240
experience and it's helpful to think about wanting to

154
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:08,938
learn this because it does help you have choice

155
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:14,520
it helps you have choice about where you direct your attention your attention is

156
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:22,438
your life force it's your everything what you pay attention to is the most precious you

157
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:28,740
know thing is what do we want to give our attention to or awareness to

158
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:33,919
shoot um

159
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:41,120
okay so let's do a little exercise together

160
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:47,360
let me just reconnect here my computer just shut down

161
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,820
I need to make sure I have my notes in front of me

162
00:17:54,299 --> 00:18:00,360
okay it's coming up here so

163
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:07,740
first of all let's bring our awareness so where we direct our attention

164
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:16,620
into our feet so we're gonna just as bring as much of

165
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:21,919
our awareness into our experience of our feet as possible

166
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,140
so you might notice things like pressure

167
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,880
you might notice how different it feels where your foot is in contact with

168
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,740
something versus where it is not

169
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:48,380
you might be able to feel warmth or coolness

170
00:18:54,539 --> 00:19:01,679
can you feel where your toes touch each other or between the toes can you feel

171
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,940
into those spaces

172
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:21,240
can you feel where your toenails are and if you can't sense this you can just

173
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,760
kind of hold your mind your awareness where that area would be

174
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:32,820
right it's just it's okay if you can't feel a lot this directing your awareness towards

175
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:40,440
your feet noticing any tingling pulsing

176
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:52,080
maybe you know spending 10 more seconds here

177
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:58,500
really feeling your feet just as simply as you can without a lot of narrative

178
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:06,539
we're not judging our feet we're just trying to sense into them the

179
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:10,340
direct experience of the feet here

180
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:23,100
all right and with the next exhale letting go of the feet and let's

181
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:29,220
move our awareness up our body and into

182
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:36,720
our head and maybe just start by feeling all of

183
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:45,080
the head as much as you can sort of like oh this whole round orb thing here

184
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:53,100
and then maybe shifting toward feeling like the back of the head

185
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:57,919
where the head and the spine connect

186
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,299
maybe feeling the ears

187
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,400
in the top of the head

188
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:32,580
and the temples forehead

189
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:38,039
and just notice there's usually some tension in this area and just seeing if you can feel

190
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:44,880
oh what happens can I soften my eyes

191
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:51,299
my forehead at all just feeling into that

192
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:58,620
and if not no problem maybe feeling

193
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,900
the cheeks eyes

194
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:13,220
the jaw lips

195
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,539
noticing how the tongue is even

196
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:35,539
noticing the tingling the air the feeling of hair

197
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:43,039
Can You Feel the air on the ears

198
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,700
and then with the next inhale and exhale Letting Go the

199
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,500
directed awareness to the Head

200
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:04,679
and then let's bring our hands together and then what's commonly called The

201
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:13,020
Prayer posture and feel you know where the hands meet

202
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:19,080
each other versus the backs of the hands where

203
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:24,139
they're not touching Can You Feel the difference there

204
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:30,260
pressure sensing pulsing

205
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:41,899
is it possible to feel the right hand being touched by the left

206
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:50,580
or the left hand touching the right or being touched by the right

207
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:57,260
can you shift your awareness from one hand to the other

208
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:20,880
and is it possible to be aware of the area between the palms of the hands

209
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:28,020
where there is a gap space is it possible to feel and be aware of

210
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,320
that

211
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:53,419
and taking one more breath being aware of the hands

212
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:58,640
and with the exhale allowing your hands to rest

213
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:06,179
and so what happened to your feet when you were

214
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:13,320
paying attention to your hands were you aware of your feet in the same

215
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:18,900
way no but your feet didn't go anywhere did

216
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:25,860
they right and what about you know were you even

217
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:30,980
aware of your hands when you were directing your attention to your head

218
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:39,059
not really right so they don't go away

219
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:45,320
but we're choosing where to direct our attention what to attend to and we're

220
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:52,440
choosing to bring more and more of that into focus and as that happens we're

221
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:59,820
less aware of other things this is a really powerful thing

222
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:07,080
to be able to choose where you give your attention because what you pay attention to

223
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:14,039
affects you deeply and how you pay attention affects you as

224
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:20,240
well it's a little bit more complicated but it is also true

225
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:29,779
so we're going to look more now we're going to move into being aware of breathing

226
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:37,740
kind of in the same way that we just did we're moving our awareness around but now we'll choose to focus on the breath

227
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:43,260
as this doesn't mean just like your feet didn't disappear

228
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:48,299
when you weren't attending to them and you weren't aware of them it doesn't mean that

229
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:53,580
these other aspects of our life don't still happen

230
00:26:53,580 --> 00:27:00,539
like thinking like emotions like Body Sensations

231
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:07,380
we don't have to try and get rid of any of those things it's not necessary

232
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:16,140
we can just tune in more more finely more closely to particular parts of our experience

233
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:21,240
and the reason this is very very helpful is in that untangling

234
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:28,200
it's also helpful in getting to know really have this experience of getting more intimate with different aspects

235
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,399
of our direct experience

236
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:40,080
so before we I start full instructions on breath let's just do a three breath

237
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:46,200
Journey just we're gonna like okay we're gonna

238
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:53,820
be in a meditation posture or not and we're gonna see if we can follow

239
00:27:53,820 --> 00:28:01,140
intimately three breaths in a row and you might even watch to see if you

240
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:07,260
can't once you finish an exhale can you feel even before you start to breathe in

241
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:13,260
that pull the pull in the body for the inhale

242
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:19,500
and stay with that whole range so you've got that pull and inhale

243
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:26,279
and then what happens at the top of the inhale and is there a pause or is the quickly

244
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:34,140
moving to the exhale and then we're back to the beginning again the end of the exhale

245
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:40,580
and then feeling that oh there's the catch the breath that comes in

246
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:47,700
just feeling the full range like riding a wave sort of like you're on a

247
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:54,659
surfboard but the you're just staying close and connected to that flow of the breath and

248
00:28:54,659 --> 00:29:00,480
see if you can do three breaths in a row without losing contact if you can great

249
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:06,480
if you can't great it's all okay so whenever you're ready

250
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,179
just follow three breaths in a row

251
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:54,539
and whenever you're finished with your three breath turning just open your eyes so I know

252
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:57,679
where we're at

253
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:08,179
what did you notice anybody willing to share anything

254
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:17,960
we have the mic right there if you don't mind picking it up and just seeing if it's under your paper yeah

255
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:25,679
anybody willing to say anything that they noticed great

256
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:32,520
Michael right I I noticed certain like Body Sensations

257
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:41,299
like a tingling wanted to scratch my ear or or you know move my knee or something like that great and so um

258
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:46,620
that's you know great those are direct experiences that's in the body and were

259
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:53,760
you aware of the breath as those things were happening yes I almost took the sensations as like

260
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:59,279
kind of interference or sort of uh taking my attention elsewhere yeah and

261
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:05,600
so um one thing to think about because that's this is going to happen in your meditations

262
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:12,480
thoughts Sensations and it can feel like interference especially when we're being directed to pay attention to one

263
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:18,360
particular part of our experience so one way to play with that is

264
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:27,419
um one remember we don't have to get rid of the other experiences they can be included so that's really important

265
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:35,960
two is there's this idea of foreground and background so you can play with this idea of okay

266
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:43,440
that's the itching is there the itching is there maybe it's really strong but just can I still just stay with a breath

267
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:51,600
can I keep my connection with the breath as this is happening and then at some point the breath can

268
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:57,480
come back into the foreground again right and so just it's and another way

269
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:04,200
to put it is see if you can't preference the breathing like oh yeah these things are happening

270
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:10,380
and let me just invite the mind to put a preference on being connected to the

271
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:15,720
breath is that helpful great anybody else

272
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:22,100
have anything that they notice that they would be willing to share looks like you might

273
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:34,020
I noticed just the innateness of breath like it wasn't that I was telling myself

274
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:40,440
to breathe and um beautiful so breathing happens the body

275
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,398
knows how to breathe

276
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:51,899
we don't have to make it happen yeah and that's a really good thing to

277
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:58,320
recognize yeah that we can just trust the body to breathe and we we can just be aware of

278
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:03,539
however we're breathing because sometimes I'll find myself you know it's like

279
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:09,600
almost like I feel like there's hunger for the next inhale right there's

280
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:16,380
just this pulling and movement toward trying to get more air and sometimes there's these

281
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:23,220
long pauses between an inhale and an exhale and I don't have to control it I can just

282
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:30,779
know how the body is breathing in this moment and be as you know comfortable or as at

283
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:35,880
ease as I can with it so one other thing that can help before

284
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:41,700
we start is um we'll take a we'll try and take a formal

285
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:46,740
posture here now in this next part and part of that is let's lift up our

286
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:53,580
shoulders toward our ears really kind of squeeze it in tight and then roll the elbows

287
00:33:53,580 --> 00:34:01,799
back toward each other behind your back or they're behind the chair and then push the arms the elbows down

288
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:07,559
oh and you might just have an instant deeper breath and then just allow your

289
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:13,980
arms to relax resting your hands Palm up or Palm down

290
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:20,520
or Palm on Palm finding what feels comfortable I need a pillow in my lap

291
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:26,820
for my arms not to feel like they're like pulling on my shoulders right so

292
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:34,138
finding that posture that works for you but like letting the arms rest in a comfortable position that isn't pulling

293
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:40,138
on your shoulders and then it is helpful to have the feet

294
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:44,118
flat on the floor if you're sitting

295
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:51,658
and feeling a sense of uplift in the spine

296
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:57,180
so letting the head reach up toward the ceiling right just letting the spine

297
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:02,460
lift up and letting the muscles hang from the bones

298
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:08,839
letting the belly poof out we don't need to hold our bellies in for meditation

299
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:14,579
and let's take three longer deeper breaths just conscious inviting some

300
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:22,260
deeper breaths to get started as we begin to focus inviting our mind

301
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:26,660
tune in to the experience of breathing

302
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:43,859
so we're being naturalists we're scientists here compassionate scientists

303
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:49,460
we're just going to be curious about this experience

304
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:55,800
it doesn't need to be a particular thing her way

305
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:03,680
rather just kind of developing that sense of awareness of observing

306
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:12,540
and we're inviting the mind to be with the breath sometimes I feel like I need to invite

307
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:19,099
my mind mind can you please attend to breathing right now

308
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:24,960
can you may the mind make breath the primary

309
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:32,420
object of awareness the focus of my awareness best I can

310
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:38,000
so we're not muscling our way here

311
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:45,920
we're inviting invoking and tending

312
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:53,900
I'm just noticing this breath this one right here

313
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:14,838
giving ourselves permission to Value being aware of breathing

314
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:21,000
that we don't have to be thinking and creating stories and planning for later

315
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:29,300
but what's it like to just give ourselves permission

316
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:37,020
to have our only job right now to be to just experience

317
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:45,800
receive the breath however the breath is showing up

318
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:59,700
we don't need to evaluate the breathing judge it

319
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:04,220
just tuning into the sensations

320
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:19,880
we might notice the nose

321
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:27,960
and how it's impacted by the breath like warmth or coolness

322
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:33,838
the feeling of the breath pulling in versus exhale

323
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:45,020
the feeling at the tip of the nose under the nose versus in the nostrils

324
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:16,520
and we can notice the throat the back of the sinuses

325
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:21,980
which flows into the chest

326
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:38,720
and there's the front of the chest and then there's the back and the sides

327
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:45,920
can you feel them as you breathe

328
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:58,880
in the stomach

329
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:15,480
Can You Feel The Belly Button expand with the inhale and then move toward the spine with the

330
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,960
exhale

331
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:55,440
and maybe really noticing the difference between how it feels

332
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,540
to breathe in in all of these areas versus breathing

333
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:07,338
out what can you notice about that

334
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:53,339
remembering the mind will wander thoughts will happen it just will happen

335
00:41:53,339 --> 00:42:00,440
it's all okay it's all part of our normal experience

336
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:06,720
just seeing if you can't still stay in touch with

337
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:14,180
the experience of the breath nothing needs to be a problem

338
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:50,820
another way to attend to breathing is to notice the beginning there's sort of three

339
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:57,839
phrases the beginning the middle and the ending and just sort of seeing what happens if

340
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:05,160
you hold that framework in mind as you attend to breathing

341
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:13,140
Happening Here and Now in this body in this moment in this room with this people never

342
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:18,920
happened before will never happen again this breath

343
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:23,119
only happened one time this way

344
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:16,640
maybe considering this intimacy

345
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,539
this intimacy with the breathing and the body

346
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:39,720
and as you're attending notice where it's the easiest for you

347
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:45,180
to be with the breath part of your breath what part of your

348
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:52,880
body and just let yourself rest in that area

349
00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:58,980
like right now you can hear the sound of the train

350
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:02,900
and stay Tethered to the breathing

351
00:47:05,819 --> 00:47:14,780
feel a sensation or have a thought and just letting the breath move right through it

352
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:27,260
we have about one minute left

353
00:49:28,859 --> 00:49:36,240
this minute just see what you can notice how can you witness about your breathing

354
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:42,319
in this minute something you can share with the group

355
00:49:44,339 --> 00:49:48,920
and I'll ring the bell at the end of the sitting

356
00:50:23,099 --> 00:50:25,819
foreign

357
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:42,740
so congratulations sitting still

358
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:51,180
doing your best to pay attention to breathing how was it for you what did you notice

359
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:57,240
what can you share with the group it's a really is a gift to each other to

360
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:02,760
share what you've recognized or what your struggles were so

361
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,540
do you mind

362
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:15,599
um I guess I can go I haven't really thought of anything to say yet actually if anyone else wants to go first okay

363
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:18,559
thank you

364
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:27,300
hi I well I was concentrate in the breathing I had a lot of physical

365
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:34,920
Sensations more than thoughts my right neck and shoulder hurt

366
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:40,859
um kind of like the mouse and and then I started noticing my heart and the heart

367
00:51:40,859 --> 00:51:47,760
beating and I felt like I was rocking with the heart beating but I don't know if that's

368
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:54,540
a sensation or life was really doing it yeah yeah like it was more than sad he

369
00:51:54,540 --> 00:52:00,240
was more like the body kind of yeah being aware of different areas yeah yeah

370
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:04,160
yeah thank you

371
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:11,240
you can just maybe hand the mic and see if anybody will speak into it

372
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:17,400
hmm uh yeah I think I pretty much noticed um that I was in uh that I'm carrying

373
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:23,579
like a lot of pain and tension and stuff so that was kind of distracting but yeah yeah so you noticed a lot of tension

374
00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:29,819
yeah yeah and that was distracting so it was was it the tension maybe was

375
00:52:29,819 --> 00:52:37,200
uncomfortable or is it painful or um yeah so the pain can really draw our

376
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:42,960
attention to it it's really can be strong right yeah yeah

377
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:48,059
did you try that kind of idea of breathing through it or letting it be in

378
00:52:48,059 --> 00:52:53,819
the foreground background yeah um I I was just kind of with it yeah

379
00:52:53,819 --> 00:53:01,020
okay anybody else have anything to share about your what you noticed I have more

380
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:09,420
like a question sure is the purpose of uh I guess just putting all air into my

381
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:14,520
lungs I mean like having a full Breeze or just a normal blinkers yep just

382
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:20,700
normal the more I was trying to kind of get the full breed just to no only we do

383
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:27,599
the I invite the full breath in the beginning just a few breaths just to help reset

384
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:34,020
um what tends to happen is that as we're driving we're phoning you know or

385
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:39,780
stressing our breath starts to get really short and small right

386
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:45,079
um and so it just can be helpful to open up the lungs and take some

387
00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:50,579
deeper breaths to reset and just let the nervous system then take over and we

388
00:53:50,579 --> 00:53:55,940
breathe the way we breathe it's all good yes thank you

389
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:04,800
anything else any other questions about this and experiences anyone would like to share

390
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:13,338
yeah great let's bring the mic back over here thank you thank you

391
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:23,280
um nothing big but I it was pretty antsy you were antsy and you were aware of it

392
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:28,920
great yeah I like opened my eyes a few times

393
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:34,319
um it was nice to be here with that though because usually if I

394
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:40,859
am trying and then I get antsy I'll just stop you know ah but being

395
00:54:40,859 --> 00:54:46,980
here it's like oh man see but like I can't like stop really you know

396
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:51,440
so I kind of would just be antsy and then like

397
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:59,400
eventually I was a little more calm nice so you didn't have to get up and do

398
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:05,160
anything you could be with it and it still changed on its own yeah

399
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:11,400
that's a nice experience yeah thank you for sharing that and you

400
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:16,500
know there's no small thing to share or no big thing it's all great right it's

401
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:22,740
all beautiful to share your experience yeah all right so the tears did come

402
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:28,800
um it's not sadness it's more like what happens when I let my guard down yeah

403
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:34,859
yeah yeah yeah yes boy you know um I just love what you just said about

404
00:55:34,859 --> 00:55:41,960
that feeling of letting your guard down it's a lot of work to keep our guard up right and so sometimes

405
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:48,000
letting our guard down we're gonna just have that kind of experience and if

406
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,099
you've had to keep your guard up a lot you know it means that you're letting

407
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:59,700
some of that you know stuff out and you'll cry for as long as you cry

408
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:04,800
you know until you're done you know and and I'll tell you another

409
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:13,079
story about crying I was on a I went on a residential Retreat right and um it

410
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:19,440
was a week-long retreat and you know when you go on these Retreats you get your seats and you kind of stay in those

411
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:25,140
seats so you're sitting next to your neighbors right and um so you're by this person these people

412
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:32,280
for the whole Retreat most of the time sometimes people move but and I happen to get uh you know you when

413
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:38,880
you're going Retreat you also meet with teachers and right now mostly you do group discussions sometimes you do

414
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:44,220
individual so I happen to get in a group with someone who was sitting near me

415
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:49,559
on this Retreat where I was crying almost every time I sat down to meditate

416
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:56,760
this woman was so annoyed that I said why can't you stop crying

417
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:04,260
you know she was really bugged by having to sit by me crying but you know what can I do right what can we do we cry

418
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:10,079
because we've got tears and a poor woman had to endure it I suppose she could

419
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:17,400
have moved maybe she did at the end I don't remember but you know then she got to practice with her irritation I had to practice in

420
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:23,700
my tears and she had to practice with her irritation so I know

421
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:30,540
friends great perspective yeah Richard you got a question from the YouTube yeah

422
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:37,079
I have one from great Kelsey um I find myself focusing on the breath

423
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:43,319
with a kind of rigorous intensity any tips for transitioning to an

424
00:57:43,319 --> 00:57:48,619
approach of curiosity rather than intensity

425
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:57,380
the words so I would just invite you to trust what you know here which is

426
00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:04,319
curiosity what does it feel like when we're curious you know what is it like I like that

427
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:12,900
word I said it earlier but the naturalist somebody who goes out into nature to observe the wildlife

428
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:19,920
to just sit there and take notes you know they're not supposed to interact with the little rabbits and the

429
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:25,380
butterflies but they're there to watch and be curious and and just see what

430
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:31,260
happens and um so number one just yeah feel into

431
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:36,960
what curiosity feels like and sometimes for me what do you think about who who

432
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:41,480
who do you think of when you think of curiosity

433
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:50,520
a kid right I'm I think kids are such great role models for curiosity

434
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:57,720
so um do you have any children in your life Kelsey you know and if not I bet you can

435
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:06,780
think of some or memories or being a child and that feeling of uh Wonder or interest or being

436
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:12,599
mesmerized right and and this is that word too I used intimacy or there's a

437
00:59:12,599 --> 00:59:18,180
way that we can start to fall in love with just wow what's happening you know

438
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:25,260
that just being with it like is so sweet just letting it unfold in this way where

439
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:32,940
we're not trying to control things and make them happen and you know when we sit down we are putting

440
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:38,640
effort we have to decide to come to meditate we have to set ourselves up

441
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:45,119
with our equipment and our timers and you know and and helping our minds

442
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:51,720
Orient to what we're doing setting these intentions taking these deeper breaths and that

443
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:58,260
that does take effort and then a lot of the work is once we

444
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:03,799
get established is to start to relax

445
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:10,260
and to start to kind of sit back a little bit even so notice your posture

446
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:17,099
you know are you leaning forward right if you are try and sit up and even

447
01:00:17,099 --> 01:00:23,119
sit back a little there's something also right there about

448
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:28,319
sitting back right it's more of that kind of relaxed

449
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:35,040
or receptiveness so look at your posture how can you help

450
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:41,880
yourself be maybe more comfortable but still upright Kelsey I'm still talking to you so feel

451
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:47,760
free to add more things in the chat if I'm not addressing you know something for you here

452
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:55,020
but um helping the body relax helping the Mind relax

453
01:00:55,020 --> 01:01:01,319
giving yourself permission and even just the invitation well what

454
01:01:01,319 --> 01:01:10,380
if I try 10 percent less hard right now what if I try a little try to try less

455
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:18,059
you know what's that like to give a little bit less effort because we we really can we need a lot of effort to

456
01:01:18,059 --> 01:01:23,520
get going you know unless we've got some continuity and a regular practice

457
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:28,619
and then we might need to learn how to let go how to back off on that effort because

458
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:35,720
we do we get in our own way we get in our own way by trying too hard yeah

459
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:42,079
so anything in there from Kelsey at this point or

460
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:47,660
great okay all right

461
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:57,540
so um any other questions before we

462
01:01:57,540 --> 01:02:00,619
thank you

463
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:13,859
enjoyment it helps a lot yes yes

464
01:02:13,859 --> 01:02:21,359
yeah Perfection is not helpful no and trying

465
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:26,579
to have the perfect meditation that's a that's a recipe for disaster so that's

466
01:02:26,579 --> 01:02:33,000
also like you know this idea that um I talked about is we don't have to get

467
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:39,420
rid of anything we don't need to have a particular kind of experience you know it doesn't have to be Blissful

468
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:45,359
if we can just be with our experience without running out of the room

469
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:51,240
you know that's a success that's that's being mindful

470
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:57,900
it's good practice all right so the another thing I just want to say is that um

471
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:06,359
the breath is typically used as an often word that we use is anchor for our

472
01:03:06,359 --> 01:03:13,799
attention sort of it's um like if you think about a boat when you come in you know and

473
01:03:13,799 --> 01:03:21,480
you're gonna be near the shore you need to drop an anchor so the boat won't drift out to sea or get pushed up onto

474
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:27,780
the shore we're kind of like that boat and the waves are a little bit like our

475
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:35,280
thoughts and emotions sometimes our pain it can really you know carry us out to

476
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:42,059
sea and we are lost and we don't even know where we are anymore so with meditation it's helpful to have

477
01:03:42,059 --> 01:03:48,540
something that we're using as a thread an anchor a tether

478
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:54,240
something that helps us stay connected to here and now because as you notice

479
01:03:54,240 --> 01:04:02,520
I'm sure your mind can really transport you to other places right other dimensions

480
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:09,299
so if the breath is something that can work for you to have be sort of like this

481
01:04:09,299 --> 01:04:16,740
grounding connecting reminding bringing you back here here here it's it's really

482
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:23,220
helpful the nice thing about the breath in this way is it's always moving it's it's

483
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:30,660
changing it's much easier to stay connected to something that's changing than to something that's static and not

484
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:36,180
moving not changing so the breath is dynamic it's felt in so

485
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:42,540
many different ways and places you know that it is the preferred anchor but it sometimes

486
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:47,819
doesn't work for people and that's okay it's not a problem

487
01:04:47,819 --> 01:04:53,160
you can alternately use something like the feeling of the feet

488
01:04:53,160 --> 01:05:01,859
on the floor something that's very neutral for you so if there's a part of your body that isn't connected to a lot

489
01:05:01,859 --> 01:05:07,920
of pain if you have chronic pain or trauma or whatever you just you choose

490
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:13,680
that as a nice anchor the other option is listening sound meditation receiving

491
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:19,380
sounds it's a very receptive thing but you know sounds sometimes is quiet and they come

492
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:26,700
and go but um sometimes I'll do a combination of breath and sound or breath and body

493
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:32,579
so you play with it but what you want is is to create a connection

494
01:05:32,579 --> 01:05:38,339
you really do grow a relationship with your anchor

495
01:05:38,339 --> 01:05:44,040
your tether your support line to being here in the moment

496
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:50,040
so for me over time that the feeling of breathing start to like just when I'm walking

497
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:55,500
places the breaths just starts to become really dominant in my experience feeling

498
01:05:55,500 --> 01:06:02,420
in my chest it helps me stay in the present moment so

499
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:11,460
um the invitation unless it's really triggering for you or boring for you is to find the breath as

500
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:17,760
your anchor and if not choose one of the other things I offered and that's what you want to kind of this over this

501
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:24,240
three-week period right really see if you can't make friends

502
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:29,819
get close to be intimate with be curious about have this be like if you're a

503
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:35,579
naturalist and you're going out and you're studying particular butterfly well instead of the

504
01:06:35,579 --> 01:06:44,400
butterfly it's the breath or it's the the sensation in your foot or it's the sounds right and just really start to

505
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:52,640
connect notice how it's there all the time available to you anywhere you are no matter what's going on

506
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:57,900
any questions about that the idea of an anchor or a tether

507
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:05,299
any questions about using alternative things to the breath okay

508
01:07:05,339 --> 01:07:13,140
all right so now what we'll shift to is in normally so just to remind you normally all we would do tonight is the

509
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:19,859
breath that's all we would take our time with is just practicing again with breathing talking more about being aware

510
01:07:19,859 --> 01:07:25,920
of breathing and then you'd spend a week so the invitation would be for you to go home

511
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:32,099
and spend a week practicing and so normally you'd have a week with just practicing breath but we're combining it

512
01:07:32,099 --> 01:07:38,099
with body that actually works really well together it's not a problem so

513
01:07:38,099 --> 01:07:43,920
um but I just want to kind of give you you know a contrast that we're going to be adding already

514
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:51,599
the body and you've already been doing that I invited you to and so we're just going to expand that a little bit more

515
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:58,319
and you know the body we need our body it's it's what is the body's always in

516
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:05,299
the present moment so you don't have to be Buddhist to be here but you do need a body

517
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:11,420
so and we need the body it's such a huge part of meditation I cannot even

518
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:19,920
emphasize it enough it is so much a part of mindfulness really you just you you really need your

519
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:26,758
body to be mindful it's the gateway to the present moment it is always in the present moment

520
01:08:26,759 --> 01:08:33,298
Sensations happen right here and right now right here and right now

521
01:08:33,299 --> 01:08:39,420
the Mind does not play by those rules but the body does

522
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:48,139
so it's your friend it's your friend if you want to be present and embodied in your life

523
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:55,199
um the other thing is the sensations by themselves you know they're just

524
01:08:55,199 --> 01:09:01,798
experience the mind will comment on them but we don't need the commentary we

525
01:09:01,799 --> 01:09:08,758
don't need the judgments they're not really relevant that's just the mind adding to experience

526
01:09:08,759 --> 01:09:16,380
so we're always trying to just preference just the direct feeling of pulsing

527
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:22,080
itching pressure even pain if we can just try

528
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:28,440
and be with it as simply a sensation that's changing moving and don't forget

529
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:34,020
to notice that it ends it comes and goes so if we're having

530
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:41,219
pain recognize when it passes away this is very helpful for the Mind very

531
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:46,679
helpful when we start to label it and start to

532
01:09:46,679 --> 01:09:53,219
um like oh my God what's wrong with me I'm gonna have to have surgery or you

533
01:09:53,219 --> 01:10:00,540
know we're gonna really work ourselves up and it actually will amplify the pain it

534
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:06,120
will make the pain much bigger so trying to be with it direct with that

535
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:12,780
direct simple way of knowing like this this this real simplicity

536
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:20,640
and um you know the body isn't thinking or ruminating that's not what it does

537
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:26,699
so it's a relief to start to get into that just being with this natural like

538
01:10:26,699 --> 01:10:33,120
way of just sensing life it's a very pure kind of sweet way of

539
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:40,440
being the body communicates it carries a lot of actually wisdom and it carries

540
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:47,300
history and emotions and and it communicates through Sensations

541
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:52,920
and the way that we listen to the body is to feel

542
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:58,020
to feel not interpret and judge but to

543
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:04,080
actually just receive the felt sense and then the body feels heard

544
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:09,239
right it's pretty remarkable so

545
01:11:09,239 --> 01:11:15,860
yeah what else do I want to say

546
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:22,560
Body Sensations can be so you know it can be helpful to have a very simple

547
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:29,640
way of noting the kind of Sensations you're having um like Pleasant unpleasant and neutral

548
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:36,540
so then we don't get into a lot of like I don't know graphic words or just you

549
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:42,780
know analysis just oh this is unpleasant this is unpleasant just as simply as we

550
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:49,800
can oh this is Pleasant oh this is this is neutral you know just sort of having

551
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:56,460
this very simple way of tracking Sensations can be helpful it's a way to

552
01:11:56,460 --> 01:12:00,260
hold it um

553
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:07,920
um so I've I've talked about commentary so now I'll share a story that Gil

554
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:14,040
franstall tells um and I won't even tell it the way he

555
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:20,280
does I'll just say have you ever like watched a TV show or a sports game

556
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:27,600
right with the sound off it's a whole different experience yeah

557
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:34,560
it's not nearly as exciting you know and it's also you know much

558
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:40,560
easier to tune out of and you know sort of lose track of what's going on the way

559
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:47,040
the commentators you know tell Sports it is to keep us engaged to focus excite

560
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:55,080
you know like but it it really adds a lot of tension and stress so if we were

561
01:12:55,080 --> 01:13:02,340
just sitting back and watching the game without all of that it's like more of this movement this dance this

562
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:08,280
choreography right it's it's um it doesn't have to be so dramatic what

563
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:13,620
makes it dramatic is a lot of it is this narration

564
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:19,920
so our minds tend to narrate our experience in the same way internally

565
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:25,080
when we're practicing if the mind is left to its own devices it will become

566
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:31,440
the narrator and it can make your experience much more intense much more

567
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:38,760
difficult um or add all kinds of stuff that really isn't needed

568
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:46,199
so narrating if I'm crying might be you need to stop you what's wrong with you

569
01:13:46,199 --> 01:13:52,920
you know um you're bugging that Neighbor Next to You who's now I'm not happy about her

570
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:58,739
Retreat because you can't stop crying I'm adding so much difficulty to my

571
01:13:58,739 --> 01:14:06,659
experience when I start to talk to myself that way it's the invitation is just like

572
01:14:06,659 --> 01:14:13,800
whatever let me just be simply with my experience the mind can offer these thoughts it's

573
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:18,960
okay I don't have to try and shut the Mind down I won't be able to anyway

574
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:24,540
but I can just be like turning the volume down

575
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:32,040
yeah all right so we're almost out of time so we'll just do a short practice and then I'll create a little bit of

576
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:38,880
time for any other questions before we end tonight okay so are you ready for another period of

577
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:45,659
meditation great however you want to set yourself up whatever posture you want to find

578
01:14:45,659 --> 01:14:53,040
yourself in just taking a moment to recognize okay I'm sitting I'm gonna feel the Earth

579
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:58,260
right here it's also helpful Orient to your present moment look around

580
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:02,300
you know okay I'm here

581
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:09,780
taking a few intentional breaths just to start so don't keep making yourself

582
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:16,020
breathe deep just a few if it helps you kind of reset your nervous system you're

583
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:22,240
breathing ah

584
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:29,520
[Applause] and again you don't have to make other

585
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:34,800
things not happen and we'll just this invitation to start

586
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:41,100
to feel the breath in the body just connecting with that tether that

587
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:49,760
anchor that thread that can help us come back stay with this present moment

588
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:58,860
it's not a problem the thinking and emotions and pain all of these things

589
01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:02,000
are going to come and go

590
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:09,600
just inviting yourself just to tune a little bit more fully into that breath

591
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:16,620
three breaths maybe let's do a ah three breath Journey not too many not

592
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:19,100
too few

593
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:40,920
and another way to be with the breath as we sort of take a few minutes to settle

594
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:46,940
at the start of our meditation is something called noting practice

595
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:56,520
so noting is a very simple word we might say like in when we're

596
01:16:56,520 --> 01:17:03,739
breathing in and out when we're breathing out

597
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:09,659
this just sort of helps us stay connected to what's happening

598
01:17:09,659 --> 01:17:16,880
and it can feel too busy for some Minds if it feels like too much don't worry about it

599
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:23,780
if it feels helpful practice for a minute here

600
01:17:55,679 --> 01:18:02,940
you may scan the body and notice areas of tension and just without forcing anything

601
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:10,100
[Music] with an exhale just inviting a little letting go

602
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:19,920
a little sense of whatever like okay shoulders neck whatever tension isn't needed just

603
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:23,420
may may you let go

604
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:47,400
so while staying with the breathing we're starting to bring the body in

605
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:54,120
just a very gentle scanning through sensing into areas of tightness or

606
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:59,400
tension and maybe even lingering

607
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:04,580
in areas of neutral or Pleasant sensation

608
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:13,340
and if you like you might sort of Imagine [Music] that each inhale

609
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:22,500
sort of we bring awareness into the body and that awareness can expand and spread

610
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:30,659
sort of like a balloon blowing up with the breath and letting the awareness grow

611
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:39,239
just sort of naturally spread and be as large and fill up the inside of the body

612
01:20:39,239 --> 01:20:44,640
eventually maybe it may just grow a little bit or it may actually

613
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:51,420
feel you may feel it moving to the edges filling up the whole

614
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:55,158
feeling the whole body breathing

615
01:21:03,659 --> 01:21:08,760
and as this is going on you might be still staying in within and out with the

616
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:17,120
out hell exhale or you may just be you know connecting to the sensations

617
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:25,679
and whatever you're tuning into in the body

618
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:31,560
it's all great anything that's happening that's a sensation

619
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:36,140
is happening here in the present moment

620
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:42,678
now the goal is to be with it as simply as possible

621
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:50,239
and if it's a hard thing to be with just maybe thinking about

622
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:55,340
unpleasant just that simple label

623
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:09,620
maybe it's possible to sense how the body

624
01:23:09,780 --> 01:23:15,800
feeling into the whole body and how it just receives the breath

625
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:39,960
now I just want to invite you to connect with a sense of kindness

626
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:43,880
what is it like to feel kindness

627
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:51,300
what is the sound of a Kind voice the feel of a Kind touch

628
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:55,280
that's a kind gaze feel like

629
01:24:57,780 --> 01:25:05,640
can you bring that kind of kind energy to your own experience

630
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:10,820
of mindfulness of body and breath right now

631
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:57,620
whatever's happening right now there's nothing wrong you cannot do this wrong

632
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:06,000
bringing this kind regard respect

633
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:13,400
caring attention to however this is for you

634
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:39,780
giving yourself permission to be exactly who you are

635
01:26:39,780 --> 01:26:46,320
and how you are whatever that is right now

636
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:52,100
in this body in this breath

637
01:26:54,090 --> 01:27:05,399
[Music] good [Music]

638
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:17,639
thank you so just a few things and then if anybody

639
01:27:17,639 --> 01:27:24,000
wants to share anything or ask another question anybody have a a comment or a question

640
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:30,000
before I actually say my summary things how was that for you to breathe with the

641
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:35,000
whole body be with the body was that okay

642
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:43,020
great anything else quiet people there's a mic right there

643
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:46,159
thank you Corey

644
01:27:49,860 --> 01:27:55,020
I really enjoyed um experiencing

645
01:27:55,020 --> 01:28:02,040
the whole body as one uh taking in the breath rather than just

646
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:10,800
picking you know one little area so that was that was nice and then um

647
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:18,659
I also like the uh kindness towards yourself and towards

648
01:28:18,659 --> 01:28:25,400
the process of engaging in it because it's not always easy and

649
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:31,580
sometimes I know I have a perfectionist streak of a

650
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:40,280
self-critical streak so I think that's that's something I know I can work on thank you thank you

651
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:51,179
I like the simplification of pleasant unpleasant and neutral great because

652
01:28:51,179 --> 01:28:57,060
this is what you said about the sport you know instead of overly to romantic

653
01:28:57,060 --> 01:29:04,320
saying like oh it's painful is it like it's a pleasant is that's great thank you beautiful

654
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:07,320
beautiful

655
01:29:10,679 --> 01:29:17,280
I found myself jumping from thing to thing like breath thing I kept doing it um at first it was kind of annoying so

656
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:23,340
like I'm jumping back and forth and as I was doing and I was like all I'm doing is just thinking about these things I'm

657
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:30,600
not thinking about work or nothing about anything else you're fine as I did that everything slowed down too okay

658
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:33,380
beautiful

659
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:45,420
anyone else okay so I'll just you know we got one minute left so I'm gonna talk fast

660
01:29:45,420 --> 01:29:52,920
and I'll let you go um you're starting or you have started just continue keep practicing even if

661
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:57,960
it's for you know I'm going to encourage you to practice for 20 minutes a day

662
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:05,159
okay if you can do more great if you can't do that long do 15 if you can't do 15 do 10

663
01:30:05,159 --> 01:30:12,239
if you can't do 10 do 5 if you can't do five do three just do it sit down

664
01:30:12,239 --> 01:30:18,360
and set a timer and don't get up before the timer goes off right so don't also

665
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:23,760
push yourself for too long right but just try and that you know an amount

666
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:29,100
that you know you can do and practice not giving in to the impulse to get up

667
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:36,120
so you don't want you know maybe you you'll have some sessions where you know you're a little more fluid but have some

668
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:44,400
periods where you're like no and then once the Bell Rings just stay keep your eyes closed just stay don't move wait

669
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:51,480
just a minute because we start to develop this like habit of jumping out of our meditation but it's really

670
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:57,840
helpful to like linger there and notice what it's what's happening how does it

671
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:05,940
feel different instead of jumping out just give yourself a little bit of space to absorb the impact of the practice

672
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:12,920
okay um let's see

673
01:31:15,780 --> 01:31:22,800
being attentive is enough being aware of what's going on is enough

674
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:30,719
you don't have to over control your experience right and and tuning in to the felt

675
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:36,600
sense is is really helpful because it helps you stay connected to the here and

676
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:41,760
now if you can feel your feet pressed on the floor you know at least part of your

677
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:50,159
awareness is in the present moment yeah yeah Richard do we have another question or comment no from the YouTube

678
01:31:50,159 --> 01:31:55,620
okay all right so meditate daily

679
01:31:55,620 --> 01:32:02,760
and maybe um there's you know in the handouts it has lots of other suggestions for

680
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:09,540
homework maybe just choose one or two other things that you want to do this week based on what feels easiest

681
01:32:09,540 --> 01:32:16,739
to you start where it's easy don't start where it's hard okay

682
01:32:16,739 --> 01:32:25,940
