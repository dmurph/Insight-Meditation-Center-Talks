1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:09,160
hello and welcome to this half an hour meditation and um building

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:17,840
on what we've been doing earlier this week I so I've beeno and welcome so I

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,640
I've been talking about um how we divide ourselves fragment

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:31,720
ourselves and we lose touch with the whole of Who We Are by the intent it of the desires we

5
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:37,640
fixate on or the aversions or also the ways in which

6
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:47,160
we latch on to identities this is who I am and um and all these uh uh gather

7
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:54,520
strength by the intensity of our thoughts our ideas our Concepts that we

8
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:01,800
have and it isn't that thoughts and concepts are wrong to have

9
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:10,799
what's important is to be able to see how we become divided how we become

10
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,479
fragmented through them lose touch with

11
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:25,920
ourselves and um and sometimes thinking puts us in touch sometimes we have

12
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,600
thoughts ideas concepts of maybe even Who We Are

13
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:40,479
that help us to Step Beyond limited Concepts into not just an idea of our wholeness

14
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:48,799
but a way of being in touch to feel to sense so that all our capacities for

15
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:56,000
awareness are in some ways operating at the same time a whole field of

16
00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:04,600
attention and um so two things one is that it's not only important to see how

17
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:10,119
these Concepts divide us but also start getting a sense of the

18
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:16,640
intensity of the strength of them how much clinging or Force pressure

19
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,599
compulsion is behind them sometimes this is seen

20
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:28,200
by the thoughts carry us away into our preoccupations and maybe we come back to

21
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:35,000
the present to the breathing and then how quickly we get pulled back

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,280
and sometimes we get pulled back we feel the pull even before we've returned even

23
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:46,040
in the movement of returning there's the strength of the thoughts are

24
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:53,280
there the thoughts that unite us that bring us all together do not have that

25
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,560
intensity uh they don't they don't come with compulsion and pressure they're not

26
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:07,080
loud so in not being loud maybe we don't feel like we should or can or want to give

27
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:14,159
them much attention to allow things that we want to attend to but in the practice of

28
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:22,040
meditation it's the thoughts that are supportive that are non-compulsive that are quiet that are gentle that support

29
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:31,159
us here come back who say welcome into the fullness of who we are welcome

30
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,000
um be here to sense and feel all of

31
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,439
it open up there's a variety of things we can tell us so so thoughts can

32
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:49,319
support us to be here and now and this goes along with what I

33
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:55,959
talked about the first week of light awareness so there can be light

34
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:02,560
thoughts and then there can be kind of a light sense of awareness or or awareness

35
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,120
that has no weight and gentle and it's can be harder to stay

36
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,760
present for because of the strength of other preoccupations other

37
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:21,320
priorities but to develop a really healthy form of samade has a lot to do

38
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:28,120
with the slow and gradual art

39
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,479
of cultivating developing staying close

40
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:38,680
to a a gentle soft

41
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,880
light awareness a light gentle way of thinking

42
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:50,840
that supports that awareness come back be here here

43
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:57,440
now let's welcome the breathing back rather than forcefully jerking the Mind

44
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:03,759
back to the breath there can be a gentle thoughts and

45
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:11,759
attitude of let's invite the breathing back into awareness so the mind doesn't have to

46
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:18,960
move so I'll offer you some guidance on this light touch of awareness light

47
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:25,919
touch of thinking for this meditation so to assume a medit

48
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,639
meditation posture that's right for you

49
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,199
and right for you so that there is

50
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:49,080
a non-forceful alertness that may be arises out of the

51
00:05:52,120 --> 00:06:00,919
body and sometimes that is helped by whatever posture you're in

52
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:08,440
to assume that posture with intention with a sense of knowing this

53
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,360
is the posture this is what I'm

54
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:22,520
doing a gentle intention an intention that maybe is

55
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:28,759
infused with self-care self-regard

56
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,919
wanting to do well for yourself through this

57
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:46,720
meditation and then to lower your gaze and if it can support relaxing

58
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,520
further closing your

59
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,160
eyes and then to

60
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:07,840
see if you can tune adjust your

61
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:14,160
thinking to have a light touch soft

62
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:26,479
quiet maybe the soft light kind of thinking that

63
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,560
conveys a kindness a friendly less a

64
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:44,919
care and giving yourself gentle instructions so you're starting to use

65
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:50,639
your thinking in a nice light welcoming

66
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:57,000
way giving yourself instructions like I often do at the beginning of a

67
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:03,280
sitting to breathe bre breathe deeply

68
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,240
relax do that for yourself

69
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:36,518
giving yourself instructions is a way in which you begin

70
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:42,680
helping yourself become whole undivided

71
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,560
maybe talking to yourself with a tone of

72
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:13,120
voice that is comfortable

73
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,680
settling for your mind and your heart

74
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,680
and then breathing normally

75
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,839
relaxing on the exhale maybe with extending the exhale

76
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:13,360
just a little bit longer than usual by letting go relaxing at the

77
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:20,000
end and relax into the settling

78
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,240
Point final point of where the last sensation of exhale occurs deep in your

79
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,240
body

80
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:47,480
follow the exhale to the end allowing yourself to settle into

81
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:56,480
that end and allowing the inhale to arise from that

82
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,240
grounding point that settling point

83
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:45,600
as if breathing inhale spreads from this single point where inhale

84
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:55,279
begins and with the exhale there's a return to that point

85
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,279
and don't uh Focus directly

86
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:32,440
or fixedly on this end of the exhale this point

87
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:38,760
settling point but do be aware of it kind of with

88
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,360
peripheral awareness

89
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:16,320
so the way of being with this settling place with breathing deep

90
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:23,480
inside grounding place as a light touch

91
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:40,000
and if the mind wanders off in thought notice how that you lose touch

92
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:50,560
with yourself and then and then give yourself gentle calm

93
00:13:50,839 --> 00:14:00,240
instructions to Welcome Back Being in touch being connected

94
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:07,480
so how you instruct yourself is light and gentle and

95
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:17,199
kind slowly getting used to light kind

96
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:25,639
awareness it helps you stay in touch with the body your

97
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
experience

98
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
e

99
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

100
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
for

101
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
for

102
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
for

103
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
for

104
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

105
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
for

106
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
for

107
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,720
for for

108
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
for

109
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,559
for for

110
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
for

111
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

112
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,440
for for

113
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:40,320
as we continue see if you can find just the

114
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:47,960
right balance of not trying too hard to be

115
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:53,200
present and not wandering away from the

116
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:02,240
present maybe a little bit like being at the center point of a seesaw keeping

117
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,480
it

118
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:14,398
balanced relax attention on

119
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,600
breathing attentive not to wonderand

120
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
away

121
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,278
for for

122
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:36,640
and then as we come to the end of this meditation to see if there can be a

123
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:42,760
balance maybe balancing in the middle n

124
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:48,200
seesaw between being grounded in

125
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,960
yourself and turning your awareness out into the

126
00:26:55,399 --> 00:27:00,240
world to the people that you'll encounter

127
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:06,278
today people known and people not known

128
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:14,320
strangers and to imagine staying at ease and

129
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:21,200
balanced present connected to

130
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:29,840
yourself while being aware of the world of others

131
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,799
inviting a kind attention inviting

132
00:27:54,799 --> 00:28:02,600
Goodwill for both for your yourself and for

133
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:13,760
others standing here balance between these two with Good Will flowing in all

134
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:22,120
directions may all beings be

135
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:30,120
happy may all beings be safe

136
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:37,200
may all beings be

137
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:43,279
peaceful and may all beings be

138
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:50,360
free and may it be that how I'm

139
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,320
aware as I go about my

140
00:28:56,279 --> 00:29:03,600
day might contribute to Greater happiness and peace in this

141
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,080
world may all beings be

142
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:22,399
[Music]

143
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,158
well thank you

144
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:30,480
so hello and welcome to this now 10th talk on

145
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:37,120
samadi putting down the foundations for what is needed to really have a useful

146
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:45,120
form of concentration in meditation and

147
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:48,679
um the

148
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:56,760
um so we're learning how our minds work

149
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:03,559
how our thoughts our attention works so that we can use it in a useful

150
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:10,559
way to not understand ourselves and try to get concentrated sometimes doesn't work or

151
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:16,480
we override ourselves or the concentration comes with a lot of tension and

152
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:22,799
force and um one of the things I've been emphasizing this week is that the ways

153
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:28,440
in which our thinking the ways in which desire and aversions and the ways in

154
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:36,159
which identity how we identify ourselves can be uh divisive in

155
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:42,120
ourselves how it could create divisions fragmentations how it contributes to not

156
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:49,799
being fully in touch with ourselves sometimes even a disassociation or disconnection from

157
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:56,720
ourselves and because to try to develop somebody while being disconnected uh is going to be much

158
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:04,000
harder uh it's through being connected somebody is a gathering together it's a

159
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:11,480
collectedness everything collected together collectiveness of mind and body and so we have to kind of

160
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:17,279
understand how we do the opposite and then to understand how to use the mind

161
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:23,760
how to use the attention so that that attention doesn't further the division

162
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:31,720
the divide that attention actually begins to heal it so to use attention in a like a laser

163
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:37,679
focus in a fixed way in a determined way to to blast through something or blast

164
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,919
into concentration um uh that actually creates more

165
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:47,960
separation and so there's some kind of way of being relaxed and soft and

166
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:53,399
welcoming to have an attention that begins opening to the hole not forcing

167
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:58,799
ourselves into the present so I want to use an anal

168
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:06,440
ology that maybe points to something important that um if I find myself may

169
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:16,120
be afraid and the manifestation of that fear is that um I I hold my hands in

170
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:22,760
tight fists and uh and I just you know been

171
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:29,120
doing that for so long I never really open my hand if I'm going to pick something up I put it you know have to

172
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:35,360
hold my two fists together and grab it somehow and so all I'm thinking about is

173
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,559
you know all I know about my hand is it's fisted and I start being concerned

174
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:45,840
about am I fisted in the proper way and you know what's the right way to have a

175
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:53,360
fist is my thumb supposed to be inside or outside what do people think of my fist do I have a nice handsome fist or

176
00:33:53,360 --> 00:34:00,799
is this something that's embarrassing as a human being to have this kind of fist maybe I'm supposed to uh tighten up

177
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:08,720
harder with a fist or maybe I'm supposed to I'm supposed to be a Buddhist so a good Buddhist has a relaxed fist easeful

178
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:14,040
fist all I know is Fist and then I come across some wise

179
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:21,638
teacher who tells me gil you might try relaxing your hand fully pry your fingers apart and let

180
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:27,040
your full hand relax and then I get disoriented but but

181
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:34,000
but but I'm I'm my fist that's who I am what am I going to there's no fist anymore the

182
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,398
fist disappeared what did you do to my fist and eventually I discover oh how

183
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:47,800
nice it is the absence of the Fist is really nice I haven't betrayed the fist

184
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:53,040
by by relaxing uh I've just stopped doing something

185
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:58,079
unnecessary and if I ever need to fist again I can do it I know how but it's so

186
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:08,200
nice not to have it so in the same way um the the ways in which we cling

187
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:18,119
the compulsions of the Mind the pressure and tightness and the force behind which we think want have AV verion uh it's

188
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:24,720
possible to feel the sensations of that and and uh sometimes when people have a

189
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:29,920
sense of I am uh just dness what they're

190
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:36,599
identifying is that fisted of the Mind the tightness in the center of our

191
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:43,440
thinking and thinking does not have to have any pressure associated with it thinking does not have to have any

192
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,640
tightness or um thinking doesn't have to be fisted

193
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:56,440
in any kind of way but if that's what we're used to and that's what we think thinking is it's inconceivable that we

194
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:04,280
would relax that thinking muscle and um and uh we feel like we

195
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:09,960
have to go along with it and this who I am after all and so the very Act of

196
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:17,640
identification holding on tightly to identities it isn't the identity that's necessarily the problem it's how we hold

197
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:23,000
on to it the compulsion the pressure behind it uh the thinking isn't

198
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:30,240
necessarily a problem it's the compulsion and pressure the clinging the force behind it and so what we can start

199
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:37,000
looking at is the underlying tension that's there in thinking and in

200
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:45,240
identifying ourselves having an identification with anything at all and it's possible to loosen the fist

201
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:50,760
to relax and something disappears when the just like the fist disappears

202
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:59,440
something disappears in the mind and if we think that what disappears is who we are it can be disoriented Ed

203
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:06,800
disorienting but what disappears is the tension is the pressure that same thing can exist with

204
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:12,480
how people focus their attention in meditation they associate meditation

205
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:18,200
with having this with the tension or the pressure that's in

206
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:24,040
focusing focusing on the breath I know I'm focusing breath because on the breath because there's a kind of a

207
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:32,359
gathering and tightening in the mind that it's like a like this little strain of looking at my breathing or some part

208
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:37,880
of my body and for some people that strain is

209
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:44,200
what keeps them present because otherwise the tendency of mind to wander off is so

210
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:52,800
strong what we're trying to do here is to find some other way of being present that does not

211
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:58,800
involve force does not involve any kind of strain and so we have to let go of

212
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:06,480
the strain and realize it's still possible be focused and we don't you you know uh in

213
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:14,359
a different way and that's a light way a soft way an open way and so the the

214
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:21,400
dedication the persistence is in staying open and relaxed staying available and

215
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:30,160
relaxed staying intimate and relaxed and so we work hard at being relaxed we work

216
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:35,319
hard at being at ease and of course you can't work hard

217
00:38:35,319 --> 00:38:43,240
that way and strain the working hard is just kind of like a repetition coming back staying

218
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:51,720
close to in a gentle kind supportive way and so learning a whole different way of

219
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:57,160
using attention whole different way of thinking and a whole different way of

220
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:02,880
maybe even uh taking things some some aspects of who we are and identifying

221
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:10,800
this is who I am and this applies also to how we identify other people there can be force

222
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:17,520
and compulsion identifying other people as being somehow wrong you know I'm

223
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:25,520
right that's an identification and there can be a lot of strength behind that they're wrong it's the force and the

224
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:31,800
compulsion that that some get created that's not in the being right and wrong

225
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:38,079
it's the reification the solidification the separation the the prioritization of

226
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:43,560
a certain way of being prior prioritization of a fisted

227
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:49,720
mind where we lose lose something in that process a fisted hand loses the

228
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:55,319
Open Hand the fisted mind fisted mind loses an open

229
00:39:55,319 --> 00:40:00,760
mind a tense mind loses an easeful

230
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:08,920
mind and so to begin experimenting in daily life in meditation with seeing can

231
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:17,200
you find a way to think talk to yourself have thoughts

232
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:23,280
that are light easeful that are thoughts about staying

233
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:28,640
present giving yourself gentle instructions not that you're you're going to do this

234
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:34,680
forever but if you're honest you might find that sometimes that's the better

235
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:40,800
alternative to how the to how the mind's wondering often different kinds of Thoughts by itself thoughts that maybe

236
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:47,880
are not so useful and it's a beginning of training preparing the Mind learning the

237
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:56,920
mind how to be friendly how to be easeful how to be light how to be uh

238
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:02,240
very comforting mind a mind that you want to stay close to by beginning to

239
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:07,800
talk to yourself in nice ways in gentle ways it's not so much what you say to

240
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:14,079
yourself but how you say it and that can begin translating to

241
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:19,400
having in a a form of present moment awareness that is

242
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:25,280
compelling because it's not compulsive it's compelling because it feels so com

243
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:31,119
so nice of course I want to be present of course I want to have an open hand

244
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:36,680
when it feels so nice to have it open of course I want to open to the sensations

245
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:42,119
of my body of course I want to open to the feelings I have not because the body

246
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:47,640
and feelings are necessarily comfortable or nice pleasant but it's so nice to

247
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:54,440
have that awareness that's light and useful and available and so in a sense if what we

248
00:41:54,440 --> 00:42:01,480
if you want to identify yourself with something don't identify yourself with anything that has pressure or tension in

249
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:08,200
it identify with the awareness the thinking which has none that's easeful

250
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:15,520
and light Pleasant and may be friendly so I hope that what I'm saying

251
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:20,920
makes enough sense for you to experiment with this and to be patient as we move

252
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:26,839
it slowly into this world of samade where we're going is as I've told said

253
00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:33,800
earlier here it's kind of like a sacred Temple and uh and it's kind of uh

254
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:41,520
amazing capacities of the mind uh that should be we should have a lot of respect for the higher reaches of samade

255
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:48,200
are astounding but uh we want to really create the good foundation for it and

256
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:55,400
that's I'm hoping we're doing and with the instructions for today I offer you those for for this

257
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:02,599
weekend that uh you find a nice easeful way of

258
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:08,640
thinking and find a way of meditation to nice easeful way of giving yourself

259
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:15,400
instructions so that you can ease yourself into a nice comfortable relaxed

260
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:22,838
awareness that's is able to stay welcoming the present

261
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:27,440
moment thank you
