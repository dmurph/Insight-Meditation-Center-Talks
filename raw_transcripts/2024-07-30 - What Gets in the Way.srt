1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,919
good evening welcome

2
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:12,759
welcome so tonight I'm going to continue on this uh series I've been doing on the

3
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:19,240
introduction to mindfulness and this is not exactly

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:25,840
mindfulness I'm going to be talking about but it's such an important teaching that's uh part

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:33,120
of maybe the whole picture of mindfulness practice and that is to talk about like what gets

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,840
in the way like why is it sometimes hard to be mindful why is it that we can't be

7
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:45,640
present all the time and many of us begin a meditation

8
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:52,000
practice with this hope with this idea that we'll find more freedom and ease in

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,359
our lives and then we discover that it turns

10
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:03,040
out not to be so easy so so it can be helpful

11
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,600
to discover or to look into or investigate or be curious about what is

12
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:15,320
it that's getting in the way of more freedom and ease and peace these kinds

13
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:21,000
of things so part of the finding our way to

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,840
more freedom and ease is running about what gets in the way

15
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,200
so I'm going to start with an analogy and that is this analogy that

16
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,720
the brudda gives of U when it

17
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:50,439
rains espe in my mind I'm thinking of the monsoon season in India there's a you know when it rains

18
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:57,130
on the Hills it's just natural that the water Ro rolls Downstream and it goes

19
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:03,399
[Music] from Little vets maybe to streams to

20
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:08,520
rivers to the ocean right and it only goes One Direction right it only goes

21
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:14,080
downhill of course you don't need me to tell you this we all know this it's like this it

22
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,720
just goes downhill but when we think about

23
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:27,840
rivers or streams often what we notice is that there's a bunch of uh H there's a bunch

24
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:35,040
of uh Boulders or even Banks or you know something that's in the way it's not like the water just goes straight down

25
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,959
in the most efficient and fast way that only exists in amusement parks right where we have but instead you know this

26
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:48,120
the river is um encountering these Boulders and then turning and and uh

27
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,640
encountering maybe Fallen branches in the Fallen Tree Trunks and moving around

28
00:02:53,640 --> 00:03:00,120
them in this kind of way it's not a problem that the Bold ERS

29
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:06,440
are there it's not a problem that the tree trunks are there it's just what the

30
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,840
water is encountering as it's continuing on its way

31
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,519
downhill and in some way we might even say this water is having like this intimate contact with the boulder or

32
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:25,760
tree trunk or whatever is finding there and then it just goes around or goes

33
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,040
over or does whatever it does

34
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:38,560
so in some ways we can think about uh our practice in a similar way that

35
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:45,120
mindfulness practice has this momentum it goes a certain direction and it

36
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,200
encounters obstructions Boulders tree trunks on its

37
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:58,920
way towards the ocean of I don't know maybe I'm taking this analogy too far but uh maybe the ocean is you know

38
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,159
vastness some real peace and

39
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:14,360
ease so I appreciate very much that the Buddhist tra tradition just recognized

40
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:20,680
these what we might call Boulders in the way the Buddha talked about them quite a

41
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:26,680
number of times thousands of years ago they were recognizing oh yeah it's not

42
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,880
so easy to always be mindful it's not so easy to be consistent with this practice

43
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:37,560
it's not so easy to always be in the present moment or be doing loving

44
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:44,000
kindness whatever one's practice is and the Buddha he gave teachings

45
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,560
about this so one way that we might consider these

46
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,680
Boulders and tree trunks in this analogy that I gave is as hindrances things that

47
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:04,840
are hindering obstructing or getting in the way of the

48
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:10,919
the uh this movement of the water it doesn't prevent the water from going it

49
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:16,360
just impacts the water the water goes around or something like

50
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:24,280
this so this idea of hindrances another different analogy but

51
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:30,880
another way to consider these things that are getting in the way so to speak is these hindrance are sometimes called

52
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:37,360
veiling factors that is they cover something they hide or conceal or

53
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,680
obstruct what's actually happening in the present moment or what's to be done

54
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:50,560
next or just get in the way of a Clarity any kind of clarity clarity about

55
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,000
anything get in the way of seeing ourselves clearly seeing other people

56
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,319
clearly seeing the situ situation

57
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:08,840
clearly and then these obstructions these hindrances these veiling factors

58
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:14,080
it's not just in meditation practice in meditation practice we see

59
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:20,160
them more clearly often we're using the meditation as a laboratory to see and understand

60
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:27,639
what goes on in our minds but they show up in our work our

61
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:34,639
professions our relationship ship or creative projects or service projects

62
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,039
that we might have and as well as in

63
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:47,120
meditation I mean it makes sense right that because if something were to only happen in meditation that would suggest

64
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:55,080
that there was like a different mind and body that meditates than the one that goes to work and has a family and has

65
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:01,639
relationships it's you know just one mind and body so of course things show up and meditation are actually showing

66
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:09,120
up in other areas of our lives and hindering in some respects so meditation is an opportunity

67
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:16,720
for us to explore these so in these teachings there's a

68
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,960
way in which this is maybe simplified and classified like all the things that

69
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,840
get in the way I don't know if that's the best expression get in the way but I'll work

70
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,240
with it for now and

71
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,400
so there's this typical list you won't be surprised to hear about this that

72
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,240
there's a list of these hindrances and I going to talk about

73
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:53,159
them a little bit at a high level and then I'm going to talk about one in particular I'll do some little

74
00:07:53,159 --> 00:08:01,520
meditation there in the middle this evening so in General these

75
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:08,120
hindrances we can say there's two that are about pushing or pulling like this

76
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:15,400
idea of like like this kind of leaning forward and like um like uh like go away

77
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:22,560
like this push away kind of thing aversion I don't want it go

78
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,960
away maybe I did this wrong so you're it's the pushing but the is uh I did

79
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,560
this with my body I leaned forward but it's we'll just say pushing it's like pushing away or there's things that

80
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:42,080
we're like pulling we want more of it kind of like energetically we're doing this maybe even

81
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:50,120
literally so pushing and pulling I want more I want less aversion

82
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,680
desire two the two more about energy I have too much energy feeling restless

83
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,640
and fidgety and the last thing I want to do is sit still here and I want to get up and run with away or do anything pick

84
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,920
up my phone or whatever it might be or the opposite is like oh my goodness I

85
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:14,440
can barely stay awake kind of like you know falling asleep too much energy this

86
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:20,839
restlessness or this like not enough energy this sleepiness or

87
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:27,440
torper too much energy not enough energy and then the fifth one we can

88
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:34,880
think about it as a uh way as I often kind think about it's more like a

89
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:41,320
spinning like not quite sure what to do this vacillation this hesitation maybe I'll do this well no actually maybe I'll

90
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:46,760
do that I I actually I'm not sure maybe this thing over here is better well maybe that's over B maybe I should do

91
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:53,920
this this hesitation this uh not clarity about what to do and ends up not doing

92
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:00,440
anything but instead just kind of spinning spinning our wheels so to to

93
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,480
speak and this fifth one was called doubt and I'm going to talk a little bit

94
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:11,240
more about that uh this evening because I think uh it's so

95
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:17,720
powerful and it's so Insidious it's so uh often veils so many different things

96
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:24,360
and likes to masquerade and camouflage itself and so I'll talk about doubt and

97
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:31,120
ways that we can work with it so I'm talking about these hindrances

98
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,920
pushing and pulling too much energy not enough energy or spinning so kind of

99
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:45,079
like Di's versions of uh describing these uh hindrances but they are

100
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:52,120
Spectra like they they occur on a spectrum it's not like binary yes it's

101
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:58,720
there and yes or no it's not there and one thing as we begin to

102
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:05,600
meditate more and more we start and as the mind and the body really start to settle we start to find more and more

103
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,200
settle versions of these

104
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,959
hindrances things that you didn't even know were there was didn't even know were kind of like operating um

105
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:23,279
underneath maybe the usual way of seeing things or doing

106
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:32,000
things so this also means this idea that it's not just binary on off present not

107
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,560
present or you know it's it's you know really settled to really obvious I mean

108
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:44,800
I think we all have this experience of sometimes like feeling restless and just getting up when we're at home and you

109
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:51,160
know not finishing the duration in which we thought we were going to meditate but then we start to see like

110
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:57,440
in a really subtle level there's a way in which the mind can always be like looking for something looking for

111
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:04,959
entertainment or looking for the next thing or what's happening next it doesn't want to be just with what is it

112
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:12,200
wants to be you know titilated and some kind of way so that's a more like subtle version and then there can be even a

113
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:18,560
really really subtle version of that when the mind is really quiet in some

114
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:25,480
deep concentration States we can sometimes see how there's the mind is sometimes very quietly like probing

115
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,839
trying to find something and so the way that we work

116
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:37,440
with them of course isn't I mean we have to kind of like respect this uh that they arise and they

117
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,680
pass away and sometimes they're obvious and sometimes they

118
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,480
aren't so I'd like to do a little guided

119
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:58,440
meditation where we'll explore these a little bit again I'll just say uh this IDE well

120
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:03,560
maybe I'll just say all of us have all five of these it's that's just the way

121
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:10,279
it's part of the human experience and I'll talk a little bit more about that after the guided meditation but often

122
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:18,160
many of us have one that tends to be a little bit more predominant that tends to be something

123
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,519
that uh shows up more regularly and also to be clear there can

124
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:31,040
be all five at the same time too like you just a we call this like a hindrance storm

125
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:38,560
but there's also as I said can be way in which there that one that's the most

126
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:45,680
common like the the mind and the body's favorite way to uh

127
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:52,279
to not to be present and I'm using this word favorite like in with air

128
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:59,279
quotes so again just these five if you don't know them and we using I'm using

129
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:06,079
this kind of language because um I like us to like feel into the experience of

130
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:11,399
them as opposed to getting too much about the concept or the notion of them

131
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:18,800
so there's pushing and pulling or we could also say uh leaning forward which

132
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:25,959
is you know like a desire or leaning back which is I don't want it or there's pushing I don't want it or pulling I do

133
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:33,800
want it these two oppos iits or this with energy maybe there's

134
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:39,279
just so this restlessness this feeling like I want to be anywhere but here or

135
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:46,399
this strong sense of it's really important that I you know take care of whatever it is we feel like we have to

136
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:52,720
take care of or this sleepiness like as soon as we start to

137
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:59,160
settle down the mind starts wants to fall asleep and then the fifth one maybe will

138
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:05,959
say a few more words here which I'm calling like spinning is this hesitation it's about uh well okay so maybe I

139
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:12,360
should be doing mindfulness practice and we'll do mindfulness of breathing yeah but my breath I don't know I shouldn't

140
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:18,120
be with the breath maybe okay I'm going to do mindfulness of sounds but gee I don't really like those sounds and then

141
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,320
you know maybe my breath is more uh stable now I'll do mindful breath well yeah I heard that loving kindness is

142
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:29,040
good I'm going to do loveing kindness practice so there's this way in which we just kind of don't quite settle down

143
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,720
because we don't really decide on the practice instead there's this hesitation

144
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,759
or vacillation or not a commitment or not a like okay this is what I'm going

145
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:45,319
to do instead we just spend all our time trying to think about or consider or

146
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:54,680
philosophies about what we're going to do okay so with that is an

147
00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:00,920
introduction Let's uh we'll do a little bit of a guided meditation here

148
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:12,480
taking a meditation posture a posture

149
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:20,920
that expresses your intention toity and also has some

150
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:30,920
ease has some uprightness and some relaxation

151
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:46,199
and feeling the pressure on the body from the sitting surface whether that's

152
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:49,199
a chair or a

153
00:16:52,560 --> 00:17:00,800
cushion feeling the contact with the sitting surface

154
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,959
we're here right

155
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,520
now and then maybe just do a general

156
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:33,400
body scan is there any obvious any areas of

157
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,640
obvious tension or holding or

158
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:47,240
tightness it can be that bringing attention to those areas allows a little more ease or

159
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,240
softness

160
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:19,039
and then letting the attention rest on the sensations of

161
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:32,000
breathing whether you feel the or sense the experience a breathing in the belly

162
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,640
or in the chest or in the

163
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:43,480
nose just feeling the experience of breathing

164
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:18,600
giving yourself over to the experience of breathing

165
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:50,520
what is it feel like to have an in breath

166
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:27,000
what does it feel like to have an out breath

167
00:20:53,600 --> 00:21:00,600
and what about the transition between in breaths and out breaths

168
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,240
what do they feel like

169
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:48,240
and we'll stay here for a little bit resting Awareness on the sensations

170
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,480
of

171
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,559
breathing e

172
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,440
when the mind wanders just very simply

173
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:05,000
gently begin again with the sensations of

174
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,480
breathing e

175
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:11,240
five hindrances just the tradition holds this as the

176
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:18,039
list pushing away and

177
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:21,679
experience including

178
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,399
thoughts pulling towards

179
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:37,720
wanting more of having of energy

180
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,000
restlessness in the body or in the

181
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:51,440
mind having little energy feeling sleepy or

182
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:59,919
foggy lethargic in the body or in the mind

183
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:07,480
or this sense of hesitation vacillation

184
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:19,480
spinning which one of these is tending to come

185
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,919
up as we

186
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:35,679
meditate Maybe you see all five maybe only

187
00:25:53,720 --> 00:26:00,240
one so resting attention on the sensations of breathing

188
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:07,480
and then when you notice that you are no longer on the

189
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:16,880
breath a little bit curious is there some pushing or pulling or energy or

190
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:23,000
spinning and then begin again with the sensations of

191
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,278
breathing e

192
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:38,278
if you recognize one of these five can you just allow it to be

193
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:46,200
there this is what too much energy feels like for

194
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:56,360
example this is what aversion feels like

195
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,480
and then come back to the sensations of

196
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,080
breathing e

197
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,240
is it the same hindrance all the

198
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:13,158
time maybe it's

199
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,080
changing e

200
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:09,080
can you notice the absence of any of these

201
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:16,000
five maybe there's pulling but no

202
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,679
pushing or maybe there's

203
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,960
both

204
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:00,960
e for

205
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:50,159
I'll say that when I first learned about these hindrances I felt such a relief I had taken this uh you know

206
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:55,519
introduction to meditation class and I thought that I was the only one that uh

207
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:02,320
couldn't keep my mind uh settled I felt relieved to discover you know for

208
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:10,279
all these thousands of years you countless individuals have uh done this practice and have had these

209
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:15,600
experiences because it can be easy to think that we can't meditate because our

210
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:22,639
mind wanders too much or we might uh think that we can't

211
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:29,320
might idealize the teachers or the teachings in such a way that we think that uh nobody else is having any

212
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:36,519
trouble with meditation ever or I think you know that idealize what we see around us people are sitting quietly and

213
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:41,799
to think that oh I'm the only one that's feeling restless or sleepy or has doubt

214
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:48,440
or something like this but the hindrance is um we don't

215
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:54,960
have to take them personally they don't mean anything about you as a person they don't mean

216
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:01,240
anything about you as a meditator this is just what happens when people

217
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:08,720
sit down to meditate this is what happens these hindrances arise and sure they

218
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,799
Abate and with a more meditation experience maybe the severity and the

219
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:21,039
duration of them uh changes but it's uh I think until fact I know I would

220
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:26,760
say I I should say I would say that a person who's completely awakened is the

221
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:32,320
only person who doesn't have have hindrances and said there's always a

222
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:39,278
certain way in which we are working with these different energies or these forces in the

223
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:45,440
mind and we might even say I mean we could actually say meditation practice

224
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:51,919
is hindrance practice of course it is we don't talk about it that way maybe it's not as fun

225
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:58,039
and interesting but uh of course it is we it say especially the

226
00:33:58,039 --> 00:34:03,600
concentration practice is hindrance practice working with

227
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:12,720
them and then maybe also say that you know we want to have respect for these forces in the mind that uh are making it

228
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:18,800
difficult for us to be present because meditation it touches uh

229
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:25,079
some of the things that are really deep inside of us and that are important to us

230
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:31,878
and that uh maybe we are identified with or we feel like are a core part a core

231
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:37,280
aspect of who we are or what makes us tick or something like this maybe some

232
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:43,040
of that kind of stuff gets touched in meditation so there's a responses to

233
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:49,118
that and the responses often are a form of a hindrance like you know preventing us

234
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:57,440
from getting deeper and deeper into there so there might be this challenges that are getting touched

235
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:03,800
in into like this these unresolved places these places of pain or

236
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:11,000
uncertainty or maybe deep doubt or this idea of our purpose or the value we have

237
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,400
or these types of things might get touched into with a meditation and then there's a hindrance that can show up as

238
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,640
a way when we something inside of us like

239
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:28,079
oh no no that's going to be painful I don't want to go there that's not necessar that's not a

240
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:34,480
conscious thought so much but often it's kind of what's underneath these hindrances not always sometimes so we

241
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:41,640
want to have a lot of respect for them and care for them instead of thinking like oh I have to get rid of this

242
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:48,240
thing maybe just like the bolders in that uh analogy that I gave at the beginning it's just part of practice you

243
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:55,119
know practice we just encounter these Boulders and as it turns out these Boulders so to speak turn into

244
00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:00,560
doorways absolutely it's an integral part of practice for us to start to see

245
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:09,319
like what what is getting in the way what is uh what is it that uh affects our

246
00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:15,040
practice and then we just bring mindfulness to it so

247
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:21,760
we start thinking like mindfulness is going this way just like a a river does it encounters a boulder so then we just

248
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:27,839
turn like okay nope now I'm going to be mindful of this experience of this pushing and pulling or the energy or

249
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:33,720
something like this so in that way it's not a problem it's no longer a hindrance it just

250
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:38,960
becomes the object of meditation object of

251
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:46,640
mindfulness so now I'd like to open it up and I'd like to ask you guys how was that that guided meditation and I asked

252
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:54,839
is there a particular one that you felt uh more obviously or more often or more

253
00:36:54,839 --> 00:37:00,480
readily or anybody have would like to share or maybe you're like

254
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:06,640
I don't know it's perfectly fine whatever whatever experience you

255
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:12,119
had yes can we send the microphone back there thank you

256
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:24,839
Jim I found that uh when I really let go of

257
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:30,119
eting it helps me feel very clear cuz sometimes I try to effort in the

258
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:37,720
right ways to do the right things like trying to be mindful trying to be but when I let go of all everything and just

259
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:44,000
kind of just be still and be be be natural that's when I feel the most

260
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Mindful and clear I see so and what helps uh you

261
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:58,280
remember like oh yeah maybe I can lessen up on the effort a here just to let go yeah just to consciously stop trying

262
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:06,040
yeah even in the right ways if I think it's a right way to try don't even just don't try just be natural and when when

263
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:12,280
I feel like I'm in my natural state I always see my most mindful yeah yeah thank you thank you and this is such an

264
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:17,560
interesting place to practice it's kind I would say like the art of practice like how much effort how much is too

265
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:25,000
much and how much is too little so that we just go off a dangering yeah great thank you thank you anybody else have

266
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,160
something you'd like to share of this list of five do anybody

267
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:36,280
recognize that yeah we can maybe we can run the microphone here

268
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:41,359
thanks yeah I wonder about your thoughts on working with

269
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:46,839
sleepiness um especially because your awareness of the

270
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:52,839
sleepiness itself decreases the sleepier you

271
00:38:52,839 --> 00:38:58,400
get that's right and so at a certain point you can you can no longer be aware

272
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:04,800
that you're sleepy I mean maybe maybe in a subtle way you can but uh yeah I'm

273
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:11,359
curious about your perspective on working with that yeah and I appreciate so much what you're pointing to here

274
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:18,560
that because one way is to be aware of the experiences and you will fall asleep if you do this and maybe that's okay

275
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:24,680
maybe part of being aware of sleepiness is to like wow and see how that image is

276
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:31,000
I don't know exactly how it is for you but I've done a lot of work with this and like just how like the hypnogogic like the images kind of get a little

277
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:37,720
swirly and they start to get a little dreamy and then maybe the shoulders heav and the eyes are heavy and then you

278
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:45,040
often will kind like fall asleep and then you wake up like oh yeah I supped to do that meditation thing and then you're just following it can be

279
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:50,680
fascinating just that just to watch that experience that's a legitimate form of

280
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:56,200
practice so there's a way and often we can um feel like oh I shouldn't be

281
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:03,960
sleepy and it can be a hindrance but if you're just being mindful of it and exploring

282
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:10,359
and investigating it doesn't have to be a hindrance but sleepiness but I will also talk I'll say a few words about how

283
00:40:10,359 --> 00:40:17,319
to not be so sleepy not fall asleep and maybe you know these but I'll mention a few of them first of all I'll

284
00:40:17,319 --> 00:40:22,880
say this is very common this is very common right I think uh in today's society especially right we're

285
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:29,319
accustomed to like go go go do do do then then you know the only time that we

286
00:40:29,319 --> 00:40:36,560
kind of uh sleep is when we just relax and then when we relax we associate the Mind assoc associate that with

287
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:43,599
sleeping and B we're sleep deprived very often and sometimes we just actually should sleep rather than meditate

288
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:49,200
because if you're really sleep deprived you can't meditate your way through very well any

289
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:55,400
yourway so here we go um one is to meditate with your eyes open and just uh

290
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:02,280
you know down you know at a at an angle so letting the light in and that kind of helps remind you that you're

291
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:08,119
here two is um like I was leading us on mindfulness on the sensations of

292
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:15,079
breathing but you could give the Mind something a little bit busier to do that keeps it more awake so for example it

293
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:20,800
could be um mindfulness of the sensations of the

294
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:28,560
lips touching then the sensation of the seat against the body and the what the uh

295
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:35,359
hands are touching and then what the feet are touching and you do maybe one second each and just kind of rotate

296
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:43,640
through lips seat hands feet and then just be going

297
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:49,640
through this and so that can um give the as I said give the mind a little bit more something to do that's something

298
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:55,760
else that can be helpful some people have talked about uh

299
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:02,560
imagining a really bright light I haven't myself had success with

300
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:10,400
this maybe other people do I offer this in case it's something to that's really helpful like to I don't know I have a

301
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:16,560
bright light so like it maybe in the same way that you're less likely to fall asleep if you're looking at a lamp or

302
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:22,440
something like that some people stand up for their meditation period you're less likely to

303
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:27,920
fall asleep if you're standing and maybe I'll I'll stop there

304
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:33,960
but those are some things to to do great thank you you're welcome you're

305
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:40,559
welcome anybody else have a question or comment about uh yeah so maybe uh can we

306
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:45,920
send it back to I think to the person that was

307
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:51,440
sitting right next to you Jim thank you thanks um I have an answer to the

308
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:57,240
original question of like reflecting on the medit meditation also um something

309
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:04,559
thing to the question that was just asked that's work for me is imp is improving my posture um I actually

310
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:09,880
didn't do that this time and kind of suffered for it so that's something I'll be better about next time like the

311
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:18,000
straighter your back is the more awake I am but if I slouch then I often drift off um great thank you but yeah I guess

312
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:25,079
a reflection was that like I tried to not ruminate too much on whenever I like

313
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:31,440
got distracted by thought um um and not like be too hard on myself and be like oh you're bad at meditating you should

314
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:39,000
you should be better by now you've been doing this a while um and kind of just like breathe it out so to speak um I

315
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,800
guess to the Five hindrances Point like what I noticed the most was probably doubt in that sense but I tried to like

316
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:53,960
kind of not sit on it for too long and kind of just like say oh that was just a thought

317
00:43:53,960 --> 00:44:00,720
you know on with it and just like Focus back on whatever the an ER was nice very nice I'm going to talk a

318
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:07,319
little bit more about doubt and including just recognizing thoughts or just thoughts yeah great great thank

319
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:12,800
you can I can I also yeah make a comment so I noticed something it was very very

320
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:20,520
nice and I noticed um I don't quite know maybe it's it's a

321
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:27,559
version it's very subtle what's happening so you know let's see like I'm like let's see what's going on here when

322
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:32,920
we're trying to be on the breath and then there's this quality of like give

323
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:39,400
me a break I want to do what I want to do and it's a little bit like has the

324
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:44,480
quality of maybe a little bit resistance even rebellious like

325
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:52,119
no um it's good for you to want this but and then next next thing that happens is

326
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:57,599
there's a little bit of you know I'm somewhere else so the Mind goes and and

327
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:03,720
it's not because it wants to but because there's maybe what Matt said it's like effting let let me do this

328
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:08,920
thing um so it's kind of like I don't know what it is maybe aversion right or

329
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:15,520
like not wanting can you tell me how it feels in the body with this uh this tension this

330
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:21,800
this tension like I almost like feels like we don't want this this is a little

331
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:27,559
like artificial right now it's not it's not it's the quality of just overall

332
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:34,640
not clear aware but like a little bit of like some kind of constraint or

333
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:40,680
tension in the body so not relaxed this kind of thing and yeah yeah

334
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:47,359
so it can be restlessness it also could be doubt to the sense of yeah maybe is this really worth the effort is this

335
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:55,559
really what I should be doing now or the Mind wants to or so I kind of like I have this memory of me as a child uh not

336
00:45:55,559 --> 00:46:04,160
like really not um kind of when somebody is not convincing the teacher or the parent and

337
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:10,240
I really like just okay just don't don't buy into this

338
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:16,319
yeah yeah so it's kind of and then I'm going to do my thing and this is not the

339
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:22,960
yeah we're not going to be on the breath because it's something about it is fake so that's what happens maybe doubt I

340
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:28,839
don't know and do you stay so then the mind wanders but then do you come back back then I come back and maybe the

341
00:46:28,839 --> 00:46:34,319
coming back is a little like again the way I come back there's a quality of

342
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:42,040
like let's let's do it and then the mind is um I don't know no we something is

343
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:47,720
not quite nice here so so I really like I'm curious about this moment and I try

344
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:53,359
to be gentle right and try to be like let's be a good

345
00:46:53,359 --> 00:47:00,680
parent but but I guess it takes time uh the Mind needs to be reassured and yeah

346
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:05,760
cuz it occurs to me I I don't know if this is actually right spet up but it occurs to me that there like a little

347
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:12,319
bit of trust is needed like oh yeah okay this is contrived it is artificial but

348
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:18,520
it is uh something that um is going to take me a direction that I want to go

349
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:24,040
yeah that that is I think that's what uh there's a little bit of yeah lack of

350
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:30,119
that lack of like yes I I'm and that's where I'm thinking about it me as a

351
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:36,599
child so you know I don't know if I can trust you guys so this is interesting

352
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:42,599
this is a very interesting because I'm curious what happens where why do I like

353
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:51,000
why most of the time this is the same pattern right yeah maybe it's some doubt thank

354
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:59,000
you it was very nice very helpful do anybody else have a a comment

355
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,520
before I uh continue

356
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:14,480
here okay so I want to talk a little bit about doubt just because I think that desire

357
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:21,119
and aversion may maybe I'll just say a little thing about desire desire itself is not a problem we're talking about

358
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:26,400
desire when it's a hindrance when it's getting in the way of what you want to do of course we need a certain amount of

359
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:32,800
deser to you know fuel our movement towards greater and greater Peace and Freedom

360
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:37,960
and ease and these kinds of things so I don't want to uh kind of like say that

361
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:45,559
all desire is a terrible thing and we shouldn't have any it's just often sensual desire this pursuit of uh

362
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:52,040
pleasure pleasure pleasure which gets in the way of uh our meditation practice our spiritual

363
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:59,559
practice so doubt is this feeling of hesitation or maybe this vacillation or

364
00:48:59,559 --> 00:49:08,160
this wavering or maybe even resistance we might say this uh resistance to practice where and we end up not going

365
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:14,240
anywhere like I was saying earlier we kind of like are spinning because we have this endless it can be like this

366
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:21,599
endless speculation where we can't quite decide as I said earlier like what um

367
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:27,559
what practice should I do or even this feeling of I don't feel like it

368
00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:32,960
it sometimes the C doubt can show up that

369
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:38,520
way so doubt is a expected and natural

370
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:43,839
part of practice and I appreciate this so much that this practice is about you

371
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:51,640
know like come and see come and see for yourself experience for yourself it's not come and believe it's not like here

372
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:59,440
we're just going to believe this and you'll be fine go on your way it's this uh invitation to experience for yourself

373
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:06,079
and to explore for yourself and to see if these teachings are true for

374
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:12,280
yourself and so a doubt of course there's going to be a certain amount of Doubt like I'm not sure I haven't

375
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:17,400
experience some of these things that are being spoken about or that are being

376
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:22,839
pointed to so it's a natural part of

377
00:50:22,839 --> 00:50:29,760
practice and I will also say right there can be really healthy doubt too I mean

378
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:34,799
the obvious ways in which there's healthy doubt in our life is uh when you

379
00:50:34,799 --> 00:50:40,359
get this uh email from the bank out of the blue

380
00:50:40,359 --> 00:50:46,079
oh we' we're changing our uh systems please send us your passwords your

381
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:51,799
social security number or you know something like this right that's you know natural to be like I'm a little

382
00:50:51,799 --> 00:50:57,640
suspicious about this I don't think so right so there's that kind of doubt it's perfectly health healthy and natural and

383
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:05,680
will help us to um maybe to examine things or to really engage with like

384
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:11,240
wait is this really the bank and you know look at the email address it's from

385
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:18,240
or the URL or you know something like this these days something that we do but

386
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:23,599
it's also um it's healthy to not just believe

387
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:28,760
something because somebody told us or not to just disbelieve something because

388
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:35,720
somebody told us it's really about you know finding our own way and finding our practice

389
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:43,520
finding our own practice our own version of it each one of us practice will unfold a little bit differently and I

390
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:50,640
know that I used to think that you know what I was experiencing was what everybody was experiencing and it wasn't

391
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:57,839
until that um this was years ago but did some um like small grp groups where

392
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:03,000
people would talk with the teacher would put us into groups and we would talk about something or other and I realized

393
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:09,119
oh there's lots of different ways to consider this or to experience this and

394
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:15,559
that was like a a big eye opener for me because in my mind I was thinking like oh the teacher said this so you know the

395
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:23,119
way that I interpreted it was the only interpretation but of course that isn't true so each one of us will will

396
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:28,520
bringing hopefully like all of ourselves to this prti practice and that means

397
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:34,680
that it will all kind of unfold in a certain flavor in a certain way a certain

398
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:42,119
manner so this uh doubt I'm is to have some curiosity about what this is and

399
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:49,760
not necessarily just to believe everything and to um swallow everything I guess in some

400
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:56,440
kind of way but instead to learn something about ourselves

401
00:52:56,839 --> 00:53:02,920
to learn about what is it that we are unsure about and what are those things that we are just believing and assuming

402
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:09,319
that what we um are thinking or interpreting is the only

403
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:15,720
way so doubt is definitely a healthy part of practice just like in the same

404
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:21,200
way that desire is a very healthy part of a normal human

405
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:28,079
life and there's desire that gets in the way and there's doubt that gets in the way

406
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:33,599
and so part of practice is to you know be Discerning and notice when is this

407
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:41,359
helpful and when is it getting in the way so we might say that healthy

408
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:48,960
doubt is uh asks this question does this teaching or does this

409
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:55,119
practice does this help does this bring me closer or increase the amount of

410
00:53:55,119 --> 00:54:00,880
freedom and ease and peace and well-being that's the direction we're

411
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:06,319
going and even Sometimes some teachings are uncomfortable and some practices are

412
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:12,839
uncomfortable absolutely but there's often a part of us that recognizes like oh yeah it's

413
00:54:12,839 --> 00:54:18,960
uncomfortable because it's this greater self- understanding I didn't know that part about myself and kind of

414
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:24,640
disappointed now that I see that about myself and that's really uncomfortable but there's yes so there's a part of us

415
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:31,680
that recognizes even though it's uncomfortable it's pointing us or creating the conditions or creating a foundation that

416
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:37,720
there can be greater peace and ease so healthy doubt is asking this

417
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:43,799
question does this help me is this supporting greater

418
00:54:43,799 --> 00:54:50,160
freedom is this supporting greater ease peace

419
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:57,040
wellbeing because when it's unhelpful as I said we may be just lost

420
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:03,480
we may be lost wondering I don't know these teachings Diana is talking about thousands of years ago she's talking

421
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:09,760
about like it's a good thing but maybe they're completely irrelevant because they're so old maybe there's a part of

422
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:17,240
us that uh might be think what does that have to do with you know my life today or you know how can I what the Buddha

423
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:22,680
was talking about back then Modern Life Is So Different or maybe we have this

424
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:29,599
idea yeah it's these practices or these teachings they sound nice but can I

425
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:38,559
really do them maybe it's other people can do them but can I do them in a way that's uh

426
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:45,520
what's expected or in a way that is a support for my practice so we might have doubt about

427
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:52,039
our capabilities and we might have doubt about the teachings and of course we might have

428
00:55:52,039 --> 00:55:57,280
doubt about the teacher how do we know that this person

429
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:03,440
who's currently sitting right here knows what she's talking about or you know or the Buddha or any

430
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:08,480
book you read or drama talk you listen to right we might have like H I don't

431
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:16,280
know so it's perfectly legitimate right to have some doubts we don't have to believe everything all at once so how

432
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:22,680
can we practice with it or maybe I'll say bit more talking about how to

433
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:27,960
practice with it one way to recognize when doubt is I

434
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:35,480
might say like up and running so to speak is when it's really strong there's

435
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:41,520
this way that um it's experienced as being very

436
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:49,079
authoritative and there's this way it can be really like powerful and it starts like questioning

437
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:55,720
everything we're doing and it starts um like vacillating or hesitating or not

438
00:56:55,720 --> 00:57:00,760
having any any confidence in what we're doing either like that's a waste of

439
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:07,440
time that's not right you can't do it anyway you know these types of things

440
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:14,720
and there's often the way that I'm like vocalizing this is like clear sentences and saying out loud but often there are

441
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:20,880
Quiet niggling Little Voices in the back of the mind that might even be familiar

442
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:28,440
they might be showing up in all areas of our lives so it sounds like it must be true because we hear it so

443
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:34,520
often but doubt it's is just a another

444
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:42,599
hindrance it can also it doesn't mean that it's true that we have these questions we're just

445
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:48,599
questioning and it may show up as not being able to make a commitment like okay I'm going to sit for so long or I'm

446
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:55,680
going to whatever our practices go on a retreat read a book listen to Dharma talks come here to IMC whatever it is

447
00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:01,280
they're like yeah I'll just do it when I feel like it which is you know it's a legitimate

448
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:07,400
way of practice but that's different than like you know making a commitment it's also this sense of while

449
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:13,160
you're sitting or there's got to be another way I'm sure there's an easier way there's got to be shortcuts and and

450
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:18,640
there's to be sure like there's a whole group of you know neuroscientists that

451
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:25,559
are trying to find shortcuts for a meditation practice and when it's strong we don't

452
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:30,599
do things that are beneficial for us like are actively like undermining

453
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:36,200
ourselves and we're giving up on things uh unnecessarily or giving up

454
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:43,079
prematurely before the practice has really had an opportunity to show some of the

455
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:50,680
fruit okay so how can we practice with this one just

456
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:56,880
recognize recognize the wavering the hesitation the vacillation the sense of

457
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:02,880
spinning the sense of uh not wanting to make a commitment this kind like being

458
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:08,480
like a little bit dis engaged and you can just even say those

459
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:15,839
words yep there's wavering here there's this uncertainty this vacillation there's

460
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:22,480
confusion or whatever the word might be just just to recognize that right and then then

461
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:29,440
all of a sudden we can have mindfulness of that experience and we're in the practice as opposed to it being a

462
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:34,599
hindrance something that's in the way it just starts to become the

463
00:59:35,079 --> 00:59:44,200
practice we might even um depends you know what else is happening and the the

464
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:49,680
uh surrounding situations or the conditions we might even uh notice the

465
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:56,440
fear that is often underneath doubt and then we can work with that

466
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:02,319
maybe recognize that and maybe even just name it and can we feel the fear in a

467
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:08,839
way that's supportive not in a way that's going to tip us over into overwhelm but like oh yeah there's this

468
01:00:08,839 --> 01:00:14,160
uh feeling that if I stay with this practice I'm going to lose my important

469
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:20,319
relationships or I'm not going to be as productive at work because I'm going to spend time uh

470
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:27,960
meditating or I'm going to lose my Competitive Edge or whatever it might be whatever it might be

471
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:36,240
so recognize it and sometimes that might be enough to is there a way that we can

472
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:42,280
allow the experience to be there yep there's a lot of hesitation

473
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:48,039
here and one way we can allow it to be there is to feel it in the

474
01:00:48,039 --> 01:00:53,240
body is to One Way feeling in the body is to get out of the abstract thinking

475
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:58,880
and the philosophizing and the trying to figure it out to find the right answer which you know we could just spend you

476
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:05,240
know or we could spend our whole life doing that but to kind of like uh interrupt the momentum of that kind of

477
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:13,960
thinking and figuring out and trying to get the perfect practice or the perfect answer feel in the body the bodily

478
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:19,559
experience of restlessness or uncomfortableness or this feeling of

479
01:01:19,559 --> 01:01:26,400
trying to figure things out which often is associated with maybe with a confusion like I don't know I got to

480
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:32,520
figure it out and how does that feel I notic when I said that I like leaned forward a

481
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:39,880
little bit to my body there's a way there's a I got to get it I got to go find the answer it's not here it's

482
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:47,640
elsewhere so there can be this uneasiness or a sense of heaviness

483
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:55,160
or this way in which um yeah not there's maybe not a sense of

484
01:01:55,160 --> 01:02:03,039
uprightness but instead there's a a tension and a sense of uh pushing

485
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:08,440
maybe so one way to allow the experience to be there is to feel it in the

486
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:14,520
body and the second is to remember that thoughts are just

487
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:21,039
thoughts and what are thoughts they are in substantial

488
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:26,079
ephemeral they're just coming and going and coming and going

489
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:31,160
the same way we imagine pink elephants is the same way

490
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:36,599
we imagine a better practice it's the same activity right it's completely uh

491
01:02:36,599 --> 01:02:43,279
in the mind imagined and sometimes that can be helpful to say like okay it's just

492
01:02:43,279 --> 01:02:51,400
thoughts don't worry you'll have another thought another second from now so that's two ways we can allow the

493
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:57,880
experience to be there is feel it in the body and kind of like pull the rug out out from under the authority of thoughts

494
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:03,000
thoughts are just thoughts we don't have to believe them we don't have to let

495
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:10,359
them push us around and I talked a little bit about thoughts uh I guess it was three weeks ago a little bit I did a

496
01:03:10,359 --> 01:03:15,520
whole day a whole evening on thoughts and the third thing that we can

497
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:23,400
do to work with doubt is to we might call this an antidote you know like to apply an antidote to um undermine the

498
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:27,720
doubt and one is to

499
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:35,480
investigate the opposite of Doubt is actually investigation because doubt is this way

500
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:43,079
we're like disconnected and we're not sure but if you're not sure

501
01:03:43,079 --> 01:03:49,799
you can lean in kind of like roll up your sleeves and like well what is it exactly that I have doubt about is it

502
01:03:49,799 --> 01:03:58,000
the teachings is it the teacher is it myself and just you know have this uh

503
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:03,119
have some bring some curiosity to it bring some curiosity like what is this

504
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:09,520
doubt about and sometimes that can help instead of this vague think like yeah

505
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:16,920
I'm not sure like what what is it that you're not sure about what are excuse me what are you

506
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:22,559
sure about do you are there some things you do have confidence in maybe you've seen some of the benefits of meditation

507
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:31,480
practice or benefits of loving kindness practice whatever it might be yeah so one way to an antidote is to

508
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:37,240
just investigate some people will say faith is an antidote to doubt I would

509
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:42,279
say if you have faith that's fantastic you can use that as an antidote to doubt

510
01:04:42,279 --> 01:04:48,599
but for a lot of people that's not so easy just to like oh I'll just to have faith maybe some people have devotional

511
01:04:48,599 --> 01:04:53,799
practices chanting bowing these types of things that can be

512
01:04:53,799 --> 01:04:59,799
a fantastic antidote as well but uh investigation is a antidote as

513
01:04:59,799 --> 01:05:07,359
well maybe I'll say a little bit more about uh investigation because you can also investigate just

514
01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:14,000
inquire directly is this doubt you can just ask let's kind of like Drop in that

515
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:19,480
question and then maybe the one way to answer that is to say is said was there

516
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:27,400
like an uncomfortable experience that uh started this Cascade sometimes doubt gets fueled by a

517
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:33,119
little bit of uncomfortableness and then there's this disengagement and then the disengagement

518
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:40,520
justifies Itself by saying well I'm not sure this is such a good idea anyway and all these other things but not always

519
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:45,920
but it's often uh initiated within some uncomfortable

520
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:52,359
experience so that might be uh part of the investigation that we're

521
01:05:52,359 --> 01:05:59,760
doing or maybe we could uh ask this drop in this question do we have this view do

522
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:06,720
we have this idea that things should be a certain way if this meditation practice were any

523
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:13,039
good I would be experiencing a b and c and I'm not experiencing a b and c therefore I'm not so sure about this

524
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:20,559
meditation practice there's these ways in which we bring beliefs and Views into our practice our expectations of course

525
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:27,000
we do and then sometimes when those expectations aren't met

526
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:33,200
then there starts to be doubt but maybe one way to work with doubt is to just investigate what are the expectations

527
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:38,760
what are the beliefs and the views that I've uh brought to this

528
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:44,760
practice and then also you know so drop in some of these questions and then we

529
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:49,880
have to be open to finding answers so sometimes that answers if we're in the

530
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:55,279
middle of meditation we're dropping in questions the answers will bubble up

531
01:06:55,279 --> 01:07:01,799
maybe they won't but if we investigate and we discover yeah you know actually I do

532
01:07:01,799 --> 01:07:09,559
have a specific question what's this business about rebirth I just don't get it or there's not supposed to be a self

533
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:16,039
but then who's getting reborn and then you know this is the usual question that comes up I don't have a good answer that

534
01:07:16,039 --> 01:07:24,599
will satisfy any of you just just a heads up about that so be uh willing to find answers

535
01:07:24,599 --> 01:07:30,760
maybe it's reading a book maybe it's uh talking to some other dma practitioners

536
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:39,240
maybe it's talking to a teacher maybe it's going on a retreat and uh having some extended meditation period this is

537
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:44,400
something that can help with doubt too to not only to

538
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:51,920
um uh determine what a question is but uh be willing to find some

539
01:07:54,240 --> 01:08:01,240
answers and then maybe there's this way that uh with doubt again is being uh

540
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:07,760
experienced as this hesitation or asolution maybe we could uh investigate

541
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:13,119
this uh way we can settle back and open the question or ask the

542
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:19,520
question what is happening right now that I'm not open

543
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:26,238
to what is happening right now that I'm not open to sometimes

544
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:33,480
like as I said an uncomfortable experience can like initiate a sense of

545
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:39,520
doubt and then whether it uh maybe it's

546
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:44,600
not even an antidote to doubt maybe that's just more mindfulness practice

547
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:50,880
what am I not open to right then that just brings you right back into the present moment yeah well what is going

548
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:56,560
on that I'm not tuned into that I'm not uh that I'm trying to to avoid or I

549
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:03,318
don't really want to pay attention to and that's mindfulness practice so now maybe Doubt's still

550
01:09:03,319 --> 01:09:06,440
there but it's no longer a

551
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:15,920
hindrance and then maybe the last thing that I'll say here is maybe it's kind of an antidote to that I spoke about a

552
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:24,359
little bit is to bring to mind what do I have confidence in with regards to this

553
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:30,640
practice what do you know that's been beneficial or what has been

554
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:38,120
uplifting maybe bring something that to mind maybe a memory as I said maybe some

555
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:45,600
devotional practices a way that kind of like opens the heart and relaxes the mind that

556
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:51,159
allows you to be with whatever is happening so then you're no longer

557
01:09:51,159 --> 01:09:59,199
hindered you can be back into the practice so doubt often is masquerading as wisdom

558
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:06,840
it's telling you I don't know about this and it's uh can be something that

559
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:11,920
you know causes us to abandon the practice or to turn away from

560
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:18,280
it so it can it's a hindrance that actually can be quite powerful not only because it can cause us to turn away but

561
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:24,000
also because it's often not recognized or we might have this idea

562
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:30,920
okay yeah it is doubt but I'm supposed to have faith some people think that the faith is the antidote and for some

563
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:35,960
individuals faith can be an antidote but for others maybe investigation is an

564
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:44,079
antidote and we know that investigation is a factor of Awakening and there we are right in the practice

565
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:50,760
again so maybe with that I'll end with doubt and open it up and see if there's

566
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:55,800
some questions we don't have a lot of time I'm afraid but is there a question

567
01:10:55,800 --> 01:11:00,960
about doubt that's somebody would like to ask do you have doubt about

568
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:07,440
doubt maybe you should doubt your doubt that's actually the way forward just doubt

569
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:11,000
more doubt the

570
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:21,600
doubt maybe in the back there

571
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:37,360
um my question funnily enough kind of like ties in with your doubt the doubt pun um how do you balance

572
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:42,719
between like questioning things as you're trying to

573
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:48,400
learn something new and like kind of have to ask certain questions to like

574
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:53,880
build upon an incomplete understanding um with like not wanting to ask too many

575
01:11:53,880 --> 01:12:02,560
questions that you're just like always kind of afloat and like without grounding like like in saying doubt the

576
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:08,199
doubt like you do need some doubt but you also don't need some doubt so like how do you strike that balance yeah so

577
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:14,719
the question is is it getting in the way is it hindering so do you feel like okay

578
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:20,800
um I'm disengaged from the practice and I find myself hesitating and vacillating

579
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:25,960
then that's something maybe to work with but if you're feeling like you know I'm not sure but there's a certain

580
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:32,679
willingness to still lean into the practice or to do the practice then that's the that's that's the doubt

581
01:12:32,679 --> 01:12:39,040
that's helpful and supportive for practice does that make sense yeah

582
01:12:39,639 --> 01:12:45,239
yeah okay so thank you all for your attention and you're welcome to come up

583
01:12:45,239 --> 01:12:51,199
here and ask me some questions if you like afterwards but I wish you wonderful rest of the evening thank

584
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:57,719
you and then maybe I'll say next week we'll be a different format we'll do the uh a sit and then a talk so we'll go

585
01:12:57,719 --> 01:13:02,360
