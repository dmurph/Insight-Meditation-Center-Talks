1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:08,319
good morning everyone welcome so

2
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:17,119
um it may be interesting for you to know that um whereas mostly I give talks like when

3
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:23,000
I come Sunday morning uh it's always uh my

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,640
protection to know that instead of giving a talk I can just answer questions

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:40,000
and it's a wonderful protection to have just oh I don't have to worry that just well if no talk is there then I'm uh I'm

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,520
here and um and uh today I don't have a

7
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,640
talk partly because I um all my discretionary time for the

8
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,680
last few days has been filled getting ready to be go away for a month a lot of

9
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:02,280
mean I couldn't believe how many details there were to take care of and

10
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,520
um and there's still a couple but I'm leaving right after the

11
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:14,200
butlock I'm going and to long drive to spend three weeks in the wilderness uh

12
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:22,759
teaching um kind of a Buddhist Wilderness Retreats and uh and then uh and then to

13
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:30,119
recover from that I don't think I need to recover but uh just the contrast is that then going

14
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:39,479
to go for a week backpacking with my wife so four weeks in the wilderness and um so I come

15
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:46,799
here wonderfully empty of Dharma talks so if any of you have any

16
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,000
questions you'd like to ask about anything that seems somewhat related to what we're about here at

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:01,840
IMC practice or teaching or something uh I'd be very happy to respond in some way

18
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,520
uh good morning Gil I just have a I guess it's more of a personal question if you're open to answering I'm just

19
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,760
curious how your practice has evolved over time in terms of when you

20
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:21,360
first kind of got interested in it and then what's changed what stayed the same

21
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,760
okay so a little bit try to do it short that's mean it's been 50 years

22
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:34,519
to to summarize here and um so

23
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:40,959
certainly I've suffered less uh I mean suffering is what brought me into it

24
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:48,840
didn't bring me into Buddhism I got interested for other reasons but at some point uh when I was about you know was

25
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,360
got started getting interesting interested in Buddhism when I was about 19 but uh it was a little more

26
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:02,080
intellectual but I was 22 I suffered enough that I thought okay I have to kind of deal with the suffering and uh

27
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,599
and then um and then that suffering has uh Abad you know uh sometimes in big

28
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,879
steps Quantum steps sometimes a slow gradual process and so one way my

29
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:18,599
practice has changed over the years it feels lighter you know it's a there's an ease

30
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:24,840
to the practice or lightness to it another thing that's changed is that

31
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,120
uh uh I think what uh

32
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,319
things that uh this practice did to me very important things that it did it it

33
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:40,879
this part this less and less suffering sense of ease it came with a a really a

34
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:48,560
decreasing of clinging of of being caught or attachment so there's been a steady decrease of that and I'd like to

35
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:56,040
believe that in that process there were three phases that happened the first phase was that um compassion was

36
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:03,159
awakened in me and that became a central orienting organization principle for how to live my life the second was that

37
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:08,280
loving kindness was awoken in me and that uh changed my way I related to

38
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:15,120
myself and to other people that made it a little lighter than compassion is not the compassion didn't go but it opened

39
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,440
up a whole different way of appreciating people in a very deep way and the third

40
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,840
phase was it opened up a third kind of social emotion that I call care the poly

41
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,960
word is anukampa which was a uh I a very very strongly associated with the

42
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:37,120
absence of clinging the absence of distress or tightness and so when

43
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,840
compassion loving kindness kind of meet non- clinging then it can come through

44
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:48,919
this very simple easeful kind of way of really having a profound sense of care

45
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:54,800
uh that's different than compassion different than love but it's um it's in some ways I feel it's like the

46
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:01,000
foundation for it so that was a third phase so is that answer the question

47
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,240
well

48
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:15,080
enough you can be next that scene Gil just in the last week it is percolated

49
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:25,000
to the top of my mind that I don't really understand or haven't really understood what vasana means vasana and

50
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:33,680
is vasana what we do here and um and the meaning of aasana I have intersect with

51
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,880
or or relate to um the meaning of

52
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,120
mindfulness and and the differences between mindfulness and concentration that's kind of a two or three-part

53
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:50,560
question and but just answer whatever seems most useful yeah I I appreciate that question very much because I think

54
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:58,120
uh it has been uh confusing about all the different ways the word vipasa is used and insight and mindfulness is used

55
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:04,800
and so they get some clarity about about it rather than just one big jumble assuming they're kind of the same but

56
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:11,240
doesn't seem quite right or something so um the the original

57
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:17,319
meaning uh for the word basana is that um it was not that it was

58
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:24,479
a practice people did but rather it was a it it kind of it was Insight people

59
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:32,160
had in doing the practice it refers to Insight and uh and so the the the the

60
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,240
meaning of the word Pana of V pasana means to see so it's a b particular kind

61
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,880
of seeing so that is so Insight it kind of works because the sight is in seeing

62
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:49,280
you know and the V is just a a emphatic

63
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:56,280
prefix so you can choose uh how you like to emphasize you should say it strongly

64
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:03,039
seeing or you can say you know really seeing uh uh some of my teachers or my favorite

65
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:09,080
translation is clear seeeing to give that emphasis and then the question is what

66
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:16,919
do we see and the ancient tradition was very clear what you see and um and that

67
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:24,560
this is to see the inconstancy the changing nature of our experience in some very profound way that you can't

68
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:32,240
imagine if you're seeing the change in the world which is you can see change all the time time but um but uh there's

69
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,560
a different way of experiencing the changing nature of the way that perception

70
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:46,120
Works uh when the mind is concentrated when the when the mindfulness is really clear so the word mindfulness

71
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:53,159
Sati uh refers to the nature of awareness that has the ability to see

72
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:59,560
clearly so it and um for the again for the Buddha it was Sati was never a

73
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:05,560
practice people did but it was a consequence of doing practice so in the

74
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:12,919
modern world these things have become practices so like uh you know come time see and practice mindfulness people will

75
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:20,159
say um you know you know and yes we do we're doing basana here so what's

76
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:26,520
happened is over time is these these uh insights uh have been starting to be

77
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:32,320
seen as be identified with the practices that lead to the insight to lead to this

78
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,959
clear awareness clear Sati and um and some of those things are

79
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:44,560
the ability to know clearly so so uh the recognition of the present moment

80
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:50,920
experience is not the same thing as Sati the original meaning of mindfulness but

81
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:56,600
it's become the meaning of mindfulness and um and then the people

82
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:03,040
who do that clear recognition of the present moment then that's sometimes over called

83
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,880
vasana practice and uh and kind of we don't use the word vasna here too much

84
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:15,720
to refer to ourselves we use the word insight and little bit of it it's not just because it's English I guess one

85
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:21,120
reason and because when um when the American teachers who started this

86
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,720
particular lineage that we're in Joseph Goldstein Sharon salsburg

87
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,800
um Jack cornfield they used insight to describe their first Meditation Center

88
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:39,959
Insight Meditation society and um and so then different places they call themselves insight to

89
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:45,839
associate themselves with that so Insight is a little bit little bit like you know Insight Meditation little bit

90
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:52,640
like a brand name that you know but maybe maybe it's a better word or or Association name for

91
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,680
people connected in this kind of lineage and then there's a different lineage

92
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:05,040
that use the word vpos basna centers and people say I went to I just came back from a 10day basna

93
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,240
retreat it chances are 99% that they were doing a guenka

94
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:17,160
retreat which is wonderful but they're different they practice a little differently they the the our practice

95
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,519
and their practice has the same goal but the means to it is different so

96
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:29,880
there is a difference and the same goal meaning the same Insight the same insights into inconstancy I didn't

97
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:37,880
finish it before um uh something called not self and something uh called suffering

98
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:47,279
duka so see those in a deep way so they and the VAS people gr people practice to

99
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:55,680
have the same deep Insight but get there a little different ways and so is that

100
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:02,200
enough that was a lot that was a lot know I apologize so Nancy had her hand

101
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:08,920
up before so pass it it Forward here please good

102
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:14,519
morning mush mus okay uh good morning Gil um I have a question about something

103
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:20,360
I've been exploring um some in my own uh work and teaching which is um something

104
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,399
I was inspired to explore actually from my um activities here I'm wondering if

105
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:32,680
you can talk a little bit about the connection between Beauty and and ethical mind States ah the connection

106
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:38,639
between Beauty and ethical mind States so uh every three years or so I

107
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:44,040
teach a year-long course here on uh ethics there's a three called what's

108
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:49,720
called three trainings in Buddhism there's the training in ethics the training in meditation and training in

109
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:57,480
wisdom and they're all equally important and so I do a year along course on each of those so in 2025 I'll start with the

110
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:03,040
ethics again but uh the first thing that we read for that course is an e is an

111
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,480
essay on beauty and uh because Beauty the word

112
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:16,639
for beauty that's being one of the words for beauty that's I'm referring to in ply um uh is also means being what in

113
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:22,399
English we call ethics it turns out there's no good poly word Believe It or

114
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,959
Not ancient Buddhist word that represents the English word ethics there

115
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:33,720
was a one one of the First Western professors of Buddhist ethics was really

116
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:39,600
amazed when he started looking trying to study ethics in Buddhism and um and he

117
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:46,240
couldn't find any like books or doctrines or treatises or philosophies

118
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,720
of Ethics teachings of Ethics like he had been used to in Western uh uh

119
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:59,959
theological studies that you know there's Departments of ethics for example some places and um and so so um

120
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:07,839
I think he has an article called something like morality without ethics and um and then he describes how

121
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:13,000
the historically how this word ethics was somehow because of Western cultural

122
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,880
uh reasons was kind of became its own special thing in in Buddhism ethics was

123
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:24,600
not separated from uh the whole Enterprise of Buddhism the whole enter

124
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:30,320
from Western point of view the whole Enterprise of Buddhism is ethical from the beginning all the way to

125
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:36,600
Enlightenment Enlightenment is an ethical uh experience but uh it's not kind of

126
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:42,959
called that it's just called Dharma it's just called Dharma practice or so you have to kind of read between

127
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:49,839
you have to kind of read more carefully to see that every step along the way um there's an ethical quality to it and one

128
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,959
of the characteristics of this kind of ethical quality is that um it's a

129
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:02,240
natural consequence of the mind's or the heart's Beauty and to cultivate this beauty to discover

130
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,680
this inner beauty this wholesomeness this sense of um is synonimous with

131
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,800
culturing cultivating it an ethical sensitivity which in Buddhism is defined

132
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:20,880
as Inseparable from is kind of Ethics in Buddhism is is defined as um that which

133
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:27,120
avoids causing harm but but instead causes benefit it's that easy so that's

134
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,320
the whole domain of Buddhist idea ethics and of course it can get complicated uh that you know how to

135
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:39,199
analyze that in different circumstances but um but that that orientation to not

136
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:44,680
causing harm is considered in Buddhism is profoundly beautiful and I've met

137
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:51,240
people you you really clearly feel that that's their orientation and I think they're just beautiful people the inner

138
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:59,680
beauty uh sometimes I've made meet people who uh are Inca seems like this person's incapable of of uh telling a

139
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:07,800
lie and so it's just you know just kind of you can feel it in them and I said wow that's so beautiful and so wonderful

140
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:14,880
so um so rather than rather than shaking my finger at you Nancy say you should be

141
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:21,959
ethical I'll just smile at you and say let us see your beauty your inner beauty

142
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:28,120
that would that would serve the world world well so someone back there outside had a

143
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,000
hand that I saw before for so let's uh see if we can bring that

144
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:47,199
up thank you uh I think at this time uh in the world I I don't want to go into

145
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:53,759
detail but in our country some people feel a responsibility for addressing uh a potentially very dangerous situation

146
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:59,040
for our country as a whole and uh when I think about this I remember Martin

147
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:05,800
Luther King crossing the Pettis Bridge he was leading lots of people in a civil rights protest he was in the front of

148
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:12,959
the line he was addressed by people making violent threats and he surprised people because he knelt in prayer in the

149
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:22,040
middle of the March he just knelt down and started to pray uh I wondered if you had any uh help for people in that in

150
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:29,480
that kind of situation I think some of us find ourselves in right now uh in terms of meditation or some practice we

151
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:36,600
could do that would help us right now thank you well I think uh all the Buddhist

152
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,759
practice is a preparation for that capacity and I say that because that's

153
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,880
that was really the first uh reason why I got interested in Buddhism was not my

154
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:54,680
suffering but rather was uh to be able to um step into exactly those kinds of

155
00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:01,040
situations and not be afraid of dying because it's a risky right yeah someone is I'm dedicated to

156
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:07,520
non-violence action so it's not pacifism in the sense of not doing anything but

157
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:15,438
rather you have to show up but to do it non-violently and I could see when I was 20 that uh how important that was for me

158
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:23,438
but that I I didn't know if I could do it because I felt afraid of potential death that would come and uh and I

159
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:29,440
thought Buddhism had the answer to that that issue of of uh you know of of fear of death

160
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:35,640
and that in terms of what how it's been changed I'm not afraid of death now I don't I don't particularly want to

161
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:42,200
die and uh you know I'll be careful and how I drive and things like that but um

162
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:48,919
but the um but uh I have a in a certain way a

163
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:54,880
um a kind of a positive orientation to dying uh if I could die if I'm lucky

164
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,000
enough to die consciously because it feel I imagine that it's very much like

165
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,080
a process of the deepest meditation you go into and so I so the idea oh that

166
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:11,360
would be cool so so but but more specifically

167
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:17,600
what you can do so all of Buddhist practices this so to meditate to practice and know your own mind well so

168
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:24,760
that if you get afraid if you get angry in a situation like that um it doesn't take over take you over that you know

169
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:31,880
how to stay balanced a quanus you know how to stay peaceful even no matter what's coming your way that you're able

170
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:39,880
to stand there and look someone in the eye as you know there's someone that we know that uh was at the riots in San in

171
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:46,000
San uh San Francisco State University it's called San Francisco State College back in in the

172
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,520
Vietnam War and was up against a riot police and looking you know pressed up

173
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:57,880
against him and looked him in his eye and was changed for the rest of her life by that what she saw the humanity of

174
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:04,559
that person chartman tells that story often and I've known someone who uh was

175
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:10,280
in the Civil Rights South and um was literally three days in a row was beat

176
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:16,559
up by the same white racist in in a protest or or two days MH and then the

177
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:22,240
third day the same guy came to beat her up and he had his fist up in the air to

178
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,880
strike her again and uh he he looked her in the eyes and he stopped and he said

179
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:34,000
what are you doing here and then they had a conversation and there was no more violence so to

180
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,159
have that ability is phenomenal to know yourself well and then one of the

181
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:46,000
classic Buddhist prayers that we would do is is we would uh rely on loving

182
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,039
kindness love and kindness meditation and so our equivalent perhaps of of

183
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:59,480
stopping to pray is to wish the the enemy wish the our people adver who are

184
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:05,400
fighting against or you know fighting against us um uh wish them well and

185
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:11,679
cultivate Goodwill and spread that Goodwill thanks a lot thanks a lot

186
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:17,320
Gil so so you can bring it here's we have

187
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:22,520
another mic but that helps sometimes yeah yeah here we go yeah you can keep it over there in the back end in case

188
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:28,799
someone else over there once all right this question is going to seem really trivial after all that but

189
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:36,120
um when I was first taught to meditate I was taught that one should reflect on one's intention before sitting down to

190
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:41,559
meditate I never understood that question um and I I also was conscious

191
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:48,039
of not wanting anything for meditation and so so I would so ever since I I say

192
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:54,880
my intention is to sit and meditate so I don't know if I if I've misinterpreted that or if so so when you

193
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:02,480
say that when you establish that intention at the beginning of the meditation does that support your meditation I think so but then I wonder

194
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,720
should I just not even bother doing that so so one of the answers to these kinds

195
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:13,440
of questions is uh uh find the answer for yourself and what I asked you was

196
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:20,080
the way to find it did it did it help you meditation to establish the intention to meditate at the beginning I

197
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:26,200
think so but then every time I wonder you supposed you supposed to have a better

198
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,760
better intention Okay so right you wonder if there the right intention maybe there's supposed to be something

199
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:39,240
Grand I just always reflect back to that and I said I don't understand this question

200
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:46,400
yeah the um so uh when I first started meditating as I said uh I did because I

201
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:52,919
was suffering and uh at some point um uh the

202
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:59,200
the kind of surface suffering that I had been trying to address kind of dissolved and I contributed to the

203
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,640
meditation I was doing and um and so the so that the reason for why I was

204
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:10,960
meditating was no longer there but the really weird thing was for

205
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:17,120
me was that I continued to meditate and I like to do things for reasons I'm kind

206
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,279
of a little bit you know logical or rational or something maybe and um and

207
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:29,559
so I uh I uh thought this is really strange I I'm meditating for no reason

208
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:36,520
and uh why am I doing this and I was you know I was doing twice a day I I was a college student you know undergraduate there's other things to do

209
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:43,120
if you're a graduate and um and so you know every morning every evening I meditated and

210
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:50,919
why am I doing this and um so I had that question for a long time but I still kept kept meditating so

211
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:56,080
um so the the for now I'll stop for a moment and say that's one answer you

212
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:04,039
don't have to have an intention you can just do it anyway maybe something inside deep inside knows that this is what

213
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:12,559
you're doing you want to do this there's no question which was my case eventually what I realized was that um I was

214
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:18,840
meditating uh uh as a form of self-expression not as something to

215
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:25,440
attain and uh and associated with the way that a uh an artist might paint or

216
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,039
dancer might dance as a form of expression it's not about finishing something or accomplish

217
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:38,200
anything it's the very Act of itself and and that became really important orientation for me for meditation to it

218
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:46,400
was just it wasn't wasn't the intention wasn't any more than just to let this inner expressivity flow through me that

219
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:54,000
was Deeper Than Words deeper than my emotions deep really a deep thing um some people uh give that

220
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:01,279
instructions to to connect to your intention at the beginning of a retreat the beginning of a sitting because um

221
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:07,000
then people have gave a little bit more sense of um focus on the practice uh

222
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,880
otherwise uh you know we're sitting there and thinking about what should I have for lunch you know or you know my boss

223
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:19,880
yelled at me yesterday and I really need to come back with a better rejoiner tomorrow and you know that might be

224
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:26,000
important but uh it's maybe meditation is more important and so uh and so to be

225
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,320
reminded oh this my intention is to and is to really sit and be focused and be

226
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,360
here and so that kind of lets the kind of the extra stuff fall away and we're

227
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:43,640
more here to do it if it doesn't happen that doesn't help you you're more than

228
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:49,159
welcome to drop it there's no shoulds in this practice the only should would be

229
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:54,840
for you to learn how to be your own teacher in the practice so you so by trial and error find out what works for

230
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:01,080
you what doesn't work but it does help if you have an some kind of sense of why you're

231
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:06,240
practicing what you're practicing for and um so what I like to do and I

232
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,919
don't want to mess you up even more what I like I what uh um I one of

233
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:17,279
the great exercises I think is to ask yourself I I did that for a year every

234
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:22,360
day ask yourself the question what is your deepest intention what or what is

235
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:28,399
your deepest sense of purpose what's your deepest sense of meaning that you have and uh and what it was great to to

236
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:36,039
do it over a year was I I started going through all these different answers and I had one answer and then the next day

237
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:43,760
somehow support me to go a little bit further a little bit further sometimes I had uh negative answers like um I don't

238
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:50,840
want to be afraid anymore that's my intention but if it's negative then I'd ask myself well

239
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:56,200
Gil if you were not afraid what would your intention then be and that would

240
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:01,360
drop me into a deeper place and it would change over time it was really great and

241
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:07,080
um and and then but then I think this question is so our lives are so

242
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:13,159
important so valuable that if you're asking answering that question for

243
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:19,000
yourself and you don't see how meditation relates to that maybe you

244
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,279
shouldn't meditate thank you that's all is that okay answer Al also pretty

245
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:35,320
lengthy we have questions from the h yes sir so we got two online questions

246
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:43,320
I'll ask first Pat Ho's question how is Dharma attended to in

247
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:51,200
personal relationships especially family and intimate others like wives and

248
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:02,240
children um well I think that in these relationships

249
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:07,960
there's a higher degree of of

250
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:13,200
uh um connection emotional connection

251
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:22,279
there's a higher degree of whether we know it or not there's a higher degree of um impact what we do and and U

252
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:29,080
benefit that can come from the relationship that um that uh it I think one of the things

253
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:35,360
Buddhist practice does is for us to appreciate the the the privacy of those

254
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:42,600
relationships or the depth of those relationships or the potentiality of those relationships and for Buddhists what I

255
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:52,440
like to believe is that when we have these kind of more primary relationships that um um to

256
00:27:52,440 --> 00:28:00,760
always discover how to love the other to always be able to um find you

257
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:09,559
know something like love or Compassion or care and at different times different ones will be operating but um but my

258
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:14,960
belief is that is that least I'll say it for myself at some point uh in my

259
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:22,159
Buddhist practice I felt it was possible um to find a way to love

260
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:28,120
everyone and it was only then that I felt uh Inspire inspired or something or

261
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:33,880
transpired was not the right word word but I felt um I could uh be get behind

262
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:41,240
being married and uh because I thought this is the person I want to always discover

263
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:47,559
where I can find the love no matter what happens yes we'll grow separate and yes we'll have different things that happen

264
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:54,960
and all kinds of things but I I want to I want to always I know you love can be Universal and I always want to come this

265
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:01,559
person I have committed to always coming and finding it so I think to have that a primary characteristic of the

266
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:08,720
relationship means that we're dedicated to not letting anything interfere with the clarity and the

267
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:16,519
openness of the relationship so we don't let hate or angry or resentment or Envy or we don't

268
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:26,000
let uh greed or expectations or lust or or um um projection projecting our needs

269
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,600
or our values onto the other because all those things makes the water muddy we

270
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:37,679
want to we want to have this clear you know clear seeing or a clear space in

271
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:45,799
every relationship we're in and so that takes a lot of self-work you know to really recognize okay now I'm resentful

272
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:51,000
now I'm angry I guess I have work to do this now now this is part of my practice

273
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:58,159
and even if you can't let go of the anger or the fear or the hostility or the resentment or or sometimes the the

274
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:03,519
the worst that can happen to someone is they close they they shut down they

275
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:09,840
close their heart to some other people I have no anger yes but your heart's

276
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:16,279
closed and um and so and so the part of the purpose of mindfulness and practice

277
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:21,799
in Buddhism is to always bring enough attention to yourself to really see

278
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:27,039
where the tension is where the stress is where the where we shut down where the

279
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:32,159
UNH wholesome non- beautiful parts of the heart are

280
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:40,200
taking predominance and to not believe in it not trust in it not prioritize it

281
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:47,159
not uh give into it and and um that might not automatically help us to love

282
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:53,120
other people but if we we try to jump over to the love before we do this inner

283
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:58,559
work the love might not be so genuine so in Buddhism at least always

284
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:05,360
this deeper look deeper look here look here look this is my work this is my work and as soon as you say this is my

285
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:13,399
work then you're starting to become free from the to from being caught in some of

286
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:20,240
the ways that we get attached in relationships and with with deep primary

287
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:26,639
relationships uh the attachments sometimes are the very uh deepest ones we

288
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:34,639
have um and so the stakes are pretty high in these relationships because if you're

289
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:40,120
really going to let go fully whoa that's scary in these

290
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:46,559
relationships I mean I can't let go of that but Buddhism says you can and the

291
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:53,679
reason you can is that the love the compassion the care the respect and

292
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:59,240
maybe the commitment remains that doesn't have to go away when there's no

293
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:04,840
attachment in fact I'd like to believe that uh the love is actually better when

294
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:12,320
we we've let go fully and um and so um so so that's

295
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:18,399
that's so I don't know if that answered the question for how we but that's my best

296
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:24,159
effort thank you one more question from Jamie

297
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:31,200
Andrews is there a connection between nonself and emptiness are they from different

298
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,360
Traditions oh well thank you Jamie I remember you fondly from the many times

299
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:42,399
you sat here in this room so

300
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:54,679
um uh yes and no there are uh the way that um these top these ideas of

301
00:32:54,679 --> 00:33:00,519
emptiness and not self are taught very in different Buddhist traditions and

302
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:08,519
there's one school of Buddhism called Mahayana Buddhism which is the Buddhism of kind of East Asia especially Tibet

303
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:13,600
and East Asia and um and they made a specialty around the philosophy and the

304
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,799
practice and the insights of emptiness so you know so they go to town to talk

305
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:24,399
about all the different forms of emptiness and and when you spent 2,000 years with the philosophy of emptiness

306
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:31,159
you can imagine that it's varied and Rich and and if you want to you know you

307
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:36,240
could you could spend a lifetime as a Buddhist scholar uh digging into the

308
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,440
different teachings on emptiness and but in the earliest form

309
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:47,960
of Buddhism uh it's there as well but in our tradition um there's a connection

310
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:56,080
between emptiness and and there's a number of connection between emptiness and not self and one of them is that um

311
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:01,799
the uh every thing the inside this vipasana that we have the deep inside

312
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:06,960
the clear seeing some point we don't have to believe in this we don't have to understand it you philosophically or

313
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:14,679
read a book to understand it but it's something that becomes obvious it's revealed to the eyes in a completely

314
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:21,040
obvious way nothing could be clear be clear as the practice deepens that uh

315
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:26,480
nothing in our world of our experience or they say differently

316
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:32,960
everything in the world of our experience is absent of

317
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:40,440
self so so you know so so you know of course for many people that's

318
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:49,200
outrageous I mean what you know well what am I you know do I disappear do I not exist what goes on here and uh and

319
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:55,960
so no you're just fine but uh but there isn't this uh

320
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:02,040
coagulation around a concept cep ideas around self even the very simple feeling

321
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:08,119
of amness I am if there's a feeling for that in Buddhism they say that's not

322
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:15,119
quite free yet there the very very little constellation of amness we feel

323
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:20,560
even when that Fai dissolves that's freedom but you're still there you're

324
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:27,280
still you know fine um so I don't know if that answers Jamie's question well enough but maybe

325
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:34,720
that's enigmatic enough to u to spark your curiosity around this

326
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:40,160
topic so there's a question way back in the outer Hall can we pass it back there

327
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,640
and oh sorry about that Kurt you can ask

328
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:54,599
afterwards um thanks Gil um you spoke a lot about K SE can you turn it up the

329
00:35:54,599 --> 00:36:01,599
volume a little bit I think you spoke a lot about about suffering being a motivation for no no

330
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:07,480
know it's yeah if you hold it uh horizontally yeah oh there we go okay um

331
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:13,599
guess you spoke a lot about suffering being a motivation and think that's something that deeply resonates um for

332
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:19,680
where I am in my practice I feel a lot of sadness still and so I wanted to I

333
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:26,000
guess want to ask if you have any can talk to more about kind of how to what can be supportive for practice when

334
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,920
there's still a lot of sadness for kind of the sufferings going on in what's around us great great yeah well thank

335
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:38,079
you yeah with the uh there is a ancient teaching in Buddhism idea that everyone

336
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:43,839
comes to Buddhism because of suffering not everyone realizes that but one way

337
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:50,599
other people come that and then the suffering has to take some flavor 31 Flavors of

338
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:57,119
suffering and so uh I I I have tremendous value uh I really appreciate

339
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:03,280
very much someone coming up and just saying matter of factly my flavor is sadness you know this is this because it

340
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:09,520
has to be something and but be so clear about it and open about it I think you're well on your way to finding

341
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:16,040
finding your way with it so thank you and um the first thing that occurred to me

342
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:21,240
and I don't know if it's I don't know why it occurred to me I don't know if it's particular to something I'm

343
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:28,200
understanding about you just with a question or maybe it's just me maybe that um uh the the first thing I would

344
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:34,920
like to say is uh be a sad Buddha and I say that in the sense that

345
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:39,960
a sad Buddha means um don't feel like it's don't don't try to fix it or make

346
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:46,359
it different or feel bad about yourself for being sad it's sadness sadness often

347
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:53,240
needs needs time it needs to have to be allowed to be there and many people

348
00:37:53,240 --> 00:38:00,720
don't know how to let sadness be there I mean they they they know they know their sad but then they're adding layers of

349
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:07,040
reactivity on top of it I shouldn't be sad I'm I'm wrong but I'm sad I mean after all I'm a Buddhist I'm supposed to

350
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:13,040
be always smiling and loving and you know but I'm not now a bad Buddhist because I'm sad so there's layers of

351
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:18,359
things that we do or just might feel so uncomfortable the body tenses up or you

352
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:24,720
might feel so discouraged because whatever reason and um so the F so this

353
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:30,480
idea of just being a sad Buddha is to find a way to just allow it to be there

354
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:37,040
and then what we do in mindfulness practice is once we can learn how to be very simple make space for it allow it

355
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:42,960
to be there as if it has permission to be there uh then we can begin maybe uh

356
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:49,640
seeing it more clearly uh find out uh not to understand it you know to analyze

357
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:55,000
it but to really get uh deep more deeply familiar what's the roots of it in our

358
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,720
body how does it play out in the body body and part of the benefit of feeling

359
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,920
emotions like this in the body is the body is a processing

360
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:11,520
center that works much better than the mind and so it's a kind of way of

361
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:17,760
getting out of the way helping you to get out of the way of the emotions so the motion part of emotions can operate

362
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:23,760
it can be in moving and all emotions want to move so even sadness wants to do

363
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:30,920
something and what's sometimes these more uh you know painful emotions uh

364
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:39,160
before they can heal or become better or do what they need to do um they need to be stronger so then the practice if you

365
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:44,880
have enough practice you start having confidence it's okay I have the ability to be present to be with it as it gets

366
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:53,000
stronger and hold it be a sad Buddha and um and um so I have a lot of respect for

367
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:59,400
sadness I think sadness is something really important inside of us that something and something my idea about

368
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:06,720
sadness is that it's a The Harbinger the of something that wants to be born

369
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:11,839
inside and what is it that wants to be born so the ability to just allow it to

370
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:17,839
be there give it permission to be there to look go deeper see what else is there

371
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:25,880
and sometimes sadness underneath sadness might be hurt and so maybe the hurt needs more time sometimes uh uh below

372
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:34,440
that hurt might be love and maybe that love now has a chance to grow and and and and inform how we

373
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:41,240
relate to the challenges we've been in uh or maybe uh you know sadness and

374
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:47,800
depression sometimes are not so different and we have a culture I think now in the

375
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:54,920
west that I think has developed a very negative attitude towards depression that somehow it's wrong and

376
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:01,400
you should you should fix it as soon as you can you know anti-depressant medication and sometimes uh depression

377
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:06,440
and sadness is a kind of a a allow is a kind of I think of it as a little bit of

378
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:12,280
as a fallow time that something wants to work

379
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:19,599
through or something new wants to come and sometimes we need to give ourselves the time quality time in being sad being

380
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:26,480
depressed just to see if there's something else that wants to come that we're missing out on that and um and if

381
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:32,200
we don't allow give that some people don't give themselves that time and they rush into what's next what they think

382
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:37,599
they should be doing something kind of lingers deep inside that is never that

383
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:45,720
remains unresolved so anyway is that is that I'm just I'm just talking a lot today but is

384
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:53,400
that enough or you want to ask another question that because it's an important question so if there's something more

385
00:41:53,400 --> 00:42:00,079
specific please I'll digest that more and then I feel like and then in some other time we

386
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:06,560
can talk more yeah if there other questions well maybe we're almost ready to stop maybe Kur if you have if you

387
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:14,200
think my answer can be short well I'm not sure about your

388
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:20,520
answer being short but my question is this and I and I have to say that all

389
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:27,720
that you've been talking about today have sort of been answers towards my question I'm about to ask but maybe you

390
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:34,240
could um elaborate even further my question is this um given the political

391
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:40,520
nature and I'm going to use words like Trump and Biden um so forgive me

392
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:47,000
everybody or don't but here's my question um I am

393
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,640
experiencing and I know a lot of people are experiencing um a lot of fear

394
00:42:52,640 --> 00:43:00,880
anxiety uh uh judgment and rage and anger okay so I'm I I find myself filled

395
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:06,760
with all of those things with respect to this fellow uh uh Donald Trump and I

396
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:11,800
fear given the last debate I fear that he has a good chance to win so my

397
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:18,760
question is this Gil can you give some words and thoughts to the how one like

398
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:25,000
myself can uh respond if in fact he wins but even if he doesn't

399
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,800
just I am so judgmental and and fearful and resentful

400
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:39,559
all these things so you get it so are there any more thoughts you can give to how one like myself like I can respond

401
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:45,920
to these possibilities and I know part of it's my future projecting but anyway that's my

402
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:52,599
question so you know real short answer please yeah

403
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:03,240
I think one of the huge issues in the world these days but also in this

404
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:10,800
country here is um not political it's uh

405
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:16,280
hate and uh and

406
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:24,000
fear and the and the for the kind of divisiveness that comes from that in all

407
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,680
directions you know uh and uh and

408
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:36,119
um and if there's going to be a solution that's really going to be

409
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:41,760
valuable there has to be some deep addressing of this issue of divisiveness and

410
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:47,119
hate and that work can only

411
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:54,359
happen at the individual level so it needs to start with

412
00:44:54,359 --> 00:45:01,119
you and if you're so so mesmerized so

413
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:07,480
enamored so obsessed with what's happening out there

414
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:13,119
you're actually missing yourself in a profound way and probably the more that

415
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:20,319
you're Pro concerned out there the more there's a need for you to

416
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:25,359
really drop down deep inside of yourself to see what's really going on for you

417
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:33,119
there's probably some form of suffer uffing in you that's actually primary that's responsible for

418
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:39,720
this orientation and and um that's

419
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:45,119
external and this um expectation that

420
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:50,200
the answer is out there and someone is supposed to fix

421
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:57,240
it but the real isue is hate and that that's divisiveness and the fear do your

422
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:05,040
work and in the meantime while you're doing that if you're really concerned about any kind of world situations

423
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:11,680
strong enough uh part of people one of the reason that people feel like what you're doing is they feel

424
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:18,240
helpless do something do something anything at all that addresses what you're most concerned with even if it's

425
