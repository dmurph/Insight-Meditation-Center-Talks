1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,320
welcome uh welcome folks nice to see uh see some names over there yeah a lot

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:17,560
of um warm associations so so welcome uh we'll sit as we do I'll

3
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:24,920
guide something I don't know what we'll see what uh the moment brings and

4
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:31,960
um yeah can uh enjoy each other virtually

5
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:54,840
so just gently take your Dharma posture posture of your

6
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,960
heart for

7
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:41,320
tranquility and alertness in some Dynamic tension

8
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,960
sometimes we stretch up towards the

9
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,360
sky our

10
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,960
spine but then give the rest of our body

11
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,240
to the downward pull of the earth

12
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,879
gravity e

13
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,840
craving clinging holding on

14
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,640
attachment creates waves of

15
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:30,440
tension it's so hard to control

16
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:45,920
experience some part of us never wants to go let

17
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:52,680
go maybe another part of us

18
00:03:53,519 --> 00:04:00,000
is really ready to surrender

19
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,239
surrender to the goodness and the imperfection of this

20
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:13,200
moment and in that gesture of surrender

21
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,560
the possibilities become more

22
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:29,360
apparent so before we even try to pay attention to something

23
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,440
we notice the little whirl

24
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:45,120
pools of holding on and control of shaping

25
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:53,440
ourselves of proving ourselves getting

26
00:04:56,039 --> 00:05:01,000
somewhere and we deeply

27
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,639
relax

28
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:57,599
and yeah you don't get to have the exact life thought you wanted

29
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:08,000
nobody gets the exact life they

30
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:23,759
wanted so whatever heartache there may be in a

31
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:32,759
very small microcosm way or big we we just breathe into

32
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,560
that for

33
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:50,919
and here here is my life this moment this

34
00:07:53,199 --> 00:08:01,440
breath this is what it's like to be me to be human

35
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,080
then let me honor

36
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:20,360
it by not pushing and pulling on it molding

37
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,599
and shaping

38
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,760
and so now paying attention to our

39
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,720
breathing is not a a

40
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:08,880
test it's not a

41
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,240
task but a kind of

42
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
pleasure

43
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
for

44
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

45
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
e

46
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
e

47
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
e

48
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,160
e for

49
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:06,240
that we can influence our life creates the illusion that we control it or we

50
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:14,199
own it but we don't exactly own our

51
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:26,120
life and meditation is a way of honoring

52
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,079
that e

53
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:14,959
in management it said uh you give an employee a lot of uh

54
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:24,680
responsibility very little power so very painful inheritance very

55
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:32,160
compromized and that's kind of how our mind

56
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,959
feels a world of responsibility not much

57
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,800
power and so we're very

58
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:55,199
anxious frantically adjusting any knob we can get our hands

59
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,199
on

60
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,399
can we

61
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,920
trust

62
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
awareness

63
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

64
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

65
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

66
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

67
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

68
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,760
e e

69
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,440
thinking is

70
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,679
coping nothing wrong with

71
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,120
coping but uh maybe

72
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:06,520
we don't uh need to cope with this

73
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:15,000
moment but inste can receive it heart can be penetrated by

74
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:30,080
it can trust this moment to become wisdom

75
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
love

76
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

77
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

78
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

79
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

80
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

81
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

82
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

83
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

84
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

85
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

86
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

87
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

88
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
e

89
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,158
e e

90
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,080
e

91
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:39,440
okay so uh yeah good to good to sit with you it's a little bit of a somber

92
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:45,919
meditation but um my heart is

93
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:52,080
good so um question that was submitted some some

94
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:58,640
weeks ago um says uh uhen goenka

95
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,919
Goa says attachment and suffering are always found

96
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:10,760
together he says we're addicted to the condition of craving the object is

97
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:17,519
secondary craving becomes a habit we cannot break is interesting to me because when

98
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:23,840
I look at the object of craving then it fades a kind of letting go could you

99
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:31,919
talk about the condition of craving and how to feel that seems it would be uh

100
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:37,240
going more to the heart of the matter

101
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:43,200
so um I thought to let that be a kind of

102
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:49,240
I'll kind of try to answer but uh let that be the launching

103
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:54,600
point so the the the bud said um to

104
00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:02,080
study study the the the Dharma is to study causality cause and effect cause

105
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:08,080
and effect causes and conditions supporting conditions this is the realm

106
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:13,799
of course of uh of science where in in a in an experiment

107
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:19,720
you sort of control everything to isolate the cause and then see what the

108
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:24,799
effects are and generally in Buddhist circles

109
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:32,000
the interest is in one particular effect effect namely

110
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:41,480
suffering and suffering is the the effect of of causes of the the tradition

111
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:47,279
highlights craving and clinging attachment clinging is the kind of

112
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:53,320
elaboration and strategizing sponsored by the

113
00:31:54,159 --> 00:32:01,760
craving so but suffering um is is also uh is not merely an effect it's

114
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:07,320
a Cause right it can be the cause

115
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:14,960
of um of tremendous goodness or tremendous destruction are

116
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:20,600
suffering a lot of our path is like okay how do we how how can suffering be a

117
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:29,000
cause of goodness our suffering leads to the critical realization of like I don't

118
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:35,639
know what's going on exactly maybe I've been wrong maybe there's a

119
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:41,320
path suffering can be a cause for purification the untangling of the heart

120
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:47,519
from greed and hate suffering can be the cause of love and understanding and

121
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:55,159
suffering of course can be the cause of more problems bad

122
00:32:55,159 --> 00:33:00,279
strategies that grow out of our suffering uing meant to manage suffering

123
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:07,679
but compound it the cyclical nature of

124
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:13,320
it normally the formulation is

125
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:18,639
craving leads to suffering craving and clinging lead to

126
00:33:18,639 --> 00:33:25,559
suffering but I think as step Bachelor added also suffering leads to craving

127
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:34,840
the reverse suffering leads to craving unhappiness leads us to

128
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:42,760
Crave so much of our compulsive acquisition and materialism and is a

129
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:51,200
function of that right so much so much fantasizing about

130
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:59,120
some perfect pleasure you know that that that that fantasizing emerges out of

131
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:05,760
sense of incompleteness but it's not just

132
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:12,358
um objects that cause craving it's not that there are things out there in the

133
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:18,638
world and that causes the craving right even if

134
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:25,800
Donuts had never been invented no human had ever heard of a

135
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:31,040
donut I would still want

136
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:38,638
donuts it's not that the objects cause craving craving

137
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:43,679
points us back the seeds lie

138
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:49,560
within and maybe we say craving is the condition of

139
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:53,359
needing anything to

140
00:34:54,599 --> 00:35:01,040
change it's a kind of tension and craving is the sort of natural response

141
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:06,599
to suffering when we do not have Equanimity

142
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:14,800
Clarity it's the natural response to suffering something's wrong all right what do I do crave

143
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,680
something crave some answer some soothing some pleasure

144
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:28,560
some the riddle to be resolved right and so craving is is a craving suffering

145
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:35,680
very very closely knotted together and I say that that's kind of

146
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:41,760
bold language in a way but don't you know it's not don't get idealistic about

147
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:49,200
it should I not crave oxygen not crave food or something no just don't try to

148
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:56,520
find the you know the kind of far end case and then sort of reason

149
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:05,839
your way out of it no just study your mind study your mind to be uh free of craving free of

150
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:13,880
compulsivity that is at the heart of of freedom and there's something in us that

151
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:21,839
so deeply longs to be free from craving we essentially want that more than the

152
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:27,240
object right we can only imagine the end of craving by getting What We crave

153
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:34,040
getting fill in the blank right but

154
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:41,480
um sometimes I almost see that as like the whole world like

155
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:48,800
longing for nibana longing for for the

156
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,920
Dharma and yet we try to get there

157
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:02,640
through Amazon whatever right what we want is the

158
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:09,400
cessation of craving because it's so

159
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:16,400
painful and yet in this cycle of dissatisfaction and

160
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:22,480
craving and acquisition that's been reinforced just endlessly

161
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:28,480
endlessly and so it's something like we could talk about in different ways

162
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,640
but um it's something like incompleteness or

163
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:40,560
suffering craving acquisition partial

164
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:49,039
fulfillment partial heartbreak repeat until we

165
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:58,400
die I I try to be careful about uh what's called like concept creep you

166
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:05,640
know using a word like uh addiction or something which is

167
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:12,640
the example at hand using a word in broader and broader ways defining it

168
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:19,920
down and I want to be careful about that but there is some parallel with this

169
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:27,880
kind of like I I don't want to say that a you know a casual longing for a nice piece

170
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:33,640
of clothing or a tasty bite of food or something is the is is addiction or

171
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:39,720
something but there are some some parallels to the

172
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:46,720
cycle and um George CB who's a kind of prominent

173
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:53,240
addiction researcher leads National Institute on uh alcohol abuse and

174
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:59,240
alcoholism um characterized the this this cycle and

175
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:06,800
so Cub writes uh addiction can be conceptualized as a thre stage recurring

176
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:12,520
cycle binge and intoxication withdrawal and negative

177
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:17,560
affect feeling and then preoccupation anticipation

178
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:23,640
craving that worsens over time and involves neuroplastic changes in the

179
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:31,400
brain rewards stress and executive function systems goes on to say like the concept

180
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:37,359
of an anti-reward we normally talk about drugs as like rewarding Pleasures as

181
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:42,640
rewarding right but there's an anti-reward system was developed they

182
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:49,359
say to explain neuro adaptations in response to the excessive

183
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:55,480
utilization of the brain reward system it's compelling evidence that the brain

184
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:00,920
stress and emotional systems are recruited as a result of excessive

185
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:07,480
activation of the reward system and provide an additional source of negative

186
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:14,480
hedonic veence unpleasantness the combination of a deficit in the rward system and the

187
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:21,040
recruitment of the brain stress systems provides a powerful motivational

188
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:28,160
State mediated in part by the anti-reward system the

189
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:35,920
our body punishing us when we don't get what we are conditioned to

190
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:42,800
want as a bad cycle there's a lot of pain in

191
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:50,240
that and that reaches its peak in the context of

192
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:58,319
addiction um but they're even below the thresh hold of addiction

193
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:07,440
we can recognize ourselves in some of that so how do we deal with with craving

194
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,800
well it's partially maybe we say the the whole path but

195
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:20,200
um a few things uh come to mind

196
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:28,839
so partially we become awake to the disappointment involved in that process

197
00:41:28,839 --> 00:41:36,880
the disappointment in it you know we we don't focus on the object of

198
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:42,839
craving we we actually start to notice how painful the condition of craving

199
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:49,720
is even for that which we love we pay attention to the

200
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:56,240
unfulfillment the partial heartbreak the withdrawal the negative

201
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:02,960
feeling the cyclical loopiness of the whole

202
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:08,960
thing and sometimes we really renounce for a

203
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:14,119
while like retreat or even just a sit for half an

204
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:19,599
hour we really renounce and that actually winds up

205
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:25,200
sensitizing our system to pleasure just like kind of anti-reward system in

206
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:31,400
response to the bombardment of our reward system to

207
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:39,400
actually sober up and then we actually become more sensitized to pleasure we need less of

208
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:44,800
it to feel really good to feel happy and maybe

209
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:52,280
just the a nice day nice Sunset is more than

210
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:57,640
we need sometimes we bore

211
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:08,119
right into the kind of the belly of the Beast uh equinity with intense feeling

212
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:15,078
you know craving is a kind of commandment to

213
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:21,319
act everything it feels like every cell in our body is conspiring to get us to

214
00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:27,000
move to make a move and we just stay

215
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:37,440
and then sometimes just in a moment sometimes very gradually we get happier we get happier

216
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:42,480
on the path

217
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:49,040
and the more fulfilled we are the less incomplete we

218
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:54,359
feel we don't need to be completed we already

219
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:58,640
are and so

220
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:06,319
craving is a a kind of strategy that at least

221
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:13,599
temporarily is unnecessary I offer this for your

222
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:19,800
um consideration and uh happy to to uh

223
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:28,160
dwell in this uh path with you be uh away next week back on the the

224
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:33,640
14th so hope to to see you then and

225
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:38,400
