from david white w-h-y-t-e

11
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:18,320
from where many rivers meet 1990 and here is the poem

14
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:42,320
this opening to the life we have refused again

15
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,960

16
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,960

18
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:09,119
practice together enough relaxing into enoughness

19
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,879
as always uh i'll start our guided meditation with a few minutes

20
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:21,440
of being with the breath and the body and maybe that will just be enough

21
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,920
for the rest of our time together so all right so i

22
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,519
invite you to get into your meditation posture

23
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,480
whatever is appropriate for you in this moment

24
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,840
moving lying down sitting up straighter whatever it needs to be

25
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,840
letting it be enough

26
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,840
opening up to however the body is in this moment

27
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,200
letting the body whatever

28
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,640
way it's showing up in this moment whether it's tired

29
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:38,799
whether it has a headache if it's excited

30
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:48,879
what if it's a key if it's light

31
00:03:53,519 --> 00:04:00,400
it's bubbly with excitement or anxiety

32
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,840
if it's calm and settled

33
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,319
however this body is showing up

34
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,040
this heart and this mind

35
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,800
welcoming with arms

36
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,840
that say this is enough

37
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,840
enough

38
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:24,080
letting this breath

39
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,840
it moves through the body

40
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:40,800
however it's showing up offering it safety

41
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:53,840
friendliness this is enough this breath is enough

42
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,160
and if thoughts are rising

43
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:01,919
thank you thoughts hello thoughts and you know what's happening right here

44
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,960
just sitting just being with the breath is enough

45
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:13,280
this is enough i'm bowing to the thoughts

46
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,479
not now not now ever so gently

47
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,599
this is enough

48
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,840
nothing needs to be different

49
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,400
we don't make a problem out of it

50
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:44,319
it's just yes and whatever is in this moment right now

51
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:59,840
in this experience experience it's enough

52
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:10,800
taking refuge the simplicity of this moment

53
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,839
just sitting and breathing

54
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,560
i'll read the poem by david white one more time

55
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,839
and let it wash over you

56
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:03,839
enough these few words

57
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,480
are enough

58
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:17,839
if not these words this breath

59
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:31,839
if not this breath this sitting here

60
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:44,000
this opening to the life

61
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,279
we have refused

62
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:58,000
again and again

63
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:12,399
until now until now

64
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:22,800
if not these words this breath if not this breath is sitting here

65
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,120
this opening to life

66
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,959
enough

67
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,839
enough

68
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:17,919
if we don't fight with reality if we don't push away what is

69
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:26,158
what's here right now with aversion

70
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,440
softening into this body this breath this moment

71
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:44,880
embracing embracing enough enoughness

72
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:54,080
an act of friendliness with ourselves [Music] and a radical shift

73
00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:03,840
in our perception and our perspective

74
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:10,240
this moment just this moment not the last one not the future one just right

75
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:17,840
here right now this one is

76
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:26,880
this breath this lived life in this moment's experience

77
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,840
contentment

78
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,840
enough

79
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,840
this

80
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:24,799
it doesn't need to be more than what it is right now this is enough it's plenty

81
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:47,840
any different anymore any less

82
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:30,559
if there is any resistance of reality as it is can that too be included

83
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:39,840
in the friendliness to be enough

84
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:49,039
to offer that safety it's okay don't have to reject rejection see what

85
00:26:49,039 --> 00:27:07,840
shifts if that's the case that's present

86
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:19,840
maybe this practice opening to enough

87
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,279
also supports seeing the ways in which

88
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:33,679
the mind interprets this not to be enough the ways that it's

89
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:40,799
critical this is not enough you're not enough and can that be seen with kindness and

90
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:47,840
care you are enough this is enough

91
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:53,200
what if what if we invite that perception

92
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,880
for the last few moments

93
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:15,840
you are enough i am enough this moment is enough

94
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:30,159
for the last minute

95
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,039
let's practice

96
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:43,600
what if we chose what if we inclined our intention

97
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:54,240
to contentment or whatever this period of practice showed up as

98
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:03,120
to be content that we showed up and we tried as best as we could to be content with that attempt not try

99
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:09,200
to change the past re-engineer the past

100
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:21,358
and to appreciate our gratitude be content with whatever arose

101
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,398
or did not arise

102
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:35,838
our wholehearted intention to sit

103
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:41,760
and come together in community has been

104
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:49,839
enough

105
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:17,440
[Music]

106
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:45,839
so enough contentment enoughness

107
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,520
so i notice that

108
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:58,480
i feel much calmer and soothed and settled

109
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:06,240
after this period of practice which was quite bare taking a line

110
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,160
from david white's poem

111
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:17,599
these few words are enough so we had few words tonight tonight

112
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:26,800
in the spirit of enoughness contentment more of a maybe zen style of

113
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:32,079

00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:25,760
[Music] to practice in sangha

145
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:34,720

146
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:42,240
30 seconds of silent meta silent enoughness maybe silently as you're sitting feeling

147
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,359
i'm enough and you're enough as an expression of meta as an expression

148
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:53,280
of friendliness and see what that feels like in the interpersonal field and then you

149
00:40:53,280 --> 00:41:00,640
can share right you practice say a few words or not maybe silence is enough just that's

150
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:09,599
lovely actually to cultivate the comfort to sit in silence with others or share words so see see whatever

00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:31,920
accomplishing anything yay i sc absolutely

168
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:39,599
celebrate this is absolutely fantastic that there was this sense of non-doing

169
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:44,720
their sense of ease that's fantastic richard

170
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:52,480
yay and it sounds like this is the first time in a long while or ever or the way you're putting it

171
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:59,200
same how did it feel i mean i i know your inner wisdom knows that wow this is good this is wow

172
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:06,800
this is easeful well i i always feel that i have

173
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:12,400
an agenda or something or a um you know so i have to use some method i

174
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:18,240
have to like concentrate or count my breasts or something or other

175
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:27,680
or pay attention to work to pay attention and this was just sort of accepting whatever you know

176
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:34,960
it's enough it was enough yeah yeah yeah

177
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:42,880
yeah it is enough and um i so appreciate you raising this

178
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:49,359
because this is such an important point and it's so subtle actually what you are bringing to the

179
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:55,040
fore to the light it's often so subtle

180
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:00,880
that we use the same mind that we use for everything else in our lives

181
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:07,599
the same mind we apply the same mind that wants to get wants to do wants to

182
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:13,119
be wants to accomplish wants to attain uh our profession in our profession

183
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:19,839
especially in the west we bring the same type of mind to our meditation

184
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:26,800
and this is what we do this is what we all do richard until we notice wait a minute that feels like

185
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:32,079
a lot of work and we get tight and knots and it's effortful and then we don't want to meditate because

186
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:38,480
it's too much work i'm not getting anywhere and yet the secret actually is the sense

187
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:44,880
of easing into relaxing into the sense of openness and friendliness

188
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,920
with reality the right effort wise effort because

189
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:55,920
wanting to do do do is too much efforting and sometimes if there's absolutely no

190
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:02,960
it's just you know our mind is just wandering all over the place you know that's too little effort but the sweet spot

191
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:10,000
after we've experienced the the two ends so it's okay to go you know we will never ever always get

192
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:16,480
it right on we will miss and it's perfectly fine that's how you tune a bow

193
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:23,599
and there's there's similes that the buddha teaches about effort that too tight is like tuning

194
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:30,000
a bowed instrument sometimes it's too tight sometimes it's too loose and that's a part of it so what you're

195
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:37,760
sharing is that oh your instrument your mind has been too tight wow it's been like like wow what is how

196
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:45,760
different it is how lovely how my words not yours lovely how easeful maybe how easeful it is that but no

197
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:52,880
guilt feeling because that sense of ease actually can open you to finding itself because meditation

198
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:59,599
shouldn't feel like too much effort this ease full feeling is a part of it

199
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:05,040
so please don't feel guilty celebrate as i celebrate for you this realizing that oh there is a

200
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:10,319
different way and this could be a turning point does that make sense does that how does

201
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:15,680
that land it's perfect hopefully thanks for thanks for coming

202
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:22,240
to happier richard great a couple more reflections i see

203
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:28,559
uh one is it was less stimulating and very helpful to quiet the mind

204
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:34,000
at the end of the week thank you for the reminder that being present here was enough

205
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:40,800
yay thank you for that beautiful reflection and one more reflection from

206
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:47,839
elizabeth love this metaphor of rivers coming together many of us as rivers coming together and

207
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:56,160
just an acceptance of each of us rivulets yes ah

208
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:04,240
all of us rivers of humanity riverlets of humanity coming together and

209
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:10,319
may all of our little rivulets coming together as we practice together again this is

210
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:15,480
another simile that the buddha uses that with practice when you practice

211
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:20,880
wholeheartedly there is no destination other than you

212
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:26,000
will end up in no place other than the ocean and the ocean here

213
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:33,520
is is a simile for freedom for liberation for peace and ease with

214
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:40,079
all the conditions of life as they come and go peace and ease in the heart

215
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:48,240
so that we can be more present more loving more accepting of ourselves

216
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:55,280
others and all beings everywhere so thank you all for your practice for

217
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:02,400
coming to happy hour to practice and may our practice serve and support ourselves others and

218
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:10,960
all beings everywhere may all beings be happy may all beings enjoy the taste of the

219
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:17,838
ocean of lebanon

220
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:25,200
thanks everyone
