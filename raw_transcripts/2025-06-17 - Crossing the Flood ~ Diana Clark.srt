00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:08,200
good evening welcome welcome

2
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:15,599
so tonight I'd like to continue on this series I've been doing on this whole

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:22,160
idea of crossing the flood so there's a

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:29,679
this is a metaphor that shows up in a number of different places uh in the sutas over and over again and the

5
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:37,280
general idea is that we find ourselves what we call like the near shore just

6
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,640
here wherever we are and then there seems we come up against

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,000
what seems like a flood of water you know just something that's like feels

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,360
overwhelming or just sets us off balance or too much

9
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,680
something that we feel like oh my gosh how do I get to the other died

10
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:07,840
there's so many things in life right life brings us that it's maybe not so uncommon or unusual or to have at least

11
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,520
once if not more in a person's life like "Wow I don't know how I'm going to do

12
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,560
this." And in the way that this metaphor goes

13
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:25,920
is we're sitting on the nearshore see the flood and on the other side is

14
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,880
the far shore that which you know for different people means different things but in general we

15
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,400
could say that's where peace and ease and freedom

16
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:45,040
lasting happiness this type of thing and so there's the question well how do

17
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:52,240
I cross the flood how do I get over to the far shore to

18
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,320
the other side and the as I said in the polycanon this

19
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,000
the Buddha gets asked this a number of times like how did you do it how does a

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,920
person in general do it how do we get across uh the flood

21
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:17,520
and one translation from one response that I really like it has a little bit of a I don't know it's a poetic feeling

22
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,800
to it the Buddha's response is by not

23
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,239
hurrying and not ting

24
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,840
terrying is not a word that's usually in my vocabulary but I like this it's like

25
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,640
not you know just uh not doawling not stopping or not you know just doing

26
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,480
nothing not hurrying not tearing

27
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:53,360
so these two extremes we might say and it seems like so often we have uh one

28
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:00,000
way in which we prefer to meet difficulties like okay I just got to power through or I'm just going to maybe

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,599
put my head down and push maybe that's hurrying or maybe hurrying we could say

30
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:12,560
is a way in which we kind of got disconnected from ourselves and from everything else and uh we're just like

31
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,959
okay I'm just going to do the minimum to get so I can get to the other side of it i know somebody I used to work with that

32
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:25,040
was like this that uh everything that he did was done really quickly i appreciate

33
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,400
very much and oh wait this isn't quite right and oh

34
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,319
wait now that you did that it doesn't work with this other thing and you know but he he just had this feeling like he

35
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:41,720
just wanted to get off his plate as soon as uh possible

36
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:53,440
and not tearing there's this way in which sometimes when we encounter difficulties we feel stuck

37
00:03:53,440 --> 00:04:00,720
and we're just stuck and we don't really do anything

38
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,319
maybe we've put our uh head in the sand a friend of mine

39
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,599
recently said that she was uh describing she said "I just ostriched." And I was

40
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:17,280
like "What what is that?" took me a while to figure out just put your head in the sand and pretend like it's

41
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:24,560
nothing's there or whatever the difficulty is uh not to be there or something like this

42
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,639
so these uh two different ways and what's uh interesting for me I think is

43
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:38,160
interesting is that Buddha isn't saying exactly what he did he's pointing to what he didn't do

44
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:45,520
these extremes are going too fast or not doing anything and so there's a way in which maybe

45
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:53,199
there's some room for us to explore for ourselves well what first of all maybe to explore do we have a way in which we

46
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:59,360
usually are meeting difficulties do we have a way in which we just want to get through it as fast as possible because

47
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,479
it just feels uncomfortable so we'll make decisions or we'll yell out or

48
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:12,160
blame others or you know something like this just to no longer be experiencing the discomfort

49
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:18,240
or are we more of one that uh tends to kind of like get stuck so first is maybe

50
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:25,360
just to ask ourselves is there a way in which we tend one way or the other chances are that's so

51
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,840
and then maybe with that question is to can we lean a little bit more towards

52
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,919
the center it'll be uncomfortable because the usual

53
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:45,199
way of doing things is the most comfortable way but can we just recognize are the way that we often are

54
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:52,560
doing things and maybe do something more not on one of the extremes

55
00:05:52,560 --> 00:06:00,000
and so with the Buddha not saying exactly what he did allows us to interpret maybe there's a third way we

56
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,479
have one extreme another extreme and maybe there's a third way and then what might that third way be

57
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:17,360
i'll offer some ideas here one that occurs to me is to tune into to

58
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:24,160
be sensitive to what's needed maybe a certain amount of hurrying is needed

59
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:30,400
sprinkling some hurrying here some tearing there and you know and maybe a

60
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:37,039
mixture of both or something like this but a third way is to not just follow

61
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:42,560
our usual habitual patterns but instead become sensitive to what

62
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,600
what would be best here and a willingness to maybe stretch

63
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:55,039
ourselves what what is this situation what is this experience calling for

64
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:02,000
what would be uh the most helpful in the big picture in the long term instead of

65
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,240
just our usual way and then there's another way in which we

66
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,840
might interpret the third way is something that's balanced something

67
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:20,400
in the middle the middle way is we could say is part of the third way i'm not going to talk

68
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,680
about that tonight that's uh that's a whole another topic worthy of its own

69
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,120
dharma talk but is is there a way in which to be balanced and one way we

70
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:38,000
think about this is with equinimity this equinimity is this uh not being

71
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,560
thrown off not being pushed around but instead to be able to

72
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:51,039
remain balanced and then we might say well that sounds nice how do we uh be

73
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:58,960
equinimous how do we practice with equinimity one way is to just reflect on our

74
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,879
experience for example let's just say you came to a

75
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:11,120
place like IMC and let's just say it happens to be something like a Monday night and kind of like you know the

76
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:18,639
evening after dinner let's just say that you come here for a meditation session and uh it could be you sit down to

77
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:25,840
meditate and the mind is really restless but there's chances are if you have been

78
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,960
meditating before you know oh this is just kind of what it's like at the

79
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,240
beginning of a meditation session it's chances are doesn't always happen often

80
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,159
does that things will mellow out that there'll be a little bit more settling and the body will have some a little

81
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,440
more ease a little bit more relaxation but so when you're sitting down and you

82
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,600
realize oh okay I'm feeling a little restless or agitated there's a certain amount of equinimity with that you're

83
00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:00,000
not all of a sudden like oh okay I can't meditate now and just get up and walk out but instead you have this experience

84
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,680
maybe even seeing the bigger picture like Oh yeah okay this is not uncommon

85
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:13,519
and this is what happens so sometimes when we feel like there's

86
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:20,480
crossing the flood when we feel like we are coming up against some difficulties whether I was talking about overwhelming

87
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:30,800
but maybe it's not something overwhelming is there a way that can um help us to see the bigger picture

88
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:38,000
sometimes seeing the bigger picture means if it's a we find what the difficulty is

89
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,040
is some difficult emotions or some ruminations that we just can't get out of our head and we feel like we're in a

90
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,240
loop about something really uncomfortable or either anticipating a

91
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,080
really uncomfortable situation or rehashing something that happened or trying to figure it out something out

92
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:00,000
whatever it is sometimes seeing the bigger picture is to recognize oh yeah

93
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,640
okay these are thoughts that are there's a lot of rumination going around but what's happening in the bodily

94
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:12,240
experience that's kind of like expand the awareness to include the bodily

95
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,360
experience including feeling the feet on the ground if you're seated feeling the

96
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:24,480
pressure of the chair mat or cushion against the body and there's this way in which getting

97
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,399
embodied and grounded really helps us to see the

98
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,519
a little bit bigger picture because otherwise we're just stuck in the the

99
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:42,000
rumination the the circling that's happening in the mind

100
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,160
so this is another way to like support equinimity often when we're offbalance

101
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,440
not always but often it's what's happening with the mind so can we expand

102
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,720
to include the bodily experience and this helps us to not necessarily

103
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:06,040
fall into our preferred hurrying or tearing

104
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:13,839
so when the Buddha said this to this person or this who asked how did you

105
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:20,399
cross the flood he said by not hurrying and not tearing and then this uh

106
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,519
individual said "I don't have it in front of me." Something like

107
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:32,399
"Yeah but how really how did you do it?" And then the Buddha expands it a little

108
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:38,480
bit and he says "When I terried I sank

109
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,160
when I hurried I got swept away."

110
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,680
I love this at first the first 10 times maybe I've read this I didn't really

111
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:55,920
occur to me until more recently this idea that Buddha is saying trial and

112
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:04,480
error he's learning from his mistakes when I tried I sank when I hurried I got

113
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:11,040
swept away so it's not like it was clear to him exactly what to do how to cross the

114
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:17,279
flood he was finding his way he was having to be sensitive to what's needed

115
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:24,720
he was having to figure it out be present for the experience

116
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,959
so in the same way this practice isn't asking us to be perfect it's not uh

117
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,079
asking us to know exactly what to do every moment

118
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:41,360
instead it's asking us to just meet the moment

119
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:48,320
as best we can can we be present for what's arising in

120
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:55,279
our life as best we can and then we have a sense of what to do

121
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:01,040
next or what direction to head but there's something more about this

122
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,560
idea of uh this trial and error maybe a

123
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,560
little bit like as I was saying earlier for equinimity

124
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,120
is that we have to be willing to as soon

125
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:23,200
as we encounter some difficulty for example sitting down to meditate and maybe the mind is really restless there

126
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,480
has to be a certain amount of willing to hang in there a little bit trial fail

127
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,600
and error means that the very first time you make a mistake you don't don't just

128
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:41,200
leave and like okay that didn't work i'm abandoning this i'm not going to try anymore anything like that

129
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:47,279
it's this willingness to hang in there and try something else

130
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:55,360
this willingness to be sensitive and to explore okay maybe I tried um really

131
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:01,760
really being present for this uh experience of the

132
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:08,000
posture like uh being seated feeling the pressure against the body with the chair or the cushion like really really tuning

133
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,160
into and feeling um that experience but then we find ourselves getting really

134
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:20,440
tight as we're straining to really stay with that experience

135
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,880
and then instead can we recognize oh maybe there's a way instead of like

136
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:35,600
going out there and really straining that we can be more receptive

137
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,680
just receive what experiences there are to receive instead of going out there

138
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:48,639
and probing and trying to really glum on to our experiences can we receive them

139
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:55,839
this uh I'm doing this with my hands it's it's more of an openness and allowing whatever's to be known or to be

140
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:03,040
experienced to be known or experienced instead of like straining and pushing

141
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:09,680
receiving or maybe there's this way that um we

142
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:15,440
just show up for the practice in whatever way that means for us maybe

143
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:23,920
it's like you know all I can do right now is sit for five minutes five breaths

144
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:31,519
five moments but this idea like you know what I'm going to show up as best I can and this

145
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:37,680
is all I can right now to this way of showing up just for

146
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:45,519
ourselves for what's happening in whatever way that we can at that at that moment

147
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:54,560
so this diligence in terms of you know not abandoning ourselves not abandoning

148
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,639
the meeting the difficulty

149
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:07,440
and then there's this way maybe with this diligence this trial and error of hanging in there maybe this willingness

150
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:15,440
to just ask what's helpful right now what what's needed right now if we're

151
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:21,440
allowing it to be known to ourselves for it to arise whether it's uh something

152
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,079
that we want to

153
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,720
sometimes it is helpful to just drop in the question what would be helpful right

154
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,839
now sometimes what it bubbles up and it becomes clear if we're being sensitive

155
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:47,360
to the moment then we just know but maybe it's sometimes helpful to just drop in what would be helpful right now

156
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:53,040
and then it's the asking the question more than finding the answer but

157
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:59,680
sometimes just asking orienting this way can be enormously helpful

158
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:06,640
helpful to find out what's helpful and then this third thing that we need

159
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,240
like this idea of that when I terried I sank when I hurried I got swept away is

160
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:19,520
also it requires a certain amount of maybe this uh sadda is this word in poly we

161
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:26,000
could say that it's uh to have a certain faith a certain confidence

162
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,799
a certain maybe heartfelt uh connection that this

163
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:40,039
is a way forward whatever whatever way it is that we're approaching the difficulty

164
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:46,960
i talked about equinimity is like maybe we have this uh we're stuck in our mind

165
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:54,160
and then I said well maybe we could bring it into the body but then also the heart maybe the heart to pay attention

166
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:01,840
to the heart like what what feels like heart felt or you know um

167
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:07,679
to bring some tenderness into what the experience is

168
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:17,080
to bring some care and compassion and love into this experience

169
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,760
and then the sutas there's another suta quote

170
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:34,799
when uh somebody asks the Buddha well how does a person cross the flood

171
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:41,440
and he's no longer speaking about what he did but speak just giving instructions for others

172
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,960
and he says by faith you cross the flood

173
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:53,840
and by diligence you cross the deluge deluju is also could be like ocean or

174
00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:00,640
sea just a giant expanse of water and this word faith is a sensitive word i

175
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,080
I'm not so comfortable saying it sometimes in this

176
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,360
setting because it can feel like oh just believe and everything will be fine

177
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,480
but is there a way can we have like faith that

178
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:23,120
everything doesn't have to be figured out right this moment

179
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:30,280
a certain type of trust a trust that

180
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:38,360
being present for one's experience that alone is helpful

181
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:46,960
trust that things change they do change it's not always pleasant but it's also

182
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,960
can work in our favor when we're these difficulties

183
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:58,640
and then faith also has this heart quality so what is it that uh uplifts the heart

184
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:04,880
that allows us to have some openness to meet difficulties meet ourselves

185
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:12,519
maybe with some compassion meet others with compassion

186
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:27,880
how did you cross the flood by not hurrying and not tearing

187
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:36,080
and I think I'm going to end there could end a little bit early tonight but I'd

188
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,840
love to hear from you all

189
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:50,640
do you have some ways in which you meet difficulties some habitual ways some patterned ways

190
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:58,080
what does a flood feel like for you what does it mean to you to have faith

191
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:04,640
trust confidence to help cross the flood

192
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:10,600
what does it mean to have equinimity to have balance

193
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:17,399
what is a third way between two different extremes

194
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:26,799
if we can I'd love to hear any comments anybody has about this we can cocreate

195
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:31,320
the this talk here

196
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,440
one thing that comes to mind for me is to be the eye in the storm so in other

197
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,720
words you know all this stuff is going on around you to you through you

198
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,880
whatever in your life but you're just the eye of the storm you're just like

199
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,240
unchanged by it you have that equinimity on the inside so nothing out there is

200
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:12,960
pulling you too much this way or that very nice that came to mind for me do you have a a sense what helps you to be

201
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,559
the eye in the storm uh inner stillness so in other words if there's a lot of

202
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:24,159
noise out there it's not necessarily in there so you can be still even though

203
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:30,080
there's all that noise nice yeah yeah and we all have this stillness we just

204
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:36,400
don't always aren't in touch with it or Yeah yeah thank you thank you

205
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,799
anybody else

206
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,600
thanks for the talk um I for me I found it hard uh to work

207
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:04,640
with the metaphor maybe I just haven't thought about it much but nearshore far shore and um it's both kind of abstract

208
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,880
but then it's trying to be concrete and so uh I kind of thought a lot about the

209
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,159
teachings of impermanence as a way to work through it and specifically the

210
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:22,480
idea that like oh today we've identified a far shore like we've created a goal

211
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:28,640
and to think about like why do we think that that's the far shore and if you think back like we probably all had

212
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:36,240
different far shores and identifying ourselves on a certain nearshore right so depending on the day or season of

213
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:43,440
life or whatever different far shores aka goals maybe um and so impermanence

214
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:51,360
kind of helps me and just go oh like it's what I see today nice and like if you adopt a posture where you're like

215
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:56,480
well that might fade um or the shore I'm on might you know

216
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:04,880
fade but you know can keep moving and recognize there will probably be another shore or kind of surrounding It nice

217
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:11,200
doesn't work much i don't know if with an island metaphor no I appreciate that very much the

218
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:17,279
changing nature of it thank you thank you that's great today's far shore maybe tomorrow is

219
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:22,320
nearshore or today's nearshore maybe tomorrow is far we don't know right

220
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:30,279
maybe yeah yeah i love it anybody else

221
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:46,000
um for me there's a big difference whether the turbulent river is

222
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:53,039
um occupied by another person and it's a relational situation

223
00:24:53,039 --> 00:25:01,600
or whether it's my own individual uh project or situation

224
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:08,960
when it's my own I can pace myself and pause and

225
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:14,080
when it involves other people it's like there's a real force just

226
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:20,480
yanking me to go forward and to change that tendency

227
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,880
i'm very conscious that that's something I would really like to intend to change that to

228
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:32,400
have the courage to just be present

229
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:38,159
and be with it instead of this impulse to

230
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,360
rush in or say something or do something

231
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:50,400
have you got any uh recommendations for this dilemma

232
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:59,200
can you tell me do you have a sense of what what's underneath that impulse is is there um

233
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:06,159
I feel like when it's just me and my own situation I have a certain amount of confidence

234
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:11,840
and trust but when I look at the other person

235
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:20,960
faltering and showing me a need or a disturbance

236
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:27,840
But then again it's different whether I'm wearing a professional hat or it's family for example and as a professional

237
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:35,600
I could do that because you have like a little discipline you put on every day

238
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:42,320
but in familial situations that's where it's really tough

239
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,440
and I feel it's really important i'm still sharp enough that I could attempt

240
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,279
this you know it's not too late it's not too late

241
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:59,360
yeah one thing that when we're seeing others uh struggling let's say and we

242
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,880
want to help them it really brings up acutely

243
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:11,760
our powerlessness to control others

244
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:18,320
that's really uncomfortable to feel like oh I care about you i want to help you i

245
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:24,799
want to support you and we might have a sense of what would be helpful for them but of course you know they're going to

246
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:31,760
do what they're going to do and we don't like to think of ourselves as wanting to control others but there's this way we

247
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:37,760
often or just the powerlessness is so uncomfortable of course I don't know if

248
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:43,360
this is exactly what's happening with you but I just want to highlight that this is

249
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,559
often what's underneath when there's some uh difficulties with when one

250
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:54,360
person is struggling and the other person really wants to help

251
00:27:54,799 --> 00:28:03,000
yeah I see the power part i definitely see it um

252
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:10,960
but it's very hard to perceive these delineations when it's happening

253
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:18,880
you know I it's um it's kind of like when the weather suddenly changes and you realize oh it's going to hail you

254
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:24,880
know and down it comes and there's no warning um

255
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,720
and so that's the difficulty for me is to

256
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:39,360
um particularly in very well ingrained habitual familial patterns

257
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:45,360
that's definitely I think I've heard it mentioned many times in different sort of these are the really tough

258
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:52,880
tough areas and they're beautiful places to practice because they are tough areas and it's I would say in some ways

259
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:59,039
meditation practice is fantastic because I mean let's be honest sitting still for

260
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:06,960
30 minutes is sometimes really uncomfortable like we don't want to and it's just uh building up the capacity to

261
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:13,279
be with uncomfortableness is absolutely a way forward because just feeling like

262
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:20,000
yeah wow this uh this doesn't feel good whatever it is and just saying like but

263
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:27,360
uh having some equinimity seeing the bigger picture like oh yeah okay I've sat through physically difficult or

264
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:32,399
mentally difficult situations it doesn't matter the particulars of what made it

265
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:38,640
difficult it's uh really does a tremendous amount for our capacity to be

266
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:44,159
uncomfortable it's lifech changing in so many ways

267
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:51,440
yeah and I can kind of hope that the compost process of meditation might loosen it up a bit does that make any

268
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:57,679
sense to you yeah yeah compost right things get uh changed yeah somehow they

269
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:03,520
get loosened yeah i'm sure it does yeah thank you you're

270
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,080
welcome you're welcome

271
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:17,600
maybe right behind you you know when you're talking about the the nearshore in the far shore I was

272
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:23,440
thinking of another another metaphor I heard years ago which is you know you're

273
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,720
you're in a in a room and you want to figure out a way to get out of the room

274
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:35,120
you're not I forget what the the motivation is but you can spend a lot of time moving the furniture around and

275
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:40,240
think that something's going to be different but really the task is to get

276
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:46,559
outside of the room and you're looking for instructions like how do I do it and

277
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:55,039
the the metaphor was well there are instructions but they're on the outside of the room

278
00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:01,120
and you know I I what I've always taken away from that is

279
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:07,120
um it's almost like there's a a narrative and a story that we think will

280
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:12,240
guide us through but you may not know what that is in the

281
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:18,720
moment it's only after you've sort of navigated whatever that challenge is

282
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:25,279
that you say "Oh well this is the story I'm going to tell myself." But again

283
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:30,320
it's a story it's a narrative um but you don't know what it is when

284
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:36,080
you're in the middle of the on one side of the river I guess

285
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:43,120
interest so let's see if I understand so this um the instructions are like the

286
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:48,640
narrative but we don't know them it's only retrospectively we look back

287
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:56,240
and we can piece together and knit together a narrative from events that happened yeah or perhaps the guidance

288
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,840
that we were looking for to change our situation but we don't need the guidance

289
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:07,559
then when we're outside the room right so

290
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,919
that's kind of a cruel thing right that sometimes that like oh now I see yeah

291
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:20,720
yeah that's an interesting idea the instructions are outside of the room so

292
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:27,039
maybe maybe that's the metaphor there is to stop looking for instructions instead I'm using this language like be

293
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:32,559
sensitive to what's needed maybe that stops you don't have instructions so

294
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:38,159
tune in to what's the next thing to do yeah and it also goes back to what you

295
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:44,000
were talking about a couple weeks ago that you know you're um

296
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:53,200
I forget how you described it but you said something like you're in place B and you're trying to get to place A but

297
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,559
the only way you're going to get there is to be completely present here that's

298
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,000
exactly right

299
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,120
thank you thank you

300
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:17,639
anybody else have something they'd like to share or say

301
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,720
so the instructions reminded me that at one time I was trying to learn to ski

302
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:36,000
and for years I tried and tried to make nice smooth connected turns and it never

303
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,240
worked and one day an instructor gave me a particular instruction and I skied

304
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:48,720
down with nice smooth connected turns and I said oh great these are great instructions and it took me a while to

305
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:54,720
realize is that it had nothing to do or very little to do with the instructions it had a lot more to do with a couple of

306
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:00,240
years trying trying and failing and more

307
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:06,480
or less that's what I'm doing here very nice very nice we tend to think like oh

308
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:13,118
if only I had those instructions years ago dismissing that oh no no no we needed those years of trial and error

309
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:19,078
and practice yeah yeah yeah great thank you thank you

310
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:35,760
you know as far as doubt is concerned um

311
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,960
there's a Joseph Goldstein used a phrase which I

312
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:47,118
loved uh he said uh watch out for doubt masquerading as wisdom

313
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:53,839
and I loved that because uh in my case especially you know that it'll have the flavor of this is how it really is you

314
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:59,040
know oh my god maybe it's all maybe you know it has this certain I

315
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:08,720
know what's what's really happening you know it's got that flavor um but for me if I can catch it it helps

316
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:16,240
but I could be stewing in doubt for let's say let's say I'm stewing in doubt for 10 minutes and struggling i don't know what's going on after 10 minutes

317
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:22,240
let's say I catch oh my god this is doubt then I might stew another 10 minutes oh okay doubt i'll work with

318
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:28,560
doubt i'll work with doubt and after 10 minutes the thought might come oh Joseph Goldstein said that and then it helps

319
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:34,160
resolve it you know and then I went oh my god wait oh wow okay now I can and he also said like what does doubt feel like

320
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:39,760
in your body and then I like oh this is what doubt feels like i can stay and stay and then it shifts right but even

321
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:45,040
with having that tool sometimes having the right thought come seems important i

322
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:50,880
could still in 20 minutes even though I know this kind of thing helps me if that thought doesn't come that go said this

323
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:56,880
and it's helping me I can still 20 minutes goes away until that thought comes you know so I struggle with that

324
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:03,119
part there's all these tools but if it the right thing needs to come at the right time that's right that's right but

325
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:08,960
the right time you're defining is when you want it yes it's coming at the

326
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,960
perfect right time for it right it doesn't necessarily match your preferences but uh it arises when it

327
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,000
arises yeah you know and when it does it feels

328
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,680
like and when the resolution happens the first thing that happens is I should have thought of this 20 minutes ago you

329
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:31,040
know that's the first but not hurrying

330
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:37,599
and not tearing right this idea hurrying like oh that should have been 20 minutes ago

331
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,000
thank you Jay

332
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:59,800
okay today was a

333
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:12,000
yeah today was a day that I didn't have a opportunity to prepare a talk and uh I

334
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,640
scribbled some notes here and I said well we'll see what happens

335
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:26,160
and I don't know it's just lovely that together we I don't know I felt like we created something together

336
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,838
