1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,240
and greetings

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,639
everyone happy to be here with you all again and this very sweet to see the

3
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:21,160
greetings in the chat box

4
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:34,399
uh here we are again at 7 o' in the Pacific

5
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:43,760
time we'll begin our meditation with the sound of a

6
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,920
bell

7
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:14,119
pausing pausing to begin our meditation together

8
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:18,399
this morning for this

9
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:34,280
day being very generous with this a process of

10
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:46,640
pausing what is happening right now with

11
00:01:53,439 --> 00:02:01,840
pausing there may be a momentary mindfulness coming in

12
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,798
maybe momentary kind of

13
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:26,920
stopping maybe there is a sense of a kind of flow in the mind

14
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,680
thoughts got interrupt it

15
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,400
momentarily staying with a

16
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,760
pausing pausing to arrive at Here and

17
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,760
Now

18
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,920
maybe we can finally take a few long deep

19
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:35,360
breaths maybe the

20
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,360
sound can move through

21
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:52,360
us maybe the sensations in the body are the movements of the

22
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,640
breath are bubbling up to the

23
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,680
foreground

24
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:14,319
pausing to step out of unconscious

25
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:21,160
flow of the thoughts

26
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,918
planning project

27
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,600
managing fantasizing

28
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:52,960
pausing to arrive at a Here and

29
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,560
Now embodied

30
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,319
heartfelt the beginning moments of the meditation

31
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:36,639
may feel a little jerky or

32
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:44,520
bouncy because of the momentum of the flow of

33
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,960
unconscious mindfulness is a flickering in and

34
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:05,440
out no

35
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:18,520
problem or simply patiently

36
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:27,039
gently staying with this process of pausing to

37
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
arrive

38
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,440
letting go of the active

39
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,199
feeding into the

40
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,400
thinking and resting more and

41
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:26,960
more in a mindful

42
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
awareness

43
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,639
embodied

44
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:56,720
heartfelt what's the felt sense of your experience right

45
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
now

46
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:15,199
maybe the rapid

47
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:22,919
movements the momentum at the beginning of the meditation is settling

48
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:31,240
down ever so slightly or maybe not

49
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:55,480
resting in the present

50
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:01,200
resting with mindfulness

51
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:33,279
patiently with a sense of a

52
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:42,440
commitment Sati may become more

53
00:09:51,920 --> 00:10:01,120
continuous we have a sense of we finally arrived

54
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,160
at the

55
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
presence

56
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:44,360
can you notice some small

57
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,360
ways are big ways of inner

58
00:10:49,560 --> 00:11:01,040
shift from unconscious flow to becoming consciously aware

59
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:24,959
you feel availability right

60
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
here

61
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:43,040
being available to the felt sense in the

62
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:57,160
body being available to the

63
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,639
aliveness that's present right

64
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,880
here through the movements of the

65
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,839
breath vibrations in the

66
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:33,839
body pausing is an

67
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,839
alchemical

68
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,560
process what's the felt [Music]

69
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,800
sense right

70
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,600
now arriving

71
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,440
arrived and

72
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:55,120
available you feel the heart

73
00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:00,759
opening easing up

74
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:16,839
the body

75
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,560
softening

76
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
relaxing

77
00:14:52,360 --> 00:15:00,680
from this open receptive available field

78
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:07,440
[Music] ining

79
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:22,639
aligning and orienting our whole being inner

80
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,759
outer with our deepest intentions

81
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,319
our

82
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,959
aspirations without having

83
00:15:51,360 --> 00:16:01,000
to use the thinking mind to align Can You Feel the

84
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,839
aligning in the body with the

85
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:36,240
heart aligning with our aspirations feels like

86
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:42,600
this in the immediacy of your

87
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,720
experience sometimes the images may

88
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:10,480
come you may have a certain kind of recognition

89
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
arising

90
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:53,200
for me sometimes this spontaneous image of sitting

91
00:17:53,200 --> 00:18:00,760
upright like the Buddha would

92
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,760
arise staying with the felt

93
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
sense

94
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:30,960
being aligned and available feels like

95
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,039
this in your own

96
00:19:54,159 --> 00:20:00,240
experience you may have a kind of a grounding

97
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:21,158
flavor maybe the heart and mind and the body can feel

98
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,400
safe

99
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
protected

100
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:43,840
from this aligned and available

101
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:51,559
field you can choose to turn the

102
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:56,799
attention onto the familiar meditation

103
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:01,200
object if you you choose to do

104
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,720
that body

105
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:19,480
breath or you can simply rest

106
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:27,039
here being present

107
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,679
aligned and

108
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
available

109
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:58,360
if the Mind wandered away remember

110
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,360
remember

111
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:14,799
pausing allow pausing to

112
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:19,679
interrupt the cutness of our

113
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679
mind

114
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:41,559
pausing to allow mindfulness

115
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,360
sa to come

116
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,679
forth

117
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,440
the last moments of our meditation

118
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:48,039
together maybe resting and settling on the ground of being

119
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:55,360
available and aligned aligned with our

120
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,320
values aspirations

121
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:11,360
allow this be a whole some ground that we can stand

122
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:16,200
in as we step into the

123
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,240
day

124
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:08,200
thank you for practicing together I'd like to take a moment to do

125
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:15,519
something that uh folks suggested yesterday in the chat that is maybe

126
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:23,200
collectively we send a meta to Nikki who was supposed to be here this week um but

127
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:30,200
was feeling unwell and wasn't able to be here with you all and so let's just take

128
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:37,440
a moment to send meta to Nikki and wishing her

129
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:47,440
well-being and a speedy recovery from whatever may be bothering her body and

130
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,159
heart

131
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:12,600
so uh today I brought with me a second

132
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:18,120
practice skill that I like to share and this is what I

133
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:24,399
called the Alchemy of paing so

134
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:31,559
pausing is probably not um that unfamiliar to most of us and who

135
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:37,039
has been practicing with mindfulness and inite

136
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:42,840
meditation as a lot of teachers would have pointed out that we can

137
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:51,039
pause and as a part of our practice and so um what may be

138
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:57,799
unfamiliar is that often we may not have

139
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:05,360
um paid close attention to this alchemical process of

140
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:14,840
pausing I want to drop in kind of a um evocative phrase here sentence

141
00:33:15,639 --> 00:33:23,039
here the practice ofusing has a potential to mature in a

142
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:28,960
radical transformation Here and Now

143
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:36,519
maybe that's a little radical so I was uh pointed out recently that the word

144
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:45,840
radical um can mean extreme but it also has a meaning of relating to or

145
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:51,399
proceeding from a root or

146
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:59,720
Foundation I love that this a sense of the simple practice of

147
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:05,919
pausing can have a potential to have a inner shift and

148
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:13,720
inner transformation that happens at the foundational level of our

149
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:20,919
being well you know we can see if that's possible but I like to maybe unpack this

150
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:27,720
alchemical process uh a bit today and I introduce a little bit of

151
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:33,679
this uh at the guided meditation today um at the

152
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:43,720
beginning and a little bit at the end also so as we um practice with pausing

153
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:50,240
what happens when we first start

154
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:58,119
pausing maybe you can say that our practice mindfulness practice begins

155
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:05,800
with a momentary pause what I often notice

156
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:10,920
is the moment of a pausing I can notice

157
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:19,280
uh one or two things one is noticing that I was going there was a

158
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:26,000
kind of ongoing flow of my mind that was happening maybe thinking planning

159
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:33,160
ruminating wondering so that became available to me

160
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:41,480
kind of visible to me and this pausing has this um effect

161
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:46,560
of interrupting that flow which usually is

162
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:55,000
very unconscious and it's kind of we just going with that flow and so that's one effect and supp

163
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:02,280
pausing to interrupt the unconscious flow and the other effect with the

164
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:10,640
momentary pausing is the mindfulness becomes

165
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:19,800
available and so maybe not kind of immediately uh established kind of

166
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:25,440
available of the Sati but it's a momentary it's kind of flickering in and

167
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:31,480
out because there is a momentum of this unconscious flow that may be

168
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:38,359
operating it's like um you know maybe we're going with a rapid current uh

169
00:36:38,359 --> 00:36:45,880
flowing with that uh at some point this beginning of the pausing is like there's

170
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:53,160
a sense of oh you know I want to step out of this unconscious flow but we're

171
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:59,400
not taking the foothold just yet on the RO River Bank for example or still kind

172
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:08,079
of being carried by it a little bit but it's um but we are interrupting

173
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:15,040
that flow when we're not actively engaging in the unconscious flow Itself

174
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:23,800
by keep feeding with our thinking and thoughts and plans and doing and project

175
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:31,200
managing and so the first uh if effect of this process ofusing is it can

176
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:38,000
interrupt that unconsciousness and then as we stay with

177
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:47,280
uh the momentary mindfulness little by little what can happen in our felt sense

178
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:55,599
is a pausing can lead to some kind a felt sense of things slowing

179
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:01,440
down our mindfulness can become more

180
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:08,200
continuous may not be perfect continuous but you can feel you're more

181
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:14,680
present and um uh the rapid fire of the thoughts

182
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:21,280
might thing out a bit because we're not so invested in

183
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:27,319
it and um the stories that may feel a little more

184
00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:32,400
floaty you know they're not so gra grip gripping on

185
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:38,760
us and so this is when uh using that current analogy this is kind of like a

186
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:44,800
we're now uh being able to have more foothold uh on the river bank and and

187
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:51,040
kind of not being so carried away um by the unconscious

188
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:58,000
flow and so this is the kind of a maybe I'm calling it a second phase of of this

189
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:05,560
alchemical shift and change of the Paw starts with

190
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:12,359
interrupt and then start and then moving into things slowing

191
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:20,200
down and we can actually begin to hear some sounds or we can feel that we can

192
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:26,599
actually breathe sometimes when we're being carried by the unconscious flow we're

193
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:36,040
holding our breath we don't even know and so that can happen and

194
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:43,880
then again as we stay with this process more and more the next uh phase that

195
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:51,040
began to uh emerge is that our mindfulness can

196
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:57,560
become Fuller and so now it feels like our foot

197
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:05,359
can actually settle on the River Band Bank maybe both feet are settle settling

198
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:11,000
on the river bank and so there is a kind of a felt

199
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:18,200
sense of were more rooted Here and Now

200
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:27,160
present and the momentum of going two places began to settle down

201
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:32,880
and so some sometimes for me I would notice and at the beginning of my

202
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:40,200
mindfulness uh starting to uh kind of come to come forth it can have a

203
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:46,760
momentum um that's like the rapid fire thinking mind because my mindfulness

204
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:54,359
would be kind of hopping around you know jumping between the breath and the sound but then when our mindfulness

205
00:40:54,359 --> 00:41:02,160
becomes more established that the momentum of hopping

206
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:07,680
around from one object to another began to

207
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:16,200
settle we're not not moving about so much we're simply resting more and more

208
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:21,318
in this a field of awareness and

209
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:31,319
knowing and so this is a phase where there is can be a distinct shift that we

210
00:41:31,319 --> 00:41:38,920
can feel oh we're shifting from this momentum of

211
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:44,480
unconscious doing to a kind of

212
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:52,839
knowing resting in the knowing we can observe and feel the

213
00:41:52,839 --> 00:41:59,800
flow but we're not being carried by it Carried Away by

214
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:08,400
it and then with this mindfulness of being uh more and more fully

215
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:15,960
established this began to empower the unfolding of the next phase of a

216
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:22,280
pausing which I'm calling pausing to be

217
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:32,880
transformed as we began to rest uh more fully in this

218
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,720
um uh in um the fullness of awareness

219
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:46,760
knowing what can happen is that we can begin to see the different patterns

220
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:54,559
of our mind activities and we can see how the

221
00:42:54,559 --> 00:43:01,359
activities and reactivity ities that can lead to duka or

222
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:09,880
stress and how we can be free from the stress

223
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:15,119
oruka and so one of the main patterns that gets

224
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:22,720
revealed uh in this process by staying resting in this field of

225
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:29,480
awareness is that we can see that are ongoing

226
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:36,160
self-centered project managing um reacting and

227
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:43,800
threshing between the wanting and not wanting they're just tying ourselves in

228
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:51,400
NS right and Dharma dhapat has this very Vivid verses that describes this kind of

229
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:58,040
a threshing and that the unconscious mind can and get ourselves

230
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:03,400
involved it's like the fish out of the water thrashing

231
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:07,799
about with this unconscious

232
00:44:08,839 --> 00:44:17,119
mind and so resting in this a field of awareness we can begin to see the

233
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:24,960
patterns very clearly and seeing clearly has a

234
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:32,359
powerful effect in us when we see when we know for

235
00:44:32,359 --> 00:44:41,359
ourselves the grip on this kind of a pattern or the investment in trying to

236
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:49,318
um managing our ways out begin to soften itself loosen

237
00:44:50,160 --> 00:45:00,319
itself and so we are more and more at ease so settling into a kind of a being

238
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:07,079
that's available for us being with the

239
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:12,880
flow rather than being pulled or pushed by

240
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:20,559
it and so there is a kind of a through line with this alchemical process of a

241
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:26,640
pausing that moves us from the unconscious

242
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,960
doing managing to a clear

243
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:39,040
knowing and a profound sense of a being and that's a radical

244
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:46,240
transformation it has that potential it doesn't mean that it's always there but

245
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:51,760
it's a possibility and this form of a being is

246
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:58,359
not deadening but rather it's alive it has innate

247
00:45:58,359 --> 00:46:05,520
responsiveness within it and it has a capacity to respond out

248
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:11,760
the depth of our [Music] being and so my invitation for

249
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:19,640
today yes open to the possibility of

250
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:26,760
pausing pausing to interrupt pausing to slow down

251
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:33,240
pausing to get to know the depth of our being and

252
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:40,000
pausing to see the possibility of being transformed by

253
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,040
it so thank you everyone for your

254
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:54,599
attention and uh may you rejoice in the practice of a

255
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:57,599
passing
