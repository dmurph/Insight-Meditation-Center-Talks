1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:11,840
yeah so welcome is anybody here for their first time ah nice welcome welcome

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:18,880
yay yeah you know IMC welcomes everybody

3
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,039
so yeah

4
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:31,480
yeah I um was anybody how many of you listen to Gils talk last

5
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:37,719
week yeah I I have been I mean it's kind of nice tradition he has of starting the

6
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:43,920
year with a formable truths and um I've been teaching on them and

7
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,840
other people have and I really liked what he offered and I'm going to kind of fold in some of what he shared to what

8
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,960
I'm going to offer and I'm going to but I'm going to start like who who here

9
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:02,760
doesn't know about the four noble truths is anybody here who not doesn't know what the four noble truths

10
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,640
are yeah okay great great so um then I'll put a little

11
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:17,640
context around before I get started um and uh let me say kind of

12
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:27,200
the one thing I want to do is kind of differentiate um what I'll call for the moment Noble

13
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,840
Dua from heedless Dua

14
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:39,880
Noble Dua from heedless Dua and I also want to talk about you know Duca and

15
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:47,040
well-being because they really come together or can so the four noble truths were are

16
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,600
said to be the first teaching of the Buddha and it's said um I have a I'll

17
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:00,079
come to it later but there's a a sua quote where sarauta who's one of the um

18
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:06,079
main teachers uh students of the Buddha and the teacher a teacher of the

19
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:13,480
Dharma compared the for Noble Truths um to an elephant um

20
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:19,319
footprint and he says just like any animal in the whole Kingdom's footprint

21
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:25,000
can fit inside of the elephant's footprint so too can all of the

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:34,319
teachings of the Buddha fit inside the for noal truths so it's a very uh significant

23
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,519
teaching and essentially um the way it's traditionally taught is there is

24
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:48,360
suffering which I'll talk about what that is how to interpret that there's the cause of the suffering there's the

25
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:57,720
end of suffering and then there's the way to end all suffering and um so I like to pair the

26
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,840
first and second truth and the third and for so maybe call them two noble

27
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:09,200
truths and the first two are really about um the direction of um UNH

28
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:17,599
wholesomeness and un you know sort of not doing well and so the Dua and which

29
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:23,000
can be translated as Gil likes to translate it as pain and I'm going to

30
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,159
incorporate that into my talk today but it can be thought of as super subtle

31
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:36,920
disase I think the volume needs to go down just a teeny bit more um irritation

32
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:43,760
to Total distress so this huge range volume still

33
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,519
okay okay a little louder again wasn't quite yeah it needs to go up a little

34
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:56,120
bit it's really hard balance sorry yeah okay so

35
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:04,879
um just this huge variation so let's just say that that you know just like pain can be maybe super mild just this

36
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:10,159
little rough patch on your skin you feel is a little bit sensitive to the cold or

37
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:16,760
something um to you know your leg is broken to

38
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:23,919
worse um so Dua and the cause of Dua and

39
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,720
uh the word in poly for Dua I mean for um the cause is tanha which is

40
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:40,479
classically translated as craving and today what I want to talk about it as um is resistance and

41
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,160
compulsion resistance and

42
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:51,520
compulsion so this resistance and compulsion

43
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,800
cause pain that's pretty relatable right is that relatable for you guys to you

44
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:04,199
understand that sort of like when we resist things things it can even slightly just think about that just the

45
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:09,880
subtlest resistance oh I don't want that just a subtlest

46
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:16,479
pain and the compulsion has just when we feel compelled there's a a discomfort to

47
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:26,680
that to extreme discomfort so these two um kind of can move us if

48
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:32,680
we are heedless and unmindful toward more and more difficulty the second

49
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:40,479
truth or the third and the fourth truths are the end of suffering and it's what

50
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,400
leads us to the end of suffering and that is the Noble eight-fold

51
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:54,160
Path this is the teachings of the Buddha um that guide us in how to engage with

52
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:00,160
our life and our practice

53
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:08,680
so Noble Dua and heedless Dua unheeded

54
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:15,240
Dua and well-being and so maybe I'll take a minute to talk a little bit about

55
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:22,240
well-being and maybe two kinds of well-being I'll say that um there can be

56
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,400
hedonic well-being and honic is a term that is used to describe sort of like

57
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,720
the the treadmill of life where we're always trying to get and do and feel better sort of like me trying to get the

58
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,639
sound just right you know there's this like trying to adjust and you know kind

59
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,479
of always moving towards sort of trying to get things right and um do things

60
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:53,880
like you know go to the spa and do all this extra extra stuff to make ourselves feel good and um and so you know it can

61
00:06:53,880 --> 00:07:03,199
be really helpful actually and but when it's heedless it it just leads back to

62
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:11,199
Dua um and then there's udic well-being honic is kind of a well-being

63
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:19,479
that's the result of what the Buddha really talked about in terms of happiness is things like um the Bliss of

64
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:25,800
blamelessness it comes from showing up for others and ourselves in a way that

65
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,639
um we feel is blameless it's not dropping our garbage

66
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:38,599
on the ground and instead putting it in a trash can and you know being able to walk by other garbage and go like yes I

67
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:44,000
didn't do that you know in a simple way it's uh

68
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,960
you know ethical action it's wise action the result of those

69
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:57,520
things I'll talk a little more about that too but I kind of want to give you these this idea because when I start to

70
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:03,520
talk about Dua if all you have in your mind is something that's very very unpleasant

71
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:11,159
and not helpful and something you don't want you might not hear my words the same way I'm hoping that you will so

72
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:16,960
there is Noble Dua duka that leads toward well-being

73
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,198
actually so

74
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:31,240
um I have learned to listen to Dua

75
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:37,880
and I have learned that I often feel very happy when I recognize

76
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:45,480
Dua and when I see Dua I know that there's I'm seeing it so there's an

77
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,720
opportunity to suffer

78
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:57,959
less when I don't listen to my Dua I'm not heeding my

79
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:04,680
Dua it can become heedless Dua and that can be where we're trying

80
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:12,160
to do things to make ourselves feel better but we just keep making it worse and worse or the we we're ignoring the

81
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,880
suffering and it just grows and grows because we're ignoring the problem like

82
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:23,440
the pain we're ignoring the pain and and the cause of the pain gets worse and

83
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:31,120
worse cuz we're not listening

84
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:42,839
so Dua if we're listening to Dua it can Inspire us to move toward honic pleasure

85
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:50,120
it can Inspire us to move toward getting a piece of cake or shopping or something

86
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:55,440
like that that is using sense Pleasures to try and make us feel

87
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:02,200
better and that's not really the kind of um well-being or the usefulness of the

88
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,200
the that of Duca that would be maybe considered

89
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:16,640
Noble there can be noticing Dua and turning inward instead of

90
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:24,800
outward and meeting that Duca with uh intimacy and

91
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,480
curiosity with like this deep faith and understanding that

92
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:39,440
it's there with a message it's there inviting us to notice how we're

93
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:46,760
causing pain how we're engaging with our life in a way that's causing

94
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:59,440
pain I think that one of the things it's a little bit hard to to think about when

95
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:06,880
I'm trying to differentiate these two kinds of well-being is that um it's much easier

96
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:13,480
for the mind to focus on something than nothing so if you look around this room

97
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:19,480
right now try and find empty space a space where there's not

98
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,880
inhabited and I'm going to have you pause and try and keep your mind on that

99
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,240
space for several seconds so just see what

100
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:37,680
happens if you try and just like look at emptiness nothingness what happens in your

101
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:57,959
mind did anyone notice that it's hard to keep your attention focused in that

102
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:04,720
space for me I could feel the there's like a tug you know I just I want to look

103
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:15,000
around I want to find something more solid to look at and um so I think that it's easier

104
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,600
and more compelling for us to try and look for something to help us feel

105
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:27,880
better than it is to practice letting go and renouncing or you know turning

106
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:33,880
inward that make sense

107
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:46,279
okay so pain so if we think about um pain is

108
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:53,440
caused physical pain is caused by injury right some kind of

109
00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:00,839
injury and so maybe we think about you know

110
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:08,920
resistance and um compulsion as causing

111
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:18,800
injury and as I was thinking about this my mind thought about the term moral injury has anybody heard that

112
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,959
term it came up a lot in the pandemic because of doctors and healthc

113
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:31,720
Care profess professionals working in hospitals with people dying of covid who were refusing vaccinations and denying

114
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:37,519
that they had covid and um and and it can happen in Sim similar

115
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,639
ways where you know

116
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:49,480
you're well the here's a definition moral injury is the Damage Done to one's

117
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,639
conscience or moral compass when that person perpetrates

118
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,720
Witnesses so this was an example of witnessing or fails to prevent Act acts

119
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:05,240
that transgress one's own's moral beliefs values or ethical codes of

120
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:10,480
conduct and this is actually to me a kind of a definition of what the Buddha

121
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,759
was teaching and I connect this with Dua

122
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:21,079
that we experience that kind of pain when we you know when there's Damage Done to

123
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:27,680
our conscious when our awareness what's our Clarity what our moral values

124
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
are

125
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:47,079
so here's a thought question what would happen if we

126
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:53,160
didn't have Dua What would life be like if Dua

127
00:14:53,160 --> 00:15:00,680
didn't exist

128
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:08,120
when I was asking myself that question it occurred to me there are people who don't feel pain there is a syndrome

129
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:15,399
medical syndrome called congenital intens insensitivity to pain or

130
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:21,720
CIP so I looked it up a little bit and the article starts by saying

131
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,040
pain is the body's way of telling us to be

132
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:33,199
careful but there's some who get their entire life without feeling

133
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:41,160
it wow right wow and it goes on to say people with

134
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:48,160
CIP would love to know what pain means and what it feels like to be in

135
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:56,639
pain and and then it says people C A say people assume that feeling no pain is

136
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,920
this incredible thing and that it almost makes you super human

137
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:09,519
but with for people with CIP it's exact opposite exact

138
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:17,880
opposite we would love to know what pain means and what it feels like to be in pain without it your life is full of

139
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:24,880
challenges so we think that often when people are talking we think that our life is you know when we have Dua that's

140
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,399
the problem but maybe it'd be a lot worse if we didn't have Dua

141
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:38,639
I feel pretty sure it would be so to me I I really do want to

142
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:45,040
inspire you to have a different relationship with Uka by saying this kind of thing to kind

143
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:52,560
of Imagine can you appreciate can you come to appreciate Duca as a guide as a

144
00:16:52,560 --> 00:17:00,480
messenger as something Noble

145
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,839
thinking about Dua like um a feed you know feedback

146
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:21,438
mechanism so some of you may have heard this example before but it kind of I like to use it for me it works really

147
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,038
well but I think about

148
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,799
um dooka a little bit like um rumble

149
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:38,480
strips you know what rumble strips are on the side of the highway they're

150
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:44,280
little divots in the cement and if you drive on them what

151
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:49,840
happens really noisy and it's a lot of

152
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:57,400
vibration and when you hit those what happens in your

153
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:04,120
body yeah tenses up reacts and then what might happen in

154
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:11,799
your mind fear anybody get angry

155
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:17,120
annoyed yeah yeah

156
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:23,600
upset so we can drive on the rumble strips we get startled it can bring up

157
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,840
fear and then we can have mental reaction right

158
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:34,960
and then we might um harp on ourselves for being so

159
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,720
careless I can see some nodding heads or and and then we might be

160
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:47,080
thinking to ourselves a little bit later that we should probably call calr and report a complaint about these rumble

161
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:52,400
strips because you know there it's really there could be a better

162
00:18:52,400 --> 00:19:01,360
way there could be a better way maybe it could be soft jingly bells or you know something that is nice and

163
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,880
you know beautiful and helps us stay on the road instead of this terrible awful

164
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,600
feeling of these rumble strips so we can be planning what we're

165
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:18,240
going to say and craft this letter and contact the governor and do all this

166
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,880
stuff right and then or at some point we can finally kind of recognize that we

167
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:29,320
hit the rumble strips because we were driving off the road cuz we weren't paying

168
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:35,120
attention because we lost our mindfulness and then we can kind of go

169
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,279
oh and what would have happened if I had kept

170
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:47,200
driving and then there might be this sense of relief and appreciation and

171
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:53,360
even gratitude for the rumble strips and maybe this is what happens with

172
00:19:53,360 --> 00:20:00,039
Dua maybe this is how we start to you know we react to the Dua but we can help

173
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:06,960
ourselves we can walk through this and come back to this place of being oh my gosh I'm so

174
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,840
grateful I'm so grateful that my finger hurt so I didn't keep cutting with a

175
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:19,400
knife I'm so grateful I'm listening to this Dua so I'm not continuing to cause

176
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,640
harm to myself or

177
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
others

178
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,480
I'm uh deciding what to share

179
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:05,559
next so um Gil has a quote I'll

180
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:11,880
read in Buddhist shorthand addictions compulsions obsessions and attachments

181
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:18,039
are referred to as clinging and craving tanha when the contraction of clinging

182
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:26,200
is pervasive it leads to stress which makes us vulnerable to such human instincts as fear aggression and

183
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:32,919
greed when these qualities are activated it can be easy to behave in ways that further harm ourselves or

184
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:38,720
others Buddhism emphasizes that craving is a condition for further craving and

185
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,639
that intentions to harm tend to motivate more of the

186
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:52,480
same so kind of pairing this harm this idea of injury and harm and how when we

187
00:21:52,480 --> 00:22:00,039
don't listen to the dukka those other Energies

188
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,960
grow so coming back to me when I I I

189
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,919
like these words resistance and compulsion I feel like they're relatable

190
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:19,360
I often feel my mind gets kind of lost when I hear the word clinging or

191
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:25,320
craving so I like this and I encourage you to find your own liking words you

192
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:32,880
know whatever works for you that helps you feel that direct connect with oh I know what this

193
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:41,000
means and if I'm resisting something if I recognize resistance oh what don't I

194
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:47,440
want what don't I want what do I think should be different than the way it is and then I can kind of get in there and

195
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:53,159
figure out what it is I'm clinging to which is an idea a belief often or a

196
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:59,960
wish right and compulsion you know

197
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:05,120
this feeling of I want I want I want or

198
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,919
push um push and pull at the same time maybe

199
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:18,120
even it's um really can be quite tantalizing because there's this sense

200
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:23,960
that if I just get myself what I'm wanting it'll go

201
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:30,799
away I'll feel better and this is where we get into the honic well-being that I mentioned

202
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:38,559
earlier oh if I just go get this if I just give myself that I'll be

203
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:45,760
relieved but generally it's uh it's you know we're being

204
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:51,159
Bamboozled because you know it doesn't last very

205
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:59,480
long you know how often do you reach for something because it just sounds good and then you find yourself reaching

206
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:05,480
again and again and again and again for the same thing just another hunger and another

207
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,320
hunger and another

208
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:19,120
[Applause] hunger so just to say a couple of words about working with this the the

209
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:27,320
resistance or the compulsion I got a lovely uh email from

210
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:33,559
s utan this morning he has a daily daily mindfulness email that goes out that's

211
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:42,640
short and it was sort of the perfect little quote for today um and uh so just to to name

212
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,799
number one that when we're struggling with resistance and compulsion he says

213
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:53,480
if desire or aversion are overwhelming awareness needs to be built

214
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:58,760
up first before tackling them directly in this case it is better to

215
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:07,480
use a neutral object to build continuity of awareness for as long as it takes so he might mean

216
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:13,080
you know breath or walking or knitting

217
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:18,120
could be something that we're paying attention to and feeling as we

218
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:24,600
do and we do it for as long as we need to for as long as it takes to build up

219
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:31,480
our capacity to be present stay

220
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:36,600
aware he said we don't have to deal with anything in the mind until awareness and

221
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:44,840
wisdom are ready so it's kind of a nice to keep it

222
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:52,360
simple right and to take care of ourselves to get the quality of the Mind in the place so that we can relate to

223
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:59,679
the dukka as Noble Dua and not be heedless with it

224
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:12,120
as we as we start to relate to the duka as Noble we will grow trust and faith

225
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:19,520
confidence we will start to feel um that joy and well-being that

226
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,559
comes up when we recognize the presence of that pain of

227
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:30,960
duka and as we do that something inside of our our El inside of me grows wiser I

228
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,200
can feel it shifting and growing and it's like almost like

229
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:46,760
something inside starts to trust have more trust trust even in in me whatever me

230
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:55,720
is and then there's more relaxing and more ease more earned

231
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,600
confidence

232
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:13,440
I'll say just um there's a poem by Rosemary traumer you know on dealing with what

233
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:21,279
she calls it oh the longing because that compulsion right and the

234
00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:27,240
resistance and how do we deal with this how do we deal with this and um how do

235
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:32,919
we Let It Be she says let longing be

236
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:40,399
longing though it rises in me with incessant hunger though it clutches for my heart with outstretched hands pins me

237
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:46,760
with pleading eyes let longing be longing never has it worked to pretend I

238
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:52,559
don't hear it as it shouts and demands or charms me with its silken

239
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:59,519
promises in a vision I said no to the longing and the longing only grew

240
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:08,760
but when I said yes longing I see you she says some other sweet words but

241
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:14,200
essentially the longing just becomes longing and I am a woman who sometimes

242
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,679
Longs for what she cannot

243
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:24,600
have so this is all about kind of getting into that right relationship

244
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,440
with dukka so that it can be Noble for us

245
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:36,880
and um there's you know the Noble eful Path

246
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:43,200
is a path right and duka lets us know when we're on that path like the rumble

247
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,398
strips lets us know when we're on the road and going off the

248
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:56,039
road and here's another Gill quote the ancient Buddhist metaphor of a

249
00:28:56,039 --> 00:29:01,519
path draws on the idea of a cleared passageway that allows one to move

250
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:06,679
through an otherwise impassible Forest just as a person brings their

251
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:12,000
entire body along when walking on a forest path a spiritual spiritual

252
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,039
practitioner enters the Buddha path by engaging all aspects of who they

253
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:23,840
are yet while this physical path exists whether we walk on it or not in the

254
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:29,760
story the Buddhist path exists only in our engagement with

255
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:36,760
it so Dua only becomes Noble when we engage with it the path only becomes

256
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:42,039
available to us when we engage with it he says we create the path with the

257
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:46,480
activities of our minds hearts and

258
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,720
bodies so there's this great really really great book I really liked it read

259
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:59,880
it several times this last year it's called um the lion trackers guide to living by Boyd

260
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:06,880
varti and it's uh he grew up in South Africa and his family ended up creating

261
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:13,799
a a reserve and they take people on tours to track animals but they don't

262
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:20,519
kill the animals it's a long story but

263
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:26,240
um of a lot of different things but essentially he really talks about becoming a

264
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:32,679
Tracker so I have this idea of becoming Noble du

265
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:40,720
trackers one of the lines that he says that I really like is I don't know where I'm going but I definitely know how to

266
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:47,559
get there I love that I love

267
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:53,000
that and last week Gil gave this talk right on the for formable truths on the

268
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:59,240
three levels of heart body heart mind and belly

269
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:06,320
and so I like to call listening to the full range of Dua as a tracking

270
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:12,320
exercise and so we have to start by becoming aware of when Dua is present

271
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:19,399
right and it requires us wanting to recognize Dua wanting to track it

272
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:25,240
wanting to learn about it so from the book I'm going to read

273
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,519
you some some

274
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:36,480
excerpts and this first excerpt for me is about the level of Dua on the Mind

275
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:42,639
level that Gil was talking about and so he says tracking is very

276
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:50,519
much like learning a foreign language single tracks are words you might see a few as you walk

277
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:56,919
the trail and they create a jerky first phrase if you stop speaking and don't

278
00:31:56,919 --> 00:32:02,480
practice practice the learning recedes while the more you do it the more natural and fluid it

279
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:09,120
becomes so for me in the beginning when we're trying to track Dua it's it's a

280
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,240
little awkward it's not a language we're used to to speaking we're going to our mind's going

281
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:20,679
to shift around between seeing you know Dua as a friend and sometimes as a

282
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:29,080
foe but the more you do it the more natural and fluid it becomes

283
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:40,639
and he goes on to say one afternoon the short phrases became flowing sentences I was out alone he's tracking

284
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:46,360
as Alex one of his mates had some other work to do back at the camp I came

285
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:51,559
across the tracks of a large Rhino bow that had wallowed in a water hole his

286
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:58,039
body caked with a thick black mud the track away from the water hole was fairly easy to follow because as the

287
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:04,039
Rhino walked through the thick bush bush a slick of mud had scraped off on the

288
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:09,440
trees and bushes his body was Dripping with it a Hansel and gredle trail that I

289
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:15,760
could easily follow from Bush to mudded Bush so often with Dua when we first

290
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:21,399
connect with it it's pretty easy to see over time maybe it gets more subtle

291
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:29,080
and that's when we start to move to the level of the heart so he says after a few miles of

292
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:36,240
tracking this I knew the mud on his body had begun to dry and the dripping Trail became more and more faint and then

293
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:42,039
there was no more mud my eyes seamlessly shifted from the mud to the three Road

294
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:47,320
Clover tracks he had left three toed and suddenly the iterations of the track

295
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:52,399
that my brain had stored as search images began to pop I saw the track with

296
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:58,159
ease I noticed compressions scuff marks smooth bark where his Thro ton Bonnie

297
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:06,799
had brushed against a tree I saw the grass laid flat in the imprint of a side toe the half moon of a front toe I was

298
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:15,919
moving on his track fast and fluent the easy Trail had helped me to get out of my own head so I could relax into

299
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:21,480
myself so moving into like a more relaxed relationship with

300
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:28,760
Dua where our heart can start to resonate with what's going on we don't feel contract Ed and pulled

301
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:35,679
back we develop trust the faith right that the duk is Noble if we

302
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:44,000
relate to it in the right way our heart starts to

303
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,919
trust and then we move into level three the belly the level of the

304
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:56,560
belly so he goes on to describe it was easy and natural that I had the feeling

305
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:02,440
that I had gained entry into an entirely new dimension I could anticipate the subtle

306
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:07,839
shifts of this path picking up the faintest of tracks like they were elaborate

307
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:13,000
signs in the same way that after months of being an outsider on a French

308
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,800
exchange the language comes and you suddenly belong to France to the place

309
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:25,078
to the culture to the people suddenly I was part of the story of the

310
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:30,839
Bush no it is possible that engaging with the fornal truths can lead you into

311
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:36,400
a whole new dimension a whole new way of being in this

312
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:45,359
world you become the eful path in the words of the Buddha you become

313
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,800
free

314
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:14,839
I'm I feel moved by the my own Reflections on

315
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:25,078
freedom you just feel it in my body I'm at the belly level in the

316
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,720
moment

317
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:01,640
e I think I'll just try and summarize and end with a

318
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:09,160
poem and sort of emphasize that really what I'm talking about is our

319
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:14,838
relationship to and with our

320
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:22,680
experience that we can have a a noble relationship with life and our

321
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:28,599
experience or we can have in Noble relationship with our life and

322
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:42,720
experience and I find a huge part of creating a noble relationship with my

323
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:50,359
life and experience has to do with recognizing what I can and cannot

324
00:37:55,319 --> 00:38:00,560
control because has so much of having a noble relationship with life means to

325
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:06,240
allow life to to allow what's happening to

326
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:15,040
happen and to see it and show up for it in a non-reactive way but with

327
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:25,520
responsibity and this is a hard thing in in in AA they have the Serenity

328
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:33,200
Prayer it goes like this God grant me the ability to accept the things I cannot change the courage to change the

329
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:38,480
things I can and the wisdom to know the

330
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:46,680
difference and there's a version of this that I like very much which is useful when one wants to

331
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:51,920
have compassion for others which is God grant me the ability to accept the

332
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:57,800
people I cannot change the courage to change the one I

333
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:05,680
can and the wisdom to know it's me

334
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:12,400
yeah so this is a noble relationship to

335
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:21,000
life and it requires allowing allowing life allowing

336
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:30,839
others and I hope you know that our already talked it's not that we're passively allowing right it's not that

337
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:37,480
we're not engaging with mindfulness it's necessary we need to be in Wise relationship Noble relationship to

338
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:43,160
what's happening but to do that we have to first acknowledge and allow what's

339
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:50,720
really going on not to be in conflict because then we're resisting it or we're compulsively

340
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:57,319
moving to try and change it so here's a poem by Dana Falls it's

341
00:39:57,319 --> 00:40:05,200
called allow there is no controlling

342
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:13,240
life try corralling a lightning bolt containing a tornado Dam a stream and it

343
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:18,359
will create a new channel resist and the tide will sweep

344
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:24,720
you sweep you off your feet allow and Grace will carry you to Higher

345
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,880
Ground the only safety lies in letting it all

346
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:35,839
in the wild and the weak fear fantasies failures and

347
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:41,960
success when loss rips off the doors of the heart or sadness veils your vision

348
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:47,319
with despair practice becomes simply bearing

349
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:52,800
the truth practice becomes simply bearing

350
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,839
the truth and the choice to let go of your

351
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:05,480
known way of being and the choice to let go of your known way of being the whole world is

352
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,760
revealed to your new

353
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:22,560
eyes so there's a lot more I could say but I think that's a good place to end

354
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:27,920
