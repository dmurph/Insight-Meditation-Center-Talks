quite distracting for me to to get um chats

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,519

great so hello and welcome everyone to this to this Gathering of happy

29
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:22,239
hour so um I wanted to uh share

30
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:28,920
Reflections about equinity which is the fourth Brahma vihara there are these um

31
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,680
four practic of the heart in Buddhism the first one being meta loving kindness

32
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:42,599
and we spend a lot of time at happy hour practicing loving kindness the second one being Compassion or karuna the third

33
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:48,760
one being mudita or vicarious joy joy for the joy of others and the fourth one

34
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:57,599
and and we do practice all of them and and the fourth one being equinity which um sometimes seems

35
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:03,879
perhaps the most subtle of of them and and folks might even wonder well why is

36
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:10,560
equinity part of these practices of the heart because um they all the rest of

37
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,199
them the other three seem warm and caring and Equanimity some people misund

38
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:22,360
understand as as all aloofness or or kind of not caring or like oh I'm

39
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:28,759
equanimous it's okay whatever happen so yeah what's how how is this one how does

40
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:34,520
it fit with the other ones and we'll practice it tonight um

41
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:43,120
and there's so much to say about equinity by the way um and in fact I'm I'm teaching a a dayong on equinity on

42
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:50,919
Saturday maybe I'll share information later so there's so much to discover but just to to to say here that equinity is

43
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:56,199
really the the um the birthplace of

44
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:01,360
warmth kindness compassion because it's really the stability of the heart that

45
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,720
is nonreactive that neither falls into doesn't get so overly involved in

46
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:14,320
attached or I want you to be well because I want you to be well and I'm so attached to it and I'm going to you know

47
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:20,919
grieve if you're not well so that sense of uh overwhelm and also it doesn't push

48
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:26,960
away it doesn't turn away to say oh oh talk to the hand I'm not listening or I

49
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,080
um or push something away with aversion so equinity is the sense of

50
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:39,160
equipoise or balance of the heart that allows us to Care to love um freely

51
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:49,759
openly spaciously unmoved um and and also there is warmth

52
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:57,319
and Care in equinity because if if there was no care in equinity it would become

53
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:04,840
complete resignation and turning away but it's not that those are the near enemies or the

54
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,680
masqueraders so so tonight what I'd like to invite us to to practice with again

55
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:20,840
there's so many nuances of equinity but this feeling of um uh this feeling of

56
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:26,000
um um equipoise this sense of balance I

57
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,680
want to invite us to relate to equin tonight as warmhearted balance

58
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:38,319
warmhearted balance on and what would that look like if we're cultivating

59
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:45,880
warmhearted balance in our heart so warmhearted balance and and to feel into it

60
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:51,280
physically so I've said enough so let's uh let's practice together and see what

61
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:58,520
it feels like to cultivate feel into um this warmhearted balance

62
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:04,800
okay so so arriving

63
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:11,479

64

65
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:31,919

66
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:37,759

available through the breath if we followed the thread of the

to no judgments we're planting seeds planting seeds

172

[Music]

180
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:34,600
myself thanks everyone thanks for your practice ah it's so nice to sit and it's

181
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:40,760
so nice to sit with Community it's definitely different and more profound

182
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:49,039
to sit with with community so we have a little bit of

183
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:56,519
time to turn and practice with community in the way of showing up now

184
00:29:56,519 --> 00:30:02,720
for one another with Ain remedy with this warmhearted presence that is

185
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:10,279
spacious and we'll spend about 7 Minutes in small groups groups of roughly size

186
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:15,480
three and the invitation is to show up for yourself

187
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:22,240
and others embodied with a sense of embodiment and the question the inquiry

188
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:28,080
is what does what what supports equinity for you cultivating equinity what

189
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:33,159
supports equinity for you and each person will offer one nugget and the

190
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:40,480
next person then the next person will come back to you will go round and round and so maybe one nugget will be ah when

191
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:46,840
my I feel my body um that supports equipoise equinity

192
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:53,399
for me then the next person might say ah um if I'm not in a

193
00:30:53,399 --> 00:31:00,679
rush that might that supports having equ po me the next person might say if I'm

194
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:09,320
aware of my breath or whatever it might be just feel into your body what what supports what supports eonity for you

195
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:15,679
and you could also bring in and actually let's just do that what supports also what gets in the way that's kind of the

196
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:23,559
opposite the other side of the coin so you can maybe tell you what the first round uh the first two round do what

197
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:30,679
gets in the way of equinity and then the next next rounds do what supports and

198
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:36,559
then keep going with that okay so first two rounds what gets in the way of

199
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:44,480
cultivating equinity and then then third fourth fifth Etc rounds then what

200
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:51,240
supports what supports eonity okay and let's go alphabetical order according to

201
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:58,279
first name so um be kind take care of yourself

202

[Music] Mima thank you Nikki um it was I think

215
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:31,279
it was funny because even the the point the things that don't support us was still like in my case it it's

216
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:38,480
impermanence it's like that doesn't support because I shared that I have I had a real tiny little crockpot and last

217
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:44,799
night it broke I was washing it and broke I was like no there goes my equinity right and then I was like

218
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:52,039
that's the way it is it's okay it's okay but it was amazing to see that and then I love the building one another with the

219
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:58,559
things that that do support us um it was humorous we had fun so thank you for

220
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:04,840
that tonight oh that's great that just makes me so happy so light-hearted what you're sharing and also I love the the

221
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:11,440
story of the crockpot and and it's and and you're right impermanence challenges equinity it doesn't get in the way but

222
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:18,320
it challenges it things are impermanent and that's just the way it is and I loved how how you came back with this

223
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:24,760
challenge of oh I broke like that's just the way it is things break and and that

224
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:30,280
wisdom of yeah yeah sweetie Things Are imp permanent that's great be that's a

225
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:37,720
great example thanks for sharing that mimo thank you a yeah it's beautiful thank you

226
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:45,118
um Katrin please hi thank you for the practice I

227
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:51,960
got very relaxed it was very nice um I was recognizing that when like the main

228
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:58,480
obstacle for me to equinity is my mind of course but the particular

229
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:04,839
the self-critical sort of like scanning for what am I doing wrong or what is

230
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:11,880
wrong in the environment and um that what supports me

231
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:17,040
is to turn towards that part of my mind with loving

232
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:22,320
kindness and compassion and just be like oh sweetheart you're really you're

233
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:28,960
really trying to keep me safe by beating me up or by

234
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:34,119
you know or by pointing out how all the possible things that could go wrong and

235
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:41,720
that doesn't feel very equanimous but I I love you and I'm I really appreciate your care and then that seems to be the

236
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:48,800
way so the way like letting the heart be the the bridge into beautiful beautiful

237
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:56,000
yeah thank you letting the heart be the bridge that that kindness that compassion of of care especially when

238
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:02,119
the mind is is over Vigilant um yeah balancing it's a way of balancing

239
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:07,680
because it's it is in some ways the the mind in that case is pushing experience

240
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:14,560
away it's it's bad it's wrong it's an enemy so befriending by befriending yourself and experience bringing that

241
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:21,160
balance back instead of lopsided of like ah this is terrible it's okay yeah yeah

242
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:27,720
and and also um one thought that arose is is maybe another way also to to bring

243
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:33,839
balances oh what's what's going right what's well what's what's working well right now and it's what what's

244
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:43,720
nourishing in this moment so um great thank you Katherine thanks for sharing that and I see your Zoom hand

245
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:49,440
please thank you um something that uh

246
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:55,760
came up is uh so it's about to be a year since my oldest brother killed

247
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:03,119
himself and thank you um I I noticed like I'm just

248
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:10,200
more anxious than usual and um I'm like well it makes

249
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:15,599
sense anniversaries always get to me yeah so even when I'm not directly

250
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:21,960
thinking about him um but something that that has helped has been going to a

251
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:29,240
group that is specifically people that have lost siblings to suicide um so I

252
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:35,000
think finding people that have been in a very similar boat CU I can understand

253
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:41,160
people not being able to connect uh about it if they haven't been through it

254
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:48,880
so of course of course so finding Community it's like specific people yeah through

255
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:55,280
Community finding your balance and and equinity equipoise through the shared

256
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:01,000
Humanity the common Humanity of the those who are experiencing this this

257
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:07,920
grief this loss this this all the various aspects of of grief which which

258
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:13,319
are more complicated of course and and more piercing in the case of the case of

259
00:38:13,319 --> 00:38:20,880
suicide I'm so sorry to hear about your loss um and and please and remember

260
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:26,200
remember self-compassion remember self-compassion cuz it's hard it's hard

261
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:32,160
for you it's so hard with everything that arises all the

262
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:37,800
aspects of grief so remember self-compassion then equinity may be

263
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:43,319
appropriate sometimes and it may not be it's so see what's appropriate at a

264
00:38:43,319 --> 00:38:49,838
given time yeah thank you so much for speaking

265
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:56,560
up so so dear ones oh Sor I see your hand whoops wait I asked the wrong

266
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:03,440
person to unmute there Sara there you go thank you so much um thank you I

267
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:09,680
really appreciate your teachings uh Nikki it always um helps me to find a

268
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:15,079
way to make sense of a lot of things um something that we talked about in the

269
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:22,680
group was about U how to find equinity in the face of um uh suffering in the

270
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:28,400
world uh not just the suffering that you face in your life but great sufferings

271
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:35,400
that they are sometimes very difficult to make sense of um and then as you were

272
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:40,880
uh offering the teaching something came to mind that today I was listening to

273
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:47,319
Sharon salsburg um one of her books and um she

274
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:55,720
used the term she was not specifically talking about equinity but she used the term uh

275
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:04,520
tolerance and and she used this term as a way that um like we would increase our

276
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:10,599
tolerance to be able to let in anything the realities of the world

277
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:16,440
includ including the dark realities and and she used the example

278
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:22,400
of a the river of the self expanding the capacity of the river

279
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:28,839
of the self so it doesn't overflow in the face of new wav or whatever is going

280
00:40:28,839 --> 00:40:34,599
and coming and going through it um so that expansion that tolerance it doesn't

281
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:39,640
mean that you don't react in the world or uh or anything like that but it's

282
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:45,440
just like you are actually more capable of letting things in without

283
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:51,520
collapsing so that as you were talking it just like clicked that maybe

284
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:58,119
tolerance in that context would also be a good way of looking at equinity yes I

285
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:04,200
I would just share this and ask for your thoughts yeah beautiful thank you so much sir thanks for bringing this

286
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:10,160
teaching and this beautiful metaphor from Sharon I love it yeah the idea of

287
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:15,359
this expanding our capacity like this River expanding this tolerance to be

288
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:21,520
able to be with that's exactly it you can see equinity so it's not being alof

289
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:28,680
it's you're you're you're being you're yes exactly you're expanding Your Capacity your tolerance to be with all

290
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:34,640
things with care I think I add that aspect of it with care so that there's

291
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:40,200
no overwhelm you can be with the river as it flows through you and your banks

292
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:45,720
are being expanded beautiful thank you so much for bringing this this Insight

293
