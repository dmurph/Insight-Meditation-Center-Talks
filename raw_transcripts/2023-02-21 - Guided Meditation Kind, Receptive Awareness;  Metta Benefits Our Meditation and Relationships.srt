21
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:50,959
taking a couple of intentional breaths maybe with your hand on your heart just like I have it right now

22
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:57,360
breathing in as if you could breathe in directly into your heart

23
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,379
breathing out

24
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:14,300

25
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,599
sense of community

26
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,379
to being linked all over the world to people practicing now or

27
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:33,239
at other times well that to sort of enter

28
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:38,120
your body your mind

29
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:47,000
and allowing your gaze to be internal

30
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,940
perhaps closing your eyes

31
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:05,840
from the sensations having arrived here

32
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:14,939
the feelings of the greetings noticing all of the sensations in your

33
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:20,060
body and welcoming those to

34
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:32,419
welcoming your heart and mind as well exactly as they are

35
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:48,320
and if it feels right setting the intention of this meditation

36
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:56,699
to greet all experienced that arises with meta kindness

37
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:59,540
friendliness

38
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:08,419
doesn't mean condoning subject matter of thoughts necessarily

39
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:17,180
liking everything but just greeting it reading whatever arises

40
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,880
this too welcome

41
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:42,020
and then returning to your surroundings as well the soundscape

42
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:51,600
whether it be a bird song or far off City Escape noises

43
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,199
something else

44
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:02,280
in creating your internal atmosphere

45
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:11,419
settling in tuning in to the breathing

46
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:24,500
to the goodness of the moment wherever it is in the moment

47
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:44,900
allowing the mind the heart to rest

48
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:53,120
best in the gentle rising and falling of the belly your chest

49
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:59,120
we're simply rest in the gentle flux

50
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:05,240
whatever is arising in now this moment

51
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,840
settling

52
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:50,220
appreciating me Pleasant Sensations

53
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:55,220
any feelings warmth connection

54
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,300
acknowledging all that's there

55
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,139
just there's

56
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,600
from time to time reattuning at the moment

57
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:31,980
seeing how kindly graciously invite to reconnection

58
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,060
with awareness

59
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:30,800
perhaps you're engaging with loving interest

60
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:38,420
in the felt sensation known experience of now

61
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:50,360
and stay immersed in the object of attention breath or sound

62
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:58,260
or if the awareness feels steady opening up to all that is arising and

63
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,980
flowing through

64
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:10,160
appreciating allowing being with

65
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,860
foreign

66
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:24,260
foreign

67
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:03,019
foreign

68
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,480
final moments of this meditation

69
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:35,059
the invitation is to gather up soak in

70
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:42,140
find any little Glimpse in of goodness

71
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:50,880
well-being kindness peace any goodness

72
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,520
and favorite appreciate it

73
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:12,740
allow it to make an impression and the heart mind and body

74
00:32:18,899 --> 00:32:22,399
and then when you're ready

75
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:29,778
to begin to turn that internal gaze

76
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:36,360
of your heart your mind outwards to all of those

77
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,679
your life touches

78
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:49,460
casting your internal Vision far and wide

79
00:32:52,380 --> 00:33:00,919
and perhaps setting the intention that others may also benefit from your practice

80
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,440
that others be peaceful

81
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:16,340
but they be well

82
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:28,760
notice how this well-wishing feels in your heart

83
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:50,579
[Music]

84
00:33:55,340 --> 00:34:06,110
[Laughter]

85
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:17,898
thank you for the sincerity of your practice

86
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:41,060
[Music]

87
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:49,560
so dear Sangha welcome welcome to day two of a series on inner and outer

88
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:57,180
Harmony qualities that we can cultivate that help and gender promote

89
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:01,040
inner and outer Harmony

90
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,980
yesterday we covered the lives down the practicing for the

91
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:13,200
benefit of ourselves and for others and for ourselves and

92
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:20,700
others at the same time and for all beings today I'm just going to touch on the

93
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:28,800
many benefits personal and interpersonal benefits of Good Will loving kindness

94
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:35,160
it's one of the qualities that the Buddha taught about both as a meditative practice

95
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:41,460
as a quality mind heart and as an invaluable

96
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:47,760
quality in the ways that we show up with other people and most of his teachings were about

97
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:53,059
asanga but he also taught us to lay people daily life

98
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:58,740
it's well documented both in the ancient Buddhist teachings and in modern science

99
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:07,260
that there are many benefits of cultivating an attitude a disposition of good will

100
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:12,780
kindness Mecca so I'm just going to start with inviting

101
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:19,380
you to take in some of the different translations for the word meta most

102
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:24,599
often called loving kindness just feel them in your body and feel maybe a

103
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:30,300
memory or a felt sense of what resonates in your own life

104
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:36,900
in your circumstances your personality okay so the word called unless there's

105
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:42,000
no one single translation for any poly word it seems

106
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,240
is meta as friendliness

107
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:50,460
non-hatred

108
00:37:52,680 --> 00:38:00,078
sympathy Amity

109
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:08,640
kindness benevolence

110
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,079
beneficent

111
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:21,680
Goodwill love

112
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:27,240
and active interest in others

113
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:32,300
active interest in others

114
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:38,880
so maybe some of these qualities seem familiar maybe all of them do

115
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:44,520
either having been on the receiving end of them or feeling them noticing them in

116
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:51,420
your life and it's really true that for many people go

117
00:38:51,420 --> 00:39:01,200
fronstop being one of them loving kindness and compassion can naturally lead to the emergence can

118
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:06,540
actually come from the emergence of mindfulness practice sorry so

119
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:13,440
for some people the cultivation of this practice mindfulness practice just

120
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,960
kind of at some point transforms their hearts the way they show up

121
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:25,619
and for others it's also helpful to cultivate it directly and the Buddha offers practices

122
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:30,859
for that specific ones

123
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:37,079
I'll explore the benefits and techniques in detail of that practice actually in a

124
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:43,920
loving kindness an introduction to loving kindness course that I'm teaching in March through the Sati Center

125
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:49,920
so I'm not going to really go into it here so today I'm actually mostly going to

126
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:56,460
talk about how those benefits support our overall meditation practice and

127
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:01,880
relationships so

128
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:06,980
we get to the right page

129
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:13,980
[Music] a kind attitude an inner posture of good

130
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:20,720
will and the mind and the Heart is a huge benefit a huge boob support

131
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:25,920
for mindfulness practice Insight practice

132
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:33,440
some of the um known benefits both in the ancient discourses and in modern science

133
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:42,560
include a reduction of anxiety lessening ill will or hostility

134
00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:49,680
enhancing concentration bolstering confidence

135
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,720
and all of this of course bolsters the capacity for Clear seeing

136
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:01,320
insight and all of this can emerge as I was saying naturally

137
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:08,040
from dedicated mindful awareness practice over years or from the specific

138
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:14,160
practices and techniques the Buddha outlines part of the way that the attitude either

139
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:19,619
way becomes a part of our hearts and minds and natural part part of the way that the

140
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:26,880
attitude and practice of meta Goodwill towards ourselves and others

141
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:34,020
does this is by reducing preoccupation reducing preoccupation especially

142
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:39,780
self-judgment and self-criticism but also

143
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:47,460
inordinate judgment criticism or blame of other people and it makes sense right I if I'm

144
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:56,040
preoccupied on what they did wrong or what I did wrong mind is agitated it kind of stands

145
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:02,820
and that it's not so conducive to a peaceful meditation it's not so conducive to a peaceful mind and heart

146
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:09,900
and life so the calming of that the settling of that

147
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:16,619
and eventually the lessening of it is a treat of this tendency to

148
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:22,400
blame or judge or criticize all of that has

149
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,660
benefits that bolster maturity and inclusion in our hearts and Minds in

150
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:34,500
meditation practice and it has health benefits it turns out

151
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:39,900
better sleep improved immune response

152
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:46,920
and better Mental Health and all of these are outlined maybe not using those specific words

153
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:54,359
in the Buddhist ancient teachings and they're also touched on in a lot of the contemporaries and it's

154
00:42:54,359 --> 00:43:01,800
and of course these qualities don't just appear in and benefit our meditation and one's

155
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:07,560
personal experience they've still over into the rest of our

156
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:12,540
lives and benefit relationships

157
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:18,960
every interaction we have there's a story I've told this recently

158
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:25,140
in another context the story about a wise gatekeeper that

159
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:31,079
highlights this so picture back in Ancient India Bronze

160
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:38,579
Age and there's all these different little city-states sprinkled around and there's one or more Gatekeepers at

161
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:45,300
each one and um their job is to kind of monitor who flows through and who comes out

162
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:51,240
and also to orient newcomers all right tell them where to go or

163
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:56,780
help them get settled in just a little bit give them directions

164
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:03,000
so there's a wise gatekeeper it's ancient gate of this little city

165
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:10,319
and one day a group of people comes through getting ready to settle and the head of

166
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:16,200
household asks the gatekeeper thanks for all the information you know what I really want

167
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:23,880
to know tell me what people are like here the gatekeeper contemplates for a moment

168
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:30,740
and they look at the person and they say what were people like where you came from

169
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:37,440
and a person says oh they were awful mean conniving you

170
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:43,800
couldn't trust them impolite rude and the gatekeeper kind of nods and says

171
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:51,119
I think you'll find people much like that here the group goes on and a few hours passed

172
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:58,619
and another family comes by and that head of household ends up asking the gatekeeper

173
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:04,619
much the same question so tell us what are the people like here

174
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:10,980
I'm the gatekeeper asks the same question back what were they like are you

175
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:16,319
and this person said you know

176
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:22,500
we came here for this new job but we didn't want to leave they were trustworthy kind

177
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:28,800
really had your back they did everything good neighbors would do

178
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:36,060
we're really gonna miss them good people the gatekeeper nod say Julian says I

179
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:40,700
think you'll find people much like that here

180
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:48,420
so as the story highlights of course the mental templates the predispositions

181
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:55,020
that we carry around influence all of our interactions all of our relationships

182
00:45:55,020 --> 00:46:02,359
just as they influence our relationships with ourselves and this might seem really obvious until

183
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:08,760
one looks at the opposite right the habit of criticizing oneself or

184
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:13,800
others many of us in Western culture might

185
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:19,140
default to criticizing ourselves and this can often flip to being

186
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:26,220
critical of other people particularly in conflict the Buddha points out the dangers of

187
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:32,599
this attitude towards conflict he says and this this comes from the dhamapada

188
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:40,140
during conflict it's easy to see The Faults of others hard to see one song

189
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:49,619
if one focuses on others faults and constantly takes offense one's own toxins flourish

190
00:46:49,619 --> 00:46:56,700
when Zone toxins flourish that can be true even if we're overly

191
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:02,599
focused on our own effects right

192
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:09,020
it's really important not to take on all the blame or to shift all the blame somewhere else

193
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:15,119
rather than blame the practice or the emergence of meta

194
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:20,280
kindness asks us to notice to learn

195
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:26,660
or the sense of compassionate understanding for foibles our own and others

196
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:34,380
bitter seeds of blame or criticism reap a bitter fruit in the mind and heart and

197
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:41,160
in our relationships right and happily the opposite is also true

198
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:48,740
kindness and good will create a beneficial resonance and contagious

199
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:54,599
this from Dr David Hamilton an act of kindness is like a pebble

200
00:47:54,599 --> 00:48:01,380
dropped in a pond just as the pebble lifts lily pads at the other side of the pond

201
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:08,460
so an act of kindness lifts the person you help and also many others connected to that

202
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:16,400
person as their own Spirits are lifted their behavior towards others is Kinder to

203
00:48:16,859 --> 00:48:24,180
so as many of you have heard me talk about there is this ripple effect of our practice of kindness

204
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:29,819
that has an uplifting effect on our lives on our relationships physical health

205
00:48:29,819 --> 00:48:36,720
and the well-being of others and ever widening ripples

206
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:42,780
so over the next 24 hours perhaps notice notice how you already

207
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:48,060
might bring all these different flavors of meta Goodwill to your meditation

208
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:54,480
practice or your life or your interactions and notice where you might want to bring

209
00:48:54,480 --> 00:49:01,800
in just a little bit more maybe talk about it with a friend or write about it or just take a moment or

210
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:08,400
two in your downtime so those are my Reflections for today
