1
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:13,639
I haven't tested this voice yet tonight there we go thank you

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,100
hello hello the voice is working good

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:26,180
welcome to Monday night looks like my glasses I'm not going to be able to see anybody either

4
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:33,140
so what I would like to talk to you about tonight

5
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:39,000
begins with beware the conditioned mind

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,640
beware the condition to bind I've been talking to a number of people

7
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,520
lately that have have a similar issue with life which is I keep

8
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,640
practicing and I keep working and I'm so disappointed in the outcome

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,340
why isn't it better how come I'm not more equanimous I just want to be peaceful

10
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:08,280
I keep doing the right things how do I make any difference

11
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,580
I try to be kind to people and then they're not happy

12
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,960
and in general what's happening is that people are becoming

13
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,060
discouraged because things don't match their idea of

14
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:33,119
what it should be like you know if I do we make these unconscious contracts all the time if I

15
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:40,380
do this then this will be the outcome if I do diligently practice this would be true

16
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:48,479
if I consistently meditate I'm going to be a great meditator if I do all my practices well then

17
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:56,240
I'm going to be a Quantum Miss and by the way equanimous means peaceful and easy and happy

18
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:03,920
but it turns out Equanimity isn't about being happy

19
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:11,180
Equanimity is about balance in the face of things just as they are

20
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:16,920
Equanimity is about looking at ourselves and seeing ourselves just as we are not

21
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:24,480
how we would like to be Equity Equanimity means that we're not

22
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,900
measuring ourselves to see if we're improving if we're closer to that person that we

23
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,739
think we ought to be

24
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:41,700
the end of suffering does not lie in the future it only lies now

25
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:49,860
it lies in this moment in this experience there is a a Triad a famous Triad that

26
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:55,440
is repeated often in the sutas and it has to do with

27
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,140
um disenchantment

28
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:06,480
dispassion cessation of suffering and after that come those things like

29
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,879
peace and knowledge and nabana

30
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:19,980
but it really begins with this realization that what we have is a conditioned mind

31
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:26,819
what we think about things is conditioning our experience and is it self-conditioned by that

32
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:33,860
experience and if we can't see this if we don't see when it's happening

33
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:41,599
we are condemning ourselves to constantly repeating all of the Habit patterns we've always had

34
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:49,980
so the problem with talking about this is it's at this great intersection point it intersects with the Aggregates and

35
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:55,500
with the four noble truths and with mindfulness it everything kind of comes

36
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:01,260
together in this experience that determines whether we suffer or do

37
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:06,900
not suffer all of our intentions

38
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:13,560
all of our practices and somehow we think that if we do all of this that eventually we're going to

39
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:20,780
get to the place where we are free of greed hatred and delusion and I say may it be true

40
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:28,500
but I want to know how do I stop suffering right now

41
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:34,800
now when I become a better person not when I become a better meditator

42
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,940
but right now how do I end this suffering In This Moment

43
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:46,139
so I was inspired by something that came in the email there was a quote

44
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:52,220
from Joan Halifax on the subject of Hope

45
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,759
and she talked about the existence of wise hope that ordinary hope is is sort of

46
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,100
attached to some expectation that we would like to realize in our lives and I

47
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:11,419
hope this will be true we have this this great longing for something to be true

48
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:19,580
and if it doesn't become true then we are disappointed and we consider it a misfortune

49
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:26,160
or we condemn ourselves or we blame somebody for why this has not happened

50
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,320
and her point was that the difference between ordinary hope

51
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:38,039
that has to do with a dashing of expectations and disappointments that we might feel

52
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:43,199
that wise hope is not seeing things unrealistically but rather seeing things

53
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:49,500
just as they are including the truth of suffering

54
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:55,199
both its existence and our capacity to transform it

55
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:03,000
both its existence and our capacity to transform it it's when we realize we don't know what

56
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,340
will actually happen that this kind of Hope comes alive in

57
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:15,080
the spaciousness of uncertainty is the very space we need to act

58
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:22,319
in the spaciousness of uncertainty so if I am convinced that I am this kind

59
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:28,740
of person and that I will always react this way then I'm going to never give myself the chance to be anyway other

60
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:35,520
than I am or that you're that kind of person or that you approach the world this way all

61
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,699
of these beliefs I have these opinions I have about experience about life about

62
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:48,198
myself all of those things that we know

63
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,580
are not based upon the knowing of experience

64
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:58,159
but they are views that we hold

65
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:04,740
and they leave no room at all for the spaciousness of uncertainty

66
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,880
and impermanence

67
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:16,380
they leave no space at all for what's actually happening

68
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:23,759
what's actually happening so the other day I was um we have these these bowls in our our

69
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,039
house they're they're little Bulls they're they're not Pyrex but they're something like Pyrex you know you can

70
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:34,620
you can put them in the freezer you can put them in the microwave you can put them in the dishwasher and they they're

71
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:40,139
they're just a really handy size I always have them at hand for chopping

72
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:47,280
vegetables and putting things in or putting a few berries in or putting olives on the tables these little bowls

73
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,440
and we have a stack of them up on the Shelf I can just reach for them they're always there

74
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:58,580
and the other day I went to reach for one to put some berries in

75
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:06,240
and suddenly the whole stack Came Crashing Down out of the cabinet and hit the stone of the cabinet and shattered

76
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,840
into I don't know how many pieces it spread all over the kitchen

77
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:21,660
the first crash that came down uh was was quite startling and I

78
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:29,400
screamed having experienced myself screaming which was actually wonderful because

79
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:35,820
it caused me to think why am I screaming there must be something wrong with my body and it took me right into my body

80
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:41,339
and out of my head so it took the head a while to get to the point where it was whose fault is

81
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:47,880
this why did it happen you know all of those other kinds of things about why it shouldn't have happened

82
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:54,480
and I I said oh it's just glass I'm okay

83
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,360
nothing's hit me how interesting that I screamed

84
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:06,660
and in the midst of what might have been oh how am I going to clean all this up you know I don't have time to clean this

85
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:13,440
up I have something happening in a few minutes and there's glass all over and I don't have any shoes on and all of those

86
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,980
thoughts that came after that about how to deal with what was there

87
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:25,080
no problem I was calm as can be

88
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:31,380
because I was already in my body I had come back into the body to say oh it's

89
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:37,160
just glass and then it was just glass you just clean it up

90
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,080
and when the thoughts would come all those other thoughts came coming into the mind it was I didn't have any

91
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:51,019
opinion about them they were neither good nor bad nobody was good or bad

92
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:59,160
I could tell you a story about why it happened that would establish fault and blame

93
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,800
but really it doesn't matter it was just glass

94
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,760
the drama of the moment fortunately took me into my body most

95
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:18,180
times the drama of the moment takes you into trying to figure out what to do about something how to think about it we

96
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:23,640
have opinions about everything this is good this is bad this is better

97
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:31,380
this is worse I'm better this is better that shouldn't have happened that's your

98
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:37,519
fault oh this always happens this never happens

99
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:45,560
it is the ability to come back into the body out of the head

100
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:52,440
to say what am I actually feeling what do I feel

101
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:58,320
so that we don't get caught up in the stories about all the things we know already

102
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:05,160
that ignore what's actually happening the practice of getting into what's actually happening is the practice of

103
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:12,000
coming back into the body to say what's happening here what's going on with me every thought we have has some kind of

104
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,380
emotional content attached to it oh how did that happen blame blame blame

105
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:26,160
something blame I can hear the blame in that voice it wasn't curiosity about how it happened it was it shouldn't have

106
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,980
happened and to hear your voice speak the difference between

107
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:37,980
blame and curiosity is useful information about what

108
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:44,600
actually is happening what's what is truly happening

109
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:51,000
so I can hear Blame in my head I can hear Blame in the thought

110
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:58,079
and say oh blaming blaming is here but I don't have to continue blaming

111
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:03,980
I don't have to explain it to myself I can just say oh blaming is here

112
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:09,360
I don't have to become all of those thoughts

113
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,820
I don't have to become the person who always has to clean up

114
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:20,760
I don't have to become that if I Can See Clearly oh that's here oh

115
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:29,399
that's happening or maybe what I see is instead of feeling calm I feel shaken

116
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:35,339
mostly by my scream and I'm conscious of the shakiness

117
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:44,100
and so then I'm careful not to let the thoughts run away with me because I'm shaky I can feel the shakiness I

118
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:50,420
don't have to name it something that has a whole story attached to it

119
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,320
I could just say it was shaky

120
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:03,060
the conversation going on in our heads usually has the flavor of I know what

121
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:09,440
this is or I'm afraid because I don't know what this is

122
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:15,839
because we don't like to say oh I'm afraid

123
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,839
it's easier to say I'm at fault or I have a problem or this shouldn't be

124
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:28,260
happening than to say I don't know what's going on because that feels like it's out of our

125
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:34,920
control that feels not right that feels not familiar

126
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:42,079
it's easier to blame ourselves than to be in the space of unfamiliar

127
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:53,100
if you think about how you go through your day

128
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:58,800
you will notice that sometimes you have a very optimistic attitude toward what's

129
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:06,480
going to happen and other times you have a very defeated feeling about what's going to happen

130
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:13,800
so this afternoon I had planned I know I had planned his I

131
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:18,959
had a doctor's appointment this morning in several errands to run and I said okay this

132
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:26,220
chunk of time this afternoon I'm going to spend working on my talk and I know kind of what I'm going to talk about here's the well it didn't

133
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:34,620
happen this happened that happened something else happened and what I noticed was the mind was

134
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:41,519
running to there was a question that my husband and I had talked about should we get this carpet cleaner

135
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:47,279
and there was a cyber monday sale and I hadn't decided what kind of carpet

136
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:54,540
cleaner we should get and here I was busily thinking about carpet cleaners when I said

137
00:14:54,540 --> 00:15:02,880
this is being driven by Cyber Monday and I want to get a deal

138
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:08,399
and it and I said really really do I have to buy a carpet cleaner

139
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,680
today because it's Cyber Monday yesterday I wasn't thinking about buying

140
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,260
the carpet cleaner no no I don't have to think about this

141
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:24,899
and I went to my husband and said if you want to think about carpet cleaners feel free but I'm going to go do something

142
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:32,040
else now and and to watch the difference between how much tension there was around the

143
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:39,839
fact that it was Cyber Monday and these silly carpet cleaners and how much Freer I was to consider

144
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:46,079
what I was going to talk about tonight when I gave up the idea of buying a carpet cleaner

145
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:53,040
just to feel the difference in my body about how much space there was around me

146
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:59,880
when I let go of the need to get a deal which you know I could label it

147
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,980
something like greed or uh procrastination I mean I have all kinds

148
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:09,860
of stories I could tell you about why that was happening

149
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:17,779
but the important part was being able to see clearly that I was trapped

150
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:24,959
unnecessarily by something some idea I had about what needed to happen today in

151
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:30,000
this space and I was so grateful to be able to feel

152
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,279
that release of that the tension that was there

153
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:40,980
that had nothing to do with what I was going to talk about tonight it just had to do with

154
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:48,899
some imperative that I had imagined they had no basis in reality

155
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:55,560
that I was triggered I was triggered and to notice where are triggers show up

156
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:01,320
is not to say I'm always triggered by that or I am somebody who is triggered

157
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:06,900
by that but rather oh that's something I need to be familiar

158
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:14,220
with that trigger so that I can see the trigger I can be triggered and say fine

159
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:21,720
but I don't have to go there to see that we are independent of what

160
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:27,720
we see clearly we still have the ability to make a decision about it we don't

161
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:33,299
have to just fall into it just because it's a mind habit

162
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:40,260
when we become familiar with the Mind habit we become

163
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:45,780
disenchanted we no longer have to be drawn into the

164
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:53,240
Enchantment of that point of view of that way of being of that need to be

165
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,919
when we see it clearly there is the possibility of dispassion

166
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:04,820
we lose the energy of the drive

167
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:14,179
and we can just see it to not have an opinion about it

168
00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:19,279
releases us from being drawn into it

169
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,160
yesterday maybe the day before things are running together for me a bit right now

170
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:34,380
my uh my grandson was playing in a soccer tournament

171
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:39,539
and there was there were several teams and mostly kids had been pulled from

172
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:45,360
different teams for this turkey tournament and so he was playing with people he was

173
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:51,539
not familiar with and the coach wanted him to play goalie

174
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:57,120
and it is his belief that he's a terrible goalie and a great defender

175
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,160
so he didn't want to be goalie and he stood there with his hands on his

176
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,679
hips not wanting to be goalie and sure enough somebody kicked a really

177
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:13,380
hard ball right at him and one of the Rules of This indoor soccer game was that you couldn't touch it with your

178
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:19,440
hands or the other team got a point and so this ball came right at his face

179
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:25,260
and just put his hands up to block it which any sane person would have done I

180
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:30,900
think I can tell you all the things you might have done instead but that's what I

181
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:38,460
would have done and of course the other team got a point well this just confirmed for him

182
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:44,820
that he's not a goalie and the rest of the game he was just furious so they lost they they actually

183
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:51,960
were the only undefeated game going into the finals and the final game they were beaten by a team they had beat earlier

184
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:58,799
in the day and he was goalie and he was convinced it was all his fault that they were in second place

185
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:06,360
and he was crushed and I watched this blooming and blossoming and and falling

186
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,580
into and he went running out into the dark and hid behind a rock it

187
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:18,419
was all my fault it wasn't that he didn't that he was unhappy about being in second place it's

188
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:23,580
that it was all his fault and I thought about how often we do that

189
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:30,380
when Misfortune happens when something happens that we don't like it's all my fault

190
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,820
what if it's not your fault what if it's just happened

191
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:44,120
but if it's really not your fault

192
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:52,080
you know somebody was telling me that she was in a conflict with someone

193
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,419
and she tried to several ways of working it out I you know I'm doing this and I'm

194
00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:03,840
writing letters and I'm you know and nothing was working I'm just a failure

195
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:10,799
and I said you know you might consider that it's not your fault and it's not her fault

196
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:17,820
but that you're seeing things from a different point of view each of you has a different point of view

197
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:22,940
there doesn't have to be Fault In conflict

198
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:30,240
you don't have to be a flaming idiot because you don't agree with me you just don't agree with me

199
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,380
is that possible

200
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:41,659
you know the the tendency we have to know the right answer

201
00:21:41,659 --> 00:21:46,679
limits the possibilities and leaves us in a place where we're

202
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:54,059
constantly struggling and we're tied up in the struggle I'm working on this big project with my

203
00:21:54,059 --> 00:22:01,080
homeowners association and it's a speculative project and somebody managed to get themselves

204
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:06,900
put in my team who uh is opposed to the project doesn't want it to happen under any

205
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:13,500
conditions and so this other person is constantly trying is constantly undermining me you

206
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:19,500
know while she's doing this she's doing that she's not doing this and so I talked to her and said you know

207
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:27,980
I haven't even made a proposal that you know you're fighting against a proposal I haven't made I don't have the data yet

208
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:34,260
that didn't matter she was Furious and I thought about it and I said okay I

209
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:39,299
don't need this and one possibility is you remove yourself from the conflict right you

210
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:45,780
just walk away from it I don't need this I've got mine by the way

211
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:51,120
anyway I'm just doing this for other people all these virtuous thoughts and

212
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:57,620
I thought well you know mostly I'm feeling hurt that I'm being attacked

213
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:05,580
oh well that's interesting why is it hurting

214
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:11,159
well because oh and the the more I

215
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:15,860
dug into what was I actually feeling

216
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:22,980
I said well maybe I'll wait until the morning to decide whether I'm going to walk away from this and in the morning I

217
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:28,620
just got up and started again because part of what was happening was I

218
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:35,240
was just plain tired oh

219
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:41,340
when I gave up being sure I knew I was being unfairly attacked

220
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:46,100
then I could just get up the next morning and start again

221
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:54,059
we don't actually have to respond to everything that the mind tells us we

222
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:59,900
need to respond to we can just notice it's there

223
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:06,059
and we can give ourselves the space to maybe not know the answer

224
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:11,940
to maybe not be clear about what's happening it's okay to say you know I'm confused

225
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:18,960
at this point one of the things that happened this

226
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:25,740
morning was that that it was an annual Wellness visit that I did with my doctor and that I'm of an age that they do all

227
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:31,799
the age-related testing for you and so they were doing the the mental tests

228
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:38,940
and curiously enough my husband and I were talking about these tests yesterday and he told me about this drawing of the

229
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:46,020
clock and it you know it and uh how you you put the numbers on the face of the clock and then they tell you to find to

230
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:52,740
draw 11 uh 10 minutes after 11 and this is a measure of your mental acuity and

231
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:58,440
and oh and then the three words and then they come back later and ask you what the three words are well so she's

232
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:05,159
starting as soon as she told me about the clock I thought you know this isn't fair because I I worked this out in my head yesterday I know exactly how to

233
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:10,320
draw that clock [Applause] and here I am going through all of these

234
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:18,120
arguments about how this should I tell her is it honest not to tell her that I said wait a minute this is about what

235
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:24,960
do you remember and if I'm remembering yesterday then clearly I'm doing pretty well at remembering what's the problem here

236
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,539
but there was this sense that I was cheating because I knew about the test

237
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:36,299
and I could feel that oh I'm cheating I could feel the shame

238
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:42,059
and I could laugh about it but it didn't make it didn't change the

239
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:48,779
fact that it had the thought had been there and if my attitude had been a certain way I might have

240
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:54,559
devolved into a long story about how what a cheater I am

241
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:06,480
what it takes is a little bit of space in the habit of noticing what it feels

242
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,640
like with the what the trigger feels like in your body with the the thought

243
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:17,039
patterns that you typically have how they feel what's the energetics of that

244
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:21,500
what are the energetics I'm bringing to this moment

245
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:33,299
one day last week I had this really horrible dream fortunately I can't remember at this

246
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:38,340
point but I woke up just oh I know it was something about divorce so I was

247
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:43,679
being divorced you know my husband and I are happily married thank you very much and here I

248
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:49,140
was having this dream about divorce and he wasn't the person I was divorcing either which you know just added to the

249
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:57,919
confusion and I realized that something was going on in my life that what that I felt

250
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:04,820
rejected you know there was there was a feeling of rejection and I could feel that rejection

251
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:12,659
so from a psychological point of view it was useful to try to figure out why I was feeling rejected

252
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:20,400
but from a mindfulness point of view from an end of suffering point of view what was important was to realize that I

253
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:26,700
had a feeling of rejection and so I should be careful when I interact with my husband if he doesn't

254
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:34,140
say hello to me I should not feel rejected because he doesn't say hello just because I'm carrying that attitude

255
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:39,320
with me I should know that that's there

256
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:48,779
so that I don't add that knowing onto an experience and label it something it's

257
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:58,519
not so that I'm not Enchanted by what I know

258
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:04,039
so that I can't see clearly what's actually happening

259
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:11,460
because when you see oh this is what's happening oh there's resentment here

260
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:18,900
when you see oh resentment is here it breaks the energetics of that

261
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:24,900
resentment you can stop telling yourself the story about well of course I resent this

262
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,279
because this always happens

263
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:37,200
of course you're always going to take advantage of me and to notice how often

264
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:44,600
the familiarity of being the last one in the kitchen cleaning up feels good

265
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:52,140
and it's only the knowing that you're taking advantage of me that's causing the suffering

266
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:57,179
when in fact I like just making sure it's all clean

267
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:04,559
at the end of the day how how we formed the mental ideas about

268
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:12,539
of our experience is mostly about habit and inclination

269
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:17,299
and the inclination changes all the time

270
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:24,299
so if we become familiar with what things feel like in our body

271
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:30,120
then we have the information that allows us not to get trapped and Enchanted

272
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:34,580
by something that reminds us of something else

273
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:41,700
and in the dispassion of not having an opinion about it oh anger is here I

274
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:48,840
hmm I don't have to justify it I don't have to tell myself why it is I don't have to

275
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:53,600
reinforce it and I'm free to just let it

276
00:29:54,779 --> 00:30:00,740
be unentangled not part of who I am not part of who I need to be

277
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:10,380
there's so there's a poem here I want to read you see if I can find it

278
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:15,960
not following my text very well here we go so this is a new poem by Jane

279
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:21,200
hirschfield called uh two kerosene lanterns

280
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:26,820
the cat the cat walks the narrow shelf beneath the

281
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:32,120
window where many delicate things are arranged polished

282
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:37,200
ammonites a dried starfish three turtle netsuke

283
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:44,039
a few curls of birch bark too long unused kerosene lanterns

284
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:52,140
as if on their own two hands fly up to cover the person's face to cover the eyes already closed the crash as it must

285
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:59,820
arrives the hands lower slowly the cat sits on the floor in the room's

286
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:08,039
middle calmly licking one paw the law of cats is simple

287
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:15,320
one Arrangement becomes another people are strange

288
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:23,120
the law of cats is simple one Arrangement becomes another

289
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:29,399
people are strange it's our expectation that something's

290
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:35,360
going to happen that leads to the disappointment

291
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:43,080
but when we truly grasp the idea and the feeling and the

292
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:49,760
experience that things arise and pass away

293
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:57,440
we're much less likely to be subject to knowing the outcome

294
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:04,500
knowing it's always going to be this way it's hopeless to even get to try this

295
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:10,919
because it's always going to be this way and we have the energy to start up again

296
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:16,460
and again and again and again and again and again

297
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:23,640
and we become people who experience equanimity

298
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:32,700
as being the the condition in the moment of just seeing oh it's that way

299
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:39,360
oh this is what's happening oh things were a little chaotic at the

300
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:47,419
moment the glass is all over the kitchen yep the glass is all over the kitchen

301
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:55,039
I can have an opinion about that but it doesn't change the fact that the glasses all over the kitchen

302
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:00,320
and I'll probably clean it up

303
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:06,620
yep that's what happens that's exactly what happens

304
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:13,080
and there's no suffering in that it's just glass it's just two kerosene lanterns it's

305
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:17,480
just one Arrangement leading to another arrangement

306
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:27,600
when I say it that way it sounds sort of pollyannaish you know just wait and it'll all be better

307
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:34,799
but in fact it is still broken glass all over the kitchen it's not pleasant and it's not wonderful

308
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:40,220
it's not beautiful and I have to replace the Bulls or do without them

309
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:47,120
but I don't have an opinion about them that leads to suffering for me

310
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:54,600
I don't have the need to explain it away my clumsiness you're putting something

311
00:33:54,600 --> 00:34:03,919
where it doesn't belong it just is and the sense of it just is

312
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,658
the place where we can free ourselves of the enchantment that leads to

313
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:16,159
suffering it just is

314
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:22,878
and the next moment I have my intention and my next step

315
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:27,260
my intention and my next step

316
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:36,780
it frees me from having to be better than I am while having an intention

317
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:42,780
that is consistent with how I want to be in the world not who I want to be in the

318
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,898
world

319
00:34:53,700 --> 00:35:02,119
tashania calls mindfulness practice not a self-improvement project but a

320
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:08,760
self-unraveling project I kind of like that way of thinking about it a self-unraveling

321
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:16,400
where it's a process as we see more and more clearly what's actually happening we become

322
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:24,260
disentangled from all of the conditions that we that impose on our lives

323
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:32,119
and in that disentangling we can just see it oh

324
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:41,520
all of us do things that we're not proud of

325
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,980
or there's an outcome we're not proud of

326
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:54,119
well I I the other day I made a pie actually it wasn't a pie it was something else I deliberately don't want

327
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:59,838
to call it a pie because it didn't look like a pie in the end

328
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,820
and it was a recipe I'd never tried before and I you know here's his thing and I looked at it and I thought God

329
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:12,300
that looks awful but you know it tasted really good if you didn't call it a pie

330
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:18,720
it was pretty good but calling it a pie put it in a

331
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:26,839
category where there was an expectation about what it should look like you know it was awfully dark for a pie

332
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:39,780
but it was really good you had to just uh look at it

333
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:46,079
with the idea that it was a pie so my husband who wanted a pie went

334
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:52,460
around telling everybody about how I had made this pie and I kept saying oh it's not actually a pie

335
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:59,820
who knows with the people who were eating it were thinking but how you felt about it had something to

336
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:07,940
do with what you named it what category things that it went in

337
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:15,660
you know so we we think we think that uh

338
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:23,940
the way to peace that in a peaceful State we're going to be relaxed and at ease that at ease is

339
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:29,240
is you know you can imagine yourself settling into it

340
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:35,579
and everything is sweet you know every piece is about sweetness

341
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:42,540
right not really not really I ran across something

342
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:49,760
a description this afternoon I see if I can find the right tag here

343
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:59,880
yeah so this was this was something written by uh ajan mahabuwa

344
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:08,700
he was talking about his uh meditation and how sweet it was

345
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:17,220
and he said the radiance this Radiance of meditation is the ultimate counterfeit

346
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:23,640
at that moment it's the most conspicuous point you hardly want to touch it at all

347
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:29,820
because you love it and cherish it more than anything else in the entire body there is nothing more

348
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:35,640
outstanding than this Radiance which is why you're amazed at it love it cherish

349
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:43,560
it dawdle over it want nothing to touch it but it's the enemy King unawareness

350
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:50,940
once when I went to practice at watto damachetti the problem of unawareness

351
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:56,280
parentheses ignorance had me bewildered for quite some time

352
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:01,800
at that stage the mind was so radiant that I came to Marvel at its radiance

353
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:08,280
everything of every sort which could make me Marvel seem to have gathered there in the mind to the point where I

354
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:13,859
began to Marvel at myself why is it that my mind is so marvelous

355
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:20,940
looking at the body I couldn't see it at all it was all space empty

356
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:26,339
the mind was radiant in full force but luckily as soon as I began to Marvel

357
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:33,839
at myself to the point of exclaiming deludedly in the heart without being conscious of it

358
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:40,220
why has my mind come so far at that moment a statement of dhamma

359
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:45,359
spontaneously arose this too I hadn't anticipated

360
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:51,720
it suddenly appeared as if someone were speaking in the heart although there was no one there speaking

361
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:58,020
it simply appeared as a statement if there is a point or a center of the

362
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:04,400
knower anywhere that is the agent of rebirth

363
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:10,619
that's what it said as long as there is identification with

364
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:15,780
anything any sense of nowhere we are still Bound

365
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:21,780
by the conventional conditioned mind beware

366
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:27,060
of ecstatic States and lovely meditations that convince you everything

367
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:33,000
is wonderful it is at that moment that you are re-entering the cycle of

368
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,820
samsara because you have identified with that

369
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:46,520
experience it's in the identification with the experience that the suffering arises

370
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:55,320
the ability to just see the condition ah now we're in a different space

371
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:02,220
it is not me it is not the knower it is the being

372
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:09,920
is the being that gives rise to the space where anything is possible

373
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:17,820
where we truly Embrace impermanence and the arising and passing away

374
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,720
of what's there

375
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:30,960
it's not in the giant understanding that we find the freedom of nabana it is in

376
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:37,980
the small it is in the everyday small

377
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:44,579
oh this is what's happening may you all see clearly

378
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:49,980
may you know the end of enchantment

379
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:57,000
the freedom that comes with disenchantment with dispassion

380
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:04,280
with things just as they are those are my thoughts thank you

381
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:13,160
sorry I went a little too close to the edge here anybody has any comments I'd be happy to hear the questions

382
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:35,220
no great so

383
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:41,520
to the spontaneity of noticing the arising as well as the

384
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:48,140
passing away I wish you all a good night
