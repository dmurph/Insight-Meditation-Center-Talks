and holding their journey both in care with a lot of space

168
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,159
spaciousness

169
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,840
i care for you

170
00:31:52,880 --> 00:32:01,840
i care for you and i can't make your choices for you

171
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:11,440
i care for you and i acknowledge you like all beings

172
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,840
have your own journey

173
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:59,518
hey you may i may we

174
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:11,840
have peace with the comings and goings of things

175
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:25,840
with things as they are

176
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:38,240
i care for you and whether i understand it or not

177
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:45,679
things are unfolding according to a lawful nature

178
00:33:46,559 --> 00:34:07,840
may i accept what is may you accept what is with ease and equanimity and balance

179
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:57,919
and for the last moments of this practice period

180
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:06,960
opening up equipoise equanimity for whatever arose

181
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,119
or did not arise during this practice

182
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:20,880
period sense of peace ease openness to the unfolding

183
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:27,520
just as it happened without resisting judging

184
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,839
pushing away grasping

185
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:40,400
freedom freedom of heart freedom of heart

186
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:48,400
letting it be just as it was just as it arose

187
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,680
with peace

188
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,839
may all beings everywhere

189
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,400
be at peace

190
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:17,599
may all beings everywhere be free in their hearts and minds

191
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,839
including ourselves

192
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:42,369
[Music]

193
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:55,839
thanks everyone thanks for your practice

194
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:08,160
so we have some time for reflections

195
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:15,040
for questions for reports from the field of your

196
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:22,240
experience reports from the field that can be

197
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:28,160
supportive not just for yourself as you verbalize them but also supportive for

198
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,520
the entire community

199
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:40,640
so what did you notice what a rose and especially if you haven't shared for a

200
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:48,240
while or spoken you are invited to please share you can raise your hand

201
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:55,760
your zoom hand or type in chat and if you type

202
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:03,119
privately to me i won't say your name and if you type to everyone i will

203
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,039
read it out loud with your name

204
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:24,160
jessie please all right thank you yeah so

205
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:32,000
a question that's coming up for me is because you had mentioned that aloofness is uh one of the enemies

206
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,480
near afar i'm not i forget uh yeah okay thank you yeah so what that

207
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:44,560
brings up for me is um just a question about curiosity and investigation

208
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:50,960
and how much because i find that uh you know to i don't want to be

209
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:56,320
distant i want to be engaged and but it just strikes me that too much

210
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:02,880
engagement or curiosity or investigation seems to kind of go to another

211
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:08,960
side where it's uh it doesn't feel autonomous anymore i'm wondering if you could uh comment on

212
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:14,079
that yeah thank you so much for raising this because this is so important that

213
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:21,520
balance so yes too much investigation too much kind of being in it like this thing that's

214
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:27,040
happening to you actually you can tell me if that's what's coming up what do you mean by

215
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:35,359
investigation there is that what you mean or do you mean something different yeah exactly i just like i guess i feel

216
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:41,440
like i i don't want to get too wrapped up in whatever is arising the hindrance or

217
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:48,240
the aversion or the correct grasping whatever it might be right but uh uh not too aloof

218
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:55,359
either yeah yeah perfect so so actually your question what you're

219
00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:02,400
raising here is is a perfect opportunity to to talk a little more about and tease out

220
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:08,160
not just the near enemy but the far enemy which is the opposite the far enemy is the opposite i love this

221
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:14,640
archaic language fire enemy is the opposite near enemy is the masquerade or something that feels like it aloofness

222
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:22,079
often is what it feels like and then the opposite is um aversion or entanglement what you

223
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:28,160
were describing like oh and and it's okay follow you you notice you're

224
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:34,079
investigating well this is how it happens i fall into the the far enemy becomes the opposite it's

225
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:39,520
not equipoise holding it all it's too too entangled with this friend and their

226
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:47,440
suffering or it's like oh i don't like it make it go away right so so that's exactly that so the the the

227
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:53,200
invitation i have is great you've noticed that the first thing is to notice instead of

228
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:59,680
practicing practice the thinking we're practicing equanimity but we're actually entangled in there or we're having a lot of aversion so

229
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:05,680
without any judgment noticing oh this is what's happening okay here it is the

230
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:14,480
are i knew you were going to show up at some point okay now i get to practice with you and kind of find my way on my way with this practice

231
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:22,319
so so noticing it and what what can support that is the sense of

232
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:29,200
uh connection and care is kind of spacious you know you care for someone but you're

233
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:34,560
not in there trying to fix their problems you care for them and you're giving them

234
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:40,800
so much space there's so much space it's almost like loving someone from afar

235
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,800
you care for them and you know that this is their journey and

236
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:54,560
it is part of your journey too so there's that's where you can still be connected the sense of care

237
00:41:54,560 --> 00:42:00,319
but with a lot of space giving them space does that does that help jesse tell me what's coming up for

238
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:05,359
you yeah that's great i guess because something you said was that uh

239
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:11,280
equanimity has a quality of warmth to it and i guess i'm finding that it also

240
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:17,760
has a quality of kind of a gentle action you know not not just ignoring things

241
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:25,119
but yeah the application of wisdom so yeah that's great yeah yeah great yeah thank you yeah it's

242
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:32,079
it's and the gentle action is is it's ac the gentle action of inaction

243
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:37,440
in a way like giving the action is not getting entangled giving a lot of

244
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:43,040
space staying engaged i mean that's the parts that the action you're talking about

245
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:49,280
it's beautiful because it's a way of staying present staying present and

246
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:55,920
and one one image that comes up for me is at the deathbed of someone you care for and love and knowing that it is at

247
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:02,000
the end and you can't get in there and try to fix it and you can't hate it just holding presents holding press

248
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,599
you're engaged you're breathing with them and there's a sense of yeah this is this is the

249
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:14,480
journey that needs to happen thank you so much for for bringing that

250
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:23,440
up jesse very very helpful thank you yeah and linda says i had to make myself

251
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:28,560
the friend odd but beneficial great great that's

252
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:33,760
that's terrific it all works what however doing the practice works for you

253
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:39,680
in this way you can be your own friend in fact i often think of ourselves

254
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:45,920
where we can both be our benefactor our good friend we can be our difficult person sometimes

255
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:51,359
neutral person like person we don't quite know really we think we know so we can work with

256
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:56,400
ourselves with all of those categories and forrest says equanimity seems to be

257
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:03,680
much subtler than the other brahmaviharas and i often find i have a hard time identifying is this

258
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:11,560
it or tapping into it yeah thank you forrest um equanimity is subtler

259
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:17,920
absolutely glad you're calling it out which is why it's the fourth one we kind of build up to it with practicing the

260
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:24,880
other three um and and um

261
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:31,200
the the um questioning is this id is this not

262
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:36,240
um there's a sense of you know equipoise kind of both

263
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:43,280
there's a care but there's an openness so um and you will know when you're in

264
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:49,760
it when you fall out of it so that's the invitation i have for you first kind of when you feel like ah this feels like a

265
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:57,760
looseness or too much attachment and then you go into equanimity oh this is more refined the lens of perception becomes uh more

266
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:03,200
attuned and jerry asks is it the process

267
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:10,199
also of setting boundaries um [Applause]

268
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:16,960
it it could be i mean this is a slightly different language and different uh per

269
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:22,640
different lens setting boundaries but in in some ways is giving them their own

270
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:29,440
boundary giving them space right you can uh maybe it's a boundary of spacious right

271
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:35,040
it's somehow yes you can think of it as boundary but somehow setting a boundary

272
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:42,160
seems that you don't care anymore i mean you are still caring you're still and yet you it's so um

273
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:49,440
i don't know how helpful it is to use the that terminology might be maybe not but maybe i'll just leave it at that

274
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:55,839
yeah thank you all right so very rich um

275
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:03,839
reflections and conversation so let's

276
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:10,160
take our practice on the road question mark road and practice it in

277
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:16,079
instead of just silently with ourselves with our eyes closed now in the field of interpersonal

278
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:23,599
relationships with people who uh are practitioners with you in this field

279
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:28,960
so in small groups let's start with 30 seconds of

280
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:34,720
award-less meta for each other knowing that other people are wishing goodwill for

281
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:40,960
you and then sharing however little or much you like to share about

282
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:48,079
your practice and this way of connecting with equanimity um and ease so i'm going to

283
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:57,040
create the uh rooms here here we go

284
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:05,040
okay so almost there

285
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:13,680
okay ready opening opening them now okay welcome back everyone the rooms

286
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:20,319
are closed and we have a couple minutes for reflections what did you notice what did

287
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:25,440
you find out and especially if you haven't shared or are new um
