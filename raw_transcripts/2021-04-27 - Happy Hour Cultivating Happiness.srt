3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:23,039
like to invite us to to explore this idea of happiness

4
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,480

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,880
cultivating cultivating good will for ourselves and others

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:42,160
the four traditional phrases are may may you be safe may you feel safe

7
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:48,239
may you be happy may you be healthy may you have ease may you take care of

8
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:56,480
yourself happily or may i of course so first one having to do with safety second one with mental happiness

9
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:04,158
second and the third with physical happiness which is health and the fourth wish having to do with

10
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,240
um ease like our lives flowing with ease taking care of ourselves happy kind of in the

11
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,479
worldly way so so last week we spent some time exploring

12
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:24,720
um this idea of offering safety this wish of safety may i feel safe may i be safe may

13
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,799
you be safe feel safe etc and weeks we took some time exploring that just landing with that

14
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:37,759
like what does that mean how what does that open up and um based on your reflections

15
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:44,880
dear saga it seems to have been a an impactful and helpful exploration

16
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,680
to just i see some nods yes thank you just really stay with this

17
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,920
with the safety explore that that first wish of meta as the basis for everything else and if you're wondering

18
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:04,719
what that was you can go to audiodharma and it's recorded wednesday and friday

19
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:10,720
of last week so so now um the invitation is okay

20
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:18,319
let's consider let's let's hang out a little bit and explore as we cultivate our hearts

21
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,520
and goodness and good will this wish of

22
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:30,400
this wish for happiness may i be happy may you be happy

23
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:37,120
may may i have a heart full of joy may you have a heart full of joy

24
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:44,000
so so happiness for on the face value yes it seems pretty

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,560
basic this we want to be happy we want others people who we only care

26
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,920
about that can start there people who we care about you know we want them to be happy there's a sense of

27
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:04,080
reflective joy reflected happiness and and some people might say

28
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:11,360
the goal of life being is to be happy um some might say that and and in some

29
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,959
ways also um let's consider that

30
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:23,519
if the goal is just to be happiness in and of itself the goal of life is just to be happy by

31
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:30,080
any means necessary then it can become really contracted

32
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:37,680
whereas various studies point out to when we actually are um

33
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,080
there's a sense of engagement purpose kind of being engaged in our lives uh

34
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,640
and many other factors but then a sense of happiness arises so the point i

35
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,319
want to make is that when we wish ourselves happiness when we

36
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:02,720
wish others happiness here to really bring this nuanced

37
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:09,280
awareness that it's not a grabby it's not an attached to outcome may i be happy i

38
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,959
still want to be happy i'm so miserable i want to be happy oh that can actually make the heart more

39
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:21,919
contracted or if we were wishing it for others may you be happy i so want you to be happy

40
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:27,199
you're dear person to me i want you to be happy i'm going to call you afterwards and see if you're happy now because i've

41
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:34,240
been wishing you happiness did it work did it for 30 minutes so when it's grabby when it's so there's

42
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:41,040
tightness there is um such tight attachment to outcome oh the heart

43
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:47,040
gets squeezed there is not the real happiness gets squashed even though we might be wishing

44
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:54,639
happiness so considering that this wish for happiness is really an offering it's a gift

45
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:01,120
it's a gift it's it's an invocation it's just it's it's a lightness now may

46
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:07,440
you be happy may you be happy it's a gift of generosity it's a gift of goodness

47
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:15,199
with no strings attached that we offer others and similarly let's see

48
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:23,360
what it feels when we offer to ourselves with this invocation may i be happy

49
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,560
may this heart of mind contain joy ah and let it be an

50
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:37,360
aspiration an aspiration it uplifts our heart instead of may i be happy may i be happy i

51
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,720
i i'm wishing myself to be happy right you feel the difference i'm making a bit

52
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,960
of a caricature but it can be true after we do it for a while some contraction could be like oh i'm

53
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:55,199
doing metta and i'm realizing gosh i'm really miserable doing meta oh well notice how you're doing it

54
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,400
what's the the emotion with which the the relationship to

55
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,440
the way we're doing it it's not just the object but

56
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:12,639
the relationship the way so well i've said plenty to set the context

57
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:19,759
and we'll just hang out with this wish for happiness and feel it in our bones bring it up um

58
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:27,360
etc but yeah let's keep that frame in mind so without further ado

59
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:35,520
let's start practicing together so ah so

60
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:49,840
inviting you to get into your meditation posture landing in your body

61
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:58,720
you could be sitting or lying down [Music] no difference see what your body needs

62
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:07,199
and whether sitting or lying down let there be a posture a sense of

63
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:16,880
integrity to your spine for your spine to be straight

64
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:23,280
ah landing in the body and gently

65
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:31,840
if it's comfortable for you closing the eyes turning your gaze inward

66
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:45,759
resting resting landing

67
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:51,759
spend the first part of the practice

68
00:07:52,160 --> 00:08:00,479
just arriving connecting with the breath in the body to settle the mind

69
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:12,080
to arrive bringing awareness

70
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,599
to your lower abdomen

71
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:24,000
letting the breath be received in the lower abdomen

72
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:32,159
received on its own one birth at a time

73
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,640
you don't have to pick up breathing as a chore or a task

74
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:46,640
it's been happening all this time just let it unfold simply

75
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:54,959
receive let awareness as if awareness is a butterfly resting

76
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:02,399
resting and your abdomen

77
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,839
rising and falling with the breath

78
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,680
the natural wave

79
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,839
this is the wave of the ocean rising and falling

80
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,040
and with each out breath

81
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:51,839
ah let go let go some more

82
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,519

legs offering their weight to the earth

87
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,720
when the thoughts arise as they will and it's okay

88
00:10:52,880 --> 00:11:00,480
gently smilingly whisper to them in your mind thank you

89

hanging out intimately lovingly with the breath

95
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:25,839

body

100
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:41,839
appreciation for this moment of just sitting

101
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:51,839
or lying down and breathing the simplicity of it the refuge

102
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,840

103
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,519
to receive the breath in the body

104
00:17:53,919 --> 00:18:01,360
the abdomen the lower body sense of embodiment

105
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,600
here here connected

106
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,440
to the earth

107
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,480
conjuring up bringing

108
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,440
to our embodied mind filled sense of

109
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:34,720
the image of someone who's dear to us we have a simple

110
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,600
relationship with them ideally

111
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:47,520
until we care for and we want them to be happy

112
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,600
ideally someone who's alive

113
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:58,720
for this particular practice choose someone who's alive right now

114
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:05,600
someone whose presence do you feel safe

115
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,840
there's a sense of ease

116
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:20,799
maybe when you consider this person or this being could be a pet

117
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:28,640
or a child maybe a smile shows up on your face

118
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,960
you wish them well

119
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,559
there is a natural good will natural sense of connection with this

120
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:50,840
being bring them to mind as clearly as

121
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:56,000
possible hearing their voice or sound if you're

122
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
auditory you're visual seeing them in action

123
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,840
moving as if they're in front of you

124
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:25,840
noticing what comes up in your heart just a simple wish for well-being

125
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,480
happiness

126
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,840
for this being

127
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,919
for the purpose of this practice as we explore

128
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:06,240
maybe imagine them with a sense of happiness and so well-being

129
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:14,840
like they are fully inhabiting their body

130
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:22,720
their goodness they're shining they're shining the sense of happiness

131
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,360
perhaps

132
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,840
contentment

133
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:45,840
just imagining so we feel into it

134
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:56,840
knowing that there also might be areas of this dear person's life which right now are

135
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:04,159
challenging because all of our lives they're all aspects we all have aspects

136
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:09,039
that are challenging it's part of the human condition

137
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:17,919
so as we wish them happiness it's not that we're trying to

138
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:24,640
push away make those challenges go away we acknowledge

139
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,720
their challenges and yet from the goodness of our heart we offer

140
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:41,120
this wish without any strings attached

141
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:47,840
whatever the condition is right now for them some happiness a moment ago we imagined them happy just

142
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:55,840
to feel into it and now letting them be in their natural

143
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:03,120

187
00:31:45,200 --> 00:32:01,840
and strike the bell the right resonance ah something might awaken

188

gladness wishing it for others for yourself did you notice when you were wishing

242
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:02,640
maybe i'll plant a question ah great now i guess please john

243
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:11,520
thank you nikki jo let me open my video too hello so one thing i realized was that

244
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:18,960
as i was pushing happiness for myself and for uh others is that i

245
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:26,240
realize how my mind is conditioned to think i can be only happy if i have certain

246
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:32,000
things like if i have health or if i have a partner or if i have a certain body

247
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,079
and then i realize that it is very beautiful this practice you

248
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:43,359
are not conditioning on anything that's saying just like go directly to the happiness because i'm

249
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:48,720
sure if we achieve those we find other goals to postpone our happiness

250
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:55,440
too that was very nice brilliant brilliant thank you so much

251
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:01,520
for sharing that beautiful insight exactly i'll be happy only when only

252
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:07,040
when it's so common we are conditioned exactly oh yes i can't be happy and yes

253
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:15,280
no actually i can be happy with all the conditions of my life because there's always be something joseph goldstein

254
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:21,200
a a famous teacher in this tradition says if it's not one thing it's another

255
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:29,280
there's always one thing or another there's always something so just um so this this yes we can be happy

256
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:35,839
with all the conditions beautiful thank you thank you nerius and linda thanks you too for your thank you

for your insight thank you mark please

258
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:52,000
i have been taken by a line i read this afternoon

259
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:01,839
eddie hillson who died at auschwitz at the age of 29 wrote

260
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:07,359
if you don't understand why you're here that all outer experiences

261
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:14,400
are like a passing show as nothing beside the great splendor inside us

262
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:22,400
then things can look very bleak here indeed 29 years old

263
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,800
thank you mark

264
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:36,800
hmm i am so touched by that thank you for bringing that in so wise

265
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:43,200
so wise so wise there's so much in that quote to

266
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:49,040
explore so many teachings it can be a whole one hour-long dharma talk there is so much

267
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:54,640
there to explore um yeah there's so much to explore in

268
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:00,480
that it's both the freedom inside you know really the freedom inside the

269
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:06,319
freedom inside and and this passing show that she talks about is really an

270
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:13,680
insight into impermanence into emptiness many mystics we've practiced like oh yes

271
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:19,839
there's there is a world and yet it's a passing show there can be so much freedom inside

272
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:26,960
in spite of conditions thank you for bringing that in mark thank you so much thank you

273
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:32,880
and maury christine asks for a copy of that quote if you felt if you're part of the google groups

274
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,920
if you wanted to share it on the groups or in chat that'd be lovely i think

275
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:45,599
the sangha would appreciate it thank you mark um alanis says exploring how nature can

276
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:55,359
be a benefactor yes yes absolutely beautiful thanks for bringing that in and um

277
00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:02,640
and one reflection private reflection thoughts of the person i was trying to give meta to already being happy

278
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:10,480
happy enough kept coming up ah um so was that

279
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:15,680
it was that supporting your practice or was it becoming a block you're welcome to

280
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:23,440
unmute yourself if you'd like to reflect or if you want to type in chat you're welcome to but

281
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:29,680
maybe i'll say something that if if it is if it came up in terms of oh they were

282
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:35,760
happy enough they don't need my wish oh notice if that's if that's an edge

283
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,880
because we're practicing this generosity as a generosity of our heart

284
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,480
as a generosity of our heart again not attached to the conditions outside and

285
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:54,079
in fact if they're happy then it could be um

286
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:05,040
it could become the practice of mudita happiness for another person's happiness so the generosity could be explained that way

287
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:11,760
got it hindering yes you wrote yes so in that way see if if it can actually can

288
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:17,839
is the edge of the practice of mudita vicarious joy happy for other people's happiness because that's

289
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:23,760
where you're ending up with this practice it sounds like yeah and another reflection depression

290
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:30,319
is frequently my companion practicing receiving someone's wish for my happiness made me believe in it a

291
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:36,720
little more yay beautiful that's that's very sweet that makes my heart happy

292
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:44,800
um hearing that how that landed so so dear ones let's turn let's

293
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:52,480
turn now to practicing in small groups and the invitation

294
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:59,680
is to um to start with 30 seconds of wishing

295
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:06,880
happiness for each other and then um share as much or as little as you

296
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:16,319
like to share about your practicing holding each other with kindness holding each other with with safety

297
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:27,920
so here's where the rubber meets the road and i'm opening the groups here we go

298
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,960
okay all the rooms are closed and everyone is

299
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:39,920
back welcome back everyone so we've got a couple of minutes for reflections what

300
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:46,400

301
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:53,280
haven't spoken for a while would love to hear your reflections please don't be

302
00:46:53,280 --> 00:47:00,000
shy what did you notice yes ariana please

303
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:07,520
hello hi i was just sharing at the very end um i was chatting you earlier and had a

304
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:14,079
difficult time during the meditation but when i came into the room those first 30 seconds of

305
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:20,559
giving meta to the others in the room that that was just wonderful that was so it

306
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:27,200
felt just so so easy and so natural whereas the meditation did not as much

307
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:34,480
for me today unfortunately yay yay that's i

308
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:42,480
just makes me so happier thank you so much for sharing that because that is so important right both to see that and also whole to

309
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:51,359
to allow yourself to be beautifully witnessed in this way and for the benefit of others because

310
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:57,200
both parts are practiced the first part is practice silently and the second part is practicing community and

311
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:02,559
both parts are just as important and sometimes yes the first one kind of prepares us

312
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:08,480
it does us in a way we can't quite just like yeah maybe we think it's not working but something is working

313
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:15,119
and then you go into this community and oh wow it just it's flowing it's it flows with

314
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:22,400
ease so um i'm just i'm filled with with joy with happiness hearing your

315
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:28,160
