1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:09,519
so greetings and welcome to the continuation of our

2
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:16,160
exploration of mindfulness of breathing and by now i think you'll understand

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,160
that mindfulness of breathing involves much more than breathing but that breathing

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,920
mindfulness of breathing is kind of a foundation in which we begin to open up our

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,040
awareness to more and more of our experience

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:39,680
and at some point this you know as we open up to our body our feelings our minds

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,120
our mind activities mind states and so there's kind of an expansion

8
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,719
opening the metaphor i like to use and so it's not narrowly focused only on

9
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,000
the breathing and at some point as we do this the

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
the very idea of opening the feeling of opening the experience of opening becomes more and more salient and more

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,439
and more experienced experientiable that more and

12
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:17,759
more this stands out the sense of opening and in contrast to that it's possible to

13
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,040
feel a closing and this movement is that i'm calling

14
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:31,200
opening and closing can be represented by many words many ideas and

15
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,920
the buddha used the word as a word obstructing that sometimes we cover over and we get

16
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,799
certain activities of mind obstruct and others remove the obstruction and has more

17
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,399
expansion and openness of attention and we can see that i think relatively easy in some

18
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,840
circumstances in life where in know very quickly we can suddenly get

19
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,200
completely caught up in some concern completely you know the mind attention

20
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,119
everything gets focused very tightly around a preoccupation someone says

21
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:12,879
something to us which is maybe disrespectful and the whole universe

22
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:19,440
collapses around that disrespect our feelings our ideas our thoughts or maybe our fears

23
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:26,160
resentments whatever it might be and where it gets swimming and that's the story of it

24
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,680
and so maybe there's not much openness anymore uh to take a bird's eye view of the

25
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,040
situation and what just happened and what's happening with us and then

26
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,319
other times we have that bird's eye view we have this broad field of awareness and we're

27
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,680
relaxed and open and someone might do the same thing say something disrespectful

28
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,440
but we don't close down in fact maybe we do the opposite we actually open even more and like oh

29
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,040
what's going on here what's happening here let's let's uh i don't even know i don't

30
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,840
i don't quite understand all this but this is a time to be present and open and take in the full

31
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:14,319
range of what's happening myself the context the other person and there's a clear feeling of opening

32
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:21,440
being preoccupied caught up in things is something that the buddha says brings

33
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:28,879
blindness and a lack of wisdom this movement towards opening is

34
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:34,640
movement towards wisdom and vision

35
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,000
and so getting starting to get a sense of this difference is an important part of

36
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,599
this practice and this has this becomes more more relevant

37
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:51,040
when in the process and in the process of mindfulness of breathing we become more

38
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:58,319
attuned to the state of mind because it's the state of mind that shifts and

39
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:05,120
changes and so to uh so we certainly can know that we're preoccupied with resentment

40
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,400
or or uh caught up in our our hurt or whatever it might be

41
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,160
and um the uh or in our desires and we lose touch with

42
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:23,280
everything else around us and we can know that we're involved in that but to appreciate the impact that

43
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,600
preoccupation has how it shifts the mind state it shifts the quality of awareness the openness of

44
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:36,160
awareness the ease and receptivity of awareness that becomes interesting

45
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,880
and and so to notice this movement between closing down and opening up

46
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:49,440
covering over preoccupied versus kind of available attention that's open and

47
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,560
available because it's not preoccupied as practice goes along

48
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,400
there's a shift of attention from the details of our life the stories

49
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:08,080
of our life the history of our life a shift little bit even from our beliefs

50
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:16,080
and ideas desires aversions opinions and to the quality

51
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,440
of the mind state and we become the custodians

52
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:28,720
of that quality no one else can be the custodian of our inner the quality of our inner

53
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,240
life and so to begin finding a relaxed easy way

54
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,680
to to track it and know it and be able to gently

55
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,880
keep opening keep finding the way of peace keep finding the way where the mind

56
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,720
state is receptive and open with wisdom with real wisdom so that

57
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,080
we're safe in the situation and can take care of ourselves

58
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:03,520
so that's kind of the background for this meditation so if you can

59
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
begin by assuming a meditation posture

60
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,039
and if it's possible to do a posture that already in the posture

61
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:21,840
expresses a kind of openness availability

62
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,400
to life to experience

63
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,360
for me sitting cross-legged i sometimes really liked taking my hands on either side of my

64
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,280
hips on the floor math next to me and lift myself almost off the cushion

65
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:45,520
like i'm doing now and so i'm lifting up and then as i'm lifted up then i roll my

66
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:53,039
shoulders back a little bit and release and if i do that the shoulders roll back a little bit and

67
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:59,599
the chest kind of naturally kind of feels more open and that openness of the chest

68
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,080
can be one of the reference point for being open

69
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:17,039
and then gently closing your eyes

70
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:24,400
and this idea of openness we can be open-handed

71
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:31,199
and you might take a few moments to relax your hands and maybe even

72
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,960
turn your hands to palms upward so the hands are open and

73
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,080
available sometimes expressing openness in the

74
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:49,280
posture is supportive for the heart and the mind to do so become open

75
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,160
and perhaps you can as you exhale

76
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:04,639
relax the shoulders soften in the shoulders

77
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:13,840
and whatever softening release that happens in the shoulders let that travel down into your chest

78
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:26,639
and whatever reference point you have for being open-hearted

79
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,599
see if you can establish yourself as openhearted

80
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:41,839
open chested

81
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,000
and then as you exhale relaxing in the muscles of your face

82
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,760
sometimes those muscles are very intimately connected to what's happening in the mind

83
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,760
the tightness scrunching up the pulling in very subtly the micro

84
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,800
muscles of the face it's as if there's

85
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:19,920
the mind is a puppeteer with strings that go into the micro muscles of the face

86
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,920
to relax the face

87
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:37,760
around the eyes forehead and temple

88
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:45,440
the cheeks and the jaw might even be helpful to open your mouth

89
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,839
slightly so the jaw is not clenched

90
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,800
and then gently softly float

91
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:05,839
the teeth back together the mouth back together so there's a light touch with your lips

92
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:21,600
and whatever reference point you have for this as you exhale can you allow your mind to

93
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,600
become open to be open-minded

94
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,640
to your experience now

95
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,480
open-handed open-hearted open-minded

96
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:50,800
and taking a few moments also to set your body at ease

97
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:01,839
be easy with how things are in your body

98
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:08,880
maybe easing up if there's any heaviness or contraction

99
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:15,279
resistance in your body

100
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:21,360
see if you can find some even a slight sense of ease

101
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:29,839
being present for your body

102
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:43,839
and if possible set yourself at ease in your heart with your emotions

103
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:57,839
ease up on how you're feeling be easy with it

104
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,240
and then set your mind at ease

105
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,760
in whatever way it's you can a little bit ease up on what's

106
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,880
in the mind or be easy with it

107
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,800
so the awareness becomes a little broader

108
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,560
more available to receive

109
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,880
awareness is not recruited

110
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:43,040
to help us focus on our thoughts and desires and aversions fantasies

111
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,680
instead of being recruited to close down and narrow its attention

112
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,440
letting the awareness be at ease and open

113
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,839
receptive

114
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:25,839
and then within whatever openness that's here whatever ease that's here

115
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,920
to attune yourself to the breathing

116
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:39,920
the in-breath and the out-breath breathing through or with

117
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:49,839
open awareness ease full awareness

118
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:07,920
as you exhale letting go of your thoughts

119
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,519
and as you do so also see if there can be a

120
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:19,439
opening to a wider awareness or opening to opening

121
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:28,079
allowing the mind to have more space and room to silently

122
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,600
be aware of breathing body

123
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:50,560
appreciating any sense of openness or ease or

124
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,279
in the state of mind state of heart

125
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:06,959
breathing with it and notice the small and big movements

126
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,480
of losing that openness contracting

127
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,920
getting caught up in something

128
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,880
nothing you have to be feel bad about or criticize yourself for

129
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:31,040
but simply to be sensitive to that distinction

130
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:41,600
sensitive to the way the mind moves can move from being open to being more closed

131
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,519
relax to being contracted

132
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:54,240
preoccupied or being available and open

133
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,800
breathing with it all being easy with it all

134
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:09,600
but clearly aware of the difference and how the mind can move

135
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:23,839
around to different degrees of openness and less openness

136
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,840
no need to analyze or figure anything out or

137
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:51,039
stay very simple with appreciating if the mind gets more open

138
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:58,720
or more closed appreciate which direction mental activity is

139
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:06,880
taking you and see if you can keep choosing to stay

140
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:15,679
open move more it's very forgiving

141
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,520
it doesn't require a lot of understanding of what's happening

142
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:29,679
or justifying or criticizing it's just a very simple movement

143
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:36,880
opening or closing and when you can choose the opening

144
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:53,840
choose awareness

145
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,480
being upset about the mind closing down

146
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:58,320
is to do even more closing to be

147
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:06,640
equanimous about the mind closing down is to contribute more opening

148
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:14,000
as we become more aware and simply recognize what's happening

149
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,320
allowing the recognition to be wide and

150
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,840
open

151
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,228
[Music]

152
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,840
ah

153
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:04,130
[Music]

154
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:58,159
and then in the last minutes of this sitting maybe knowing it's the last minutes

155
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:04,480
you could let yourself become more open

156
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:10,960
maybe quiet the mind more and open up in a way that the heart mind is

157
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:16,240
broad and silently receptive

158
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:21,840
whatever degree of ease just being here

159
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:28,159
in a certain way nothing to do nothing to be

160
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:33,600
nothing to prove just here

161
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:42,080
with awareness open relaxed maybe even soft

162
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:53,200
and perhaps trying to keep it that way and see or see what happens

163
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:59,360
bring to mind some person that has been part of your life lately or

164
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:05,279
will be today and see if you can hold the image

165
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:12,080
the idea of this person in your mind without closing

166
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,919
without getting caught up in thoughts and stories and feelings

167
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:31,840
just for a few moments let the persons the idea the person float in the openness of the mind

168
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,799
and in doing so does that make it possible to have more

169
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:48,720
wisdom more clarity about something about yourself and them

170
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:04,240
might it make little bit more room for a simple good will

171
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:13,840
friendliness or generosity of heart

172
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:23,200
and if so maybe softly gently

173
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:29,360
give expression to that good will with these words

174
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,080
may this person be happy

175
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:42,640
may this person be safe

176
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:55,520
may this person be peaceful

177
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:01,200
may this person be free

178
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:12,880
and may you in staying open and at ease

179
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,919
in some ways contribute to this being possible

180
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:27,279
in some simple ways can you contribute to their happiness safety peacefulness

181
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:37,840
and freedom so at least they're safe from you

182
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:50,720
and then to expand that goodwill out into the world more widely

183
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,799
but without closing down

184
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,799
the air on the side of staying open and simple

185
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:11,200
and in that openness may all beings be happy

186
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,840
may all beings be safe

187
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:27,200
may all beings be peaceful

188
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:47,840
may all beings everywhere be free

189
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:09,440
so the mindfulness of mind or

190
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,960
breathing in experiencing the mind breathing out experiencing the mind

191
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:22,159
and i'm in you know what the exactly cheetah mind is i'm sorry arguing that we can't really

192
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:28,640
know what the buddha had in mind but i wanted to read you part of the

193
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:35,600
definition in the polytech society dictionary so them more or less a standard poly english

194
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:42,240
dictionary it was written over a hundred years ago now but it's still excellent resource for

195
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:48,640
understanding this and um and they have a wonderful little entry for cheetah the word that we're

196
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:54,960
mostly translating as mind it says the meaning of chitta is best

197
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:00,880
understood when explaining it by expressions familiar to us

198
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:08,960
as for example with all my heart and soul i have no heart

199
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:17,919
to do it blessed are the pure in heart singleness of heart

200
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:24,960
all of which emphasize the emotional and cognitive connotative side more

201
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:32,559
than it's the mental and rational side it may therefore be rendered mood

202
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:38,880
disposition state of mind so some people prefer to translate this

203
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:46,159
word cheetah as heart or as heart mind it kind of touches into the emotional

204
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:51,600
side of all this more than the word mind might even feel a little bit this

205
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,960
emotional this you know and not so connected to our emotional life

206
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,240
and uh and also when some people like me treat mind and awareness almost as

207
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:08,320
synonymous sometimes as we get into deeper meditation that also might kind of lend itself to

208
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:14,398
the idea that we're kind of being removed a little bit from the embodied emotional life that we have

209
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:19,760
and which may be a little unfortunate maybe this whatever cheetah is whatever the mind is

210
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:26,398
whatever awareness is maybe it's a rich world that includes our emotionality to some you know to

211
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:32,638
important ways and so uh

212
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:39,200
in the step eight seven and eight of mindfulness of breathing it's looking at the mental activities

213
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:45,200
recognizing the mental activities in the mind and now then relaxing those mental activities and they were or

214
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:50,638
tranquilizing or calming them which is that movement or opening having the mind

215
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:56,240
become open uh not contracted and as i said earlier the mind that's

216
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:02,240
preoccupied gets in my mind gets hijacked attention gets hijacked

217
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:07,359
by um our desires by our aversions by our

218
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:13,359
doubts by our restlessness our anxiety and um and it's almost like the times

219
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:19,599
are like a black hole that attention falls into and it doesn't really come out there isn't like we step

220
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:24,720
back and get the bigger picture we get swept away and our preoccupations

221
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:29,839
our thoughts our fantasies the stories our resentments all these kinds of inner

222
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:36,320
world of what goes on and um and uh and these are all mental

223
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:43,119
activities that hijack awareness and there are other mental activities that enable awareness or

224
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:51,920
open the mind that doesn't hijack but rather enhances the quality of the mind so uh the buddha

225
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:58,079
made the distinction between mental factors that do the closing the mind those that open is

226
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:03,359
a distinction between what's called the five five hindrances and the seven factors of

227
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:08,400
awakening the five hindrances are strong sensual desire

228
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:16,640
lust craving aversion ill will hostility when it's strong

229
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,320
sloth and torpor lethargy resistance

230
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:30,640
and and then agitation restlessness anxiety regrets kind of agitated states

231
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:36,160
of preoccupation and then confusion uncertainty doubt

232
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:43,599
that can really we get lost in the rabbit hole of doubt and confusion and these can have very strong

233
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:50,320
gravitational pulls and we you know we get pulled into them they can come sometimes with a lot of authority like this is really important

234
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:56,400
i have to be involved in this and but the consequence is that attention gets hijacked

235
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:02,560
and for the buddha when attention gets hijacked like this he calls that a loss of wisdom a

236
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:08,560
blindness an obstruction to the mind a covering over of the mind

237
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:16,000
a makes the mind fragile and brittle and hard and and

238
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:23,839
whereas the other that opens seven factors of awakening those are awareness mindfulness itself

239
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:30,800
um a clarity of mind that's sometimes called investigation

240
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:37,760
a effort joy tranquility samadhi

241
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:43,920
concentration and equanimity and all those can work together as a

242
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:49,599
whole and each of those can operate singularly to really kind of open the mind up and

243
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:56,160
open the inner quality of the inner life and this is where the emotional side really comes to play

244
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:01,359
i mean some of the most one of the most sublime beautiful emotions that's hard for the

245
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:06,560
people who haven't experienced it to appreciate is the quality of equanimity

246
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:13,119
um it's a you know it's uh just it's it's a beautiful kind of feeling

247
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:19,119
uh tranquilities has a kind of almost an emotional quality to it it's really strong and embodied and

248
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:26,320
broad and has a warmth and clarity to it stillness and peacefulness

249
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:32,000
joy of course seems emotional samadhi is an integration of bringing

250
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:39,839
together of all aspects of our life including the emotional so um but the the um the

251
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:48,320
the the what what these seven factors awakening are they are characteristics or supports

252
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:54,720
for awareness itself for mindfulness itself and so the more they operate together

253
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:02,560
with awareness they tend to open awareness strengthen awareness they create vision they support wisdom

254
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:08,880
they remove obstructions they remove the coverings that keeps us from seeing things clearly and

255
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:15,599
they make the mind malleable soft workable

256
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:23,359
ready to do the work receptive maybe to do do work and so here we're talking

257
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:29,599
about mental activities kind of that represent this divide between

258
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:37,119
becoming more closed or more open and and it's possible to cultivate each of

259
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:43,359
the seven factors awakening by itself to be attuned to them and learn to recognize them and support them

260
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:51,200
and it's also they they tend to grow in the wake of really emphasizing mindfulness

261
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:56,480
attention here but being attentive that the mindfulness

262
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:03,359
whatever way we practice it in and of itself is not a closing activity that it hasn't

263
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:08,560
uh there isn't some other factors that come along with mindfulness like striving or

264
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:16,319
or expectation or pushing or contracting around the

265
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:21,839
mindfulness that begins moving it in the direction of the hindrances closing down

266
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:26,880
so this ability to track the mind state allows us to be to protect the

267
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,960
mindfulness from being hijacked that way and so we can tell the mindfulness

268
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,240
now it's getting closed more as i try hard and maybe i can find a way to be more open

269
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:44,880
more relaxed and this simple movement from being more close to being more open well

270
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:50,319
yesterday i used to for gail fransdel the technical terms

271
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:57,280
ouch and ah what involves more stress or more suffering more discomfort

272
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:04,319
and what goes in the opposite direction to be able to see that simple divide is one of the primary

273
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:10,079
characteristics of the second factor of awakening as i said usually called investigation

274
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:16,800
but is really a clarity of mind that sees this surveillance sees this distinction

275
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:24,640
between the ouch and the ah being closed and being open um becoming blind or lost in our

276
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:31,280
preoccupations and opening up and having vision and and clarity what's happening

277
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:39,119
so this is one of the great advantages of beginning to tune into the mind state and i as i said in the meditation it's

278
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:45,440
fascinating i kind of said it's fascinating because they're very valuable and even healing

279
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:52,000
because just being attentive to that simple movement can free us from having to get caught up

280
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,359
in the details of what's happening whether it's right or wrong or am i good and bad

281
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:02,720
person because of what i'm doing this way and you can have the worst thought that

282
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:08,000
any preoccupation that anybody has ever happened in the history of humanity

283
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,000
and in this mind state thing it doesn't really matter that it's the worst thought anybody's ever had

284
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,760
it just matters that you recognize that you closed down you got tight and that there's an opportunity

285
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:25,280
then just to allow yourself to open and not and just let it go let it kind of recede

286
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:32,400
and move towards the openness of mind and so that's simple movement that's the direction to go can make the practice some ways

287
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,680
much simpler and very forgiving

288
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:46,240
so the mind state and so um that's

289
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,720
what we're doing today and

290
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:57,680
and we will continue tomorrow and then starting on monday the idea is to go

291
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:03,520
through these seven factors awakening uh and hopefully as we kind of linger in this area of the

292
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:10,640
mind state it's such an important one and and then we'll um go on from there

293
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:19,440
and um so thank you very much and i look forward to our time together

294
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,280
tomorrow
