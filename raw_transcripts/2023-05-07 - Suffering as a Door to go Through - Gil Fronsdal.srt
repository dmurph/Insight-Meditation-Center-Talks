1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:08,460
oh good morning everyone here in person good morning those of you hello for

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:14,000
those of you online maybe for some of you it's not morning

3
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:22,020
so happy to be here with you all nice to be together in person I think one of the I guess I guess is well

4
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:28,800
recognized now that that lack of Community has been a very big

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,840
negative impact of the pandemic and so they come back come together is

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,120
pretty important for many people and uh even if you're we're still

7
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:46,100
wearing masks here can you hear me okay is it loud enough for everyone

8
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:54,420
so um and we are discussing uh ending the mask requirement here at IMC we're like one

9
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,820
of the last big places right with with this some people show up at the door with

10
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,920
your surprise how could this be but we still are and at least for this

11
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,280
month May and it's a work in progress but we're considering ending that masks

12
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,340
in June so um or ending them being required

13
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:23,400
they're optional and recommended

14
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,880
after that so um

15
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,560
so the talk today could be titled

16
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,399
um suffering as a door to go through

17
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,720
and I think many of you know that one of the core aspects of

18
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,479
Buddhism or kind of Buddhism is addressing suffering and

19
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:58,920
the general idea or the kind of the ultimate idea they decides possible to end suffering bring suffering to an end

20
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,860
and um and that's you know it's fully fully enlightened is to bring suffering to an end

21
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:11,700
and that's perplexing for some people like like how could that be really like am I still going to be human if I don't

22
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,980
suffer at all and um and so some of this has to do with how

23
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:23,360
we Define suffering and I think that people Dharma teachers like me uh

24
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,040
seldom defined enough we just assume everyone knows what it is

25
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,300
you know we use the word suffering suffering suffering suffering until you suffer

26
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:46,440
what does he mean what's going on here and um the

27
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:53,160
and um it's a good I think it's really reasonable to question what this what we

28
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,500
mean by suffering and to have what do you mean what do you mean because for

29
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:05,700
example it doesn't mean all forms of sadness sadness feels uncomfortable therefore

30
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,800
because it's uncomfortable as I mean we're not enlightened you're not supposed to be sad anymore and if you're

31
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,379
going to be Buddhist good Buddhist you have to stop being sad please or no grief

32
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:22,019
does it mean that you never get annoyed or irritated is that that also is uncomfortable

33
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:28,700
so is that kind of you know crossing the line into suffering you know that's not supposed to be

34
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:35,519
um never be heartbroken you know see some of the things going on in the world and you're supposed to just kind of

35
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:42,959
continuing you know singing happy songs and smiling and you know well Rome Burns

36
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:50,519
or whatever it is so what about you know uncomfortable emotions is all of them supposed to go

37
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:56,519
or what so uh I think what's important to say

38
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:03,739
is don't look to Buddhism to answer those questions I just raised

39
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,540
that makes you more then now you're suffering more if we're frustrated more because wait a

40
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:16,560
minute that good isn't supposed to have answers it's supposed to describe things I think what Buddhism is trying to do at

41
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:23,820
least the kind of Buddhism that I'd like to espouse or that I see is is encouraging us to take a deep good

42
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:30,540
look at life and really and discover for ourselves what's going on in a sense answer those

43
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:37,080
questions for ourselves the questions that are really good what is suffering and is some suffering inherent and part of

44
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,360
even an enlightened life or are some forms of suffering um

45
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:48,540
you know are all suffering are going to go in but what is suffering what does that mean what are we talking about here

46
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:55,560
so to for you to answer that question for yourself and that requires stepping in and taking a good look

47
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:01,919
at whatever you might generally consider to be suffering so as some of you know the bumper

48
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,960
sticker I think Buddha should have for their cars is I stop for suffering

49
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:13,560
because to really take a good look to enter into suffering not to suffer better or more

50
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:19,500
but to do the opposite of running away from it the opposite of avoiding it

51
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:28,259
and the opposite of collapsing with it or the opposite of kind of just like just just living under the burden or the

52
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:35,520
struggle of some of this child emotional distress dismay pain that so many it's so common

53
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,860
the human life so to stop and take a good look at it so I call it a door

54
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:47,460
and so calling a door that you go through is maybe a paradigm shift

55
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:55,080
for how many people address their own suffering their own distress and stress and pain and challenges

56
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,539
because often we want to avoid it and we want to make it go away but we want to

57
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:05,880
like push it away or just cut it off or take a drug so we don't have to feel it

58
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:12,539
or something or be distracted and um but to stop and take a really good look and think of it

59
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:20,520
as a door that you have we develop a lot of faith or a lot of confidence this is a good

60
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:27,479
thing to do and that's a paradigm shift I've known people who've taught that

61
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:34,259
this kind of idea that you know you should turn around and be present for your pain and your suffering physical

62
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:42,860
pain even and really look at it and I've known that some people maybe some of you are here today already get angry

63
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:48,360
no this is terrible I'm here to get rid of it not to have it not to look at it

64
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:56,280
not that you would have to look at it and feel it even more my gosh you know this is like you know it

65
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:02,560
doesn't promise the end of it they now have to you know yes but

66
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,400
[Laughter] but this paradigm shift this kind of

67
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:15,840
almost almost a radically different way of looking at suffering where we don't see it as a burden we don't see it as an

68
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,240
oppression but we see it as a door that we go through to get to the other

69
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:29,039
side and um and and as we go through that door as we turn towards it then we can

70
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:34,080
start looking more and more deeply to understand the nature of that suffering

71
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,780
and we can answer the question which suffering is appropriate to live with

72
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:45,900
and maybe accept and maybe even appreciate as part of the richness of

73
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:52,680
being a human being and what part of the suffering do we have is just a really optional and

74
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:59,639
unnecessary and a product of the odd mechanations of my mind and

75
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:05,580
heart that don't really have to operate that way and so I see how that works the

76
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:12,960
operating system of certain kinds of suffering that comes from what's you know the unfortunate unnecessary functioning

77
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:19,259
of my mind and that I'm happy to let go of maybe it's not easy to let go of it but

78
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:24,780
I see now so we start seeing a distinction between their own

79
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:30,419
so in this regard I want to suggest that this investigation of suffering is

80
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:36,360
supported by taking a good look at three different aspects of things that could

81
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:45,200
be called suffering just inherently some people might say it or are

82
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,519
sometimes are the kind of thing that Buddhists call suffering

83
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:56,100
the cut of suffering that's what we want to bring to an end and some of it maybe is not something

84
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:01,380
you can reasonably bring to an end and you have to learn how to live with

85
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:08,040
that and how do you live with it wisely how do you live with the suffering

86
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:14,100
that's you can't get rid of ever in human life how do you live with it so you don't add

87
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:19,680
suffering on top of it that is optional that is not necessary to have

88
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:26,820
so then so so this is this that's the investigation and each of you will have a different answer today and tomorrow in

89
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:35,580
a month in a year and your answer will change over time because the answer will change a lot by the the by number of

90
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:40,399
things by how well you understand yourself

91
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,839
and the state of your mind the mindset that you live under

92
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:52,580
and the quality of Consciousness the quality of the Mind provides a very different vantage point

93
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:58,019
for understanding our life understanding ourselves understanding what's important

94
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:04,620
so it's not just simply answering the question from the state of mind you happen to have today which maybe is a perfectly good State of

95
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:11,399
Mind to have when you're in that state of mind but to have uh but you know the way we

96
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:17,580
see the world changes when we're more concentrated for example when we're peaceful

97
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:23,100
when we see aspects of the ma of this world that are invisible to us to this

98
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:28,680
to this state so so I keep asking these questions and seeing in new and new ways

99
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:34,140
so in three areas in these areas I want to talk about are

100
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:38,940
um plain and simple discomfort

101
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:47,880
emotional pain and the complex of ideations

102
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:54,959
that Belong To Me Myself and mine the kind of the whole ideations around

103
00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:00,899
identity and self and all that so to to dip into these in a deep way

104
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:07,980
that those are the that's these are doors to really address and maybe go through so we start with discomfort

105
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:13,260
I'm sitting here right now and I'm uncomfortable in my right leg somehow

106
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:19,440
something shifted in my old age I used to sit comfortably like this for years and now there's a degree of discomfort

107
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:26,220
and pain that I didn't used to have and um and uh so I'm just kind of I

108
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:33,300
don't know writing it off is the right language I'm just kind of like okay you know maybe that things change and I was

109
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:40,320
very comfortable for many decades and that was nice and now I'm not so comfortable and maybe that'll last for a

110
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,360
couple of decades and then it's all shifting all the time and actually I've had all kinds of

111
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:52,200
discomforts in my meditation career that's about 50 years old now that um

112
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,660
that uh they've come and gone at different times and you know so it's

113
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:03,000
part and parcel of meditation for me is being with discomfort

114
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,519
I have I would say that I have no suffering or barely any suffering

115
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:13,920
by this pain that I feel going down my leg here right now it's just okay you

116
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,380
know it just okay I don't give it much attention I

117
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:25,380
give it enough attention to make sure that I'm not injuring myself or not wrong to have but it's just there in the

118
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:32,640
background and you know it's you know it's cloudy today and I can meditate with the Cloudy Sky I have no pain in my

119
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:39,660
pain in my leg and I can just meditate with it without any issue so so discomfort and physical pain of

120
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:46,260
all kinds comes with human life so to degree to which some of it is

121
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:52,680
unavoidable for human beings to look at it then

122
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:57,959
deeply and one of the things we start seeing is not the discomfort itself

123
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:03,060
but the relationship we have to it so I just described to you kind of

124
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:09,240
hopefully to be a little bit encouraging that I have pain in my leg and I'm completely at ease with that then fine

125
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:16,139
that's just not an issue and and that that that that relate kind of relationship is possible is very

126
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:21,839
different that I'm sitting up here and I can have all kinds of reactivity to this here

127
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:28,620
I could get angry I've been meditating 50 years and by now I should not be uncomfortable

128
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:34,860
which is to be completely and Bliss that should be floating I thought Buddhism was the kind of Flows In The Clouds and

129
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:41,160
you know just kind of just everything is kind of blissed out and and what am I doing you know this Buddhism is a

130
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:48,000
failure that finally realize this Buddhism doesn't help me at all you know because I'm not in that Bliss state that

131
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,440
I thought the promise was so that's one relationship and some of you are laughing at me

132
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:00,420
for having that ideas and um so that's you know that's a relationship I have to

133
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:06,120
the pain that uh I would and because you're laughing you realize it's maybe a

134
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:14,220
little bit ridiculous and silly to have that it could be that um I feel really discouraged

135
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:19,440
you know wow you know I should and then it also a big idea I shouldn't be feeling pain

136
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,920
could be you know uh you know I'm embarrassed you know this is like

137
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:31,860
I shouldn't admit it I'm a meditation teacher you know and you know they're going to

138
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:37,380
think bad of me now I should be able to you know sit here and just kind of again just be you know blissed out or

139
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:44,220
something so uh uh I can be angry at the pain

140
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:51,360
you know that leg of mind or you know and I'm gonna get back at it I had a friend who had knee pain in in

141
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:57,899
meditation and he said that he would um whenever he heard he'd heard it back

142
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:02,779
yeah push at it

143
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:12,000
so you know there's all kinds of odd relationships to pain right to discomfort

144
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,519
so we are embarrassed we feel it shouldn't be there we're angry at it we're trying to escape it some people

145
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,680
are incapable of being with certain kind of emotional discomfort and they'll run

146
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:28,680
away they'll go for alcohol for example or sometimes sex or sometimes

147
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:34,199
Netflix or whatever you know something you know just to get away from it food

148
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:40,019
you know and so they don't have to feel their discomfort and um and um

149
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:46,440
so it in when we do the mindfulness practice one of the things we're learning how to

150
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:52,079
do is to take a good look at the relationship we have with discomfort and

151
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:58,560
see that the relationships the attitudes that we have are different than the discomfort itself whether it's physical

152
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:05,160
or emotional discomfort it's without a judgment about the discomfort without the idea that you

153
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:10,440
have to end all discomfort once and for all through Buddhism but rather you're trying to understand

154
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:16,139
that relationship we have so the relationship itself becomes one of ease and peaceful

155
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:22,740
so we're not adding unnecessary distress pain stress on top of our life by the

156
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:28,380
reactivity we have with the discomfort so the slogan I like for this is learn

157
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:35,339
we're learning to be comfortable with discomfort that's a radical thing to do compared to

158
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:40,620
what most people in our society know what to do some people have the idea that when

159
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:46,860
they're uncomfortable they failed at something you know somehow to be a successful person you have to kind of

160
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:54,180
just never be in pain or never be uncomfortable with something and you have to fix your discomfort at all costs

161
00:16:54,180 --> 00:17:01,860
his life is a lot easier to go through if we're comfortable with discomfort if we're not a slave to discomfort

162
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:08,819
pushed around by it and having to react and do with it as we become Freer in that way around

163
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:16,020
discomfort then we're in the much better position to look at the discomfort

164
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:21,178
in a kind of objective clear way and decide is this healthy for me is this

165
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:26,280
appropriate for me so like the pain I feel in my legs or sitting here

166
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:32,940
I pay I give it some careful attention and decide okay this is okay

167
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:39,419
for now I don't think I'm injuring myself I don't know exactly what's going on and and probably I should do more

168
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:47,520
stretching you know or something or maybe I should find a different posture to sit in but some because I'm

169
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:53,700
studying it and looking at it I can begin kind of coming to terms with it and to understand well maybe I shouldn't

170
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:59,880
be this I'm comfortable enough with having it but maybe there's ways of fixing it that are appropriate

171
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:07,080
but now I'm going to fix it because of wisdom because it just seems like a sensible thing to do as opposed to fixing it

172
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:13,080
because I'm angry or want to escape it or I have aversion towards it or I'm

173
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,720
just really attached to comfort you know so it's I need to get to myself as comfortable as possible that's what's

174
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,480
cozy and I would love that then so what's the attitude and so as the

175
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:30,179
attitude becomes simpler and simpler and non-reactive then we're in a better position to

176
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:37,320
answer questions about the discomfort okay this discomfort I can live with this one I shouldn't live with this

177
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:43,020
involves it this requires a change now let's see a healthy way to do it I don't

178
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:48,960
think that's just because I have leg pain I should go now to the bar after this being here with you all and just

179
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:55,799
kind of you know you know crank away my pain you know that I don't

180
00:18:55,799 --> 00:19:01,620
recommend that but uh but you know so what's healthy

181
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:07,440
what's the health so so discomfort one of the things that's powerful for

182
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,020
this investigation and I think phenomenal is to begin appreciating the

183
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:18,179
difference between an event here discomfort but it could be any

184
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:24,179
event we have and our relationship to it and we're beginning now to question and

185
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:29,299
look at that relationship and clarify it some people it's called purify it

186
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:34,559
simplify it free it so that we're not caught

187
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:41,700
in the grip of that relationship and I caught in the grip of aversion and desire and all kinds of other things

188
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:48,720
that they're kind of driving us kind of they're they're controlling us rather than we controlling our inner life

189
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:55,980
make some sense so that's just that it's been fantastic so then we go to a deeper layer in this

190
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:01,500
study and we start looking at what can be called emotional pain

191
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:09,480
is all emotional pain suffering the Buddhist idea of dukkha or as emotional pain some of it is the

192
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:16,320
Suffering The Buddhists end and some emotional pain just comes with human life you have to answer that question for

193
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,900
yourself how do you answer that question one of the ways is to look at your

194
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:28,860
relationship to emotional pain that's a kind of discomfort too right and so the what you learn to do with

195
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:35,220
like physical discomfort or ordinary discomfort now is addressed in this emotional pain

196
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:41,580
and you start seeing well I hate it I really want to feel some other kind of

197
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:49,200
Happy Feeling in them chasing that I feel shame you know I somehow I'm in

198
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:57,000
Buddhist for a while now and I thought Buddhists were supposed to be always equanimous and peaceful and cooled and

199
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,000
chilled and and here I am kind of you know feeling a lot of agitation and and

200
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,700
I guess I'm an embarrassment to the Buddhist world and uh so so that's that's a

201
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:14,039
relationship an attitude that we have to what's happening and we start seeing all

202
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:20,940
these layers of unnecessary judgments unnecessary interpretations that are causing us distress or

203
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:26,640
undermining us or discouraging us or something and so at the same study we did with

204
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:34,500
discomfort it can be done in relationship to emotional pain and they're also the same lesson we can

205
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:40,620
learn to be comfortable with emotional pain we can just be peaceful with it and then

206
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:45,900
we can study it more deeply and lo and behold one of the things

207
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:51,179
you'll probably discover is that some of your emotional pain

208
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:57,559
comes from some deep react deeper reactivity some of the emotional pain you have

209
00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:02,880
becomes because you're really attached to something clinging to something

210
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,299
and so for example if I mean I can be so simple thing for me

211
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:14,700
of wanting to get someplace on time because I wanted to go show up at IMC

212
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:22,260
and teach people how to be non-attached and just be relaxed with what is and not get caught up and but

213
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:28,620
there's a lot of traffic to get here and I'm going to be late and I got to get there right away and

214
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:33,900
it's important to get there right away and people get to sleep they'll all go away and no one will be here and I'll be

215
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:39,679
giving a talk about myself I have to get there you know teach them to be relaxed

216
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:48,539
and uh and so uh so there's frustration there's anger

217
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:53,820
at the traffic but I'm clinging to something I'm clinging to all kinds of things what it

218
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:59,940
means to be here and the clinging I'm just kind of clinging to the fear you're all go home if I don't show up in time

219
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:05,159
and so I if I'm mindful enough of what's happening for me they're in the traffic

220
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:12,000
feeling all hot and sweaty in a hurry so wait a minute Gil you're really attached to layers and

221
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,159
layers of things here do you have to stay attached yes the

222
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:22,440
lawyers of the Mind come up and say yes [Laughter]

223
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:29,220
but if I kind of can you know offer the counter arguments then I said no I don't have to be it

224
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:35,820
doesn't do me any good the traffic's not going to change and um and it's not going to help me to

225
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:43,440
be stressed and hold on to this attachment to be there on time and so then I begin letting go and relaxing and

226
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:50,039
I feel so much better so the anger with the traffic the distress around the traffic you start

227
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:55,200
seeing yes I'm relaxed enough about it but it might look more deeply at it there's a lot of attachments connected

228
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,419
to it and so to look and we find there's a lot

229
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:06,360
of things we hold on to a tight or we resist furiously no I'm not going to do that

230
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:12,120
things we hate things we want and if we do an honest look at it

231
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:18,000
we'll discover that sometimes in it in these emotions that we have these painful emotions

232
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,659
that we're attached to something inkling to something if you don't see the clinging if you

233
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:31,080
don't see the attachment then there's no attachment to let go of

234
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:37,140
maybe there are some emotional pains that are not supposed to be to end

235
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:43,620
you know when someone dies and we feel grief are we supposed to like now feel like we're a Buddhist failure

236
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:48,840
you know I read the news and I feel pain I feel heartbroken at some of the things

237
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:54,480
I read am I not supposed to feel that I kind of think I don't have one to live

238
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:01,260
in a universe where I don't feel sad or feel grief or feel heartbroken

239
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:06,659
over some of the things that I see happens in the world it feels completely appropriate to feel

240
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:13,500
that but I don't think it's born from attachment for me I don't think it's some clinging

241
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:20,640
to something or resisting something it just kind of comes through me but it doesn't get stuck there

242
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:27,179
it just kind of I feel it fully and clearly and sometimes I've read news in the

243
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:32,700
paper and started crying that you know I I don't I have no idea I know I have no

244
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:40,440
thought that I'm not supposed to feel that and feel that pain but if I stop and take a deeper look

245
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,659
I might see yeah in the corners of that there's something I'm attached to and

246
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:51,299
clinging to but in the heart of it no it just seems very very simple and clear

247
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:56,940
there's no one nope nothing and so I just let it be there

248
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:03,779
and I don't add layers of suffering on top of it like I'm not supposed to be this way or as opposed to like get rid

249
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:08,840
of it quickly grief is supposed to be you know after all it's been 30 minutes now

250
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:14,658
and so I should be finished with my grief you know

251
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:20,880
so we have all these attitudes that we add on top and so we're learning more and more at

252
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,980
these attitudes and simplifying and simplifying and that we discovered well some things

253
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:31,440
I don't see any attachments in this emotional pain and I've learned how to be at ease with

254
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,779
that I've learned not to add anything on top of it this we're comfortable with discomfort

255
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:42,360
comfortable with feeling emotional pain this is a phenomenal gift we can give to

256
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:50,460
the world because it means that you can be a friend to someone who is in pain emotional pain you can share in that

257
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:56,400
pain even but your your own distress you're not distressed you're not upset

258
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:03,059
you're not attached you're not getting Afraid on top of the Heartbreak

259
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:09,059
you're able to be there in a full honest clear way to offer accompaniment and

260
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:16,140
companionship and and a safe kind of listening ear a safe kind of

261
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:21,299
companionship with someone which is a phenomenal gift to give

262
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:27,480
people who are in pain let's go for a walk together you know I'm you know and I'm willing to

263
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:34,080
feel uncomfortable it's okay I know how to do this and I'm just here with it then we'll just breathe and be with it

264
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:40,140
together and I'm not trying to fix anything I'm not trying to fix you I'm not trying to fix myself

265
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:46,440
some people who are compassionate caregivers supposedly they think they

266
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:52,679
are are really trying to avoid being uncomfortable themselves

267
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:58,679
they're so uncomfortable with the discomfort in the world that they're trying to get everyone fixed and good so

268
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:04,980
they don't have to feel they don't have discomfort and I think that leads to often kind of unhealthy Behavior

269
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:12,419
and so this ability to feel our emotional pain separate out what is an extra the layers

270
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:17,580
of reactivity the layers of attachment and clinging attitudes and beliefs and

271
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:27,259
so it's simple simple simple and then be able to go through the world and be with ourselves I think as a gift

272
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:37,940
so the third layer I want to talk about is the layer of Me Myself and mine

273
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:43,700
so as we're looking at suffering as we turn towards a door of suffering and start going through it

274
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:49,159
some of that suffering is happening to me thank you

275
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:55,020
it's my suffering and uh and the attachment itself the

276
00:28:55,020 --> 00:29:00,480
ideations around self of course it's a you know certain pain

277
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:06,659
like this pain in my knee I'm it's happening to me there's no question about it

278
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:15,120
but it's also I'm the ideation that this is my suffering I'm suffering I feel so

279
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:21,240
sorry for myself 50 years of meditation pains and you know enough is enough and

280
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:27,419
you know I feel so sorry for myself and I deserve a break I deserve going to Hawaii

281
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:34,440
having a vacation and I deserve something better and and now we're now we're entering this

282
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:39,899
this world of Me Myself and mine how I think about this and how I think the

283
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:47,580
impact is on me and what I need and stuff and some of it some of that's innocent I mean earlier on I said I'll

284
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:54,360
consider this pain and consider whether I need to change my posture that's use of the word I is kind of

285
00:29:54,360 --> 00:30:00,360
innocent and simple but oh poor Gill

286
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:06,840
and I hope I can really let you know how horrible and terrible it is that I'm suffering so much with my legs so that

287
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:13,740
you'll feel sorry for me and that'll be great will have a gill feeling sorry Fest

288
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:20,640
as if that's going to help anyone right so this eye thing gets can get really activated

289
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,980
so I want to suggest a little exercise and you're all sitting here I think and

290
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:32,039
you're all sitting either in chairs or zafu's on the cushions on the floor

291
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:37,559
and uh if you're not one person is leaning against a wall so the wall is there

292
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:42,600
and uh so um

293
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:51,840
say you have to go maybe to the bathroom so you get up happily go to the bathroom and come back five minutes later

294
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:58,158
and someone is sitting in your place

295
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:07,320
that was my chair that was my cushion that you took from

296
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:14,000
you know one of our cushions here you didn't bring with you so what are they doing sitting on my cushion

297
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:21,779
if you hadn't gone to the bathroom and just stayed here to the end and went home and came back next week you would

298
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:27,899
have no memory which Christian which chair was yours it wouldn't you wouldn't have that kind of idea as soon as you

299
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:33,059
leave it's not yours anymore the idea that it's your chair your

300
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:40,740
cushion your spot that does not exist in the natural world by itself out there

301
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:47,580
that belongs to what I call the ecosphere

302
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:56,960
or the eye sphere the me swear the that that is it kind of invisible

303
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:03,059
like that chair that's empty now sitting next to Lydia right so someone sat there

304
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:10,140
once upon a time I don't have any clue who sat there

305
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:16,140
any clue who saw it that's my chair they didn't engrave their name and

306
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:22,860
decide you know so we know it's their chair it belongs to the world of mentality and

307
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:29,940
thoughts and ideas what what are what are the what is that world what is the ego sphere of thoughts

308
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:35,340
and ideas and ideations that creates this Me Myself and mine

309
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:41,580
you know it doesn't it doesn't have a weight does it have color does it have shape

310
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:48,120
is it the shape of the chair it's um you know it's a it's an unusual world

311
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:56,039
that's kind of invisible to everyone else if all of us went home today

312
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:01,320
with different because we took all our shoes off right for everyone who took their shoes off went home with different

313
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:09,740
shoes than they came with your shoes won't care

314
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:17,700
this uh the shoes you know unless you wrote your name on

315
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:23,279
it but even then you know the shoes don't have any idea that they belong to you

316
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:30,179
or you belong to them who belongs to who right and so these

317
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:35,700
shoes don't have that idea that idea but boy if you leave here now and your

318
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:41,100
shoes not on the rack when you leave someone took my shoes

319
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:47,039
yeah or you could say yeah oh the shoes I came with they're not here now

320
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:53,399
oh well I got to figure out what to do now oh some other other ones there it happened to me once many years ago I had

321
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:59,880
Birkenstocks my birth stocks were not the burger stars I came with were not there

322
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:06,000
oh but there's another pair and it's the same size

323
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,019
and it's newer

324
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:17,940
and so the next week I became back to IMC and and discovered there was a actually a three-way exchange for

325
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:23,700
Birkenstocks that happened and um

326
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:30,020
so um so again this things that things belong to us

327
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:37,560
is somewhat arbitrary it's somewhat an ideation an idea that's imposed on

328
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:43,020
things but that imposition of ownership

329
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:49,020
does not belong in the natural world out there it belongs to this ego sphere this

330
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:55,138
thought sphere ideation sphere that we kind of are swimming in

331
00:34:55,139 --> 00:35:02,700
and we're swimming in it as a society and we support it we we you know and there's even laws

332
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:10,079
that support the ownership of property and ownership of things and so it has a kind of very strong

333
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:17,060
pressure and and kind of a orientation that's intense

334
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:25,380
designate does that make it true the fact that it's legally true

335
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:31,980
I mean these lands that we live on they said you know we're now we're appreciating more and more that many of us here in the United States are living

336
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:40,260
on land they were stolen from people and the fact that it was stolen from them uh in horrible ways sometimes

337
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:45,799
genocide and and uh

338
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:51,480
the fact that I bought the property that I'm living on does that mean that really it's mine

339
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:57,180
given that it's stolen property to begin with to descendants of the indigenous people

340
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:04,859
still have a claim could they have a claim what happens if an indigenous family came to the property that I own

341
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:10,020
say you know my proper my family lived here for Generations

342
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:16,200
and so we have a relationship to this land would I say well this is my property I'm

343
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:23,460
going to pop it I'm going to put up a bigger fence now to keep you out is that the right thing to do if for

344
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:30,000
someone like that what's their relationship to the land we bought this house actually a little

345
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,839
sad story up here many years ago and in the basement they they left this huge

346
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:42,780
ancient desk which was kind of like you know wooden desk it was big wide with big drawers

347
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:49,140
and it was kind of a classic from the 1920s or something and um I kind of liked it but the top of

348
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:54,960
it was completely warped so I put a new top on it took a long time to figure out how to do

349
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,000
it and then some years ago someone came to our house and said you

350
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,359
know my grandparents lived here before you you know some you know in the 50s and 60s and 70s and we used to come

351
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:12,720
visit all the time and we just wanted to see it it's a great come and look and looked

352
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:20,520
around and showed them basements oh that's the desk it's really big so no one ever the

353
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:26,579
different owners over the years never took it out because it's kind of hard to get out I said would you like it

354
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:33,780
say oh yes you know belong to their family at one point had emotional connections so so

355
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:39,060
the ownership and what belongs to who and did it belong to me it was just left

356
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:44,820
there I guess legally it would be but does it really so ownership

357
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:51,660
and then we have identity and identity is a Hot Topic it's so hot topic these days I feel like I shouldn't even use

358
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:57,720
the word as soon as I say the word identity I'm gonna upset someone

359
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:03,000
um but it's a difficult topic right and uh but it's a very important one to

360
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:09,240
address and to look at in our society these days but the issue of identity is also complicated

361
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:15,200
and and you know for example my identity as a teacher

362
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:22,680
is that complicated or should I be complicated or easy for me if I go home with the identity of a

363
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:27,019
teacher it's a problem

364
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:34,680
it seems to work okay here [Laughter]

365
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:41,820
and until the identity of being a teacher becomes my my value as a human being is

366
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:48,180
dependent on that identity and what everybody else thinks about me in that identity and now we're getting into

367
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:55,140
dangerous territory and now I'm gonna have to give a talk that's brilliant

368
00:38:55,140 --> 00:39:02,040
you know how the pressure is on and all kinds of things right so so we're talking about an invisible

369
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:07,320
world that belongs to this world of the

370
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:14,520
thought sphere that you most people can't see exactly from for yourself

371
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:20,880
what we identify some of the things we identify with some of the things we take as mine some of the ways we Define

372
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:26,599
ourselves ideas of ownership

373
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:32,400
and I I do this sometimes I find it meaningful I don't know if it will be meaningful for you

374
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,740
but just look around the room the ceiling the walls the lights and just

375
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:43,079
look around and where do you find me in it

376
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:50,280
where's I and all that where's mine and all that

377
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:55,500
probably it's not there has any of you had this I thought that

378
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:02,660
this the chandeliers are mine or I'm the chandeliers

379
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:11,480
just it's just lights it's just walls it's just you know free of that sense of self

380
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:18,300
and to turn that kind of attention inward to what degree can you turn it Inward

381
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:24,660
and have the same kind of experience where you're looking at parts of yourself inside experiences and you see

382
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:32,040
no that's not me that's just phenomenon that's those things happening

383
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:37,260
you know a exercise I've done many times is maybe it doesn't work so much now

384
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:44,940
anymore so long ago this song but maybe you know I'm going to have a thought

385
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:51,060
arise in your in your mind that you didn't put there you didn't

386
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:57,780
want to have you're going to try to resist me don't have this thought and as this thought arises is this

387
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:03,420
thought you is this Define who you are or is that me

388
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:08,640
making this thought or is it what is it that's it's your brain but is this make

389
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:14,760
sense to call this Me Myself and mine it just conditions come together

390
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:19,460
the hills are alive with the sound of

391
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:27,780
at least some of you a certain age probably couldn't help for your mind to

392
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:34,380
to finish that sentence and um and so to have that thought is

393
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:40,800
that you you know does it quite make sense to claim that that's you it's just you know

394
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,880
it's just a response the brain has to me saying something

395
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:53,579
so you have the wind brushes against your cheek

396
00:41:53,579 --> 00:42:00,000
is that experience of sensation to his cheek is the sensations itself Me Myself

397
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,240
and mine it's happening to you do you want to clean up claim ownership of it do you

398
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:13,140
want to Define Yourself by that sensation do you cause the sensation did you orchestrate it and design it

399
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:18,599
it just it kind of no that's not me and what we learn in Buddhist Meditation

400
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:24,000
is to begin questioning and looking deeper and deeper around these ideation

401
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,300
this this eye sphere the ideation sphere that we swim in and begin seeing how

402
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:35,880
much of it we don't have to do and we can quiet that the thinking mind

403
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:41,099
that creates Me Myself and mine is a little bit of a wind drag or very

404
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:46,740
much a wind drag for the mind and as we slow down and quiet We Begin

405
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:52,859
letting go of the wind drag and and it can be Blissful and beautiful

406
00:42:52,859 --> 00:43:00,119
peaceful to because so much of this Me Myself and mine comes with attachment

407
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:05,640
comes with resistance comes with tightening up comes it's also the me

408
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:11,400
myself and my thoughts that we have are one of some of the primary kind of

409
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:19,140
inner idiations we have that's a source of our reactivity when we react automatically habitually

410
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:24,839
for or against things it has a lot to do with this identification with self

411
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:31,740
that exists within us and we start seeing how much is not part of the natural world but part of our ideations

412
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:38,060
and thoughts and ideas and we see that really clearly in meditation because

413
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:43,680
it requires processing activity in the brain

414
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:50,280
to have these thoughts and as the mind gets calmer and calmer and calmer we start we do less and less

415
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:57,619
this thinking this way and we get calm enough we see that if I start thinking

416
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:05,700
that those Birkenstocks out in the Shelf are my Birkenstocks just that thought itself

417
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:10,800
he's like that's agitate my nails gotten agitated it's true enough

418
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:17,160
with my thoughts my why would I want to agitate my mind when I'm so peaceful let's not have any more Birkenstock

419
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:22,440
thoughts in meditation you know I can do that later

420
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:28,079
and so but with that example is in so many different ways we start seeing

421
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:34,020
clearly I don't have to think this way maybe it's okay a way to think for later

422
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:41,400
and then it becomes a really kind of a revolutionary thing to experience ourselves

423
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:47,819
without this eye sphere this ideation sphere operating

424
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:54,359
so the topic of today is how to study your suffering the vantage point of studying or

425
00:44:54,359 --> 00:45:01,140
suffering without the ideation of self is a radical revolutionary change

426
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:07,319
because there's a whole layers of reactivity of emotional pain

427
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:12,599
that belonged to that ideation Around Me Myself and mine

428
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:19,319
and if you can really see that that changes the whole understanding of what

429
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:26,000
emotional pain this is the ordinary part of human life and what is unnecessary

430
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:32,520
and a lot of people will want to justify their emotional pain because it's just

431
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:38,700
natural this is part of life but it's not really that natural because you see it's part of the

432
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:44,880
reactivity around this created construct of Me Myself and mine

433
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:50,640
that's been constructed with the help of our society our family our life experiences how we've been treated by

434
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:55,940
people by our our desires and wants and

435
00:45:55,940 --> 00:46:04,079
advertisements all kinds of things that build together and it feels so natural to be yourself

436
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:10,440
that it's very hard to see how much your I your whole sense of self is a construct

437
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:16,980
that's been built up over a lifetime and there's very few things that can help you kind of break through that

438
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:22,980
meditation is one of them and I think meditation is another one is

439
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:29,480
psychedelics you know which we're not supposed to encourage here

440
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:35,760
and I think meditation is more powerful in the long term

441
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:41,819
so I said I made that the p word the

442
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:48,780
I lived for in the biggest psychedelic hippie commune in the country back in

443
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:55,740
the early 70s but they they decided because of legal issues to stop using psychedelics and so

444
00:46:55,740 --> 00:47:01,859
they wanted to find the next best thing and the next best thing was honesty

445
00:47:01,859 --> 00:47:07,859
and that's why I stayed with them I'd never been around people who were so honest I was so inspired by it

446
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:13,500
so anyway so honesty meditation other things to really see clearly what's

447
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:19,920
going on here so suffering in the end of suffering

448
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:26,940
it's for you to discover what suffering you can end but suffering is always a door to go

449
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:33,180
through and to have confidence and skill and to build up the capacity

450
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:38,940
to be willing to stop and look at sufferings stop and take it go through

451
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:45,180
that door it's really worthwhile to go through that door because one way or the other you can get

452
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:50,520
to the other side and what that other side should look like no one can tell you

453
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:57,240
it's not supposed to be floating in the clouds it's going to be your own your own way

454
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:02,760
and so really no one can answer these questions

455
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:11,579
except yourself through your that's why mindfulness and deeper looking is really so important

456
00:48:11,579 --> 00:48:18,660
and I hope you do answer those questions for yourself and now you probably answer the questions differently

457
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:23,700
over time and if you really kind of get a handle

458
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:29,579
in this whole eye sphere ideation sphere that we live under you probably answer the questions

459
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:35,420
differently than you do before you really address this part of your life

460
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:42,000
so I hope that you are inspired to do this work I hope you

461
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:49,260
come to a time where you enjoy doing it you're delighted it it inspires you it's like such a wonderful thing to

462
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:55,859
have the Good Fortune to have a practice and a means to really step into this I

463
00:48:55,859 --> 00:49:01,920
think of his way of stepping into being fully human if we're running away from our disc pain

464
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:06,980
and discomfort or suffering we're actually

465
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:12,980
shutting off or shutting down part of our full Humanity step in through that door of suffering

466
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:17,180
and you'll be much happier

467
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:22,640
thank you
