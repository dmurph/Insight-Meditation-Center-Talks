starting out just by feeling into whatever Sensations emotions are present

19
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,660
[Music] maybe allowing any excess energy or tension

20
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:24,140
to be softened released on the Opera

21
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:42,319
feeling into the goodness of the the breath itself the body itself

22
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,040
and the feeling of being connected

23
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:58,459
to others and to your own breath your own body your own inner life

24

and tuning into your body breathing

33
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:24,600
I'll offer instructions on breathing this morning but feel free to use other objects of

34
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:31,139
attention if they work better for you overall sensations of the body sound

35
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:36,020
meta many of those are fine

36
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:46,580
tuning into the motion with the ribs and the belly Sensations

37
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:55,639
of the life's graph connecting us to the outside world

38
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:12,380

39
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:21,979
that's the ribs expand the lungs expand

40
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,979

00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:36,380
fullness perhaps slightly Pleasant or neutral

42
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:45,419
then on the out breath producing all of the details

43
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:51,199
the little micro Sensations within each Opera

44
00:05:53,039 --> 00:06:01,280
turning into every every detail of when the out breath ends

45
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:09,198
perhaps there's a tiny ponds to Still Point the end of the Opera

46
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:20,300
allowing the breathing to be natural

47

54
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:50,599

55
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:57,360

all of the little details especially the details of the breath

76
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:42,740
perhaps a sense of relief from relief at the end of the Opera

77
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,540
the goodness of nourishment from the inbra

78

contentment enjoyment

83
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:21,199
is the fears to grow through the body

84
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:33,140
inviting compassion kindness kindness of being with everything else

85
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:39,860
while inviting it to fade to the background

86
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,539
foreign

87
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,780

foreign

89
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,140
there were seen the effects of each breath in the body

90
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:55,740
the expansion of the whole torso perhaps are Rippling through

91
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:03,900
energetic resonance through the rest of the body transpiring

92
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:14,419
massaging breath through all of the body

93
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:25,279
massaging allowing good feelings

94
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:32,840
to Ripple through [Music] and say well

95
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:49,880
interesting resting and contentment in the moment

96
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:33,559
in the final moment of this meditation

97
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:39,620
the invitation is to gather up

98
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:48,240
and he got intentions little glimmers of contentment or ease

99
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:55,080
calm or joy and Savor them in this body in this

100
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,380
heart

101
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:09,720
if it was difficult savoring the compassion

102
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,220
the willingness to be with

103
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:23,840
and then turning your internal gaze outwards towards your life

104
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:31,620
all of the others you may come in contact with directly or

105
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:39,730
indirectly [Music]

106
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:52,100
and offering new sense of goodness kindness

107
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:58,398
compassion care for them

108
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:08,059
making the determination that this practice be a benefit

109
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:14,899

thank you for your practice

116
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,799
foreign

117
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,419
good morning Sangha welcome to those of you who tiptoed into the YouTube stream

118
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:53,299
a little bit late and everyone else

119
00:33:53,820 --> 00:34:00,419
so today is day three of the five day series on factors of mine

120
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:05,519
that support stability wisdom

121
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:10,618
deepening in meditation practice and in daily life

122
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:18,839
we started with fundamentals on Monday of mindfulness and practice intelligence

123
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:24,540
and yesterday I introduced the first two of biogenic factors factors for

124
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:30,780
stability and samadi concentration and those two were connecting with the

125
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:38,960
meditation object and sustaining that connection also known as vitaka and vichara

126
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:46,679
so when connecting and sustaining vitaka and vichara begin to build

127
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:53,158
the rhythm of continuity than often good feelings will naturally

128
00:34:53,159 --> 00:35:01,740
result from them the poly terms for these pleasurable experiences are PT the ITI and sukha

129
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:06,839
s-u-k-h-a and they are roughly translate as

130
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:12,720
meditative happiness and contentment for sukha and meditative

131
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:17,820
joy for PT AR

132
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:24,720
the third and fourth of the five Janik factors excuse me

133
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,720
sometimes in contemporary culture people have been raised to feel like it's not okay

134
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:36,599
to feel to really enjoy joy and happiness

135
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:42,500
so if this happens to be you please consider this talk

136
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:48,599
enthusiastic permission to savor these forms of meditative

137
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:53,900
goodness Savor them enjoy them

138
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:00,720
it's important to savor and enjoy them when they arise because that encourages

139
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:08,579
them to arise more often the Buddha talked about these forms of goodness being healthy onward leading

140
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:17,220
and to be cultivated not to be feared it's also helpful to note that cultivate

141
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:22,859
your means cultivating the underlying conditions

142
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:28,500
for joy and happiness to arise we can kind of have a little control

143
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:35,400
over reconnecting with our experience the meditation object and we can kind of

144
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:42,480
have a little bit of control over sustaining that connection over time these feelings emerge naturally from

145
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:49,500
that they don't come on demand and you can't just make them appear necessarily

146
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:54,079
so Savor but not demand

147
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:01,560
so the polybird PT has a broad word cloud of translations or meanings I'll

148
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:06,720
read some of them here please tap into your body

149
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:12,000
and feel how they feel as you hear them

150
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,320
Joy satisfaction of mind

151
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,640
positive interest

152
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:29,760
rat interest Delight zest

153
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:36,240
deal exuberance

154
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:42,260
Mirth merryman

155
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:48,839
exultation thrilled

156
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:54,839
and rapture so you'll notice there's a broad range

157
00:37:54,839 --> 00:38:00,240
and one is not necessarily better or deeper than another

158
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:05,579
itchy has this large cloud of meanings because of this wide range of ways that

159
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:11,280
can be experienced it's energetic embodied and it can

160
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,440
manifest as anything from a sense of positive interest to a little pulse of

161
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:21,780
momentary Delight uplifting Joy all the way through to

162
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:27,980
wrapped interest in the kind of bubbly Joy or tingles rain like feeling

163
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:34,440
many practitioners find that as their practice deepens these

164
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:41,040
feelings actually become more subtle not stronger but they can be quite strong

165
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:48,660
and some people never experience them at all other than the mild interest or the pulse of joy every now

166
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:56,480
it's all good stronger is not necessarily better

167
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:03,119
at its simplest level this meditative Joy is the joy of being

168
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:10,500
present closely in contact with the moment in a way that helps an energetic

169
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:18,260
resonance to our eyes and that's available to all of us

170
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:25,140
like Suka Piti is an embodied mental quality so to explain both of them a

171
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:32,820
little I'm going to draw on one of yesterday's similes so if connecting is placing your hand on

172
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:39,720
a friendly furry cat and sustaining is stroking the fur

173
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:46,440
stroking the cat then PT is the purring that results

174
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:51,720
results from this natural pleasure of connection and sustaining

175
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:59,280
it can also arise from another kind of Joy called pamoja in the poly p-a-m-o-j-j-a

176
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:07,200
and that kind of Joy it's a condition for PT but it also arises itself

177
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:14,520
when the heart and mind have let go of hindering mental qualities unskeletal qualities

178
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:19,680
and PT and pamoja can also emerge with the joy of generosity

179
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:25,039
the joy of Letting Go in a wholesome or skillful way

180
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:32,579
so there are more than one pathway in to meditative joy and there's more

181
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:38,880
than one progression that can go on and this series this week is one of those progressions

182
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:45,000
Gill has talked about another one which is um a gladness pentat I think he calls

183
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:52,140
it so you'll notice that this is an important um quality in Buddhism because of that

184
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:58,579
wrapped interest that Zeal enthusiasm it appears in several lists

185
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:04,740
so that Joy of generosity that can give rise to PT reminds me of a story this is

186
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:11,060
a from a scientific study wonderful researcher who I'm completely blanking on the name of right now

187
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:16,680
invited research participants the giveaway cupcakes to total strangers

188
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:25,160
they were provided the cupcakes as part of the study and what they found was that the giver

189
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:31,680
received this pulse of Joy from the giving especially when the giving was done with

190
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:38,880
kindness warmth not only that that

191
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:45,300
Giver underestimated underestimated how good it would feel to

192
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:52,640
give right so

193
00:41:52,800 --> 00:42:00,359
there's this giving over to the practice either generosity with others or

194
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:07,579
giving over to the practice and kind of letting go that opens the door to joy and happiness

195
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:13,740
Suka a happiness or contentment piece is subtler and it also has a word problem

196
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:18,560
meanings you can feel into need

197
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:25,320
agreeable pleasure

198
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:31,740
ease well-being

199
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,780
the feeling of being blessed

200
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:51,720
contentment being pleased

201
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:56,000
and blessed

202
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:04,319
so CA is present along with PT the more

203
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:10,260
energetic resonance purring of joy and

204
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:15,900
it's softer it's subtler so it's kind of invisible sometimes when

205
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:22,560
PT is present because it's overshadowed by the more Broad and energy

206
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:29,640
of pity pity Suka is more like a calm happiness a

207
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:37,020
pervasive pleasure it can be a little like that happy contented glow after a good laugh

208
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:43,260
a really good laugh and like PT Suka can emerge in other

209
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:50,300
ways one of the most powerful is from what the Buddha calls the Bliss of blamelessness ethical conduct

210
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:56,359
recognizing that we haven't done anything to harm others

211
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:03,660
so to finish the cupcake story it turns out that people receiving the cupcakes

212
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:10,859
they valued the warmth and friendliness of the person giving them more than they valued the cupcake itself

213
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:19,560
and not only that the sense of happiness that calm our happiness pervaded the day

214
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:25,980
of these people from long after the receiving happened

215
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:32,940
and made them more likely to give to others through that day pay it forward so to speak

216
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:38,400
that lingering happiness that's the sukkah

217
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:43,760
the pulse of joy and the giving that's more like

218
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:51,859
an ancient commentary of the Buddhist teachings called the atasalina

219
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:58,560
pose a story of a person finding an oasis or Forest after crossing a desert

220
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:05,099
and then pot you know frustrated exhausted that pulse

221
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:10,380
of Joy at stepping into the shade and finding a beautiful Cool Spring to take

222
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:17,760
a bath in that the atasalini describes spt an

223
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:23,579
analogy for PT then sukha is the ease and contentment

224
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:30,500
of resting after emerging from that Cool Spring on a hot day

225
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:38,520
so perhaps one of the greatest teachings takeaways from tasting or learning about this kind

226
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:43,980
of meditative joy happiness is that we have the capacity to

227
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:50,900
experience joy and happiness with very very little from the outside world

228
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:58,380
almost nothing that's required not buying anything not Beauty possessions or fame

229
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:03,839
but rather attending with kindness and devotion

230
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:11,400
to every unfolding experience Within that's a gift

231
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:19,140
and that's how these experiences are most fruitfully regarded as as gifts

232
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:25,079
emergent quality pursuing them grasping them

233
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:30,079
scares them away because they can be really shy

234
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:37,020
so the Buddha said that these are Pleasures to be cultivated

235
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:42,060
and it's important not to attach too much

236
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:49,220
the grasp too much this is where the mindfulness and the practice intelligence come in

237
00:46:50,819 --> 00:46:58,500
well it's not the same thing another way of cultivating these can be to open ourselves to simple Joys

238
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:05,160
Pleasures contentment out in the world it's a good way of teaching our systems

239
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:11,220
how to recognize the meditative Joy is within

240
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:19,640
so your homework your assignment if you would like to accept it is to notice today over the next 24 hours

241
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:26,240
moments of pleasure Joy contentment happiness

242
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:30,318
and really feel them Savor them

243
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:40,020
as they come to full fruition and meditation they support unification and that is our

244
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:45,619
topic for tomorrow thank you for your kind attention
