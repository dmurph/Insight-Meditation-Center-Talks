1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:08,519
it's a pleasure to be here with you my name is May Elliott and I will be leading these 7 A.M sittings each day

2
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:15,480
so um over the next five days I'll be going over the foundational vapassana

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:24,000
meditation instructions as they're typically taught in the West so uh we'll start with breath today talk

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,779
about mindfulness of breathing then we'll talk about tomorrow the body Wednesday

5
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:35,280
emotions Thursday we'll talk about thinking and then Friday open awareness

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:42,440
practice so I'll say more about this series once we finish the meditation once we're in the darmet

7
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:49,020
and give you some context for this um as I mentioned the focus of today's

8
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,780
meditation will be the brat and that's going to be our primary anchor for the

9
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:01,320
meditation so um for some people the breath doesn't work very well as their primary anchor

10
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:08,760
and if you're one of those people that's totally fine Some people prefer a sense of the bodily posture like a

11
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:16,140
global sense of the body some people take the sense of Sound hearing for

12
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,479
their anchor that's all fine and just for the sake of simplifying the

13
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:28,140
instructions I'll be offering directions specifically on the breath as a primary anchor so

14
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:36,600
that's what I'll be I'll be talking most about and do what works for you so let's start our meditation with a

15
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:45,798
stable upright posture I can gently close the eyes

16
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:52,799
have your hands on your lap or your knees it's fine to be sitting standing or

17
00:01:52,799 --> 00:02:00,078
lying down whatever posture works best for your meditation

18
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,700
so as we start let's take three deep breaths together

19
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:15,860
inhaling and exhaling

20
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:24,020
inhaling and exhaling

21
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,319
and again

22
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:36,000
now allowing the breath to take up a normal rhythm in this practice we're not

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,480
tampering with the breath or trying to change it in any way just being with it as it is

24
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,400
and allow it to happen naturally

25
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:58,019
and as we settle into the body it can help to have some uprightness in

26
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:04,760
the posture if you're sitting to have a straight spine

27
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,920
we can think of lengthening the spine as though we're putting just a little bit

28
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,560
of extra space between each vertebrae

29
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,840
making the neck a little bit longer

30
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:28,860
and then from that upright stable posture it's allowing everything else to

31
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:34,200
relax allowing

32
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:41,220
the skin flesh the muscles to drape on the scaffolding

33
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,239
of the bones

34
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,900
softening the forehead and the temples

35
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,959
relaxing the jaw

36
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,000
softening the shoulders

37
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:17,480
releasing the belly

38
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,620
loosening the hips

39
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:37,160
and allowing any extra tension to flow out through the legs and the feet

40
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:49,400
arriving here

41
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:09,840
as we start this sitting together I invite you to connect with the breath

42
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,820
where you feel it most predominantly

43
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:23,659
for some people the sensation is clearest at the nostrils

44
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,259
for some it's in the rise and fall of the chest

45
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:45,380
and for others it's in the expansion of the belly it's in the belly

46
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:54,259
so go ahead and take a moment and connect with where you feel the breath most predominantly

47
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:59,699
foreign

48
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,820
the mind to settle on that sensation

49
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:30,380
allowing that area where you feel the breath most predominantly to be your primary anchor

50
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:39,979
so you are collecting the mind around that sensation into that sensation

51
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,880
and when you find that the mind has wandered

52
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:07,560
just gently and kindly slide right back to the breath right back to this

53
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,819
predominant sensation

54
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:22,259
it's no problem if the Mind thinks you just don't follow its content we don't

55
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:27,419
actually engage in the narrative it's telling us we just

56
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:37,139
come right back to the breath no need to judge ourselves for thinking

57
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:43,199
or reject the thinking or just releasing it with a really light

58
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,560
touch

59
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:11,720
fonts fall to the background and the breath is in the foreground

60
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:24,419
as soon as you notice that you've been thinking

61
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:30,979
you're actually back in the present so there's no need for reprimand

62
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,000
already back here

63
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:58,220
breathing in and breathing out

64
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:31,339
releasing any preoccupations to come into the breath

65
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:39,480
entering the breath and not just the idea of the breath but

66
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:46,860
the felt experience of the breath feeling it through the language of

67
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,579
sensation

68
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:14,040
and I'll offer some ways to be curious about the breath to get to know it

69
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:20,459
okay kind of like we are welcoming an old friend that we haven't seen for a long

70
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:27,240
time sitting down with great curiosity to get to know them to get to know who they are

71
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:33,360
now so can we

72
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,320
get to know the breath with that Curiosity and friendliness

73
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:53,040
can we sense whether the breath is textured what's

74
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:59,240
the texture of the breath is it smooth

75
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,339
or silky

76
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,680
is it staccato or rough

77
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:25,820
sensing the texture of the breath

78
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,160
foreign

79
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,779
what's the shape of the breath

80
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:03,420
does it Billow widely with a big inhale

81
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,940
or is it thin and narrow

82
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,700
feeling into the shape of the breath

83
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:44,899
maybe the breath starts thin and narrow and then it widens as the chest expands

84
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,779
what's the temperature of the breath

85
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:35,540
is it warm or cool

86
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:57,740
and does the temperature change when shifting from an inhale to an exhale

87
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:10,220
maybe the inhale is cool and the exhale is warm

88
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:43,860
and how do you know how do you know it's warm or cool

89
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:48,440
what's the sensation telling you that

90
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:16,160
maybe getting to know temperature with a little more interest

91
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,920
foreign

92
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,880
attention now to the length of the breath

93
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,680
our breath short or long

94
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:27,800
and is the inhale longer than the exhale or the other way around

95
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,820
foreign

96
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:11,058
foreign

97
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:40,320
are you feeling the breath most predominantly in the right lung or the

98
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,220
left lung

99
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,460
or do you both fill evenly

100
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,460
foreign

101
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:35,120
as we explore the breath remember that we're not tampering with it in any way

102
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:48,919
not trying to make it deeper or longer or a smoother or warmer or cooler

103
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:54,020
just noticing what's happening

104
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:01,580
no need to make the present moment any different than it is

105
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:40,320
many of us tend to notice the breath in the front of our body maybe in the rise

106
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:47,760
and fall of the chest or the belly or through the sensations on our face by

107
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,240
our nose

108
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:59,960
we can also tune into the way the breath affects our back body

109
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:08,120
Can You Feel the rise and fall of the breath in the back

110
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,100
foreign

111
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:50,600
be sensed in the rise and fall of the shoulders

112
00:20:54,419 --> 00:21:01,340
maybe there's a subtle lift and release as you breathe

113
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:45,380
can you notice the moment an in-breath starts

114
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:54,780
staying connected to the breath from the moment it starts through the length of

115
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,380
the inhale

116
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:08,220
and can you notice the top of the inhale when the breath is finished

117
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:15,179
bringing air in noticing that moment and the turn the

118
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:18,500
pivot to the exhale

119
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:27,860
feeling the complete release of the exhale

120
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:34,820
noticing the moment the exact moment the exhale stops

121
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:46,039
and then again the moment the inhale starts

122
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:05,480
this can be a great way to stay with the breath

123
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:14,039
ensuring we notice the point the breath starts the inhale starts

124
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:19,679
and the point that the inhale turns to an exhale

125
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:27,080
the complete exhale the end of the exhale

126
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:32,940
ensuring we notice these transition moments shifting from inhale to Exhale

127
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,299
again

128
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:44,059
often the mind wanders in the paws between breaths

129
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:05,400
so can we catch those moments those transition moments then bring our

130
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:12,020
curiosity to the breath in between

131
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:21,539
and on your own now allow yourself to see what your mind is interested in with the breath

132
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:28,700
maybe noticing the texture maybe the shape or the temperature

133
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,240
maybe the length

134
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,440
continuing with the breath in whatever way works for you

135
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,980
foreign

136
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:20,580
to make a mental note very light mental label

137
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:25,740
when breathing in you might note in

138
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:31,500
when breathing out or you might try

139
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:39,440
Rising falling as your notes

140
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:51,000
and the note can help us keep connected help us stay connected to the present

141
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:59,120
gives the Mind something to do naming the experience as it happens

142
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,620
if you do note the breath make sure that the note is light

143
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:14,880
the majority of the attention is in the body's sensing and the the note is very

144
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,960
light and faint

145
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:31,020
foreign

146
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,299
oh

147
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,279
foreign

148
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,840
foreign

149
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,500
foreign

150
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,820
as we come to the end of our sitting together

151
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:16,700
taking a moment to feel the goodness of this practice

152
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:28,158
some gratitude for having this time

153
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:34,158
to take care of the heart and the mind

154
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:41,299
may all beings be happy

155
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:49,220
healthy safe and free from suffering

156
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,700
foreign

157
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:33,120
I hope you enjoyed your meditation my name is May Elliott and uh I will be

158
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:39,360
leading the 7ams this week so welcome if you're just arriving

159
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,520
at the beginning I shared that over the next five days I'll be going over the foundational

160
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:50,159
vipassana meditation instructions as they are typically taught in the West

161
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:57,779
so there if you haven't noticed there are so many different styles of practice in vipassana there's the Brahma vihara

162
00:30:57,779 --> 00:31:04,860
heart practices and the five elements meditation and 32 parts of the body

163
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:12,059
um maranasati uh yeah contemplation there's so many different

164
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:18,240
ones and so my hope is just to simplify and lay out the basics of a passionate practice

165
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,640
um so if you attended a silent retreat at a Western papasana Center like

166
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:30,120
site Retreat Center or Spirit Rock these are the meditation instructions that you would typically receive over

167
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:36,600
the course of the retreat and the instructions I'll offer are the ones most typically suggested for those who

168
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:42,960
are building an at-home practice so um and for me personally I'm always

169
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:48,000
returning to this instruction for myself for my own practice so I hope that

170
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,640
similarly whether you're a new practitioner or a very experienced practitioner that these are beneficial

171
00:31:53,640 --> 00:32:00,240
for you so we'll be going over today Brett day two the body mindfulness of

172
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,640
body day three emotions day four mindfulness of thinking and then the

173
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:11,340
last day bringing that all together bringing all four days of teaching together into open awareness practice

174
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:17,760
sometimes called choiceless attention so these these instructions are most

175
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:23,880
influenced by the Burmese teacher mahasi sayadam and he's really the biggest

176
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:30,720
influence for our Insight scene in the West um however though mahasi did emphasize

177
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:37,919
the breath often feeling it in the abdomen um I don't know that he emphasized it quite as much as we do in Western

178
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:43,799
teachings and this this emphasis on the breath uh came largely from the Burmese

179
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:50,159
teacher upandita so he he had a strong influence in our scene as well

180
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:57,480
and of course at the heart of this teaching is mindfulness that's what holds together each each day of teaching

181
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:03,059
um so where we pay attention to the present moment experience learning to be

182
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:09,059
intimate with our life so we're engaging in the direct experience of the moment rather than

183
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:16,919
being lost in our narratives our stories our judgments fears Etc

184
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:25,039
and in doing so we can start to have insight into the changing and the selfless nature of experience

185
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:32,519
and mindfulness it has a uh the successful function of mindfulness

186
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:38,340
depends on a particular characteristic awareness doesn't judge it doesn't

187
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:44,460
reject and it doesn't cling to anything so by practicing mind mindfulness by

188
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:49,860
simply being aware of our experience that can allow us to disentangle from

189
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:55,679
our preoccupations and that that can allow us to touch in with the wisdom and the compassion

190
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:02,519
that's already within us so uh so the basic teaching is that when

191
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:08,520
the mind is really active and there's a lot of thinking this is a great time to simplify

192
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:15,358
this is when we want to choose a really simple object to attend to a really simple thing to focus on for our

193
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:22,138
meditation so that's why we're starting with the breath we're moving from the complexity of our stories our problems

194
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:27,658
our confusions to something very simple uh just this just

195
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:34,800
just the breath there's a book that came out a few years

196
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,839
ago called Caesar's Last Breath the Epic story of

197
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:47,940
the air around us and in it the author Sam Keane makes quite the claim he says that of the

198
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:55,320
sextillions of molecules entering and leaving your lungs at this moment quite literally there might be molecules

199
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:00,420
from Cleopatra's perfumes particles exhaled

200
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:06,540
by dinosaurs or those emitted from atomic bombs

201
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:12,839
um and it sounds very unlikely but apparently Keane crunched the numbers and estimates that

202
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:18,300
across all that distance of time and space a few of the molecules that were

203
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:23,460
inside Caesar's lungs during his last breath are actually dancing inside your

204
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:31,020
lungs right now for many of us who are lost in our inner

205
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:38,040
fantasies the breath might not seem as interesting as the fantasies

206
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:45,079
and I think that's in part because we forget what a miracle it is

207
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:51,000
that when I breathe in I'm breathing in the the air that the

208
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,579
Buddha exhaled 2500 years ago

209
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:03,900
like how extraordinary that from the moment I was born to the moment of my death that I'll have

210
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:12,359
a companion I have a promised friend that will be loyal to me for each moment of my life

211
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:17,119
and that companion is the breath

212
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:26,520
so with this in mind can we pay attention to the breath with gratitude with friendliness with wonder you know

213
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:34,619
what could be more important than paying attention to this this tiny spindle of air that miraculously Keeps Us Alive

214
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:42,300
can we be curious about it if you haven't noticed in your practice curiosity is like slight glue for the

215
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:49,560
present moment it keeps us here so if you can find ways to be curious about the breath you'll find ways to be with

216
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:55,560
it and that's why we explored all these different Sensations in the meditation practice this morning you know getting

217
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:01,578
to know the texture of the breath the shape the temperature Etc

218
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:10,020
so as we as we continue returning to the breath

219
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:17,040
it collects the Mind into the present moment almost like harvesting vegetables from a field and

220
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:23,099
collecting them into a basket the mind that's scattered becomes collected and

221
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:28,560
unified so often people associate this practice of collecting the mind of

222
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,140
focusing on the breath with the practice of concentration

223
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:39,960
with the word concentration often specifically in the west is that it can

224
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:46,200
lead to this image of a narrow um like a tight narrow laser laser beam

225
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:51,300
like where really cultivating striving in our meditations you know really

226
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:57,540
focusing really hard concentrating but that's not actually what we're trying to do with breath Focus

227
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:02,640
um so if you notice that you're heavily straining or you're tightening up to

228
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:07,980
concentrate then then you're cultivating straining and that's not what we want to

229
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:13,560
cultivate so um so this practice is of collecting the mind so I often like the word collecting

230
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:20,820
rather than concentrating because it's relaxed we're just collecting the Mind into the breath

231
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:28,800
so traditionally there are five factors of concentration and I'll only talk about the two today the first two today

232
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:35,099
um and uh and specifically I want to talk about those two because they can be supportive in learning to stay with the

233
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:43,440
breath so the first is vitaka and the second is vichara vitaka is application so we're

234
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:49,220
applying our attention to the breath applying and then the second is vichara

235
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:55,500
sustaining so sometimes we talk in Vitara are referred to as aim and

236
00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:00,140
sustain or practicing aiming and sustaining

237
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:08,220
so um recently I was on Retreat and while on Retreat I had a yogi job about

238
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:13,920
a half hour job doing a little work meditation and my job was to scrub the vegetables

239
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:19,560
and so one day I was I was scrubbing the potatoes and I was thinking about this

240
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:25,380
teaching of yitaka and vichara and I took the scrubber and I I applied I

241
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:30,420
aimed the scrubber at the potato um and then I sustained contact with the

242
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:35,880
potato as I scrubbed it right so if you talk in Vitara aiming and sustaining and I realized if I just aim at the potato

243
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:41,160
and I place the scrubber on the potato potato but then my hand kind of floats

244
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:46,440
off with the scrub brush uh I'm not sustaining contact with it you know I

245
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:53,579
can't actually I'm not actually scrubbing the potato if my hand floats off right so I have to aim and sustain and the same thing happens with the

246
00:39:53,579 --> 00:40:00,420
breath often actually well aim at the breath oh I'm supposed to be paying attention to breath right okay I'm going to feel the breath and we place the

247
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:06,780
attention on the breath and then it slips right off uh kind of like sliding on a banana peel we just slip right off

248
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:12,079
into thought so sometimes it can help to remember that we want to aim and sustain

249
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:18,780
maintain contact with the breath so touching it and staying connected

250
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:23,940
through the whole inhale the potato won't get clean if you don't aim and

251
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:29,880
sustain the mind won't get collected if you don't aim and sustain with the breath

252
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:36,660
so um this quote from w s Merwin

253
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:43,320
little breath Breathe Me Gently Romy

254
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:48,740
for I am a river I am learning to cross

255
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:58,700
little breath Breathe Me Gently roll Me Gently for I am a river I am learning to cross

256
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:05,940
so the breath is our raft and it's taking us from delusion to Awakening

257
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:12,599
it's our it's our trusty companion that supports Us in traversing samsara

258
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:18,180
so I hope that you take good care of the breath that you get to know it and that

259
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:23,880
you maybe even fall in love with the breath and ultimately this practice of

260
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:29,640
returning to the breath again and again regardless of how many times we're

261
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:35,579
distracted this builds concentration the mind is collected again and again and

262
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:41,520
this brings forth calmness and Tranquility so this calming force allows

263
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:47,339
us to develop enough stability to have insight into the nature of things

264
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:53,099
um as we return to the breath and continue to collect ourselves into the present

265
00:41:53,099 --> 00:42:01,140
it's kind of like stabilizing a tripod that holds a telescope so if we don't have a stable tripod it's

266
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:07,320
really hard to be still enough to see the stars and in meditation we're really wanting

267
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:13,320
to to clearly see the true nature of things we really want to see the stars right

268
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:18,359
um and what I mean by that is we want to clearly see the three characteristics

269
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:23,820
um we want to see um understand the source of suffering we

270
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:28,980
want to see the true nature of impermanence and the selfless nature of

271
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:35,280
all things I want to see suffering impermanence in that self but in order to do that we need to have

272
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:41,520
a stable tripod so the breath practice can stabilize us sufficiently to have insight into the

273
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:48,359
way things really are and when we can do that we can be free

274
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:56,000
so I think I will I will offer you a practice for the day

275
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:04,619
so if you would like to take this up your invitation is to spend uh two

276
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:09,660
minutes three three different times a day spend two minutes paying attention to your breath

277
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:16,020
just doing your best to let go of concerns and preoccupations maybe it's a moment to be grateful for

278
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:21,780
the breath or curious about the breath you might even set a timer now for three

279
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:28,319
different times today that you'll pause and do the practice practice and I've found that it's very rare in life that I

280
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:33,900
don't actually have time to sit for two minutes or to stand in meditation for two minutes

281
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:39,599
and I also I always know that if um if I think that I don't have time to sit for

282
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:46,560
two minutes that's often exactly when I really need to sit for two minutes so you can

283
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:52,020
explore that uh that practice as it's supportive for you

284
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:57,260
okay and I'll I'll close with a poem for you

285
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,640
this is called wage Peace by Judith Hill

286
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:15,660
wage peace with your breath breathe in firemen and Rubble

287
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:22,220
breathe out whole buildings and flocks of Red Wing blackbirds

288
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:27,599
breathe in terrorists and breathe out sleeping children and freshly moaned

289
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:35,660
feet moan fields breathe in confusion and breathe out maple trees

290
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:42,060
breathe in the fallen and bring it breathe out lifelong friendships intact

291
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:49,440
wage peace with your listening hearing Sirens pray loud remember your tools flower seeds

292
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:54,599
clothespins clean rivers make soup play music

293
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:59,838
memorize the words for thank you in three languages

294
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:07,800
learn to knit and make a hat think of chaos as dancing raspberries

295
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:12,900
imagine grief as the out breath of beauty

296
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:19,020
or the gesture of fish swim for the other side

297
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:24,720
wage peace never has the world seemed so fresh and

298
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:30,480
precious have a cup of tea and rejoice

299
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:38,099
act as if Armistice has already arrived celebrate today

300
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:43,740
that's Judith Hill wage peace so thank you everyone for your kind

301
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:49,200
attention this morning I hope to see you tomorrow for our focus on mindfulness of

302
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:55,040
body take care everyone enjoy your day
