1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,080
so good morning everyone and oh hello

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,879
everyone

3
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:22,240
and delighted to be here

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,400
so it's possible to listen to two things at once to be aware of two things

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:37,160
happening at once we do that with music where there's maybe many instruments playing at once and somehow we hear them

6
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:44,520
all and can distinguish one from the other and when many of the instruments

7
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,800
in the orchestra may be stopped playing so there can be a soloist we're aware very aware of the

8
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,440
silence Around The Soloist and uh that allows the solos to

9
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:03,000
be highlighted and accentuated and then the whole Orchestra joins in

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,799
again or we can be listening to um something in our kitchen and maybe

11
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:17,439
listening to someone talking and then suddenly the hum of the

12
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:23,960
refrigerator goes off and now there's a

13
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:31,240
silence and we still can listen to our friend speaking and the voice of that friend is

14
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,320
highlighted by that silence that we also can be aware

15
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:44,840
of so in the mind as I've offered here is that there

16
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:50,240
are two different operating systems two different categorically different ways

17
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,719
of thinking there's what can be the world of discursive

18
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:02,439
thought uh distracted thought jumping around thoughts spinning

19
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:07,600
thoughts um where we have conversations where we

20
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,000
create stories and images and predictions of the future that

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,760
relatively abstract and kind of a filling it with the fullness of the

22
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,959
story life that we live and then there uh and that is more

23
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:29,400
like the hum of the refrigerator and that's possible

24
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:35,480
sometimes for that to become quiet and it doesn't mean we no longer have any

25
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,519
thoughts but rather thinking changes as nature it becomes thinking from a

26
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:46,040
different operating system a different place different Source within rather

27
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:54,319
than the surface mind now it comes from the deep mind and the thoughts there are

28
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:01,200
generally uh very much to the point very much about the present moment experience

29
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:09,239
understanding it in a very simple way recognizing it in a very simple way maybe they are very simple instructions

30
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:14,760
we give ourselves like maybe I should bring more attention now to the end of

31
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:22,080
my out breath I seem to be a little bit uh holding back from breathing out all

32
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,239
the way what would happen if I breathe all the way out relax the E the exhale

33
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:36,439
so it can happen almost preverbally it's almost like a sense or intuition uh or could be the very simple

34
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:43,120
thoughts uh it could be simple thoughts that ask a question and

35
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,959
um uh what would happen now if I tuned into the changing nature of my

36
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:55,879
experience what would happen or is there any wisdom

37
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:02,360
now about how I get attached what can I understand from this vantage

38
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,879
point so they can be very very simple very not long discursive just a few

39
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:12,920
simple words and when practice gets really quiet from that deep place it's

40
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:19,759
just simple uh thoughts words images of recognition oh that's what's happening

41
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:27,280
that's what's happening and there's a silence in the surface mind there's a silence in that

42
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,960
Minds that's discussing things or having stories and that can be

43
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:39,600
Exquisite it might be easier to feel that silence the turning off of the hum of

44
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:47,800
the refrigerator in the mind if we understand that we're not trying to get rid of all

45
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:55,199
thoughts thoughts themselves are not the issue it's the source from which we're

46
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:02,400
thinking are we thinking from Fear are we thinking from anger or desire

47
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,360
ambition confusion are we thinking from the

48
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:14,639
surface the control tower or are we thinking from a quiet

49
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:21,680
place where there's no stress place with free of fear free of

50
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:31,479
anger free of greed ambition free of building up a self

51
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,000
the self is so tied to the story making

52
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,560
mind so it's when we let go of thinking primarily we're letting go of that

53
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:51,319
surface mind and be attuned to the resulting

54
00:05:51,319 --> 00:06:00,639
silence and quiet a quiet that lets us hear the solo

55
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,160
music that's so beautiful the quiet The Voice the

56
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:15,919
thoughts the that come from deep within from a peaceful place of no

57
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,120
stress so to assume a meditation

58
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,000
posture gently close the

59
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:36,039
eyes and taking a deep breath and relaxing on the

60
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:39,759
exhale relaxing

61
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
deeply

62
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:19,000
letting breathing return to normal and again as you exhale with a

63
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,039
normal like breath relaxing the

64
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,319
body from head to toe

65
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:02,000
as you exhale relaxing the thinking

66
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:10,479
mind the control tower any pressure or tension

67
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:18,360
contraction associated with thinking thinking that has tension as

68
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,800
part of it is part of that surface

69
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:31,240
mind it's not who we really are in our depths

70
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:53,360
as you exhale slowing thinking

71
00:08:53,360 --> 00:09:01,199
down so whatever you're thinking you think more calmly

72
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:08,120
no hurry no reaching for

73
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,839
anything softening the need to

74
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
think

75
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:52,000
and as you're breathing soften your

76
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:03,480
belly soften your belly and settle

77
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,360
in to the pelvic

78
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,399
floor let your weight be

79
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:23,839
supported the weight of your torso supported by the

80
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:31,040
pelvis relaxing as you exhale into the pelv

81
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:55,079
this and from deep within is there a

82
00:10:55,079 --> 00:11:02,480
place that is calmer more peaceful maybe more

83
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,920
still than how the surface mind

84
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,600
is the quietest most peaceful place

85
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:24,920
within and that's a relative

86
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:30,959
concern relatively more peaceful and calm

87
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:55,120
and in that quieter place within allow yourself to have very quiet

88
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:03,160
gentle thoughts about staying present with your

89
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,959
breathing quiet thoughts of

90
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:19,040
recognition that recognizes how the sensations of breathing

91
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,440
change as you

92
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
breathe

93
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
for

94
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
for

95
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
e

96
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
for

97
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:04,320
okay and as you exhale let

98
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:12,120
go of your discursive thoughts let go of thoughts which have

99
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:18,120
to do with stories of past and future

100
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,199
fantasy stories that judge yourself

101
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
and

102
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:41,079
stories that's beenin good and bad right and

103
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:51,639
wrong let go of the surface thoughts and let go into the depths of

104
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:57,600
your being the depths of

105
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
breathing

106
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:10,879
where the Deep Mind thinks gentle

107
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,519
thoughts appreciating The

108
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:23,319
Silence of the surface

109
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,519
mind

110
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
e

111
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
e

112
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
e

113
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
for

114
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
for

115
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
for

116
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:11,919
sometimes when the surface mind is quiet

117
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:19,880
silent quiet enough and we relax let go into the

118
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,720
depths of our

119
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:31,240
being the thoughts the C ni that we can be aware

120
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:39,000
of might be pre verbal

121
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,279
pre-image there's a

122
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:54,559
knowing without words and knowing without

123
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:00,600
images it might be followed by words or

124
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:06,158
images but there is a quiet place deep

125
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:12,440
within and the more peaceful that place

126
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:17,799
is and the more silence around

127
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:26,919
it the more we can rest in that pre verbal

128
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
knowing

129
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
for

130
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
for

131
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
e

132
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
oh

133
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
for

134
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
for

135
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
for

136
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:26,360
as we as we have been sitting for a number

137
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:34,520
of minutes now you might see if it's possible to relax

138
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:41,080
more deeply to release more

139
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:47,520
fully from the top of your head all the way down through your body slowly

140
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:54,799
relaxing like there's a wonderful flow of water that starts at the top of your

141
00:25:54,799 --> 00:26:03,640
head and then flows down down through the body relaxing it

142
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:11,399
all with every exhale the relaxing

143
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:16,960
water moves down settles down through your

144
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,600
body

145
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:03,120
and for from the calmest quietest Place deep

146
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:12,200
within the place that's maybe nose

147
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:21,039
preverbally knows without the filter of stories and memories

148
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,039
and desires and

149
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:31,120
fears bring to

150
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:38,679
mind the people of your life the people you might be seeing over

151
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:42,240

so hello and welcome to this fifth talk on wise

170
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:58,559
thinking I I I suspect that uh for much of my life I didn't think much about my

171
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:05,200
thinking I didn't uh took it for granted or took it as being what it is and

172
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:13,279
sometimes I in a way I took it to who I am if my thinking represented me and my interest my

173
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:20,679
thoughts my beliefs my opinions my emotions and uh it wasn't anything to

174
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:28,080
question or consider or investigate it was just taken for granted as a big

175
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:35,279
solid kind of event in its own right with

176
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:43,240
meditation uh I've learned to not do that but rather to be mindful of

177
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:50,279
thinking to investigate the nature of thinking what goes on as I think and the

178
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:56,159
Ecology of thinking and thinking is a composite thing it's made up of many different

179
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:01,240
component parts only one of which is the content of the

180
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:07,240
thoughts the very particular ideas or stories that are being uh

181
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:12,840
considered and this was really a great thing to open up to the wider field of

182
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:19,279
what's going on the emotional field the physical field what's going on in the

183
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:25,760
body energetically the tensions the Holdings the emotions that were the fuel

184
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:33,360
or the source for the emotions and um and uh this is a pretty

185
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:40,039
you know so that's included now when we do the basic introduction to meditation instructions here at

186
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:47,159
IMC and uh it's a whole this hour and a half on mindfulness of

187
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:54,480
thinking the um um and so one of the things we can begin discovering is that

188
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,559
there are different levels of thinking or different sources within from where

189
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:05,840
we think qualitatively and different kinds of thinking that we can

190
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:11,639
do and when we start understanding the range of possible ways of thinking kinds

191
00:33:11,639 --> 00:33:18,559
of thoughts we can have not not so much the content but um where they arise from

192
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:24,519
and what's feeding them and fueling them and um we can at some point discover

193
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:32,120
that there's thinking that is free of any clinging attachment free of any

194
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:38,519
need whereas the surface mind the more usual way of thinking is operating from

195
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:44,480
need from desires from greed from aversion from hostility from uh

196
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:52,440
criticism from confusion from fear in some in or in uh uh it's

197
00:33:52,440 --> 00:34:00,639
operating from stress it's possible to discover over a way of thinking that is

198
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:07,399
stressfree and for some people th this is the source of creativity and some people need to take

199
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:13,638
a vacation or really sometimes meditating is enough to awaken the capacity for creative

200
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:19,480
thinking that is flow can't flow when there's the limitation contraction of

201
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:25,398
any tension connected to thinking so we start feeling there's a different way of thinking a whole

202
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:31,040
different approach to way of thinking and it begins to put a question mark

203
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:36,440
about the value of the usual way of thinking is this really the best thing

204
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:42,200
to be doing is this really the best way to think and more importantly is the

205
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:49,079
messages coming from the surface mind that does a thinking is it really an accurate message is it true is it

206
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:54,118
valuable is it is something that I need to believe in or is it appropriate to

207
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:59,680
question it and look more deeply to see more deeply what's really going on

208
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:07,040
here and you know I found that the answer was often yes it is appropriate the question it is appropriate to look

209
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:14,599
more deeply what's really happening here more deeply within and so as we go deeper within we

210
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:20,839
discover that there's a place of thinking that um is comes out of a

211
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:27,119
stress being stressed free or some part of us some place core part or deep place

212
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:33,200
inside where there's calm or peace and that the way the nature of

213
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,800
those thoughts are very different they are very simple they can be

214
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:45,480
sophisticated in in because they can take in the whole of who we are that when whenever

215
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:50,520
we're tensed we we're always limited and we have so many faculties so

216
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:58,680
many abilities that come into play that when there's a sense of Harmony within uh then it that that all these

217
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:03,760
things can come together into an intuitive understanding or a well-informed

218
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,880
understanding that's uh we don't necessarily recognize all the data

219
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:17,240
that's coming in and that's why it's creative that's why it's know so much and can be so so uh

220
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:24,000
effective and that's deep is very s so it can be sophisticated but the content of the

221
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,640
thoughts the way they appear is not not complicated it's not a deep

222
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:37,520
complicated analysis and thinking and it's more it's a satisfying thinking it's satisfying in and of itself it's

223
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:43,280
very simple and even that thinking get quieter and quieter and sometimes it's

224
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:49,079
just this absolutely most rudimentary Act of recognition of what's

225
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:54,480
happening in the present moment calm peace

226
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:01,000
knowing Joy concentration

227
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,040
spaciousness settled just kind of very simple without

228
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:12,200
leaning forward or against not wanting or not wanting just knowing knowing

229
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:17,560
knowing and so much drops away of our life things just drop away drop away and

230
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:23,880
it just feels like the most satisfying place to be is in this very deep quiet

231
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:31,560
knowing that we really feel and are connected to are experiencing in a deep way and it might even be possible to

232
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:37,520
sense at some point that there is a kind of cognition a kind of knowing that

233
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:43,119
happens before uh there are words thoughts

234
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:49,040
images a funny thing can happen in in Con in in deep states of meditation

235
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:57,400
where it's possible to feel physically that uh kind of like a physical sense that a thought is about

236
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:03,200
to happen the image I had when this often has is like a surface of water and

237
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:09,640
the bubbles begin s growing up on the on the surface of the water and that thought bubble some some point will

238
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:14,839
leave the surface and and I could feel a little bit of pressure a little bit of

239
00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:20,920
movement or something little bit of energy behind this the thinking and

240
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:26,560
because the uh the Deep attention is right there to feel and know and Rec

241
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:35,040
recogniz what's happening this almost preverbal knowing that impulse to think Fades

242
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:41,280
away I knew I was about to think but I I never knew never

243
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:49,599
discovered what those thoughts were going to be in other words thinking begins offline often in this deeper

244
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:56,920
place but something is we have a rich inner life that's deeper than verbal thoughts and images that we do and when

245
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,960
the mind is quiet we can sometimes sense this preverbal

246
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:09,880
knowing and um not that it's necessarily knowing accurately but it's knowing freely with

247
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:15,319
the depth that um that then we can because we're paying attention being

248
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:20,480
mindful there's a kind of a check and balance system we kind of feel oh is

249
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:27,720
this so and let's find out let's let's look more deeply or check the situation

250
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:35,520
out more and so but the important thing I wanted to highlight today is that it's

251
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:43,000
possible to let the surface mind become silent and it's exquisitely beautiful

252
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:49,440
wonderful to be in this world with a surface mind quiet and

253
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:56,760
peaceful but the Deep Mind present and aware and connected and consider

254
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:04,800
considerate to what's happening around us within us there's an intelligence there we don't need to have the surface

255
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:11,720
mind always thinking always operating always figuring out and the way that we can be present

256
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:16,960
for others and present for ourselves present for this world with the surface

257
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:24,560
mind quiet and peaceful and the deeper mind available is really

258
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:31,000
wonderful so to begin to recognize when the hum of the

259
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:38,760
refrigerator quiets in the mind the surface mind gets quiet we can still think but we're not

260
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:46,440
thinking from the place where the hum is happening the stress is happening The Silence of the surface mind so I want to

261
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:53,560
end with a story from my little Book of Stories uh called the monastery

262
00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:01,839
within the the monastery work leader always appeared

263
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:10,720
peaceful this was not so unusual among the monks and nuns of the monastery he was unique however in that

264
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:17,359
he remained peaceful and calm even when the monastery was at its busiest for example when large crowds of

265
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:23,599
people visited to celebrate the Buddha's birthday if a person was needed to visit

266
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:29,520
if a person was needed to visit the hustle and bustle of the local market town this was the

267
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:38,000
monk the monastery usually sent when asked how he managed to remain peaceful he said I entered the monastery

268
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,960
for peace and quiet I had spent years in the harried world of Commerce and people

269
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:52,119
I longed for the silence the monastery was rumored to have I was delighted with my first weeks

270
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:57,640
in the monastery the silence was exquisite

271
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:04,200
however as I settled into the Silence of the place I was shocked to learn how

272
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:11,839
noisy my M my own mind was the real noise was

273
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:17,400
within it was the business of my own mind that oppressed me not the noise and

274
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:24,119
activity of the world now it doesn't matter to me where

275
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:30,359
I go I care the silence within

276
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:36,559
me so I hope that this week and talking

277
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:41,599
about these different aspects of thinking has uh opened a window for you

278
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:47,680
to investigate and consider your thinking a new way and just to to

279
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:53,640
question what your thinking is about is a step towards a kind of mental

280
00:42:53,640 --> 00:43:00,720
Freedom where we're not caught in the grip of our thoughts we don't an automatic believe every thought we have

281
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:07,800
and think that we are our thoughts there is a deeper way of being deeper way of

282
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:14,480
living in the world that is not from the control tower of the surface

283
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:22,319
mind May that surface mind from time to time provide you with a nurturing

284
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:29,920
silence and quiet and may you discover how to operate in this world with the surface

285
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:36,319
mind quiet so thank you very

286
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:43,280
much so I have a few announcements and um first is I'm not going to be here for

287
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:51,839
the next couple of weeks I'm going to um take the next uh a couple of weeks

288
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:57,240
kind of more as a vacation time and we'll be going to uh

289

292
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:24,880
the teachers here at IMC and uh she's a wonderful teacher and

293
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:32,240

294
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:38,559
for the new year and then the first week of the new year uh uh Coto Coto conin

295
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:43,680
who has been here before will U will be here and I'll be here the following

296
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:50,680
second week of the year and my plan uh for the beginning of the year is last

297
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:59,040
few years I've always uh talked about um something to do with meditation practice and sometimes a long series on on it

298
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:04,559
what I like to do this time is go back to the basics that we use here at IMC

299
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:11,000
and for and do the kind of a maybe in-depth uh instructions on the basic

300
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:17,520
Insight practice that I teach here and um and so even if you've been a

301
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:22,880
practitioner for a long time I hope that as I teach it that uh New Dimensions

302
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:29,920
will become available for you and um so it'll be a week uh each on the the five

303
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:38,359
different areas that I emphasized in the intro introduction to meditation course breath body emotions thinking and then

304
00:45:38,359 --> 00:45:43,839
practicing in life also I want to say that uh since

305
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:49,119
