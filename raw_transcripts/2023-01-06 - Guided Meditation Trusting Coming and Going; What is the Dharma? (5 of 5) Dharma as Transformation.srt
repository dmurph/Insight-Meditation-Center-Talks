1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,920
hello everyone and welcome

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,059
in the The Jump Right In

3
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:23,220
there is a significant very important teaching

4
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,500
that the Buddha gave to a monk named katyana gota

5
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:36,000
and um and in this uh I'm going to paraphrase

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,399
or or exemplify the teachings rather than to say them

7
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,519
in relationship to to support this meditation today

8
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:51,980
so the inhale when we breathe in

9
00:00:52,680 --> 00:01:00,739
when it begins we cannot say that the inhale doesn't exist

10
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:08,040
but when the inhale finishes and we begin exhaling we cannot say that the inhale exists

11
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:15,240
anymore and so and certainly we can say that it

12
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:22,619
exists continuously non-stop because that's it it's a solid static phenomena

13
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:28,020
rather it's something that comes and goes it exists as a process

14
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,600
it exists as a as a

15
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,960
in terms of breathing it exists in terms of a few moments the inhale

16
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:47,820
and if we see the inhale as something we cannot say so in a sense we

17
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:54,240
can't say that it neither exists nor doesn't exist in a static ongoing

18
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,979
non-stop kind of process it exists as a process

19
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:07,280
that's temporary it exists as it's going through its motions

20
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,900
and uh and the reason why this kind of teaching is emphasizing in this teaching

21
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:18,060
to katyana gota had said kind of more universally more generally

22
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:24,660
but that if we see that the breathing comes and go the inhale comes and goes

23
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:30,900
it doesn't make any sense to grab a hold of it to to to get attached to it

24
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:37,800
because if we grab it get attached to it soon enough it disappears

25
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:44,220
but if we get upset about it disappearing it only reappears a few moments later

26
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:50,340
and so in relationship to breathing we learn to trust the process we learn not

27
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:57,120
to be attached to it not to hold on to it we also learn not to resist it

28
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,700
and uh in as meditation deepens there becomes a deeper and deeper trust in the

29
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:08,400
process the natural process of the body just breathing by itself

30
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,760
breathing breathes itself so the same thing is true of the exhale

31
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:21,659
when it begins we can't say it doesn't exist when it passes when it ends we can't say

32
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:25,819
it now it exists

33
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:33,300
uh it exists as a phenomena that appears and disappears comes and goes

34
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:40,680
so by emphasizing this with breathing maybe you can appreciate

35
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:49,440
one of the many reasons why mindfulness of breathing is useful here it's because as we get centered and

36
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,319
focus on breathing it's possible to kind of I'd like maybe it's not the best

37
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:03,019
word but savor or have an intimacy

38
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:10,560
with that aspect of each inhale and exhale which is

39
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:17,820
how it begins it appears and it disappears

40
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:24,600
and in that appearing and disappearing There's an opportunity for a

41
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,240
spaciousness for an allowing for a non-clinging

42
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,840
for a trusting of letting it appear and letting it disappear

43
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:43,259
and one way to trusted is to not then get caught in thoughts about it

44
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:49,919
ideas and wishes and hopes around breathing because those thoughts

45
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:57,560
also have the nature of appearing and disappearing

46
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,880
and uh thoughts are kind of fickle that way even though some of them might

47
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,520
predominate and as we Center ourselves into breathing

48
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:14,160
and seeing the coming and going of it we might then also with time also begin

49
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,759
appreciating how a lot of things come and go and things that we thought were kind of this is the way things are

50
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:26,580
that turns out to be related to thoughts that think that

51
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:31,800
but those thoughts themselves come and go

52
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:38,720
so assuming a meditation posture

53
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,620
and

54
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:54,199
gently closing your eyes and with your eyes closed

55
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:01,800
to appreciate your body

56
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:09,259
your mind your heart appreciate that you are taking this time

57
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,180
for an intimacy

58
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,800
for a caring and protection and support

59
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:29,120
that's provided with meditation

60
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:46,560
and then to bring forth something that maybe doesn't exist yet but it will

61
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,419
appear for a little while and disappear

62
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:59,900
to have appear a few deep inhales and long exhales

63
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:06,840
deep enough just enough not too much not too little

64
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:13,520
but just the right amount for a greater connection

65
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:21,380
to the present moment to your body

66
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,560
and to relaxing in your body

67
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:59,479
that in your breathing return to normal

68
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,759
in some things don't come and go quickly

69
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:12,800
but some things they're passing we can watch and see and support

70
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:18,780
so tension in the body there might be some of it

71
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:25,680
that you can relax a bit support the passing

72
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:34,159
of tension maybe as you exhale to relax the face

73
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,899
maybe as you exhale to relax the shoulders

74
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:04,019
there might be a feeling small feeling of relaxing that begins

75
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:08,839
and then after the relaxing it kind of Fades away

76
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,220
relaxing the belly

77
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:28,160
relaxing the arms and hands

78
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:40,040
maybe the thighs and legs

79
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:53,600
and relaxing the thinking mind

80
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,899
maybe with a feeling that as the Mind relaxes

81
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:11,360
they just it expands

82
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,660
or spreads out quietly

83
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:31,380
in the kind of way that waves in the ocean might settle and spread out

84
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:36,200
to create a flat surface

85
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,620
and then than breathing normally

86
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:06,500
follow the exhale to the end of the exhale and when it's time to breathe in

87
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:12,360
allow the inhale to occur

88
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:18,600
let there be as receptive as you can to the body

89
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,040
beginning to breathe in

90
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:45,720
receptive to the full inhale and recognizing it when it stops when

91
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,839
they inhale ends no longer there

92
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:16,820
inhale appears and disappears

93
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:32,779
even if you're controlling it it still appears and disappears

94
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:53,060
in some ways exists and then it doesn't exist

95
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:19,700
when the inhale has ended allow the exhale

96
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,100
allow it to begin

97
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:39,200
let go as you end the exhale to allow it to finish

98
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:04,519
staying aware this way of inhales and exhales

99
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:13,920
keeps you connected to the fullness of breathing

100
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:22,040
The Full Experience of the body breathing

101
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:28,339
Sensations appearing and disappearing

102
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,420
all connected to breathing

103
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,480
foreign

104
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:09,298
foreign

105
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,620
foreign

106
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,799
as we continue

107
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:43,500
can you bring forth to trust

108
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:51,980
the trusting of this process that allows breathing to come and go

109
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:58,400
inhales come they go exhales come and go

110
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:06,860
thoughts appear and eventually disappear

111
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:15,860
there's a deep Trust in this process of coming and going

112
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:23,520
the process of unfolding that happens best when we allow things

113
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:29,520
to follow their own course of coming and

114
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,760
going

115
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:41,840
trusting the awareness

116
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:50,480
that makes room for all things to come and go

117
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:33,419
thank you in Awareness which is intimate with breathing

118
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:39,620
trusting they're coming and going inhales and exhales

119
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:46,280
in that awareness in that way of being

120
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,700
can you recognize

121
00:23:51,720 --> 00:24:00,320
freedom from clinging freedom from resistance

122
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:09,019
a kind of freedom of letting it all unfold on its own getting out of the way

123
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:17,780
is there any even hints small sense of that freedom

124
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:42,620
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

125
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:50,240
might there be something

126
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:56,400
within you that has a little bit more taste

127
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,580
feel for freedom

128
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:10,620
of freedom from being a little less preoccupied caught attached

129
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:22,100
and if there is something that

130
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:29,880
gives you some sense of Freedom that

131
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:36,799
take a few moments to breathe with it breathe through it

132
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:43,220
make space for it to grow

133
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:59,240
and then to allow that whatever sense of Freedom there is

134
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:06,240
to grow and expand maybe only with your imagination

135
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:12,960
imagining bringing this freedom

136
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,278
to your whole life

137
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:26,000
maybe with a sense of ease or peace

138
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:36,120
and that you can bring this with you to your contact with other people

139
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,919
imagine that that is so

140
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:53,240
and imagine that in this freedom and peace or ease

141
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:02,840
through space for your good will for your kindness

142
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:13,620
for your well-wishing and care

143
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,700
for this world

144
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:26,159
may this practice that we do be for the welfare and happiness

145
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:33,919
of others may all beings be happy

146
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:39,919
may all beings be safe

147
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:46,278
may all beings be peaceful

148
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:51,620
may all beings be free

149
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,860
thank you

150
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,520
foreign

151
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:33,299
so as an introduction for the last talk on what is the Dharma

152
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:40,919
I want to say that um there's a long history of Buddhists down through the centuries

153
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:46,260
and different countries having a celebratory attitude towards

154
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:52,320
the Dharma uh sometimes when you spend a lot of time with the Buddhist monistics you

155
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:59,460
don't get a quite the sense of Celebration because they're kind of required to have a decorum of being calm

156
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:07,559
quiet and not so expressive and uh but uh in fact many Buddhists

157
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:16,679
will celebrate and sing and and chant and uh have a quite historically quite a

158
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:24,299
wonderful Rich celebratory feeling about the Dharma feels they feel so fortunate so lucky it's so wonderful

159
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:29,760
that the word Dharma represents something huge for them

160
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:35,100
the the Buddhist teacher a very famous kind

161
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:42,000
of uh on somewhat naturalistic a teacher in Thai in Thailand uh John

162
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,279
buradasa a great intellectual he kind of reformed much of

163
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:52,740
Thai Buddhism from much of its superstitious background in them earlier

164
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:59,539
times times and um he um

165
00:31:59,539 --> 00:32:09,120
he was involved in a lot of inter-religious dialogue or some of some of it and uh he was quite content to equate

166
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:15,480
the Christian and and the Muslim idea of God with Dharma

167
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:23,399
so exactly what he meant by that and how it worked but it kind of has the same place that this word Dharma this concept

168
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:29,399
this this uh this reality of Dharma uh has this huge place in the life of

169
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:36,120
Buddhists that they celebrate and they're you know they're delighted for and inspired for and they go to it for

170
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:42,960
protection it's something that protects them and and that keeps them safe

171
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,919
so it's a powerful and wonderful topic and uh and I think that

172
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:56,880
as a Dharma practice Buddhist practice deepens and fills out and becomes grows

173
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:02,220
that there can be a wonderful sense of that there is this kind of support

174
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:07,980
protection uh there is this kind of inspiration this growth this tremendous

175
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:14,940
value that comes from the Dharma that almost treats it as something that

176
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:20,519
is um has has its own existence however the Dharma that we're talking

177
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:28,019
about is inseparable for the people who practice the Dharma it's the Dharma is something which kind

178
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:34,220
of exists within us as a natural process so something natural and com that's available

179
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:41,039
if we make room for it if we allow for it if we practice and it's a little bit like

180
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:46,500
someone who lives a very stressful life very busy always running and doing and

181
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:51,899
all that and their health suffers dramatically and the doctors say you

182
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:58,320
have to you know you're not going to live much longer unless you change and the person sure enough changes radically

183
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:05,760
maybe they retire they they go on a long vacation they slow down they meditate

184
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:11,280
they go in retreats and and mostly they stop doing

185
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:17,040
and in that not doing there's a whole settling and opening and healing process

186
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:25,679
that can unfold that is mostly not because they did the healing but that's a natural process

187
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:32,700
by which uh you know so much of the distressing brings brings with it allows

188
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:39,780
the way there's just a movement towards Health that the body can to some degree in some ways allow for

189
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:44,878
and even if it's not physical health there are people for whom there's been

190
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:50,158
um who have who feel like they were healed while they were dying

191
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:56,099
uh which some people that sound that's counter-intuitive or kind of goes doesn't quite work they weren't cured

192
00:34:56,099 --> 00:35:02,400
but there was a deep psychological spiritual healing that happened in the process of dying

193
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:10,440
that also didn't necessarily seem to be their own doing but it was available here in this letting go this opening up

194
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:17,300
this allowing something to unfold and flower and come to fruit

195
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,300
so the last meeting meeting that I want to talk about this week about Dharma

196
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:30,240
is that um well go back to in the first day I said that there were three primary

197
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:35,339
meetings of Dharma the first is uh the and all of them are

198
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:43,200
kind of verbs kind of important to understand them is it's an involvement in engagement that is involved when we

199
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:49,200
talk about the Dharma it's not something abstract removed though it's easy to kind of see well the Dharma is the

200
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:56,640
teachings of the Buddha I'll get a book out to read about it um but the real dharmas comes from

201
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:02,099
engagement and so the first one is the Dharma which

202
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:08,940
is the process of learning learning those teachings and not just learning the memorizing

203
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:15,000
them but engaging them and arguing with them and and exploring them and and

204
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:21,480
discovering how they work for ourselves the second is uh meaning of Dharma is

205
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:27,540
the practice that we do the Dharma practice and in some ways that probably is the

206
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:32,880
most important I put a tremendous value in the practice love it and

207
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:40,200
and the third is um attainment the higher

208
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:45,720
arrival higher coming into a new way of being

209
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:52,619
sometimes it's called when there's this threefold definition of the Dharma this last one sometimes is called

210
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:58,140
penetration so to to penetrate for oneself to know

211
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:05,640
foreign oneself that the heart of the Dharma but not by just the knowing of it

212
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:12,660
but the transformation of it so this uh uh the the last of the three

213
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:20,280
kind of definitions for Dharma is to um is the attainments that transform us so

214
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:28,440
we can maybe call that Dharma is transformation uh in the realm of freedom in the realm

215
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:33,500
of of all the good that the Dharma represents including

216
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:40,700
compassion and care and love and freedom and wisdom and joy and happiness and

217
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:47,880
honesty and a lot of things that come and so this attainment this last uh

218
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:53,700
what Dharma is that itself is sometimes divided into three categories

219
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:58,920
and that is that it's um it's called this wonderful terms uh

220
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:04,140
the first two path and fruit

221
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:12,060
there is the path of that we practice and it puts us on a path the dharma's onward leading there's a

222
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:19,260
road there's a conveyor belt there's a stream that we enter into this entering into the stream entering

223
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:26,940
into this path is a phenomenal a wonderful thing it usually doesn't happen in an instant but usually people

224
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:34,020
who practice after some point it Dawns on them wait a minute there's something happening growing developing unfolding

225
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:39,359
here that's supporting me I'm really in the Stream I'm in this current I'm on

226
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:45,720
the conveyor belt there's not really any getting off it anymore this is a powerful momentum

227
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:53,339
uh for health and and freedom

228
00:38:53,339 --> 00:39:00,900
so that's the path and uh when we kind of enter into it and then there's the path comes to fruition

229
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:08,760
uh it has a it's called fruit and this is also a beautiful kind of organic metaphor that of something which

230
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:14,099
naturally grows and ripens at first uh in the tree there's not even

231
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:19,560
the leaves in the after the winter and first the leaves grow and then the the

232
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:25,859
flowers appear and then the flowers get pollinated and that the the fruit begins

233
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:32,160
to grow slowly and and then by the end of the season the fruit is ripe and uh a

234
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:38,579
wonderful example of fruit here fruition of practice is that if you leave the fruit alone like an apple alone on the

235
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:45,780
tree at some point the connection of the stem of the of the Apple to the branch

236
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:53,160
um falls apart and the Apple Falls and so the same way that at some point

237
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:58,200
in this practice we ripen and then most natural process of it all

238
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:03,900
is that when the ripening is full which we can't know when exactly it is

239
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:09,300
that something releases something lets go in a deep full complete way and you

240
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:15,440
don't put the apple back up on the tree put tape on and try to get it to be attached to the tree again

241
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:21,859
it's uh it's a kind of irreversible that process once it falls off

242
00:40:21,859 --> 00:40:28,200
so fruition is something that's irreversible change transformation

243
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:35,520
and that the third is nirvana nibana and this is the experience the knowing

244
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:42,060
of the absence of clinging it's the release and knowing

245
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:47,420
that release knowing that freedom of um of no longer

246
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:56,280
clinging resisting craving wanting holding on tight to ideas to anything to

247
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:05,460
and uh and that idea of a path fruit and release freedom

248
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:11,880
is available in hints and small ways from the very beginning of persons practice

249
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:17,160
it's at some point as we practice it's really helpful to get a feel or a sense

250
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:22,200
intuition for the momentum for what's opening up

251
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:27,720
that oh something's opening here as feel a sense of

252
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:32,880
of it comes to a fruition it comes to there's a the fullness there's a

253
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:39,960
possibility of really being free here and then there is a feeling the sense

254
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:46,020
that of what that freedom that release is like and these These are can be found just

255
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:51,720
right there in mindfulness or breathing to really trust the coming and going the

256
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:58,500
arising and passing of the inhales of the exhales as I pointed to in the meditate meditation just now

257
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:04,740
that there can be little hints that oh this is what it's about here is the here

258
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:10,440
it is it's unfolding from the beginning to the end of the meditation something unfolded I was in

259
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:16,920
the Stream I was in this onward leading nature I'm more settled more open

260
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:23,820
a little more sense of being of being released and not caught take these into account know these

261
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:28,980
appreciate these so they can grow and when it doesn't go in some nice

262
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:34,079
linear fashion that way sometimes I'm with practice that conveyor belt or

263
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:39,960
practice brings us to places in our lives that we have to have difficulty we have to where

264
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:48,000
we encounter the unresolved issues of our life and then we can maybe appreciate that oh

265
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:55,920
I don't want to look at this I don't want to deal with this this is painful but the Dharma knows best the Dharma

266
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:01,619
knows it's time for me to be able to practice with this too so it's going to be a little bit more

267
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:07,020
difficult or quite a bit more difficult now for a while but this is good

268
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:12,300
that in the context of doing this practice this has arose and now I get to

269
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:18,480
face this and work with us and so this gives a uh adds to the

270
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:23,940
freedom that we can live with the freedom of

271
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:28,980
being willing to be with the difficulties of our life

272
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:36,300
to practice with those as well and if our freedom we're finding this practice doesn't include a certain kind

273
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:42,060
of freedom and a willingness to practice also with our difficulties

274
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:49,079
then I think this Dharma doesn't have a chance to grow into his fullness then it's not really a real thing that has to

275
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:55,099
do with our life so Dharma

276
00:43:55,560 --> 00:44:01,380
Dharma is a foundation for and this under hopefully this understanding that we offer I offered

277
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:07,800
this week uh will offer a foundation for what we'll do in the in the upcoming

278
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:14,700
months here and on this uh morning teachings there

279
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:20,460
so thank you very much and um

280
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:25,980
next week Monday and Tuesday I'll be at the retreat center

281
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:31,560
and so I'll be broadcasting from there and so you'll see a little bit different

282
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:39,260
or quite a different location and and probably I'll I'll sit where with uh

283
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:45,420
patachara the the statue of the nun patachar that we used to have for a

284
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:53,160
while here early in the pandemic but now it's down at IRC so thank you and I look forward to

285
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,520
Monday
