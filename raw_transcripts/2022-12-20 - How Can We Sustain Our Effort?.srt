1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:07,379
good evening welcome welcome to see you all

2
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:11,960
this December Day evening

3
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:19,740
before I forget I want to make an announcement that uh that we won't have

4
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:26,279
a meeting next Monday it's pretty unusual for IMC to be closed but we will

5
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:33,420
be not open next Monday so it just adds up about

6
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,640
that it's on the calendar too but uh

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,859
we don't always look at the calendar right so that we won't have a meeting here next Monday

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,340
so I've been gone for a number of weeks and partly

9
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,680
I was the reason why I wasn't here is because I was at IMS in Massachusetts

10
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,198
the Insight Meditation Society it's part of the teaching team for the

11
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:11,900
last part of the three-month retreat three months

12
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:18,180
so the way it's set up is that you can do the first six weeks you can do the second six weeks or you can do 12 weeks

13
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:24,659
all of it and this year about more than half did uh more than three did all

14
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:32,479
three months and they didn't do the three-month Retreat last year I think or the year before so

15
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:41,939
so I've done a number of three-month Retreats and and now in my role there as a teacher

16
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:47,280
I recognized in some of the participants some of the yogis that we call them

17
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,479
something that tripped me up and I saw a lot of people getting tripped up about the same thing

18
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,659
I want to talk a little bit about this and that is

19
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:06,960
maybe maybe I'll start by saying It's Perfectly Natural that if a person is

20
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:14,580
going to go on a three-month Retreat right this is a big deal to rearrange your life to essentially

21
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:19,680
drop out of society for a number of months is not a small feat

22
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,840
it's not a trivial matter it's usually something that gets planned years in advance

23
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:31,379
so that you know all everything can be taken care of and something like this and the three-month

24
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:37,200
Retreat is always in the fall every year at IMs it has been for the last 45 years

25
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:45,599
so something that you you can plan years in advance but when a person goes

26
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,780
it's not uncommon to have this secret niggling little thoughts in the back of

27
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:58,440
their mind that maybe they're not aware of but this idea of well if anything's

28
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,540
gonna happen with my practice It's gotta be here

29
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:09,620
I gotta make it happen I don't know if I'll ever be able to do a three month Retreat again in my life

30
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:15,480
and I gotta make it happen whatever it is right and we have different ideas

31
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:24,300
about what that is so there's this way in which we show up with this determination this sense of

32
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:32,340
okay I'm gonna go For Broke not recognizing not knowing because we

33
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,800
don't talk about it so much but this subtle type of

34
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:43,739
I'm like grimacing when I'm thinking about this I'm making a fist clenching my teeth kind of thought

35
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:49,799
is exactly what makes what they want to happen not happen

36
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:55,799
whatever it is right we all have different ideas with the goal of practices but there's this way in which

37
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:02,580
there's this straining this bearing down this spreading your teeth

38
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,860
that turns out not really to be the way forward

39
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:14,519
for me I my first time I was in a three-month Retreat I had this crazy idea

40
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,919
that I should never go outside

41
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:26,820
I don't you know I just felt like that was like the thing to do and IMS has organized that you can do that that all

42
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:32,580
the because it's colds there right this is New England so it's cold there in the fall it starts in September and ends in

43
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:38,160
December and you know by the time it ends the Highs are only in the 20s or something

44
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,100
there but but so it's all the buildings are connected so you can go from the dorms

45
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:50,600
to the dining hall to the meditation Hall you know without ever going outside I got a little weird

46
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:57,600
just staying inside all that time you know this kind of

47
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:04,500
mindful walking and eating and sitting and there's something that just you know

48
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:11,280
my world just kind of got really small and I kind of got really tight and in my role as a teacher here at just

49
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,740
this past few weeks seen people doing the same thing

50
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:23,699
so for me it showed up this idea of like gotta make it happen showed up in this

51
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:30,900
kind of the things getting really small and tight and that's how you could see as an an

52
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:36,300
observer just watching what Diana was doing but in the mind

53
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:43,160
was this sense of get out of my way I gotta get get

54
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:48,240
concentrated or something like this so there was this quiet aversion to

55
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,120
everything kind of being pushed away there was this quiet uh

56
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:01,020
sense of whatever I'm doing it's not enough it's not good enough or something like this

57
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:07,440
I just got a little weird and the teachers were like Diana can you back off a little bit and I was like what do

58
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,720
those teachers know they already have something I don't know

59
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,900
what it is they have but I don't have it I have to work yeah come to find out this turns out not

60
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:24,900
to be so rare to have this idea so I just thought I would talk about this a little bit

61
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:31,979
this idea of how do we have this sustained practice

62
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:40,080
this energy of showing up again and again and again without tension

63
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,020
without tightness without a sense of bearing down and

64
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:52,319
gritting our teeth how do we do that

65
00:06:52,319 --> 00:07:00,060
because to be sure this practice does require that we you know put forth energy that we put forth effort right we

66
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:06,720
can't just be passive if we are I mean there might be a way in

67
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,300
which there are some people who are thinking that okay as long as I

68
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:19,819
maybe to have some heartfelt rituals or

69
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:25,440
commitment or something like that then something will

70
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:31,560
shift but those usually aren't the people that come to IMC because we don't have very much rituals and those aren't

71
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:38,940
the type of people that go on long retreat practice so I'm kind of talking this talk is more

72
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:45,240
towards those people who are really pushing and we're in Silicon Valley

73
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:52,199
there's a lot of really smart accomplished people here so the type of

74
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:58,259
pushing or perseverance that helps in our professional life helps in our education

75
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:04,680
is not the same type of thing that's going to help in our meditation life and

76
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,960
that's really hard to understand like we have this one way of accomplishing

77
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:16,620
things becoming successful attaining achieving in so many different ways in our lives

78
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:23,039
and it turns out that that works until it doesn't

79
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:29,160
it works a little bit until only so far but if you really want this practice to

80
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:34,740
take you further that same thing that helped you in other areas of your life is not really going to help with

81
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:42,539
meditation so maybe I'll just say so that's like

82
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:49,560
one extreme really the grin and Barrett and I'm going to talk about that but there is also of course this other

83
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:56,519
extreme of you know just complete passivity and just reading some good Dharma books that make us feel good

84
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:02,519
listening to some Derma talks that make us feel good and then don't do anything until we read the

85
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:09,120
next book or listen to the next Dharma talk but there's this way that we have to do a

86
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,760
little bit of energy because if we don't

87
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:22,920
our life will unfold according to our habits our life will unfold according to our

88
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:29,220
neuroses our life will unfold according to kind

89
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:36,899
of like Evolution as programmed us to be pursuing pleasure

90
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:43,500
right getting genes into the next generation is about food and sex and pleasurable

91
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:49,920
things so you know Evolution was in about

92
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:56,339
helping us to feel happy or satisfied or Freedom or have a good life it was all about pleasure so

93
00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:03,920
it takes effort it definitely takes effort if we want something a little bit different than that

94
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,480
chances are we've been pursuing all these pleasures and found it's

95
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,180
not as satisfying as we had hoped it would be

96
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:22,080
and maybe I'll say something else so we have our habits nurses Evolution but

97
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:28,320
also just our culture it's quite something right how our

98
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:35,220
culture really wants us to pay attention to screens as much as possible Right we've kind of created a culture that

99
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:41,540
thinks it's the absolute worst thing we could ever do is be bored and once instead we need to be

100
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:48,660
entertained or we need to be assumed or we need to be outraged or

101
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:54,300
something like that so this it does take effort to turn away

102
00:10:54,300 --> 00:11:00,120
from all these pressures that we experience

103
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:06,720
so how can we how can we do this have some sustained effort in a way

104
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,899
that's without tension without tightness without

105
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:18,920
getting tipping over into something that's not so helpful

106
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:28,079
so one way is maybe I'll recognize that um this

107
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:36,480
word energy shows up in a lot of Buddhist lists energy or we can tie together um effort

108
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:43,220
so the poly words aren't exactly the same but they're pointing to the same thing

109
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:49,680
and I'll say that energy it's in the seven factors of Awakening it's the

110
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:55,200
third out of seven it's in the parmies the ten Perfections

111
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:02,640
it's the fifth of the tenth it's in the five faculties it's the

112
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:10,200
second out of the five it's in the Eightfold Path it's the

113
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:16,079
sixth out of the eighth so something that we notice if we look

114
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:21,839
at that not only is in a lot of lists and it's in more or less but the other list I'm just mentioning the most common

115
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:29,040
one the most well-known ones what we'll notice Energy's in the middle

116
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,560
of these lists and so one way that we might like it'll

117
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,620
really you know ten thousand foot V 30 000 foot view we might think of practices

118
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:45,839
having an orientation a direction we want to go

119
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,120
and then using energy is a way to help us

120
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,160
get to greater Freedom greater ease

121
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:03,720
and you know these lists end with things like concentration Equanimity or wisdom and they start with

122
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,940
things like faith view generosity kind of like this

123
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:16,820
movement of connecting with others and letting go so energy is integral to our practice

124
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:21,899
but it's not the case that just more energy is better

125
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:30,060
right it's not like the end of the practice and it's not the beginning so just this recognition that as human

126
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:35,220
beings we have limited energy right we're not machines

127
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:41,579
and so it's not a case of just more more and more the kind of like this doggedly

128
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:47,060
pursuing something with all the energy that we have

129
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:54,480
but instead it's to use energy like in a wise Direction

130
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,000
and in a balanced way and I could do a whole other Dharma talk

131
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,019
and just how to keep balance but what I want to focus on a little bit is how can maybe it is a

132
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:13,860
form of balance but in particular how can we have this steadfastness have

133
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:21,300
this perseverance without getting too tight so

134
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:27,420
part of it is this recognition that our energy levels change

135
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:33,660
they change in seasons of our life they change in times of our life they

136
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:38,700
change during the day so just to recognize that of course

137
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:45,660
energy levels that we all have is not always the same and maybe to work with that and to honor

138
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:51,360
that and to respect that as opposed to insisting that our energy

139
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:57,720
be different or thinking that this practice is asking us to have

140
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:04,560
tremendous amount of energy it's not it's a it's asking us to work with the

141
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,720
energy that we have it's asking us to be Who We Are

142
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:15,300
with the life that we have so

143
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:21,720
not only are there like seasons and times that our energy changes but we can

144
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:28,500
also notice how if we're not quite like a battery

145
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:33,860
either or a fuel tank or something like this right that there's just this steady

146
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:39,000
diminishing of energy as the day goes on or something like this

147
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,220
it seems like I know for me you know this idea of battery when I was a kid

148
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:50,399
right I didn't think about batteries too much but these days like oh does my laptop have enough power does my phone

149
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:57,240
have enough power right we seems like we're often kind of like tuned into this idea what's the percentage on the

150
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:03,000
battery and it's kind of natural to think like oh humans are like that too

151
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,940
but we're not for example

152
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:15,180
this happened to me some time ago I was going to a public space to hear a

153
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:20,279
talk a Dharma talk and this was a

154
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:26,639
I was visiting some friends and we went together to this place so it's not anywhere here in California but

155
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:32,279
um the teacher was I don't know what it was exactly but I

156
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:39,180
could not stay awake you know it was one of these things that I didn't want my to embarrass my friends

157
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:44,220
and like okay okay okay like okay I've got to pay attention to this and the

158
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:50,459
room was kind of hot you know there's lots of excuses I could get afraid but my energy was like oh my gosh when is

159
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:56,279
this going to end maybe you've had this experience

160
00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:01,440
maybe with me right you know sometimes I have my my energy right when I'm talking

161
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:07,579
is not always uh always high maybe it's a little aside

162
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:13,678
here's like a True Confessions here I um I have been giving a Dharma talk

163
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,720
and I remember thinking to myself this is so boring

164
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:26,120
I'm bored these poor people they're bored like when is this gonna be over

165
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:31,320
what can I do you know so just this recognition right it'll have

166
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:36,960
it happens right right so here I am listening to start my target feeling like I really have no

167
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,000
energy trying to stay awake as it happens the Dharma talk did end

168
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,940
like oh okay where are we gonna go to dinner oh yeah well let's think about this if I also the energy comes up and

169
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:56,580
let's go here no I don't want to go there and what about this I've never tried this I've never been there and like the energy comes up right so it's

170
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:02,820
what often is happening in the mind that is affecting the energy level

171
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:08,400
is this something for us to just be aware of because often we might think I

172
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:14,280
don't have enough energy but there's a way in which maybe it's

173
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:19,799
true but maybe it's not true also and so for us to just be open to that

174
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:28,020
possibility so what are some ways that we can

175
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:34,679
practice with kind of sustaining our energy with a have some resolve some

176
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:42,299
determination some commitment some loyalty some devotion we might use this

177
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:47,539
kind of language to our practice one is

178
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:53,299
the practice needs to be meaningful for us

179
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:59,460
sometimes we can get into this habits I listen to Dharma talks on this day

180
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:04,980
that's because that's what I do but is there a way

181
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:12,179
that or I meditate at this time because that's what I do this is fantastic but is there a way

182
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:19,220
that we can also connect to a way in which it's meaningful for us

183
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:25,860
because without this meaningfulness it can start to feel like drudgery or

184
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:33,900
dryness or like okay here it is it's the morning I'm supposed to meditate and redo it but there isn't this juice to it

185
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:39,480
it becomes like a chore or something we're supposed to do so

186
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:46,620
is there a way that we can connect to what we love about the

187
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:52,620
practice what is something juicy about the

188
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:58,260
practice is there a way that something that we care about or something that's

189
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:05,400
important for us right this is this brings energy to our

190
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:13,980
lives you know things that are important to us meaningful for us so it's helpful to really think what is

191
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:21,360
Meaningful about this practice as opposed to this is what I'm supposed to do or I'm doing this in order that this

192
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,700
will happen can we connect to it in a way that feels

193
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:32,160
alive and for some people it is a little bit

194
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:37,679
of devotion or I know somebody I've mentioned this before who does meta

195
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:43,080
practice in the beginning of every sit just and they chant sometimes it's

196
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:48,679
silent sometimes it's in their head doing the meta

197
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:56,940
because it's uplifting but kind of like opens the heart in some kind of way

198
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:02,580
so maybe some chanting is Meaningful we don't do a lot of chanting probably here

199
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:09,780
at IMC we do I don't know maybe twice a year of each and it's not really something that we do

200
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:16,200
here but if this is something you're interested in the abayagiri website

201
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:22,799
and they have a chant book and recordings of the monastics doing some chanting including the meta chant which

202
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:28,740
is something that I myself have found really meaningful and I don't know I found like

203
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:35,520
hard opening I made a little recording on my on a CD

204
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:42,539
player I had to chat like over and over and over and over and over and over again and I just put that in my car and that's

205
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:49,520
how I memorized it just tearing it over and over again this may not speak to you

206
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:56,640
is there something about I don't know so it's like the Buddha and some sometime we had a parachara here

207
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:04,679
this idea of these people that found some freedom in their practice and they just

208
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:11,100
through pure generosity pure care for others shared it with others

209
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:16,679
and somehow I feel touched by that this feeling that there was the Buddha and

210
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:22,860
also parature a woman this recognized teacher that just shared it

211
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:30,059
so this is one way to connect to some meaningfulness but

212
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:36,380
also there's is there a way that there can be this heartfulness

213
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:45,419
for me also I'll say that I heard a a talk this was years ago actually at

214
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:53,280
one of these three month retreats where one of the teachers this is at the beginning of the three months said

215
00:22:53,280 --> 00:23:00,179
what would it be like if you'd dedicate it or

216
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:05,880
maybe dedicate feels too strong of a word but opened up the idea that your

217
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:13,320
practice helps others and recognizing that on a retreat that

218
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:22,140
long just and it's hard right there are six days weeks maybe months Maybe

219
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:29,340
when it's hard to get to the cushion but this recognition Okay my sitting

220
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:36,360
here maybe helps the person next to me the person behind me just knowing that

221
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:45,000
somebody else is meditating is helpful so I just started to say at the

222
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,120
beginning of my sits may this it be for the benefit of all beings

223
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,220
and for me that was meaningful this may feel a little too Airy fairy

224
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:02,340
woo-woo for some people it may feel too like I don't know that just doesn't make any sense to me

225
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:10,799
you don't have to do it but here's just an invitation to touch into what is something that would support you and

226
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:17,159
make it meaningful and maybe with some heartfeltness

227
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:23,880
make it you know the way in which there can be some enthusiasm or some joyfulness to this as

228
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,380
opposed to some drudgery

229
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:36,919
so there's also a way that we might think about practice

230
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:42,539
as I know I've said this expression a number of times and I sincerely believe this

231
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:47,900
finding our way to have a sustained effort

232
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:54,600
without tension without tightness without drudgery without like this sense

233
00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:01,260
of bearing down is an art I would say this is an art

234
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:06,360
and we only find it by getting out of balance sometimes

235
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:13,620
but and this is the art of practice really because sometimes it takes more or takes more energy and sometimes it

236
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:20,100
takes less energy but what if we were to consider this

237
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:26,340
practice as kind of like an art and what I mean by that is

238
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:31,679
sometimes I I don't like to talk about myself so

239
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,779
much but I'm giving just examples hopefully so that you all can find your own way

240
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:43,799
but here's another story of something that Diana does I like to play with paper it's kind of

241
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:51,840
like a craft and I like to make things with paper this is just something that I do on my own is something that's fun

242
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,600
it started something that my mom and I would do and you know so you know now I

243
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:04,500
do it I make cards for people or I make little things I just something that I do

244
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:10,260
but I love doing this and part of what I love about it is like I'll have these

245
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:16,440
pieces of paper that I'm kind of creating I'll like look at it and like um no that's not quite right that's a

246
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:23,940
little bit out of balance it needs to have something there and it's a little bit too heavy here and you know playing

247
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:29,820
putting things here and like oh now this looks good but now that doesn't so I'm

248
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:35,039
gonna put this in and you know the scrap that I threw away go back to the trash you know actually this might be just

249
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:41,460
what's needed and I put it here it's fun I just like to do that

250
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:48,240
what if practice were like that oh I'm just looking at this this feels a

251
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:55,080
little tight I'm gonna try to can there be a little bit of softening and

252
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:00,840
part of what is fun about this crafting that I do with paper is it

253
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:06,299
it's okay whatever it is I'm just giving myself over to it and there's a little

254
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:13,860
playfulness exploration without this idea that it has to be perfect or that

255
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:20,279
it has to be one particular way so what would it be like to consider our

256
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:25,440
practice like that like a sit as having some playfulness and this is

257
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:31,620
like an art we're creating something we're exploring

258
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:36,679
we're experimenting we're seeing what it is

259
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,900
this the downside of this is that we Tinker we do nothing but Tinker for our

260
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:49,679
entire practice and that's not helpful either but is there a way to think of it like

261
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:57,299
okay there's a the art of practice part of the art is some playfulness some

262
00:27:57,299 --> 00:28:01,620
exploration some experimentation

263
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:08,700
something else that is helpful to have this

264
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:14,520
I mean this sustained practice without this tightness or tension

265
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:23,778
is to recognize or believe that are our actions have consequences

266
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:30,480
of course we believe that right I mean when I say that I will say well of course they do

267
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:38,520
but there's also a way in which we might think it doesn't really matter if I

268
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:44,640
use my meditation time all fantasizing the whole time which you know we want to

269
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:52,440
do of course we want to do or it doesn't matter if I'm rehearsing um that way that that person hurt my

270
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:58,380
feelings and now I'm going to get back to them and this there's a way in which we might

271
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:04,220
think that it doesn't matter what we're doing

272
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:12,720
but it does of course it does there are a way that we spend our energy

273
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:21,059
has an impact on us it affects our moods affects the energy

274
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:27,240
level in the body it affects our habits which impact Our

275
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:32,340
Lives so it makes

276
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:38,100
a difference how we act and how we think

277
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:45,179
and what a difference our life is if we're willing to put a little bit of effort

278
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:51,179
towards doing some skillfulness um recognizing that things that are

279
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:58,500
unskillful unhelpful unwholesome do have an impact but can we recognize

280
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:03,960
it without you know getting judgmental about ourselves but just recognizing

281
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:12,179
that it's important to act skillfully to think skillfully

282
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:18,360
as best we can as best we can there's a way in which we might think oh

283
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:24,659
it doesn't really matter it does matter these minor Small Things what's

284
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:29,940
happening in our head nobody else knows about we might think that they're not important but

285
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:36,419
it it can be can it can make a difference it does make a

286
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:42,179
difference and there's this way here's another Diana's story

287
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:47,580
that um there was a time when I was really into yoga

288
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:53,520
and I couldn't explain to you why I liked yoga I was I was a research

289
00:30:53,520 --> 00:31:00,779
scientist at the time and I thought yoga was this weird thing somehow I felt better when I did it so I

290
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:07,620
kept on doing it and I had no aspiration it was kind of

291
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:13,380
like a secret thing I didn't want my other scientists friends that I was doing this weird thing

292
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:18,419
so I had no aspirations I was going to be a great yoga that I could do and he

293
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:24,360
poses better or anything like that I just noticed that I don't know I felt a little bit more connected to myself into

294
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:32,940
my life when I was doing this without meaning to with zero intention

295
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:39,480
I just got better at these yoga poses right because I was just doing them more

296
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:45,000
often I just started to notice like oh oh yeah I didn't used to be able to

297
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:52,740
balance that way but now I can so it's just this recognition that

298
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:58,380
we can things we can learn things even without

299
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:04,799
this tension of having wanting to and that we all of us have learned things in

300
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:11,940
the past of course right we've learned to tie our shoes we learned to cook we learned to knit we

301
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:17,700
learned to play tennis whatever but all those things we didn't we weren't able to do them at

302
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:25,940
the first time we had to just apply a little bit of persistent effort and we could do it

303
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:33,720
so maybe there's this um maybe there's a little bit more I could say here but

304
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:40,679
I think maybe I'll do a few more talks on this idea and I'm gonna I want to leave or end

305
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:49,100
today with um talking about squirrels and I've mentioned this on a talk before

306
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:58,080
maybe I'll just mention some of you might know that there's this um internet uh YouTuber person

307
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,419
named Mark Rober he's a scientists he's here in the

308
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:09,360
Silicon Valley he's a engineer I should say he's not as much a scientists as engineer he used to work at Nasa I used

309
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:14,820
to work at Apple I think he has the more YouTube views

310
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:21,000
than any other human and he teaches about engineering it's I just love this

311
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,220
kind of geeky stuff but he makes it a lot of fun as some of you might have seen this that

312
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:33,240
he um noticed that uh squirrels were stealing

313
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:39,480
the bird feed out of the bird feeder in his backyard so he thought well maybe I'm going to

314
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:46,500
make it a little bit I'm going to try to um engineer the bird feeder to make it so

315
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:54,480
that the squirrels wouldn't get it make it long story short he ends up creating the eight part ninja obstacle

316
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:01,860
course for squirrels and it's so cute and the squirrels figure out a way to do

317
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:09,720
it it's amazing how they jump over fly around you know all this kind of stuff to get to the bird feeder right so it's

318
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:15,658
I can recommend it recommend it see he's now gone to part three of the Ninja

319
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:23,520
obstacle courses so there's also this poem

320
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:32,099
the squirrel determination by Rosemary traumer this poem is called again again

321
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:38,040
and I want to think that Rosemary traumer has seen these uh YouTube videos

322
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:43,320
as she might have this was this poem was written at the end of 2020.

323
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:49,638
right still in the pandemic and the poem goes like this

324
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:57,900
on a day when the world asks too much of me and I don't know how to give it

325
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:03,119
I think of the squirrels at the feeder when I was a girl

326
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:08,640
dad hung the feeder on a squirrel proof wire

327
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,740
dad set the feeder on a squirrel proof Pole

328
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:20,700
squirrels found a way surely there's some squirrel in me

329
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:28,859
some chattering tenacity some bushy-tailed resolve I can't be courageous and brave then let

330
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:35,339
me at least be stubborn surely inside this aching heart is a

331
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:42,119
scamperer willing to try again to try again

332
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:48,480
to meet disappointment and failure and exhaustion and try again

333
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,140
again

334
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:59,220
squirrels found a way I'm not sure that I would use the word

335
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:05,940
stubborn but she's talking about kind of like this tenacity and you know determination

336
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:11,220
and I like this kind of way like squirrels right they they find a way so

337
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:16,440
maybe it's not straightforward or linear

338
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:22,740
but they just you know find a way

339
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:28,680
so maybe there's a way that we can find a way with our practice keep on coming back

340
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:34,380
in a playful way squirrels are a little bit playful or

341
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:39,660
with some heart feltness I don't know if squirrels have heartfeltness but can we

342
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:48,500
connect with this playfulness a sense of maybe it's a little bit of an art or some heartfulness or exploration or

343
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:56,160
experimentation or some attitudes like that to help support us on this journey

344
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:03,680
so I think with that I'll open it up to see if there are any questions or comments

345
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:10,040
about this idea of persistence or

346
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:17,359
sustained effort without tension or getting some tightness

347
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,579
so maybe Jim behind you

348
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:41,359
uh maybe in addition to finding that balance between

349
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:49,380
effort and relaxedness there's also the idea of just if you can which is hard

350
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:56,940
for me getting into a rhythm getting into a rhythm a rhythm of practice of daily practice yes a rhythm

351
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:04,619
can be really supportive but also there can be a way in which sometimes Rhythm gets a little bit dry too so the point

352
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:10,560
is like can we have some I like this word juiciness but I don't know if that's a good word or not

353
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:17,640
because there's a way in which people we can kind of get stuck we're just doing the same thing again and again

354
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:23,640
without yeah maybe stuck so a rhythm is

355
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:29,040
fantastic if it works and until it doesn't work does that make sense

356
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:35,040
oh yeah and um maybe what was the word you

357
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:42,900
um maybe an interestedness yes thank you like all this stuff going on in my mind

358
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:49,320
and body maybe it's not always good news but it's who I am and it means oh you

359
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:57,900
know evidence hey I'm alive it's it's interesting and in an edifying way yes absolutely an

360
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:04,380
investigation rate is one of the Awakening factors and it's one of the enlivening Awakening factors just as you

361
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:10,140
said yep yep some curiosity like wow what is this this is kind of a way that

362
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:17,940
we could be with them our experience yeah I need to remember all these points because I'm a hard case it's hard

363
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:25,500
for me to get into my daily practice Yeah right it's easy to kind of like fall into a pattern and maybe a is that

364
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:31,859
what you said that it's it's hard for um for me to get into a sustained daily practice so so I I'm

365
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:37,280
all these little tips I need to remember you're not the only one

366
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:43,680
right it's not natural I think for us to have a regular meditation practice it

367
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:48,680
definitely takes effort yeah thank you

368
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:06,540
um can you talk a little bit about on a three-month retreat

369
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:11,579
is the schedule Pace the same as

370
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:18,900
like a three-week retreat but just longer or essentially yeah the sits tend

371
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:24,240
to be a little bit uh longer if you the sits are longer there's more one hour

372
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:29,280
sits but that you can do a one hour set right after you've been sitting in a

373
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:35,520
while yeah so it's the same thing from same type of schedules it walks it walks

374
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:40,920
it walks it walks it walks it walk do any of you

375
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:46,260
but it's but you stay at the retreat center you don't leave the retreat

376
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:52,920
center come back like you don't you may not go outside but if some people go outside do they go

377
00:40:52,920 --> 00:41:01,500
out side and go away and come back or no IMS is um in particular is located a

378
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:07,680
little bit in the middle of nowhere but it's also in the middle of woods and there's all kinds of hiking trails so

379
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:14,339
people would go outside and sometimes that's a recommendation to move the body get the blood pumping and go out and see

380
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:19,560
some beautiful things that can you know uplift the heart and mind so yeah most

381
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:26,400
people go outside is it anticipated that people go

382
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:32,460
to that to those longer Retreats with

383
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:38,780
um a stated purpose or no

384
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:44,760
I know sometimes that IRC that they ask what your goal is

385
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:50,640
yeah um the expectation is that you would be

386
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:58,920
practicing like how we practice here so vipassana and insight so there's less of

387
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:05,339
um you're you're having to have a specific goal IRC does this more to kind

388
00:42:05,339 --> 00:42:11,339
of just give people the opportunity to reflect on what they're doing so that

389
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:17,760
they don't waste their time in some kind of way but a three-month Retreat is long enough is that you know there'll be time

390
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:24,180
whether you'll be feeling motivated and great and then you're like oh my gosh what am I doing here this is so long get

391
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:31,260
me out of here and then it comes back up and so there's these natural rhythms that happen so and I think what people

392
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:37,079
arrive maybe with one idea but you know while you're in week seven week eight

393
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:44,220
you know those ideas are you have different ideas then the first time you set that length of a

394
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:49,040
retreat did you have any apprehension about it

395
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:57,839
apprehension like how can I do this or yeah I just I'm afraid that I would go nuts

396
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:02,240
at some point yeah I went through

397
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:11,579
you know I can't remember this was now quite some time ago so I can't remember the for the first Retreat if I I'm sure

398
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:18,420
I did right it's not a normal thing to do right so of course I I must have been

399
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:26,160
and then after that once I realized what it's like but and to be sure that being on Retreat

400
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:31,560
for that long that duration the mind can touch places that you can't access on

401
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:36,660
shorter Retreats or in daily life so it definitely is uh

402
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:42,780
a different experience so the effort that you're making actually changes

403
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:49,700
day to day or week to week during the retreat right

404
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:57,780
um so one thing I'll say in a retreat container right that definitely supports right the bell rings so you go to the

405
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:03,960
hole [Music] um but the um

406
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:11,579
yeah right because it's like sometimes difficulties arise things that are hard like emotions are coming up or memories

407
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:18,060
are coming up they're difficult and it takes energy to like stay not you know get up and run out screaming kind of

408
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:23,520
thing I'm exaggerating but you know sometimes it feels like that like you know this is what happens on Long

409
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:30,300
Retreats of course stuff comes up of course so um and sometimes yeah it feels like

410
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:35,819
wow this is like I never want to leave you know and sometimes you're like get

411
00:44:35,819 --> 00:44:41,520
me out of here what was I thinking so yeah I guess maybe the energy changes

412
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:46,220
as that kind of experience changes

413
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:53,460
you're welcome okay so here we are at the top of the

414
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:58,859
hour so thank you all for your kind attention

415
00:44:58,859 --> 00:45:05,940
and we'll see you in the new year can you believe that it's going to be January

416
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:13,160
2nd I think it said Monday that will be here next so deep house deep house

417
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:16,040
thank you
