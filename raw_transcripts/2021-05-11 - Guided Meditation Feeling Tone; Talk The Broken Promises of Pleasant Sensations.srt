1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:07,759
good evening good evening and warm welcome warm welcome

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:17,119
so we'll start with a little bit of a guided meditation

3
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:24,880
and just settling into this moment

4
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,840
and taking a meditative posture

5
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,120
a posture that expresses dignity

6
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:49,920
and resolve maybe but as well as softness and kindness

7
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,680
so some uprightness but without stiffness or

8
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:17,359
rigidity and feeling into the posture

9
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:26,479
does it feel balanced

10
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:41,840
does it feel supportive for meditation practice

11
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,600
i'm tuning in to the experiences of

12
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:02,719
sitting here feeling the pressure of the

13
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,640
whatever it is you're sitting on against the body

14
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,800
so maybe if you're sitting cross-legged on the floor

15
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,840
the pressure against the legs and the buttocks

16
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,640
you're sitting in a chair

17
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,519
maybe different parts of the legs or if you're sitting on a bench or a

18
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,840
couch

19
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:50,000
feeling the connection between what we're sitting on in the body

20
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:04,080
we're grounded we're connected here here

21
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:11,360
and hopefully the pressure against the body is not unpleasant

22
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,400
it might be neutral maybe a little bit pleasant

23
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:36,080
i'm sitting here on i'm not sure why but i think there are three sabutons

24
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,440
three of the big cushions

25
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,840
it's very pleasant actually

26
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:25,199
tuning in to other sensations in the

27
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:33,600
body maybe more subtle

28
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,199
maybe not maybe there are some uncomfortable

29
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,840
sensations that are anything but subtle

30
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:56,160
maybe the sensations of breathing

31
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:04,320
the movements the body makes an association with breathing

32
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,840
the chest the belly

33
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:25,840
maybe feeling the air going in and out of the nose

34
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:49,199
one way to simplify our experiences

35
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:56,639
so that we don't get lost in thought so much or so that they don't create more suffering

36
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,319
more difficulties so one way to simplify

37
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,440
our experience

38
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:14,000
is just to notice the feeling tone

39
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:21,759
is this experience this sensation whatever it might be

40
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:31,840
is it pleasant or unpleasant or neither or we could say neutral

41
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:50,199
sometimes it's helpful to make a label use a label something like unpleasant

42
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:58,560
unpleasant unpleasant pleasant

43
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:06,960
unpleasant unpleasant pleasant

44
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:13,599
so something like this that whatever experience sensation

45
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:21,759
arises in the mind feeling into the the tone the texture

46
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,520
the flavor

47
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:41,839
these are the only three choices pleasant unpleasant neutral

48
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:55,040
if it feels like you're getting tangled up i'm not sure is this pleasant or

49
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:02,839
unpleasant or if you feel like you're playing whack-a-mole and like

50
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:08,000
really on the experiences

51
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,480
within slamming a label on them

52
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:19,839
is there a way that you might do this that is supportive

53
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:30,079
doesn't have to be super fast it doesn't have to be accurate so much it's just

54
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:47,839
simplifying our experience to the feeling tone

55
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:39,839
what might we learn about our experiences

56
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:48,000
if we apply these labels pleasant unpleasant neutral

57
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,839
what do we tend to notice the most

58
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,839
is the feeling turn long-lasting or fleeting

59
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:24,720
we don't have to judge it we don't have to figure it out or understand exactly why

60
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:35,600
those sensations are arising just keeping it very simple

61
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:49,839
if it feels tiresome don't have to do it all the time

62
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:48,640
so simplifying our practice by noticing pleasant unpleasant or

63
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:54,480
neutral there's a way in which there might be more ease

64
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:00,080
help us stop the tumbling into more and more suffering

65
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:06,320
and with more ease our life unfolds in a certain way

66
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:14,159
and in a way that allows us to have the bandwidth so to speak to

67
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:20,480
support others if we have more ease then we're more available not only to

68
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:26,000
take care of ourselves but to take care of others so may our

69
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:37,840
practice together be for the benefit of all beings

70
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:36,480
um so good evening again welcome

71
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:42,799
welcome wherever you are and whenever it might be sometimes it's

72
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:48,080
fun to imagine you know it might be listening to this years in advance

73
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:56,000
or years from now who knows who knows wherever you are whoever you are you're

74
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,039
very welcome here

75
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:08,399
so one thing i'd like to talk about tonight is feeling tone or

76
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:13,600
vedina is the polyword in the language that the

77
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:19,600
ancient literature is preserved in vedana and many of you probably know that it's

78
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:26,720
one of the foundations of mindfulness when we talk about the four foundations of mindfulness vedina is one

79
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:34,320
of them the second one and often when we talk about it or teach about it

80
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:40,320
which isn't that often more often it's about mindfulness of breathing or mindfulness

81
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:45,840
of the body or sometimes even mindfulness of the mind so the body's the first foundation

82
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:51,360
the mind is the third foundation vedana or feeling to feeling tone is in

83
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:57,600
the middle there in the second but often when we teach about it we don't really

84
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:05,440
unpack it or explore some of the depths or how it might be a support to practice

85
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:12,399
so we might just um see what happens if we take kind of like this thread and pull it a

86
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:19,519
little bit and see what gets unraveled so this thread of looking at the fade in a

87
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:25,760
feeling tone so often vedana is translated as feeling or

88
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:31,440
feelings but then it starts to feel like emotions or sounds like right we use the word

89
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:37,519
feelings for sad or lonely or hungry or

90
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:44,240
excited or something like that but rather feeling tone or

91
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:51,360
sometimes even sensation is um really what the buddha is pointing to here and over and over

92
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:58,320
he defines them as pleasant unpleasant or neither pleasant nor

93
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:05,760
unpleasant which we often just shoot shorten to neutral so feeling tone

94
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:11,839
has only three different flavors whereas you know emotions of course are

95
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:16,878
more complex and seems like there's an unlimited number of them

96
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:24,560
but feeling tone is is this sensation this experience

97
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:32,000
pleasant unpleasant or neutral pretty simple pretty simple it's

98
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,638
and we might notice if we um if we set um this is kind of our lens

99
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:44,079
through which we're looking through vedana looking through the all of our sensations

100
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:50,240
we're looking at feeling tone and this includes the seeing the tactile the

101
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:56,320
hearing as well as thoughts thinking remember in the buddhist tradition

102
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:03,920
thinking is one of the senses everything every experience without

103
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:11,359
exception every experience pleasant unpleasant or neutral

104
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:18,880
and so if we were to tune into this simple categorization of our experience so rather than giving

105
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:25,359
them labels about exactly what they are but just to notice the feeling tone whether it's pleasant unpleasant or

106
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:31,440
neutral it might seem dry or nitpicky

107
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:39,680
or reductionistic or i might have some of these ideas like why would i want to do that we might feel like it's

108
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:46,320
dismissive of the richness the fullness of our experience

109
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:54,160
but there can be times in which simplifying just a pleasant unpleasant or neutral

110
00:35:54,160 --> 00:36:01,440
can be a tremendous support sometimes when things are um difficult it can be a little bit

111
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:10,720
overwhelming or we feel lost or we feel confused or we just feel maybe lost confused

112
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:17,040
overwhelmed or the way that we feel and then just to simplify it down to pleasant

113
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:24,320
unpleasant neutral and this is a way that kind of can not only simplify things but also

114
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:30,480
like sharpens our awareness so instead of getting lost in story making

115
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:36,000
based on the experience that this uncomfortable experience of my knee

116
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:43,440
which reminds me of that bicycle accident that i had which reminds me that that person that i was cycling with

117
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:49,760
they didn't stop fast enough and you know all these stories we might have

118
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:55,359
so kind of simplifying down to this feeling tone kind of like snips in the bud some of the story

119
00:36:55,359 --> 00:37:00,480
making we might be having and it's just one way of looking at our

120
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,680
experience so there might be a time in which it's helpful and supportive to be

121
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:12,079
simplified things down to pleasant unpleasant and neutral and maybe there's other times when it's

122
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:17,680
makes more sense to feel the emotions but that's a different

123
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:23,760
practice so i'm just talking about one particular practice here

124
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,880
and so not only does it simplify our experience to do practice this way

125
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,400
but it helps create the conditions for more and more freedom and that's a little bit what i'd like to

126
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:40,320
talk about tonight because fade and i will notice

127
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:46,400
this is a is a key link that pleasant sensations create the

128
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,440
conditions for desire and clinging which then create the conditions for

129
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,720
suffering of course unpleasant sensations create the conditions for

130
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:05,040
dislike and aversion which is just another form of clinging and as a form of suffering

131
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:10,240
and neutral feelings also create the conditions for delusion that is just not quite connecting with

132
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:15,599
our experience at all and not even really being aware of it at all and

133
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:21,680
ignorance also leads to suffering so we can see how paying attention to

134
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:29,520
the feeling tone is a way in which if we could somehow interrupt this this connection

135
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:35,680
that goes from a pleasant feeling tone to craving to suffering as a way that in which we can diminish

136
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,720
our suffering so of course one of the messages that

137
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:47,280
the buddha was teaching was that the pleasures we seek no matter what those pleasures are

138
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,320
whether it's cookies or sexual encounters or

139
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:59,599
status enhancing experiences or something that

140
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:05,200
consumption online purchases or points in a video game whatever it might be

141
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:12,160
that some of these pleasant experiences they evaporate quickly i'm sure you've

142
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:17,520
noticed this and not only do they evaporate quickly but they leave us

143
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:23,200
thirsting for more this hedonic treadmill that even though we

144
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:28,640
might have some more pleasure pleasant experiences

145
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:34,160
then we kind of adapt to that and then we just want more and then we just want more and so we

146
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:40,000
never i shouldn't say never but we rarely are having this feeling of

147
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:47,119
contentment so we overestimate this is what human beings do we overestimate

148
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:55,839
how much happiness that pleasant sensations will bring us and how long the pleasant sensation will

149
00:39:55,839 --> 00:40:00,640
last so we keep on chasing after them

150
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:07,440
but if we look at what um kind of natural selection the psychology and

151
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:13,200
biology of a natural selection we'd say that this makes perfect sense that humans would do this

152
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:21,280
that they would overestimate how much happiness pleasant sensations would bring and overestimate how long that pleasant

153
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:28,079
sensation or the happiness would last because if we look at

154
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:34,560
natural selection then the original function of eve

155
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:42,160
evolutionarily speaking of even having pleasant sensations or even having unpleasant sensations

156
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:47,599
was just uh was to support organisms um approaching those things that are

157
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:57,359
helpful and avoiding those things that aren't helpful right so that we've inherited this um genetic code

158
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:04,560
that means that we have pleasant unpleasant and neutral sensations and the reason why we do this well maybe

159
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:10,480
i'll say this that natural selection um

160
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:17,440
that there was selection pressure for us to have these experience to have these sensations

161
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:22,880
so that genes could get into the next generation right

162
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:28,960
we wouldn't designed quote unquote natural selection isn't a designer but

163
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:35,680
i could say like the selection pressure wasn't for us to be happy

164
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:40,720
so much as get genes into the next generation

165
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:47,040
and it wasn't so much that we had to see everything clearly we didn't there wasn't so much selection

166
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:52,240
pressure for absolute perfect seeing things clearly

167
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:59,040
instead we can see that natural selection would say actually it's a little bit helpful to

168
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:05,359
have a certain amount of delusion so that there's our minds and that these

169
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:11,520
perceptions and beliefs that make it more likely that our genes will get into the next generation

170
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:17,359
right that's what we've inherited our genetic code from

171
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:23,920
so some of the selection pressure some of which natural selection is

172
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:31,440
designed again quote unquote is that achieving goals

173
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:39,040
that is goals of eating impressing peers having sex should bring pleasure

174
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:47,440
and that because humans tend to pursue things that bring pleasure and the pleasure pleasure

175
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:53,760
shouldn't last forever because if the pleasure didn't subside

176
00:42:53,760 --> 00:43:00,640
then we wouldn't seek it again and then we would just eat once and we would be satisfied

177
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:07,920
we would have sex once and then be satisfied never have to have it again we would uh raise our status in our

178
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:13,040
community once never have to do it again right

179
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:19,359
but then here's where the delusion part comes in and i'm getting these ideas from robert wright

180
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:24,560
in this book that he wrote why buddhism is true i think it's a very

181
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:31,280
interesting book i read it quite a number of years ago and i've just been looking at it recently again

182
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:36,880
and he's positing that not only is there selection pressure

183
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:43,520
that goals should achieve pleasure and that the pleasure should be should not be long lasting

184
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:49,760
but that there should be a little bit of delusion involved that organisms should focus on the

185
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:55,119
effect that pleasure will accompany the goal whatever it is that we want what we

186
00:43:55,119 --> 00:44:00,318
desire focus on the pleasure

187
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:06,560
and we should not focus on that the pleasure will dissipate shortly

188
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:13,359
after we've experienced it they're fleeting they're impermanent

189
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:22,319
so for those of you who are listening to the guided meditation i did earlier if we notice if we're looking at the

190
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:27,920
feeling tone we see it's changing or our mind is going

191
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:34,079
maybe from one feeling tone to the next the next but maybe we get on a jag where we're just noticing unpleasant

192
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:39,200
unpleasant unpleasant we tend to those tend to be a little bit more

193
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:47,200
compelling but we're also noticing that it's not like a constant sensation

194
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:55,839
so a little bit of this delusion is that we don't quite notice in our daily life and when we're

195
00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:02,160
pursuing what we desire we don't think about it and nor do we really notice

196
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:08,480
how short-lived pleasant experiences are and so this is another

197
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:13,520
way in which noticing vedana the feeling tone

198
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:23,119
can really be a support for us when we start to see oh this is really short lift it's impermanent

199
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:30,720
then we're less likely to really grab onto it identify it and make with um

200
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:36,000
make a um a whole story out of it or something like this

201
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,680
so we can practice with this regularly just noticing the feeling tone of our

202
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:46,960
experience either in meditation as we did in the guide meditation or we can do it in

203
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:53,119
daily life too it doesn't have to be linked there and we don't have to

204
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:59,040
analyze judge compare figure out why it's pleasant or

205
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:04,079
unpleasant or why we're noticing the pleasant ones and not the unpleasant ones or anything like

206
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:15,119
this we're just keeping it really simple pleasant unpleasant neutral

207
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:23,680
and so we often one thing that we will often notice is that um sometimes if something is

208
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:29,440
really pleasant or really unpleasant we

209
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:35,680
don't bring that into our meditative experience somehow we try to separate ourselves

210
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:42,079
from it in some particular way we will come out of minute if we're on

211
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:48,480
meditation something really unpleasant happens very often we shift our posture

212
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:54,640
or stop meditating or something like this that's one thing we might notice

213
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:01,920
something else that we might notice is that actually

214
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:08,480
it's the feeling tone that we are attached to or adverse to

215
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:14,800
rather than the objects that is we are attached

216
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:21,839
to we might think that we're attached to the fantasy that we're having or that we are averse

217
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:28,559
to the sound of the neighbor's dog barking or reverse to certain sensations in the

218
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:36,079
body but actually it's that we are more attached to

219
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:43,040
the pleasant feeling that's associated with the fantasy it's more that we are

220
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:48,240
repelled by the unpleasant that's associated with the uncomfortable

221
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:53,440
feeling in the body or the sound so it's a way in which we

222
00:47:53,440 --> 00:48:00,800
might get a little bit closer to what it is that's kind of pushing us around

223
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:09,520
but to also get back to the idea of the impermanence of what's the feeling tone of how

224
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:15,839
they're just fleeting the buddha of course recognizes and this is part of his teachings

225
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:24,240
but um i've i appreciate very much this short passage here where the buddha says

226
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:30,720
just as various winds blow in the sky winds from the east winds from the west

227
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:36,480
winds from the north winds from the south dusty winds dustless winds

228
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:44,880
cold winds hot winds mild winds strong winds all kinds of different winds so too

229
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:52,480
various feeling tones arise in this body pleasant feeling arises painful feeling

230
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:59,599
arises neither painful nor pleasant feeling that is neutral arises

231
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:07,359
so this can be a real support for us in our practice to notice that actually it's these

232
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:12,720
pleasant sensations that we are often getting tangled up in and then to

233
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:18,960
really notice how they are changing really changing

234
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:27,920
so but there's also the buddha talked more about the feeling tone and in

235
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:33,599
particular he talked about the kind of some of the delusion that we might have

236
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:40,559
that natural selection kind of primed us for is that we don't notice

237
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:47,440
maybe some of the unpleasantness of pursuing what we desire we're just

238
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:55,200
focused on what we desire the pleasant experience that we are imagining that we might have

239
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:02,800
and then to support this uh there's a few colorful similes that the buddha cave so this

240
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:08,720
simile of waking up after a dream of uh sensual pleasures we can imagine

241
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:14,559
what kind of dream this might be right but uh here he gives some specifics the

242
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:22,960
buddha he says suppose a person dreamt about lovely parks lovely groves lovely meadows

243
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:30,880
and lovely lakes and on awakening they saw nothing of it

244
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:36,720
so too a practitioner considers thus sensual pleasures have been compared to

245
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:44,960
a dream by the blessed one they provide suffering and despair while the danger in them is great

246
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:50,880
so that the suffering and the despair is that when we imagine that something that we really

247
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:58,960
want we might actually get it it doesn't quite it's not satisfying it's way or if it is

248
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:05,119
satisfied it's so short-lived so there's like these broken promises

249
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:11,119
that the pursuit of sensual pleasures or any just pleasant sensation

250
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:17,119
is these broken promises of how it's going to make us happy or how it will be pleasurable for a long

251
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:22,960
time or something like this there's a another colorful simile that maybe

252
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:28,880
highlights more the the despair associated with this

253
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:34,400
so that buddha says suppose a dog overcome by hunger and weakness was

254
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:39,920
waiting by a butcher shop these poor dogs right ones that if they

255
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:45,280
weren't pets then a skilled butcher or their

256
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:50,800
apprentice would toss the dog a meatless bone smeared with blood

257
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:56,800
what do you think would that dog get rid of his hunger and weakness by gnawing on this meatless

258
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:02,079
bone smeared with blood no venerable sir eventually that dog

259
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:09,680
would reap wariness and disappointment i can imagine my gnawing on a bone

260
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:14,720
trying to get some nourishment trying to get something satisfying out

261
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:20,319
of it and just not finding it i find this very evocative we have this

262
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:25,680
expression trying to get water from a stone

263
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:32,559
in the same way trying to get nourishment from things that can't be nourishing so in some ways some of

264
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:38,640
these things that we're pursuing aren't really nourishing but we find ourselves kind of like gnawing on them

265
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:44,720
anyway but i don't want to demonize you know

266
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:49,920
pleasant experiences or sensual pleasures it's part of the

267
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:55,920
human experience and of course it's also maybe i shouldn't say of course but it's

268
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:02,480
also part of the path of practice the buddha talked about that if not all

269
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:08,559
pleasant experiences should be avoided not all pleasant experiences

270
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:14,079
bring suffering and danger and specifically he pointed to the

271
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:19,839
pleasant experiences associated with behaving ethically the bliss of

272
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:27,200
blamelessness ana suka this

273
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:33,520
and paulie i just like saying that word anava jazuka so this is when we behave in wholesome

274
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:38,559
ways and we know that we don't have any

275
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:45,200
remorse or regret that we it didn't intentionally harm anybody it doesn't

276
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:53,520
mean that unintentionally we might have harmed ourselves or others but we really were practicing

277
00:53:53,520 --> 00:54:01,440
non-harming to the best of our ability without any little uh

278
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:08,000
like footnotes like yeah okay well i had to tell that lie or um

279
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:14,319
i didn't i don't know what it might be but when we have this bliss of blamelessness to know that

280
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:21,280
our behavior is appropriate that's a good feeling that's a good

281
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:26,400
feeling to not have remorse not have regret

282
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:32,240
and just by maintaining the basics of ethical conduct

283
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:41,920
and not only the bliss of blamelessness but also mindfulness itself can be experience of

284
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:48,160
happiness or can be a pleasant experience because when we're mindful that is when

285
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:54,559
we kind of have this certain arriving and experiencing the present moment

286
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:59,839
at that time that's we're not caught up in reactivity or

287
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:05,280
there's not a proliferation of thoughts of this thought train where we're

288
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:11,119
building on and then this and then that and then that you know this big complicated story

289
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:18,839
those are involved are not associated with some settledness and

290
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:24,880
ease but instead if we can be mindful it can bring a certain amount of ease

291
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:30,799
and subtleness it's subtle but there can be this little bit of joy

292
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:38,079
even ah yes okay i'm here and at this moment i'm still

293
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:45,119
breathing and things are okay at this very moment you know it doesn't

294
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:50,559
mean everything's perfect and i don't want to be a pollyanna but being mindful

295
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:55,680
may probably you've noticed this otherwise you wouldn't have a regular meditation practice right

296
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:03,040
if you haven't noticed sometimes that there is this ease and this pleasant sensation associated with it

297
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:09,200
and part of what's nice of um really noticing the happiness or the pleasant sensations associated

298
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:14,960
with mindfulness is that this subtle happiness of being in the present moment actually can be

299
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:20,079
aroused at any time it doesn't have to be just when we're on the meditation

300
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:25,359
cushion all it requires is just kind of turning

301
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:33,520
towards our experience like what's happening right now and then just remaining aware of

302
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:38,880
that experience it can be done at the same time as everything else we're doing

303
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:44,319
it doesn't have to be separate so this is a pleasant sensation a

304
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:51,599
pleasant experience that we can bring with us all day every day

305
00:56:52,720 --> 00:57:00,079
then another pleasant experience that the buddha brought in and some of you might be familiar with

306
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:06,160
this is that um before the buddha was the buddha that is

307
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:11,520
when he before his awakening when he was practicing to become awakened

308
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:18,400
the tradition holds there's this story that he remembered when he was a young

309
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:25,440
boy that there was this pleasant meditative experience that he had

310
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:32,559
and then he has after the memory of that comes to his mind he asks himself why am i afraid of a

311
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:38,400
type of happiness that is apart from sensuality and unwholesome states

312
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:45,280
and this was the turning point for him that enabled him to meditate and become

313
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:50,799
awakened so this recognition that he doesn't have to be afraid of this

314
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:58,400
type of happiness or pleasant sensation maybe i'll say he's an aside sukkah

315
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:04,400
it's the opposite of dukkha it's and sometimes it gets translated as happiness and sometimes it gets

316
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:09,599
translated as pleasant sensation and usually it's whether the context of

317
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:15,599
how we um translate it so the buddha asks himself why am i

318
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:22,000
afraid why do i of this type of pleasant sensation that is apart from sensuality and

319
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:29,440
unwholesome states so this is how we can practice

320
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:36,079
can practice notice feeling tone again including noticing pleasant

321
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:41,839
sensations it's part of our human experience that we are of desire

322
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:48,240
and chasing after pleasant experiences this is natural selection created the conditions

323
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:55,920
in which we all do this is part of the human experience but then we can ask ourselves is this

324
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:01,760
helpful or not helpful pursuing this pleasant sensation

325
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:09,039
does it lead to more freedom or less freedom does it lead to more ease or less ease

326
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:17,520
and if we might find that just simplifying down to actual the feeling tone might be a way in which

327
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:22,960
we can simplify it and not get carried away and

328
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:28,720
might bring it into whatever it might be can bring it into something that is more satisfying

329
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:36,160
brings more happiness even though it is fleeting even though it is not the greatest

330
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:42,000
happiness because awakening of course is the biggest happiness

331
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:49,920
maha happiness mahasuka so vadena feeling tone and pleasant

332
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:56,720
sensations can be a really rich place for practice

333
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:03,920
and may our practice with feeling tone help us find more ease and may it support us

334
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:12,160
in supporting others thank you
