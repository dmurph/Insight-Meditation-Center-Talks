1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,919
welcome everyone I'm definitely getting my tech lessons this

2
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:14,920
week um and I'm delighted to have your input that you can see and hear me so welcome back to our practice this

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:21,800
week of supporting the growth of samade for ourselves we're taking a little extra

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:27,560
time to practice the steps that Gil has already taught us and we're giving uh

5
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:33,040
ourselves a little longer sitting in the these mornings to allow more time in

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:39,960
silence for independent Discovery one of the ways Gil offered to

7
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,960
settle the mind was by attending to inhalation and exhalation with that

8
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,840
process of being with the sensations of breathing uh following them very

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,280
thoroughly in the foreground and then counting with each breath or each half

10
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:05,080
breath in the periphery in the background just as a way to keep the Mind present and free of

11
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:13,479
distraction a simple settled mind a still mind inclines towards

12
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:18,799
somebody so the settled quality is encouraged by a couple of

13
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:25,320
wholesome qualities of mind that are considered virtues uh in the poly language they're

14
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:32,600
called parami some of you have worked on these so one is

15
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:38,520
patience which I've come to think of as infinite patience because that was

16
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:44,159
something that uh really stuck with me that the teacher Annie nent said on a

17
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:51,079
long retreat that I took at IMs years ago infinite patience and I still feel

18
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:58,840
that phrase echoing inside me uh because the way I am living I'm happy to

19
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:05,640
continue to cultiv at some for as long as I have it's a beautiful practice it's an

20
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,640
interesting practice watching it unfold and it really does help to be

21
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:18,640
patient um I once inherited a healthy Ficus benjamina plant from a colleague

22
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:26,280
and it continued to thrive so well in my waiting room that it was growing along the ceiling so I read about taking a

23
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:33,519
cutting from a plant and starting a new plant and I took a/4 inch little Branch

24
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:40,000
about 4 in long and planted it in soil and then I watered it as

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,239
directed so week by week I watered and watered and by about the sixth week I

26
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:53,040
suddenly stopped and thought wait is this crazy I'm watering this stick and

27
00:02:53,040 --> 00:03:00,400
nothing is happening should I keep watering so I didn't really know

28
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,840
but I for whatever reason I continued to water the stick and within a week a tiny

29
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,920
beautiful little green leaf appeared and then another and another and it grew

30
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,799
into a very healthy plant what was really interesting about that process

31
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:25,440
was I didn't have to know why it was that I continued to water see seemingly

32
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,360
nonsensically or I didn't need to solve it as a problem I just kept

33
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,040
watering so the kind of patience we sometimes need to bring well I certainly

34
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:43,319
need to bring to cultivating samade is a frame of of mind that is not only

35
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:51,360
patient but it's also willing to not know it's okay not to know what will

36
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,720
happen with somebody or when it will happen in fact it's better not to know

37
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,120
because if you know you're being driven by Concepts and ideas and that will not

38
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,400
result in somebody it's also a state of mind that

39
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:14,000
cultivates another of the virtues called parami and that is resolve or

40
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,720
persistence but this is a very gentle quiet kind of resolve it's not a

41
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,040
demand it's not a should it's not striving and

42
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,680
pushing it's just a willingness to keep coming back again and again without a

43
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,919
lot of flap so I'll share something that might sound a little

44
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:45,400
strange but the way that these virtues have worked for me is not by doing a

45
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:51,759
lot actually all I've done is whispered those phrases or a phrase when I've

46
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,759
needed it so when I've needed it infinite

47
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:03,520
patience or not knowing just at a challenging moment or

48
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:10,960
a moment I'm perplexed or gentle resolve and just by saying those things

49
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:18,199
just by Whispering that phrase in the mind the mind seems to settle

50
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:24,400
itself I find it's more settled in general at the start and then continues

51
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:32,240
to settle by returning to that Stillness and allowing whatever wants to unfold to

52
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,840
unfold so being okay with unpleasant things coming up or other things than

53
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:46,039
what we're practicing coming up patience infinite patience not knowing and just

54
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:55,199
continuing to be with the practice so with that we'll turn to the lightly guided

55
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,199
meditation

56
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:10,479
giving yourself time maybe for those settling

57
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:31,199
breaths and certainly for noticing how you are as you begin this meditation

58
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:38,720
are there any qualities of Mind any little phrases that are allies that you

59
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:45,000
think would be helpful to your practice feeling free in this practice

60
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,400
to very quietly coach yourself with a tiny whisper in the mind of any of these

61
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:58,080
things or things that are useful to you infinite patience

62
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,280
quiet

63
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:24,240
persistence and if words are too much at any time simply

64
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:31,520
radiating the intention feeling it almost physically

65
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,000
in the heart in the mind in the

66
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,800
body and also offering yourself encouragement with some good will to

67
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,919
begin the practice either with silent words in the

68
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:56,520
mind or again just radiating some of these

69
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:01,280
intentions may I be well

70
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,560
may I be free of all

71
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:34,599
harm may I receive experience with

72
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:57,160
patience may I allow myself not to have to know what is going to happen or when

73
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,000
it's going to happen

74
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:20,760
may I practice with gentle resolve

75
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:47,839
settled resting in Stillness may I be free of

76
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:54,800
dissatisfaction of stress of suffering

77
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:22,360
taking whatever time you need to relax the body and mind settle

78
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:30,680
it or bring ease to any area that cannot be relaxed reled or is

79
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,680
preoccupying

80
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,720
you coming gradually into

81
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:56,240
awareness of that quiet quiet deeper place

82
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:03,200
within and Gra gradually allowing yourself to turn

83
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,560
to following present with all of the

84
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:14,720
movements of breathing as the inhalation

85
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,680
arises travels through the

86
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:30,959
body as breathing pauses whenever it does that

87
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:36,760
and with the exhalation following the sensations of

88
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:41,680
breathing out the rise and

89
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,360
fall the expansion and

90
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:05,320
contraction returning again and again to Stillness

91
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:23,600
quietness resting in the Stillness in the quiet of following the

92
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,240
breathing in breath

93
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,160
out

94
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:53,079
breath using counting of the breath as a support your ability to keep the

95
00:12:53,079 --> 00:13:00,360
breathing the sensations of breathing in the foreground fully aware

96
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,600
of the

97
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
movement

98
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,079
e e

99
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:41,839
if other experience arises in the mind meeting it as you would kindly meet

100
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:50,160
a friend coming alongside of it with awareness for a few moments and then

101
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:56,079
gradually turning the attention turning awareness back to

102
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:03,639
being with the breathing and perhaps bringing in

103
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:07,199
counting the half

104
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:16,440
breath whatever keeps you present in the foreground with breathing the sensations

105
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:23,199
of breathing it doesn't matter how many times you have to come

106
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:30,959
back just keep bringing awareness very gently back

benefit any moments of quiet

144
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:20,919
any virtues that you're developing allowing those to be

145
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:28,280
embodied so that you bring a level of peace and calm

e for

157
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:32,359
as we continue with learning what supports the cultivation of

158
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:39,560
somadi we have this continued opportunity as well today to practice

159
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:45,079
mindfulness during daily life every time we

160
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:51,040
remember we can notice what kinds of mental activity we're engaged in at any

161
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:58,200
moment we come back to awareness and see whether it increases

162
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:05,319
impatience or encourages patience see what disturbs the mind and

163
00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:11,599
what settles it what agitates it what gets it preoccupied or

164
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:19,440
ruminating ah thank you I will try to speak up oh I know what I've done I made the same mistake the other

165
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:25,720
day I forgot to turn original sound off so thanks for the reminder about

166
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:30,880
volume so as to go through the day practicing mindfulness sometimes aided

167
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:40,160
by others helping us remember um noticing during the day what is bringing

168
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:46,560
about uh the qualities that are not helpful or the

169
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:51,960
um Tendencies of mind that are less helpful and what things are supporting

170
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:57,839
the Tendencies of mind that are wholesome and helpful to you

171
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:05,599
one form of uh cultivating somat and settling is what I mentioned in these

172
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:13,000
first comments this morning naming what's happening making a mental note if it's

173
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:19,400
un wholesome no problem just make a mental note and sometimes that is part

174
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:26,119
of or sometimes it's enough of a reminder to help the Mind turn back and

175
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:32,119
align with what more helpful so if we can say to ourselves ah wanting is

176
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:37,200
arising I so want I so want to strive for

177
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,640
somebody okay that sort of helps the mind go does striving

178
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:50,599
help maybe not so naming what's happening mentally is very

179
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:57,720
helpful impatience or patience and then maybe using phrases like patience that

180
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:04,040
are helpful to you you'll find the ones that are helpful to you not knowing when

181
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:10,520
or how this is going to evolve come to fruition we don't need

182
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:17,480
to know that actually it won't help to know it because we'll try to shape it and that won't

183
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:22,920
work so this practice of naming things has worked amazingly well for me in

184
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:30,960
daily life and in meditation so sometimes when I've been sitting I've noticed when a particular

185
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:38,079
trend of Mind comes up and I can name doubt or comparing

186
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:45,560
mind or trying to push something away just by saying that to myself I can

187
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:52,040
feel oh I need to turn back or I don't even have to try it just sometimes

188
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:57,880
starts the Mind back towards what's more helpful of course not every state of mind

189
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:05,480
not every hindrance is going to respond to that sometimes we're so entangled we're so deeply into it already that

190
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:11,240
it's going to take some strength of mindfulness to come back to the

191
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:18,839
recognition of what we're thinking and uh questioning the thinking is this really helping me and often to make the

192
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:27,480
shift from the thinking from the tangle down into the body feeling the impact of that and

193
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:34,240
maybe breathing in and out of the impact noticing what isn't

194
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:39,520
working being patient with that even taking the time if you catch yourself

195
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:46,319
after a period of being caught no problem you've caught it you've noticed it and over time this will start to

196
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:52,520
unwind and relax these conditioned Tendencies of

197
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:59,920
Mind a clean conscience a mind that doesn't have the burden of

198
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:05,760
knowing that it's done anything harmful to oneself or to others really is

199
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,800
another support for settling in

200
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:16,880
Soma the eight-fold path practices that the Buddha offered are really wonderful

201
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:22,800
ways to come to wholesomeness in your life to resolve conflict and to become

202
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:29,000
more peaceful if you haven't learned those eight-fold path practices IMC

203
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,440
offers a program every year that's available on zoom and in person for

204
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:40,640
those who are living closer to Redwood City um that supports it usually you can

205
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:45,680
sign up for it in July or August and it starts in September and runs through May

206
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:50,880
so you can support yourself with these practices and learn more wholesome more

207
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,720
ethical Ways to Live

208
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:10,440
as the Mind becomes more settled it's easier than to detect a

209
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:18,400
ripple of what isn't helpful earlier on to catch it and we are already

210
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:25,400
cultivating many of the qualities I mentioned today simply by what we're doing turning the attention to the

211
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:31,000
breathing to the inhalation and the exhalation again and again quietly

212
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:36,440
counting in the background those are actually cultivating patience the more

213
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:41,839
we see oh it worked a little bit I am feeling a little more collected than I

214
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:46,920
did at the beginning of the sitting or day by day there's just a tiny bit of

215
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:54,480
shift noticing that is building resolve quiet persistence it's working I want to

216
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:01,240
continue with this and another thing that helps which we'll

217
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:06,559
get into more tomorrow is noticing is noticing this benefit is noticing

218
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:12,880
anything wholesome that's coming from this so again today the

219
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:18,359
invitation is to practice stronger mindfulness every time you remember

220
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:23,800
throughout the day notice what's happening with the mind and also to

221
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:29,040
maybe take a few minutes at a time out of the day when you remember to check in

222
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:37,040
with the breath check in with any internal quiet that is also there and as

223
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:43,079
I've been doing all week at 4 o'clock today I'll offer a silent 20 minute
