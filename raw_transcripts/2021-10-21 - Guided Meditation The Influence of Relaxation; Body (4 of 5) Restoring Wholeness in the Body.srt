1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:06,560
so hello everyone

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,879
and

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:21,279
welcome and to take a moment to just kind of relax settle back

4
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,199
getting ready for this meditation

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:35,039
and um one of the

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:42,160
ways of helping support an ongoing mindfulness a continuity of awareness

7
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:49,039
through the all the arisings of things in the present moment

8
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:56,320
is sometimes you want to be aware of what's happening

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:03,840
but also be aware of the influence that has on us and the ongoing impact

10
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,560
and um and so some of it's a little bit getting getting out of the detail of whatever is happening but also aware of

11
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:17,439
the way the influence the impact the the way it lingers in us for a while

12
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:23,680
and so for example with tension it's possible to be aware of tension

13
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:31,040
and also to take time to feel what the influence of tension is in us in us how does it spread out from us and

14
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,079
what uh how does it affect our mood or affect our feelings how does it affect

15
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:42,799
the area around the place where there's tension how might it affect the mind

16
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:50,320
but for today i want to emphasize something a little different and that is when we relax

17
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:57,040
that to be aware of what what's what

18
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:03,280
replaces the relaxation or what influence the relaxation has

19
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,280
so it's one thing to relax the hand and that feels good but then to really stay

20
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,520
and be really aware of that good feeling oh that's how it is kind of like you take

21
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:22,640
it in be aware of it let it register more deeply and so as we relax

22
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,760
uh the body the to be aware of the vitality the

23
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:34,160
aliveness the peacefulness how things get lighter how things become settle down release

24
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:40,400
um if we feel the goodness of it the wholesomeness the the niceness of

25
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,879
what happens once we have relaxed it it doesn't have to be dramatic it can be quite subtle

26
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:52,560
but uh that does a few things one is it keeps us in the process of mindfulness of

27
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,879
awareness and also it the benefit of what's wholesome can

28
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:05,680
register more deeply in us it has a deeper a good influence on us if we do it that way

29
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:12,640
and the opposite happens with taking in the influence of tension it isn't that we

30
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,000
unless we react to it isn't that we feel worse it actually lightens things up it

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,200
kind of loosens and opens the space a little bit so

32
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:30,000
and that's also this idea of being aware of the influence sometimes it's quite nice to do that on

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,720
the end of the exhale the exhale is a kind of a letting go and then with that letting go

34
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:43,760
is there any good feeling or lightness or openness or

35
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,959
kind of the absence of things it feels really nice it doesn't always the case sometimes the

36
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:55,280
end of the out breath can be a little bit frightening and uncomfortable but if it is nice

37
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:03,360
take it take some time to really moment to feel that before the in-breath begins

38
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,920
so um to

39
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,560
assume your meditation posture and

40
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:24,280
to gently close your eyes

41
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,360
and in a moment take just one long slow deep breath in

42
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:42,720
and one relaxing long exhale and then feel what the impact that

43
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:49,320
exhale has on you so go ahead

44
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,880
then do it again and on the exhale relax your body

45
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,320
and take a moment to feel the influence the impact of that relaxation

46
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,120
what's left in the body that's maybe feels nice

47
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,000
taking a deep breath in and relaxing as you exhale

48
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,240
and then to let your breathing return to normal

49
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,680
but then continue relaxing on the exhale

50
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:04,880
and if you're able to relax these different parts of the body take in the feeling that's there

51
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:13,440
that comes from having relaxed so relaxing the muscles of the face

52
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:26,160
the eyes around the mouth

53
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,680
the lips are pressing against each other let them fall away from each other a

54
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:40,240
little bit or if they gonna touch touch lightly

55
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:54,039
on the exhale relax the shoulders

56
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:14,160
and then relax the chest and if it releases a bit

57
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:21,560
settles a bit feel that influence on you

58
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:42,080
and relaxing your belly soften the belly

59
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,039
and if anything feels nice about the soft relaxed belly

60
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,639
feel that

61
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:08,319
and if there's any way that you're bracing yourself with your whole body maybe a little bit

62
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:18,319
braced on the exhale let go let go of it let go of some of it

63
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,160
and feel how that's like

64
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,279
and as we settle in meditation the body settles and relaxes

65
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,519
the mind settles a bit and calms

66
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,080
feel the resulting

67
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,440
way in which it is what it's like to be alive the energies the feelings the sensations

68
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:12,480
of the body that seem to

69
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,600
come with a deeper subtleness

70
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,959
a relaxation

71
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:38,160
allowing like all your pores to be open to receive and feel

72
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,000
the aliveness of the body

73
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,480
and then in the middle of it all

74
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,959
being aware of breathing in and breathing out

75
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:26,800
as you exhale letting go of your thoughts and letting go into

76
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,720
the body breathing

77
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,480
so

78
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:25,039
letting go of your thoughts in opening up the body

79
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:30,640
to receive the vitality the animated qualities of the

80
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,640
body

81
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,960
allowing the bodies feeling sensations energies

82
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,720
to flow through you with the idea that

83
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:56,400
they blend together to become a whole a harmonious and peaceful

84
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:02,919
hole of vibration buzzing

85
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:12,760
that in a sense the body receives allows

86
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:38,400
and then to feel the body again what's the effect on the body

87
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:46,240
from having meditated these minutes what has shifted in your body

88
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:53,440
is there any influence of any calm calm or relaxation

89
00:26:53,440 --> 00:27:00,360
that's happened and what is that influence on your body

90
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:14,799
and rather than feeling it from the control tower to allow yourself to feel that influence

91
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:23,720
let the body feel it more fully body receives is a mixed space

92
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:42,559
in a sense body space the space of the body can become bigger feel bigger have more

93
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:48,480
room in it and it's easier than to

94
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:55,278
have room for all the challenges of life

95
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:04,559
smaller more contracted the body is the less room we have to respond deal with

96
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,200
process the difficulties of life

97
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:19,200
so to relax into your body

98
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,840
relax your body

99
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:38,399
and turn your attention outward into the world

100
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:44,440
whilst keeping yourself grounded and centered in your body

101
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:53,760
and gently modestly wish well on the people in your life

102
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,279
gaze upon them kindly

103
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:08,520
stay calm and gaze upon the world kindly

104
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:23,279
learn from your meditation practice how to be present for others

105
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:30,159
in an open stable way where there's a room for what's happening

106
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:35,360
without getting caught in it or reacted to it

107
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:44,000
so you can gaze upon it all kindly caringly

108
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:51,279
there's a way in which we care for the world which is a simple

109
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:57,679
expression of the freedom that comes from the

110
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:06,080
meditation whatever ease or calm or freedom we have

111
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:13,120
whatever way that that gives birth to a care and a kindness

112
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:21,279
let that care and kindness spread out from you into the world with these words

113
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,520
may all beings be happy

114
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,559
may all beings be safe

115
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:39,760
may all beings be peaceful

116
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:48,679
may all beings everywhere be free

117
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:20,240
so yesterday's topic for mindfulness of the body was respecting the body

118
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:28,960
and respecting the body is partly also respecting the uniqueness of our own body and its needs

119
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,600
there's all kinds of conditions physical conditions challenges in the body

120
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:41,120
that um you know are challenging to be with and

121
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:47,760
and to gaze upon that kindly to be have compassion to respect

122
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:54,720
the body for what it is and to learn how to take care of it how to care for this wonderful body that

123
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:01,519
we have challenging bodies and uh the care that we want to live

124
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:08,000
from in buddhist practice extends to ourselves as well and so

125
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:14,240
part of what mindfulness of the body can do is as we get more attuned to our body

126
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:21,360
we can better kind of feel what supports it and what debilitates it what's healing for it or

127
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:26,799
helpful for it how to best the best posture the best way of being with

128
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:33,440
whatever is going on in our body and i think the first time i came across

129
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:40,720
someone who was doing this was when i was a news end student a long time ago

130
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:46,640
and there was a woman who had uh some kind of knee issues serious knee

131
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:53,840
issues she'd been a runner and and um and she used her um

132
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:59,440
her attention they to details attention to her body she was learning through zen practice

133
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:06,640
to learn to walk in a new way and she'd fight finding to try to find exactly the right play to angle for her

134
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:13,760
feet and how to come down and put her weight and with that she found a way to walk that for her

135
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:19,600
situation that prevented her from or meant that she didn't have to go for

136
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:25,760
surgery i don't know what happened to her in the long term but i do know that

137
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:31,760
partly i think that inspired her and she went on to become a doctor so this

138
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:38,559
this you know care to the body and really what is what's the right thing for the body how to be

139
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:45,919
you know i've had a bad back various times in my life and i found it to be an exquisite time for mindfulness

140
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:51,679
because it was such a strong feedback loop between the slightest little move which was hurt

141
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:58,080
or kind of relieved it and so it's right there to stay and be aware so this mindfulness of the body and

142
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,760
respecting the body can give us the information to guide us to find a way to live with this body

143
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:09,440
more caringly and then wisely

144
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:15,040
and also one of the things that can happen as we practice is that there

145
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:21,200
there can be a restoration of a sense of healthiness or vitality or

146
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:26,878
or harmony in the body as we do this practice that it's not just the practice of

147
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:32,960
letting go but the letting go is a process of becoming whole

148
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:38,878
a process of not excluding anything and we can feel that little bit um

149
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:44,158
what i'm trying to say here is um if we get settled and relaxed in

150
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:49,200
meditation somewhat calm and a some we start thinking about

151
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:56,320
something that has some tension in it uh and we feel ourselves sensing up

152
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:02,240
and it can be com at some point it becomes really clear that following the tension getting

153
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:08,640
involved in that tension tensing up even more is detrimental it's not interesting

154
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:15,040
and it's in more interesting to not do it and so to relax to settle back

155
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:20,880
to come back to that more relaxed state and partly the motivation to do so is we see

156
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:26,160
so clearly the disadvantages of tensing up

157
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:32,240
as we see it just starting us this tensing starting to happen we let go and come back

158
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:38,560
so that's a little bit of a kind of a negative motivation it's also possible to have a more

159
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:44,640
positive motivation that as we let go we start feeling the benefits of that in

160
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:51,280
the body and it feels so good to feel this way to feel whole to feel subtle for the

161
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:57,040
inner life to feel peaceful or calm or settled harmonious

162
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:03,839
and um and you can feel how when we start getting tense or preoccupied about something the whole sometimes the whole

163
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:09,440
physical system um starts to lock up or get a little bit tighter the micro muscles some of the

164
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,640
micro muscles in the body tighten up or there's a disconnection

165
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:20,960
we lose touch with the body i mean it's quite dramatic you know maybe some of you had this experience of

166
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:27,280
minding your own business meditating calmly and the mind suddenly releases some memory of

167
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,560
you know from the teenage times and you know some

168
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:39,280
some difficult event that happened and and turns out there's still some charge

169
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,960
around it and and i have to have it happen to me and this suddenly this energy in the

170
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,079
body kind of you know like gets goes upright and i get tense and

171
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:56,079
and the energy flows into my mind and i'm thinking and having conversations about what happened and

172
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:01,680
reviewing it and i've lost touch with my body i lost touch with a settled and calm

173
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:07,599
body and and so it's quite dramatic to see that

174
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:13,359
movement and it's an education about how easily it is to disconnect from the body

175
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:19,200
and as we develop mindfulness we're developing body fullness developing capacity to

176
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:27,119
feel and sense the body not only so we don't tense it but the absence of tension gives rise to

177
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:33,280
feelings of healthiness or harmony or wholeness that can even be there

178
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:38,960
when there's the body's ill or or there's pain or there's different

179
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:45,760
things happening in the body there are challenges in the body there's a whole it's a there's a different kind of energy a

180
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:52,160
different kind of attentiveness in the body that is peaceful

181
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:58,720
calm holistic sometimes even cozy that seems to spread and open and

182
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:04,880
suffuse the body a gentleness that has space

183
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,480
to hold what's difficult that's there as well so we're not preoccupied and caught by

184
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:17,200
the difficulty but the awareness is holding it more widely and it isn't just the mental awareness

185
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:24,000
but there's also kind of a bodily awareness that can hold it and the remarkable thing is the body can

186
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,839
start feeling like it has lots of space some years ago i went to a cadaver lab

187
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:37,200
to spend some time looking at cadavers and um i was surprised how all the

188
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:43,680
organs was all squeezed in there and like there was almost no space in there um because everything was

189
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:50,000
packed with these different organs and uh and why would surprise me is that when i sit and meditate

190
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:58,480
um i feel like there's lots of space in my cavity lots of space in uh in my torso

191
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,920
and just that space gets bigger and bigger as i sit and quiet and sometimes that space feels like it has no

192
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:09,839
boundaries just opens up and so the the the ex way we experience

193
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:15,040
the body uh can be different than what's actually there because what we're doing is

194
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:20,079
experiencing the the it's the is the experience of the body

195
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:27,119
that's the medium through which we're really creating room and space to be able to hold everything

196
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:34,560
not to deny anything but to make more room for it and and as things have more room they

197
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:40,800
have more room to move more move to unfold more more room to relax

198
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:46,640
but also some things are are healthy that they flow begin flowing more

199
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:52,720
and um and so this restoration of uh

200
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:59,040
with the body of having mindfulness support a restoration of healthiness a restoration of

201
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:04,400
a flowing energy a restoration of of um of um

202
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:10,560
kind of a spacious calm in the body that can hold the challenges that we have

203
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:17,040
and and the wonderful thing is as we have more space we have then more capacity to be with

204
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:24,560
difficulties and one of the great contributions of buddhist practice is to expand our capacity

205
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:30,720
to be with challenges expand our capacity to be uncomfortable expand our capacity

206
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:38,000
to be in conflict with people because there's more space for it all

207
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,640
so part of mindfulness of the body is uh not only to be aware of the body but

208
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:50,000
also to have a kind of receiving allowing

209
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,920
attitude that allows that space to grow that allows the energy to start flowing

210
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:01,359
more fully and to feel that to feel the goodness that might be there and make space for

211
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:06,560
it hold it be aware of it not in a

212
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:12,079
in a utilitarian way like i'm going to do this for a purpose i'm going to make

213
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:19,440
this happen or something the utilitarian approach to mindfulness has is very very limited

214
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:25,359
but what's rather than utilitarian approach it's an appreciative mode

215
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:32,800
to appreciate rather than to make something happen and in that appreciation to receive and

216
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:39,680
hold and experience the body in a bigger way so the restoration of the whole body

217
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:46,640
and and so it's one of the great

218
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:53,280
i've been for me one of the great gifts of meditation practice is um the richness

219
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:59,359
of living in this body that has come from that uh from the practice

220
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:06,000
so um may your meditation practice your mindfulness

221
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,079
practice help you

222
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:17,520
rest in the richness of this living vibrating body and to learn the wisdom

223
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:26,000
of it and the healthiness of it and its capacity to hold all things

224
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:32,079
so um thank you very much and

225
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:37,720
we'll do the last day on the body tomorrow
