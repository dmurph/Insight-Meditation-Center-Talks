1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:09,519
so welcome everyone and to our sunday morning here at imc

2
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:16,640
and uh today is juneteenth day

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,480
which is a one of two independence

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:29,279
holidays that you have here in united states freedom holidays

5
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:36,160
and perhaps for those who meditate while we're meditating

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:44,079
it's uh the call to freedom can begin in our own hearts

7
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,280
movement to be free within ourselves

8
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,120
of ourselves to be free of the tremendous

9
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:02,160
pull and influence of our attitudes our ways of thinking our greed

10
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:10,240
our clinging our attachments our fears and there's something in our hearts that

11
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,799
here's a call that sends forth a call

12
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:23,360
for that freedom and for that freedom to begin with ourselves

13
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,880
then perhaps we can hear the call for freedom in our society

14
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,960
that we can support so perhaps in this sitting today

15
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,320
maybe what can guide you inspire you

16
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:47,119
encourage you to really be present be here in this experience of the moment

17
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,320
is your own heart's impulse

18
00:01:52,320 --> 00:02:00,079
to not be limited to not be defined by thoughts and

19
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,479
attachments and clingings distractions

20
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,720
maybe you can be inspired by your capacity to step

21
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:18,640
beyond through all attachments all clingings all

22
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:25,760
inner oppressions that we live by so the heart can be free

23
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:33,599
here and now so to take a meditation posture

24
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:42,959
and there's a history of in buddhism there's a history in buddhism of

25
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:50,480
this meditation posture representing either directly or symbolically

26
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:57,680
a certain kind of dignity nobility in

27
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,120
claiming or or establishing in our posture

28
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,760
a certain kind of freedom and independence

29
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:16,720
that might help enable the greatest freedom of heart

30
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:24,080
so what would your posture be if they had your posture express that

31
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,560
and if you're comfortable with it to gently close your eyes

32
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:48,640
and if it's comfortable for you to take a few long slow deep breaths with the exhale settling in to

33
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,200
yourself

34
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:02,959
with the exhale letting go into your depth

35
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,079
letting go into your heart or your horror

36
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,320
a place of grounding stability

37
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,959
here and now

38
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,520
letting your breathing return to normal

39
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:55,360
and in the center of all things there's a welcome there's a call

40
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,400
come here here

41
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:08,320
you're being called to freedom in the midst of all things your

42
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,720
breathing your body your mind

43
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,680
here come and see

44
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,520
freedom is to be freedom is to be found

45
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,440
okay

46
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,640
so

47
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,560
um

48
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,680
uh

49
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,040
so

50
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,959
um

51
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,600
so

52
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,399
so

53
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,480
so

54
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,199
so

55
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,240
so

56
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:10,279
and as we come to the end of this sitting

57
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,720
to practice with the buddhist

58
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:27,279
bridging of our practice to the welfare of the world around us

59
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:33,919
we dedicate the merit we dedicate the benefits of this sitting

60
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:41,360
and may it be that any of the benefits the welfare

61
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:47,919
the insights the freedoms that we recognize or intuit

62
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,960
through this practice may we

63
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:59,679
consider think about how we can apply them

64
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:09,679
to benefit others and we can wish and hope that in fact

65
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:14,878
directly or indirectly consciously or unconsciously

66
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:19,800
that this these minutes of meditation

67
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:27,280
serve for the welfare and happiness of all beings may all beings

68
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:35,158
be happy may all beings be safe

69
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,878
may all beings be peaceful

70
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:46,878
may all beings be free and may we contribute to that

71
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,838
possibility

72
00:34:52,320 --> 00:35:07,400
[Music]

73
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,320
so

74
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:04,000
so good morning everyone and welcome to imc and

75
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:11,559
here in person and also online and uh

76
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:20,560
so today is the anniversary of

77
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:27,520
the delayed emancipation of african americans here in the united

78
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:33,760
states some two two and a half years after abraham lincoln lincoln signed the

79
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:41,280
emancipation proclamation it took that long too for

80
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:47,680
some of the slaves in this country to and slaveholders to finally

81
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:54,560
realize that freedom from slavery in texas

82
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:00,200
in uh 1865.

83
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:06,240
and uh it's now that it's become the

84
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:11,599
national holiday it's this it's the united states now has two

85
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:18,400
independence days and uh the first one marks a certain kind of

86
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:25,760
independence and also represents in many ways

87
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:32,720
an independence that was only partial independence that ended up legalizing

88
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:40,640
the enslavement of other people so a freedom that some people attained

89
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:46,000
but which institutionalized or

90
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,839
sanctioned the lack of freedom for others

91
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:57,440
and it took almost another hundred years before

92
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,960
legally that freedom became much more complete in that

93
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:08,400
slaves were emancipated and as probably many of you know this

94
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:14,800
the history but that's been celebrated every year first in galveston texas

95
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:21,119
and then it spread to texas and to other places over time and uh

96
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:25,920
until now it's a national holiday

97
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:33,119
and uh the people who mostly celebrated until recently have been

98
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:40,480
black americans who were most impacted by this and it was a certainly a celebration for

99
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:46,400
them over their this freedom from slavery it was also a

100
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:52,400
remembering of the horrendous oppression and suffering that their

101
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,680
ancestors went through and it's good to remember

102
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:03,680
and then there's uh but also many african-americans have used the time

103
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:09,119
as a celebration of their achievements their perseverance

104
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:15,200
how far how brilliantly some of them have worked through their

105
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,800
oppression including the challenges they've had over the last hundred and

106
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,079
sixty seventy years since emancipation

107
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:33,040
and uh and uh you know it's remarkable how much

108
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:40,640
african-americans have contributed to this culture not just contributed institutions to help make it

109
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:46,800
with uh some phenomenal achievements and uh highest levels of government and

110
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:54,480
military and science and literature and music just goes on and on

111
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:04,000
so this day is is also the celebration of this the tremendous drive its creativity and

112
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:11,599
capacity of this population of people who who've been so oppressed

113
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:17,359
and for me personally i'm inspired very much by by this perseverance

114
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:23,359
this the degree to which so many of them have not given up have not

115
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:29,760
turned around to to

116
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:35,920
reject this country but really have stepped up in a powerful

117
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:41,119
way to claim their place as citizens of this country proud

118
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:48,880
citizens of this country and have met with oppression and violence and murder and

119
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:54,880
all kinds of things some of them with persevering and insisting on the truth

120
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:00,640
insisting on asserting or finding their freedom but also

121
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:08,079
many of them maybe partly from their christian background but a message of forgiveness and love

122
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:14,880
it's phenomenal to see how this has worked that someone was so much stacked against them so much

123
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:22,240
horrible things done to them have kept showing up showing up showing up over and over again

124
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:29,920
and excelled in so many different ways including in the capacity to love

125
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:37,760
i've met a number of african-americans who are been practitioners some of them have become teacher buddhist teachers

126
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:43,440
and have learned a little bit about their personal story and how challenging it's been growing up in this country and

127
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:48,880
and what they've had to face but that they came to buddhist practice

128
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:54,319
in order to deal with their tremendous pain that they carried with them

129
00:41:54,319 --> 00:42:00,240
and their tremendous rage their anger and how difficult it was to sit

130
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:07,680
in a room full of mostly white people and retreats and uh and sit there and sit there and

131
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:14,880
but they use this practice in order to somehow resolve that and work with it and heal it

132
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:21,680
and came out the other side with a dignity and confidence

133
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:27,280
and a capacity because they had healed their rage and their woundedness

134
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:34,640
a capacity to still be in the fire of racism in this country but to be able to look at it in the face

135
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:41,280
with strength and confidence and with a certain kind of love sometimes a fierce love

136
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:47,920
and sometimes i met these african-american practitioners and had been it's kind of in awe of them

137
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:55,440
and kind of like it's well inspired by them and kind of felt wow

138
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:05,839
i hope you know what would i be able to do that would i have been able to manage with that level of challenge

139
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:12,079
like you would hope so but i don't know so a day to celebrate

140
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:17,119
you know the amazing amazing accomplishment of what a free people can do

141
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:23,680
and to recognize there's plenty of people who are not not yet free enough there's still oppression in this country

142
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:29,760
there's still still limitations and things that undermine that lots of people not just african-americans but

143
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,960
that's what we're celebrating today and uh that keeps

144
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:40,240
lots of things that keep them from excelling they keep them from

145
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:45,839
living a free life keep them from fulfilling their capacity

146
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:52,880
in beautiful ways so what i'd like to do today is to

147
00:43:52,880 --> 00:44:00,480
teach you what the teachings of the buddha are called the four great resolves the four

148
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,920
things the word resolve here and the quality word is aditana

149
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:11,599
which kind of etymology of the word means something like a higher stand and where

150
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:17,760
you take your stand so it's not just a resolve which can feel like where you're headed resolved to get

151
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:23,040
someplace but this is where we take our stand like this you know

152
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:31,280
this is what we're committed to and we're going to find our way and these four resolves or four stands

153
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:36,400
are uh wisdom truth

154
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:43,280
relinquishment and peace so i'll say a little bit about them but

155
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:51,680
mostly what i want to do is use this as a as a structure to read some quotations from

156
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:57,839
african-american writers activists people and i've chosen different quotes that

157
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:04,880
kind of fit into these categories and that might kind of give a different uh

158
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:10,960
application or orientation in order to kind of consider these four stands

159
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:16,720
i think many for in the context of this buddhist meditation practice

160
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:23,520
that these four resolves uh are often understood in terms of our own in practice

161
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:29,040
it's like uh turned inward towards ourselves how to practice them and that's actually very significant to do

162
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:35,280
that and that's what these african-american practitioners in some ways did in order

163
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,560
to find their freedom in order to be able to go out and after that afterwards some of them are

164
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:46,880
kind of activists now so there's a place for that but we tend

165
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:54,160
to limit ourselves too much our freedom in being internally focused sometimes in this buddhist practice and so to

166
00:45:54,160 --> 00:46:01,520
hear these these quotations in the context of these four resolves might be interesting too for a reflection and

167
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:06,560
also a way of kind of honoring this holiday

168
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:13,440
so the first one wisdom and there's a number of definitions of

169
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,800
wisdom in buddhism but the one that i find most inspiring

170
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:24,400
is not that of wisdom but of a wise person so how a wise person thinks is their

171
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:29,599
wisdom and the buddha says a wise person

172
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:37,440
is someone who considers their own welfare consid the welfare of others

173
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:45,200
the welfare of both self and others and the welfare of the whole world

174
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:53,280
this is different than what most people think wisdom is in buddhism or many things that are defined as wisdom

175
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:58,960
sometimes it's you know people point to emptiness or the four noble truths or

176
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:05,280
to uh dependent arising all kinds of things kind of other things but

177
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:13,280
to front and center put was put define wisdom and have wisdom be connected to welfare

178
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:19,440
and for that we have to know what is welfare what is the well-being

179
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:24,720
and we have to for that to be concerned for the welfare of others we have to know them

180
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:31,599
we have to know something about them we have to be able to meet them with a lot of respect

181
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:38,160
and understanding and so to have buddhist practice that part of the context for it

182
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:43,200
according to the buddha is this mutual

183
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:49,920
welfare and uh when he says the buddha says self self self other

184
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:55,280
self and other and the whole world i unders there's no explanation of what

185
00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:01,040
these three four categories are but self and other i understand it to be the

186
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:07,359
we the relationship we have what happens when we come together the interact interrelatedness that we

187
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:14,720
have and uh that gets created in our mutual contact with each other

188
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:21,359
and then the whole world just i just take it to be you know our scope or the care of a wise person

189
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:27,200
it is 360 degrees nothing's left out nothing is outside

190
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:32,839
the purview of what our care is so

191
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:39,599
uh one of the really one great

192
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:44,960
african-american historians in this country was w.e.b de bois

193
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:50,079
amazing man who uh you know there was about a century

194
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:57,200
from the time of the end of the civil war the emancipation proclamation

195
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:04,880
to uh the civil rights act in that hundred years he lived 95 of

196
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:11,359
them he was born in 1868 died in 1963 a year before the civil

197
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:16,800
rights act which he he championed and you know worked for

198
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:22,079
and what a what a lifetime to live through jim crow and

199
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:27,200
cooper's clan and you know world war one and world war ii and

200
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:34,160
the civil rights movement you know just kind of you know there's so many powerful things that happened

201
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:40,000
and uh and he studied it he wrote about it he

202
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:46,400
commented that he was a prolific writer and one of the founders of the national

203
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:53,520
association for the advancement of colored people so he wrote

204
00:49:54,319 --> 00:50:01,200
herein lies the tragedy of the age not that men are poor

205
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:07,440
all men know something of poverty not that men are wicked

206
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:13,200
who after all is good not that magnar men are ignorant

207
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:20,000
after all what is truth nay the tragedy is that men know so little

208
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:26,800
of men a little hard to read when we don't use gender inclusive language these days but

209
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:34,480
this was the language of the time the tragedy of we don't know each other

210
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:40,640
and so one of his summations of all the suffering that he's seeing in his

211
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:45,920
country in this country in his time uh and this quote kind of zeroes in on

212
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:52,880
it we don't know each other well enough and what happens when we really know people

213
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:58,720
there was a african-american jazz player who uh

214
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:04,960
made it his mission to uh convert or

215
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:12,000
disarm members of the ku klux klan and he would go around to ku klux klan

216
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,839
rallies and he would befriend the people there become their friends get it invite them

217
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:23,839
out for lunch invited to their houses for lunch and uh and these clan people they never

218
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:30,160
had friendship with a black person and they got to know him and they realized that their beliefs

219
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:36,720
their vision of you of what a black person is was wrong and they left the clan some of the high

220
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:43,200
wizards left the clan that he has a whole collection of clan uh robes that they gave to him as kind

221
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:48,720
of uh to mark this they're leaving the clan and he collects them he has a big you know

222
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:54,400
closet full of them but what a remarkable thing to do i mean that kind of sounds a little

223
00:51:54,400 --> 00:52:02,000
crazy you know in principle to me but uh you can read about him there's lots of articles about him

224
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,839
and uh forget his name

225
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:15,200
alice walker healing begins

226
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:21,280
where the wound was made healing begins where the wound

227
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:26,720
was made so here also this wisdom of knowing you know being concerned for

228
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:32,960
the welfare of others but can you know about the welfare of others without knowing the wound they

229
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:39,280
have the suffering the challenges they have and one of the principles of wisdom and

230
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:47,119
buddhism is the wisdom the importance of being attuned to suffering and being

231
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:52,240
attuned to pain the wounds the challenges of ourselves and others

232
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:58,880
not so that we are oppressed by it or suffer even more but without understanding or suffering

233
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:04,880
with understanding or societal suffering there's no hope to move move through it

234
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:14,000
and find the freedom on the other end healing begins where the wound was made

235
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:20,000
james baldwin wrote for a while the tale of how we suffer

236
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:26,400
and how we are delighted and how we may triumph is never new

237
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:34,079
it always must be heard there isn't any other tale to tell

238
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:41,200
it's the only light we got in all this darkness so we have to the wisdom of facing this

239
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:48,240
to be able to tell the story and or to recognize how we suffer how we're delighted

240
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:54,319
and how we triumph and that's what you know this holiday is about part just not only freedom but the

241
00:53:54,319 --> 00:54:00,880
triumphing of those african-americans who have really pushed through their oppression

242
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:05,039
and excelled in so many different ways

243
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:12,800
and malcolm x a man who is a little controversial perhaps for some people but

244
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:18,720
many people have come to appreciate him more and more as the distance of his time

245
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:25,760
we are not fighting for integration nor are we fighting for separation

246
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:31,760
we are fighting for recognition as human beings in fact

247
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:37,200
we are actually fighting for rights that are even greater than civil rights

248
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:42,559
and that is human rights so

249
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:49,440
fighting for recognition hey we're here we count we're important

250
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:57,280
this is you know i think it's a wonderful wonderful rallying cry and a teaching in its own

251
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:04,079
right the slogan black lives matter and because there's been so so much

252
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:09,119
resistance to this slogan in this country surprising

253
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:14,559
that anybody would resist that slogan i wonder sometimes whether we add one

254
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:19,680
word to it whether that would help black lives matter

255
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:26,480
also because who could argue against that

256
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:32,720
so wisdom recognition seeing the wound recognizing

257
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:39,359
other people recognizing the humanity of others and uh

258
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:45,119
you know is part of this whole wisdom tradition so here not just for in ourselves but now

259
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:52,160
looking outwards into this world so the second resolve is truth

260
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:59,040
and this is central to buddhist practice we practice mindfulness to be able to be present for what is most true the truth

261
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:05,040
that's liberating and for personal liberation it's a real

262
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:11,440
deep look inside and through the depths of our hearts for societal liberty liberation there

263
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:17,440
has to be some study and recognition of what's true out there

264
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:22,160
and uh and avoid lies

265
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:28,240
complicated issue in some ways but uh certainly we have examples in the

266
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:34,240
contemporary society where it's not a question of what is true and what's lies because it's

267
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:41,920
freely admitted their people are lying but they're doing it anyway tremendous costs to our society

268
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:49,680
uh so nicole hannah jones who's one of the

269
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:57,599
one of the main originators of the 1619 project to study racism in this

270
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:02,400
country she wrote

271
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:10,240
if we here at the united states if we are truly a great nation

272
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:16,799
then the truth cannot destroy us

273
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:22,559
this is a powerful statement in my mind so here they're trying to get to come out they bring out the truth of the

274
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:27,680
wound of what's happening here that so many people are resisting and not wanting

275
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:34,960
thinking somehow it's going to do something terrible but the truth can never destroy us

276
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:42,559
dubois said the cure

277
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:51,119
isn't simply telling people the truth it is inducing them to act on the truth

278
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:58,319
so to act to live the truth to act on what's true so you know part of the danger in

279
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:04,319
buddhism where we have in our practice at least where we're having insights and understanding and wisdom

280
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:09,839
is that it uh they're powerful for us maybe to see the truth in some ways in our practice

281
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:16,480
but then we don't take the next step which is to understand how that

282
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:22,480
influences or or inspires living a different way let go of

283
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:28,079
attachments not so that we can watch more netflix and not have to worry about anything

284
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:33,920
because we did our own spiritual world work but to discover how to be let go of our

285
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:40,720
attachments so that that we can step into the world

286
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:49,200
in a free way dedicated to freedom i sense i'll go on absolutely

287
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:55,599
so then there comes relinquishment relinquishment is a fascinating word because it also the

288
00:58:55,599 --> 00:59:01,520
pali word chaga for relinquishment also means generosity

289
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:08,799
and the fact that relinquishment letting go in some deep way can mean generosity it kind of gives a

290
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:13,839
different twist because some people think relinquish by just kind of giving something up

291
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:18,960
but the word giving up originally apparently suggested offering

292
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:25,520
something up on the altar giving it's also the word giving is in it and though sometimes in colloquial

293
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:32,240
english giving up feels like a kind of a hopeless surrender or something but what

294
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:39,040
if giving up is a powerful act of of independence and freedom and

295
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:45,280
he you know that it's not surrendering something

296
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:50,559
but rather stepping in letting go to step forward

297
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:57,359
in a free way so again dubois

298
00:59:57,359 --> 01:00:03,359
there is in this world no force as the force of a man determined to

299
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:10,079
arise the human soul cannot be permanently chained

300
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:15,480
the human heart cannot be permanently chained

301
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:20,720
the uh uh here's our soul the human soul cannot be permanently chained and for me

302
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:26,720
i translate that as heart our heart does not want to be held in

303
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:34,240
check doesn't want to be repressed or held down there is in us a call to freedom

304
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:39,920
a yearning for freedom to be set free and i believe that once we do mindfulness practice or meditation

305
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:45,040
practice that lets the mind quiet down enough from all its distractions all its

306
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:50,480
preoccupations and we can feel listen hear ourselves more deeply

307
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:57,760
we'll hear that call for freedom the way in early in the buddhism that's expressed

308
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:03,359
is the word which means come and see

309
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:10,319
there's a call there's a call to come and see come and look here freedom is found here come and look for

310
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:15,599
it one buddha is saying a chinese buddhist saying is that

311
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:22,400
freedom beckons us in everything there's a call to freedom the heart

312
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:31,119
wants to be free the heart doesn't want to suffer and one of the simplest kind of maybe

313
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:40,640
rational maybe even mechanical ways of understanding this

314
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:46,480
call to freedom is that it's a call to let go

315
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:52,559
of all the ways in which the heart is contracted or tight

316
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:59,359
fisted up and it's a lot of work to do that

317
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:06,799
it's a lot of effort and if you really if you feel into a fist which is all contracted and tight

318
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:11,920
you feel kind of a call in the fist to relax it doesn't want to be that way you

319
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:18,480
have to assert the mind over and over again to keep the hand fisted up there is a call in the heart

320
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:25,440
for freedom for release the human soul cannot be permanently

321
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:32,160
chained dubois again the cost of liberty

322
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:37,359
is less than the price of repression

323
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:43,280
that's a powerful statement and i don't know if you can reword it for

324
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:49,920
the cost of freedom is less than the price of

325
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:56,400
attachment the price of craving and clinging let's say so if you want to do the

326
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:03,200
economic analysis of this practice it clearly comes in favor of us doing

327
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:06,400
the work to become free

328
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:14,839
dubois again i believe in liberty for all

329
01:03:14,839 --> 01:03:22,079
men the space to stretch their arms and their souls the right to breathe and the fight to

330
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:27,440
vote the freedom to choose their friends enjoy the sunshine

331
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:32,799
and ride on the railroads uncursed by color

332
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:37,920
thinking dreaming and working as they will in a kingdom of beauty and

333
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:45,680
love working as they will and a kingdom of beauty and love

334
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:51,280
don't we want to live in a kingdom like that a world like that do we want to contribute to that

335
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:59,039
do we want to be someone who contributes to beauty love and freedom

336
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:04,799
i think that it's actually if you learn how to do it it's actually less

337
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:08,400
less work than the alternative

338
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:19,119
then a colleague of uh dubois was a man named carter woodson he was actually the main founder of the naacp

339
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:24,400
lived around the same time and uh

340
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:30,240
he wrote history shows that it does not matter who is in

341
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:35,920
power or what revolutionary forces take over the government

342
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:43,440
those who have not learned to do for themselves and have to depend so solely on others

343
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:49,599
never obtain any more rights or privileges in the end than they had in the beginning

344
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:55,760
so this is where buddhist practice comes into play because this is a kind of specialty of buddhism

345
01:04:55,760 --> 01:05:01,920
i think that has to contribute to all this we those who have not learned to do for

346
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:08,400
themselves and have to depend so solely on others

347
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:14,640
buddhist practice is leading us to becoming independent

348
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:22,079
there's a certain kind of the buddha was explicit using this word not dependent to live a life not dependent on anything

349
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:29,359
and not dependent on others is that possible psychologically in certain way

350
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:38,480
it is possible and and to the degree to which this the heart can become independent

351
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:46,480
without that woodson doesn't believe it's possible to

352
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:53,839
have any other freedom so then in terms of this freedom

353
01:05:53,839 --> 01:05:59,280
living a life of beauty living a life of love

354
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:04,440
tony morrison has this beautiful quote

355
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:10,720
if you can't imagine it you can't have it

356
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:17,039
if you can't imagine it you can't have it so some of you maybe don't feel like you

357
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:23,280
have freedom yet full freedom don't live life of full love and all the context

358
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:29,520
that you'd like to live it maybe you even have the but imagine that it's possible imagine

359
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:35,920
it have a vision for it the first experience of liberation and

360
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:42,480
buddhism is often called a vision then we have a vision of what's possible

361
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:50,559
the first experience of liberation is not the end but it's the beginning because now we kind of we can imagine it

362
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:57,759
as so the four resolves wisdom

363
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:05,440
truth relinquishment and now the fourth one is peace and for the buddha

364
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:10,559
in terms of the kind of emotional experience of liberation what it

365
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:16,640
actually feels like he has two concepts that he presents

366
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:23,359
one is peace and the other is happiness peaceful happiness happy peace if you

367
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:30,720
put him together so peace is kind of like the one of the goals of the buddhist practice

368
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:37,119
and malcolm x said you cannot separate peace

369
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:42,880
from freedom because no one can be at peace unless he

370
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:47,920
has his freedom no one can be at peace unless he has his

371
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:56,920
freedom so we don't want to live in a world where people are denied their freedom

372
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:06,480
dubois what a world this will be when human possibilities are freed

373
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:13,039
when we discover each other when the stranger is no longer the potential criminal

374
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:19,120
and the certain inferior it doesn't really mention peace but this

375
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:26,480
is where the quote got to put the world of human possibilities

376
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:31,920
tony morrison don't let anybody

377
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:39,040
anybody convince you this is the way the world is and therefore must be

378
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:45,758
it must be the way it ought to be this is a unusual quote for buddhists in

379
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:51,278
our scene ought to be different we keep emphasizing you know you have to

380
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:57,120
see the world as it is yes

381
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:02,238
we see the world as it is so that the social world

382
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:08,560
can become what it ought to be we see the truth of what's happening

383
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:16,798
things as they are in our hearts so that our lived life in this world

384
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:24,159
can be as it's possible as we can imagine it if we only accept

385
01:09:24,159 --> 01:09:30,080
things as they are ourselves as we are

386
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:37,278
nothing's really going to change and is there really a freedom

387
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:42,719
to be found by simply just accepting things as they are

388
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:48,480
i'd say no things have to change

389
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:54,880
to the degree to which buddhists practice acceptance it's only so that we get to know them

390
01:09:54,880 --> 01:10:00,400
better more deeply only so that our reactivity and our

391
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:06,800
attachments don't get the upper hand but not we don't accept so that we

392
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:12,880
permanently accept we learn how to be present to see things as they are

393
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:18,159
so that we can let this growth into freedom

394
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:23,679
happen that's what our heart wants that's what the heart

395
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:28,800
the ought of our hearts there is a possibility for a different

396
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:35,679
life there is a possibility for a different society whether or not we attain it in this

397
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:42,080
lifetime in this century and this millennia one of the most powerful

398
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:47,199
ways of freedom gets enacted and lived is

399
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:54,560
we don't we don't limit our freedom our enactment our

400
01:10:55,040 --> 01:11:00,239
by the short-term possibilities

401
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:08,800
what's important and even by the results what's important is we act in free ways we act for freedom

402
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:15,199
we become someone who wants to live expressing our love

403
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:20,480
our care maybe a certain beauty

404
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:25,760
and freedom so we can be free

405
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:32,080
and the love in our hearts can be set free so that we can be

406
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:36,800
attuned and supportive of the freedom and

407
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:44,480
love that others can have the possibility of freedom and love

408
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:51,040
between self and others and to contribute to a world

409
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:55,840
where freedom and love are recognized

410
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:03,840
appreciated valued and celebrated and may it be that on this day of

411
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:09,600
the juneteenth that's a day where we appreciate

412
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:15,600
value and start to live more fully dedicate ourselves

413
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:20,840
to the advancement the freedom the happiness of

414
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:27,600
everyone including and maybe with some priority

415
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:33,760
the african-americans in this country they've been forgotten ignored

416
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:38,800
oppressed for centuries and so

417
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:45,040
there's a little bit of a reckoning that we should do and care for

418
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:50,800
and to support a real change continue the change that's happening in

419
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:57,840
a good direction on this juneteenth day so thank you

420
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:03,679
wisdom truth relinquishment

421
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:10,560
and peace so uh

422
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:16,400
we will stop and then for those of you who would like we'll take some chairs folding

423
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:22,719
chairs outside the parking lot and we can sit there and have a little discussion and check in

424
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:29,360
and whatever happens we can take our masks off if you like you can keep it on if you like

425
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:36,800
out there and that's nice you're all welcome to come it's nice to have chat and one of the things i'd like to do maybe at the beginning of that gathering

426
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:42,960
is to talk a little bit about some of the thinking about how what kind of changes we might enact

427
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:48,400
of for the covid protocol for coming here on sunday mornings in july

428
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:54,560
is maybe not a lot big change but a little bit of change one but one of them is

429
01:13:54,560 --> 01:14:00,560
maybe to stop using this whole registration system we have

430
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:08,480
to have it be an honor system that people are vaccinated still wear masks but uh maybe also not uh

431
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:13,679
limit the numbers and see what happens if it just you know if

432
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:18,800
with that uh so we haven't decided we haven't decided what to do but i thought

433
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:24,880
at least to give you those of you who'd like to stay and have some discussion about it we could begin our conversation out

434
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:30,800
there with that so uh thank you

435
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:34,158
very much and uh

436
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:41,679
this holiday continues tomorrow so it's really a two-day holiday so so

437
01:14:41,679 --> 01:14:47,360
so keep uh keep this the whole idea i suggest you keep this whole idea of

438
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:52,800
juneteenth day and enough in the forefront in your mind that you read about it study about it

439
01:14:52,800 --> 01:15:00,360
and kind of learn a little bit more about african-american history thank you
