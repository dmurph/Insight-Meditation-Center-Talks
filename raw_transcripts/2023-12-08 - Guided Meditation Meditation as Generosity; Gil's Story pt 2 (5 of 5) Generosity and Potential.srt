1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,800
hello everyone and

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:11,559
welcome and today I want to introduce

3
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:18,160
meditation as generosity that the act of meditation is

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,080
a continual Act of generosity and

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:30,720
uh and in that regard I'm inspired that

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,480
that in the classic teachings of the Buddha the upper reaching upper reaches

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,520
of spiritual growth of meditation practice is a very

8
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,640
profound letting go and it turns out that some of the

9
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,359
words that the Buddha uses for letting go he has a number of words maybe it's

10
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:59,120
such a central part of his teachings that um the more you're involved in something

11
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:06,200
the more variation and names you can have some of us will just call a wave a wave but

12
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,560
oceanographer might have many different names for different kinds of waves or

13
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:18,759
clouds are just clouds for me but someone who knows about clouds can identify all the different

14
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:24,079
types so uh the variations of letting go

15
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:31,000
but some of the words the Buddha uses for letting go have a double meaning and they also mean

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:40,680
generosity one of those is the word chaga c a g which uh means to relinquish or let go

17
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,840
and it also is used in the Buddhist teachings as a as an expression of

18
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:54,759
generosity there's a word translated as um as uh relinquishment into English

19
00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:00,960
which also has the meaning of giving or generosity

20
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,280
and one the way we can understand this is that uh if you hold something tight

21
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,680
in your hand in order to give it away you have to also let go you have to also

22
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,360
relinquish it and you can you Poss relinquish under

23
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:24,800
Force against your will uh it's possible to do it reluctantly but it's also sometimes we

24
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,840
do it with our generosity our sense of delight and appreciation the of Freedom

25
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,040
here like there's no almost maybe even no self-consciousness in the ACT no it's

26
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:42,480
not about me it's just about the Delight of hear please and this it's an expression of our

27
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:49,280
freedom so it's in that that regard that we talk about meditation is

28
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,720
generosity to let go into the present

29
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,879
moment an act of generosity where the giver and the the

30
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:06,519
receiver are the same we give fully let go

31
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:12,480
fully not hold on to anything fully and we

32
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:20,400
benefit we give so we can be free we are free so that we can

33
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,560
give and meditation is the opportunity where really the giver and the receiver

34
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,680
are the same we do it so deeply and fully that the notion of giving and

35
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,640
giver and receiver Falls away the Oneness of giving and letting

36
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,799
go the Oneness of generosity and

37
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:52,280
relinquishment so to assume a posture for meditation but to do so as an act of

38
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,439
generosity to yourself that this meditation posture

39
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:04,879
gives you you're giving yourself a chance to sit with

40
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:12,200
dignity to sit in a way that or or whatever posture you have to have a

41
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:20,320
sense that there's dignity and nobility there is respect for this body

42
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:27,280
for ourselves for our hearts and that's an act of

43
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:35,520
generosity and to let go of the ways in which we collapse

44
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,400
or the ways in which we're under the weight

45
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,600
of challenging emotions certainly we can have them but to but to succumb under

46
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:55,479
the weight of them is not a generous thing to do it's also not generous to the

47
00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:01,758
difficult emotions but to take a posture of

48
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:10,199
dignity respect as if your difficult

49
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,960
emotions are being respected as if you're rising to the

50
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:22,639
occasion to meet them as if you have value and

51
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,479
dignity and then to gently close your

52
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:34,600
eyes even closing your eyes can be

53
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:41,280
generosity the generosity of offering your full inner attention

54
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,720
now to yourself without being distracted by

55
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:54,000
sights around you like you're sitting with a friend on

56
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,039
a park bench to really listen to the friend and close your eyes to sit with

57
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:07,840
yourself to really listen feel be

58
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:21,599
here and then taking a few long slow deep breaths it's a gift to your body to take

59
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:27,720
in a deep breath of oxygen and it's a gift to your body to

60
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,400
relax as you exhale

61
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:39,599
a kind act to the body here relax

62
00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:01,400
soften and then to let your breathing return to normal

63
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:10,160
allowing breathing to be a gift that supports your

64
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:18,120
life and that as you exhale do not only let go

65
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:26,759
of the old Air that's being released the carbon dioxide but let the exhale also be a

66
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:31,319
release of tension in your body

67
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:47,840
scanning your body for where there's holding that you can let go of and in the Letting

68
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:56,240
Go offer something good for your body the absence of

69
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
tension

70
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:27,919
and if you also relax your thinking mind think of that relaxation as a

71
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,720
gift do doing something good for the

72
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:41,120
mind and appreciating it as an act of generosity no matter how small the

73
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:48,839
Letting Go the releasing relaxing is appreciate offering the gift of

74
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,760
relaxation to the thinking

75
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
mind

76
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:33,440
for and if you're caught up in

77
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:41,079
thoughts let go of the thoughts but let

78
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:50,760
go as a form of generosity as a way to offer something

79
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:57,839
beneficial here it's okay to relax let

80
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:05,440
go moving the thinking mind

81
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,440
to a healthier functioning one that's not caught in the

82
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,240
grip of

83
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
attachments

84
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
for

85
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
for

86
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
for

87
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:34,880
for centering yourself on your

88
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:44,399
breathing and with a very openhearted open-minded

89
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:56,360
way giving attention to your breathing as an act of

90
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:04,680
generosity it's it's a way of giving space allowing breathing more

91
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:09,519
room it's a way of valuing and

92
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:14,519
appreciating this life here and

93
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:21,920
now giving ourselves over to breathing is an

94
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:29,600
alternative to the mind being free to be involved in thoughts which are

95
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:36,240
tense or stressful

96
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:45,320
disconnecting to appreciate the giving of attention to

97
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:51,120
our lived experience breathing in and breathing

98
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
out

99
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
for

100
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
for

101
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
for

102
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,519
for

103
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
for

104
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:31,840
to keep you in the rhythm of the breathing to keep you in the flow of

105
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:41,400
attention think of attention let attention be an act of

106
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,240
generosity a relinquishment of

107
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:57,400
distractions a giving of oneself to the

108
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
breathing

109
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:09,158
giving oneself to to give all of

110
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:16,039
oneself to the present moment of our own

111
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:23,600
experience and in this way giving ourselves

112
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:30,200
over to ourselves to the lived experience of

113
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,200
ourselves

114
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
now

115
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
for

116
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
for

117
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
for

118
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
for

119
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
for

120
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
for

121
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
for

122
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
for

123
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
e

124
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:46,039
rather than giving yourself over to thinking give yourself over to the

125
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:52,960
immediacy of your lived experience through your

126
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:59,480
body your heart through the inner

127
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,760
experience of being here and

128
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
now

129
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
for

130
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679
for

131
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,679
for

132
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,240
and then as we come to the end of the

133
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:32,039
sitting part of the tremendous benefit of giving ourselves to

134
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:38,960
ourselves to give ourselves over to the fullness the

135
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:48,720
three-dimensionality of ourselves here and now to be in our body sensing and

136
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:56,600
feeling part of the benefit of that there's much more of ourselves here

137
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:04,640
now with which to be present for other

138
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:11,159
people we're less likely to be distracted less likely to be caught in

139
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:16,200
tension less likely to be fragmented or

140
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:25,279
divided different divided their divided attention divided

141
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:34,159
intention we're much more we have much more to offer in the gift of listening the gift

142
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:43,120
of seeing the gift of attending to this life to

143
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:51,120
others and may it be that this practice of ours gives us the capacity to be present

144
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:58,720
for this world that we contribute to people's

145
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:05,158
happiness their safety their

146
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:13,000
peace and their freedom from suffering may that be our

147
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:22,519
Legacy may all beings be happy may all beings be

148
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:28,519

may all beings be

150
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:41,399
free and may our ability to be

151
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:48,039
mindful be a gift that contributes to this

152
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:03,540
possibility [Music]

153
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,240
thank

154
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,320
you

155
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,320
e

156
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:31,278
so I come to this last talk

157
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:37,679
on kind of a little bit of my story my story in the

158
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:43,919
Dharma and yesterday I came more or less to

159
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:50,120
the the beginning of IMC here in Redwood red Redwood City and being able to

160
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:56,720
purchase this building that I'm sitting in and we're able to do it out of the generosity of the sellers the two

161
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:01,960
ministers Christian ministers who wanted us to buy the church because they also

162
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:10,600
provided us with the necessary loan to buy it and it would have been hard for us to have had the money also it took a

163
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:17,279
year and a half from the time that they told us that we're interesting selling it to us before they even showed us the

164
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:23,120
building and that worked really well for our mindfulness approach just doing things mindfully

165
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:30,559
slowly uh uh caringly we kind of got ready and prepared for this process and

166
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:36,440
that was exceptional because in in this area back then uh you had to have made a

167
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:41,720
bid for buying a property probably the day before it went on the market it was

168
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:49,080
that fast you it had to be really quick and so we didn't really have that ability and and um and uh and also

169
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:56,760
wasn't the kind of our way of doing things and and it's important that we do things buy things move ahead build our

170
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:03,519
program on our in our community all in a way that feels harmonious with u the practice we're

171
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:09,240
doing that's harmonious with being hopefully being relaxed at ease not

172
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:17,399
pushing not trying to make something happen for which there is no um kind of momentum and delight and

173
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:23,320
enthusiasm for doing so after that the long period of

174
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:28,880
uh we bought the building and and that was phenomenally beneficial for our

175
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:36,039
community to have now this kind of blank canvas to grow our programs and grow all kinds of things and with that our

176
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:43,760
community grew and um both in numbers but but also in uh kind of the the the

177
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:49,679
maturity of people's practice and the different expressions of people's practice having a place like this

178
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:55,799
allowed people to develop and grow in leadership grow in generosity grow in um

179
00:32:55,799 --> 00:33:02,440
goodwi and and and friendships Dharma friendships and Dharma conversations and

180
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:10,600
they became a very rich kind of network of Dharma life that people not to participate in that uh was really

181
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:17,480
beneficial for everyone including myself and uh and as it developed one of

182
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:25,000
the really key aspects of this was uh people's generosity and um generosity as

183
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:32,760
volunteers and we had a huge number we have a large large number of volunteers and um and also people's

184
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:38,440
generosity financially and uh we did buy the building with debt mortgage and I

185
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:45,159
think within two or three years we raised the money to uh retire the morgage and own the building

186
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:51,360
outright the same thing happened with IRC that um we you know it's there was a

187
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:58,279
Wellspring of generosity Wellspring of support and and uh in 199 19 2005 was

188
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:03,799
about the time we started to be serious about looking for a retreat center and

189
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:13,599
um and so we started the search and and um and a lot as we went along uh uh uh

190
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:19,800
it took a long time it took about five six years of searching and looking but that also was beneficial for us it

191
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:24,960
prepared us for it and eventually we were able to uh raise enough

192
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:32,560
money and uh and then and we were able to buy the building and we had a mortgage at first and uh and a variety

193
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:43,200
of things happened that I think probably within um I would say um six years that morgage

194
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:48,679
was put to rest including the tremendous generosity of some of our some of our uh

195
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:53,919
big donors and um but also for thousands of

196
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:59,920
people from all over the country that uh really want really inspired by our model of

197
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:07,560
generosity and uh and for these last you know 24 years now or so uh that I or 20

198
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:13,280
plus years of live of practicing here in IRC uh I've been inspired over and over

199
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:19,440
and over again by the generosity of the community and how much support there is

200
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:26,599
and it's been part of my uh certainly vision of having a community a Dharma Community where that's the case because

201
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:33,040
I feel I believe that Dharma practice unfolds best where it's all voluntary and it's all given freely to

202
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:38,880
the people who come and so this ability to give freely by everyone uh is

203
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,920
beneficial it's it's a gift to ourselves to do that and so it's a gift to others

204
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:50,000
and this mutuality of giving and receiving and how they're all kind of folded together is such an inspiring

205
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,400
thing and this to see it operating in this community is is uh one of the great

206
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:01,480
experiences of my life and um so we were here and we were able

207
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:07,400
to start developing programs the community was maturing and as they mature we developed more programs and

208
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:13,440
for to match the maturity of where people are at and um and EV visioned

209
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:19,400
grew of being able to uh support people in the Dharma in this practice uh in all

210
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:25,560
areas of their life kind of expand outwards and keep developing and certainly The Retreat Center was one way

211
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:33,000
of doing that at some point it became clear that uh to mature further people are really ready to have easy access to

212
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,200
Retreats and to sit with us and and uh and to mature

213
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:44,400
there and um it's became very successful the retreat center and some ways that

214
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,520
does the the idea of easy availability of of offering Retreats freely was

215
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:55,240
fulfilled because to rent facilities which we did before that was so much more expensive and it would have been

216
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:02,240
more and more out of the reach to do a as many Retreats as we do every year and um so it's phenomenal that we have this

217
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:09,079
beautiful Retreat Center we developed a study center not IMC particularly but this community and

218
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:14,680
we have the Sati Center for Buddhist studies which is thriving and kind of grew slowly and now it's thriving over

219
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:20,000
the last few years uh one of the great things that rose out of here was uh

220
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:27,400
because we had this place partly and was possible to enion more for new things uh

221
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:33,400
with the study center Sati Center Buddhist studies after uh 2001 uh September 11th

222
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:39,839
2001 um that had a huge impact on me and I some point I felt I was walking on the

223
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:46,640
beach someplace thinking about this and um and I think you know this had such a big

224
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:53,240
impact on me that uh it's it's going to do it's going to actually be a kind of continuation of the

225
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:58,760
violence if I'm not changed by this event changed for the the better and uh

226
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:03,960
somehow something has to change and be different after that horrendous

227
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:11,920
event and um and I said what well how how do I want to be different how do how do this the scene the Arma communities

228
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:18,359
that I'm involved and how can we be different after something like this and after in that walk on the beach I

229
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:23,760
decided oh let's start a Buddhist chaplaincy

230
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:29,240
program Let's uh I learned just enough about chaplaincy that what a deep

231
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:36,079
spiritual caregiving it is to people who are not just Buddhists but all walks of white life in the times of the greatest

232
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:41,640
crisis in their lives um that they go through in in uh hospitals and in

233
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:46,839
prisons and in hospices and many different places chaplain kind of meet

234
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:53,079
uh they're like firefighters they run towards the fire chaplain go towards some of the greatest suffering that

235
00:38:53,079 --> 00:39:00,079
humans have that other people may sometimes pull away from and I so we started a chaplaincy program an

236
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:06,440
introduction to Buddhist chaplaincy and it's not a full-fledged professional chaplaincy program but it opened the

237
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:12,680
door it has been for not for 20 more than 20 years it's continued and it's one of the bright lights of my life the

238
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:19,960
fact that we open this door to the world of spiritual caregiving to so many people who come and do the training and

239
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:28,440
that that program has developed now into not only in-person program but a second online person uh program

240
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:35,920
and then to I did it partly to support the continued maturity of this community uh the IMC Community because I felt that

241
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:41,880
we had to learn we had to develop people who grew in spiritual care in compassion

242
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:48,119
expressions of their compassion and we had a community of people to caretake for people were dying and getting old

243
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:56,200
and going through their own crisises and I felt it we important to develop we grew to develop a a community that also

244
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:02,200
could care for each other with all the different things and

245
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:09,280
um and so um it's been a a

246
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:16,040
phenomenal pleasure joy for me and a growth for me to become see my own

247
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:21,599
practice my own generosity my own Letting Go My Own clarification of my

248
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:27,880
intentions clarification of my mind um of my heart to watch it in this kind of

249
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:33,760
rich rich world of Dharma growth that we have and I feel so grateful to be able

250
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:39,680
to be so much opportunities now to develop teachings and develop programs

251
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:45,160
and to allow people to grow and develop and expand outwards and fill in the gaps

252
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:50,720
of what it means to be a fully developed you know Buddhist practitioner

253
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:58,800
fully developed human being in this world and how we've supported different people to individuate in different

254
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:05,640
ways uh because we offer so many different things that kind of support for Direction people to go in different

255
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:11,400
directions and and I think one of the really uh

256
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:18,839
impactful things of this growth of this community over these years is my phenomenal

257
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:26,319
appreciation of the individuals who I encounter the phenomenal uh appreciation

258
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:31,520
of the uniqueness of each person um as they follow this path of awareness of

259
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:37,520
mindfulness of care and compassion um the um there's one thing

260
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:44,839
to offer teachings and another thing to take those teachings and personalize them in each person for their own kind

261
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:52,640
of path through life to find how to support that and and coming to really appreciate the beauty of everyone and

262
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:58,480
the sincerity of people and and how each person has this beautiful unfolding that

263
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:03,640
is their own and uh it's not a cookie cutter kind of approach though sometimes

264
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:10,160
the teachings might sound that way just do this follow the breath or something but it's not the it's not cookie cutter

265
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:17,760
it's it's really it's it's opening a breathing room and space for everyone to find out kind of who they are and who

266
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:24,440
they are in this complicated world and how we participate in this world in a

267
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:30,280
rich way and uh you know I set myself up many

268
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:37,480
years ago to set my I dedicated my life to try to make this world a better place

269
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:45,040
to come to the end of suffering in this world and uh in the scale of suffering in this

270
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:50,839
in this world you know perhaps I've just done a drop maybe not even a drop of

271
00:42:50,839 --> 00:42:55,920
difference but I feel that it's phenomenal what has grown and developed

272
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:01,960
uh over these years with so many people stepping up to support and to practice and to

273
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:08,040
Dedicated that uh uh I never would would have when I set myself my dedication to

274
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:17,640
kind of to alleviate suffering the world and make that the central focus of My Life um the um I I could never have

275
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:25,240
imagined that how much we've been able to do here and now uh as we continue uh with

276
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:31,599
our community and now the expanded community of so many people like you all

277
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:38,160
um spread out across the globe spread far and wide uh it's very exciting for

278
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:44,440
me to see how it grows and how now there's new potential um during the pandemic we

279
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:52,400
expanded our potential with this with technology being able to do this now uh online and reaches more people and we

280
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:58,040
have now a whole kind of uh uh online onine Retreat Center we call it Insight

281
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:03,240
Retreat online that is offering Retreats for people online that have been very

282
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:08,599
very impactful and so to watch this growth and this development and now I

283
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:14,800
find myself still quite inspired what we're doing here and quite inspired by

284
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:22,440
this my role as a Visionary and quite inspired by the potential that's still here and how

285
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:29,440
we're still growing and developing in this field of generosity and um it's very important for us to do

286
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:36,400
it in a dharmic way in a way that's relaxed and doesn't Force anything but

287
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:43,640
uh I take Delight in the dayto day of what we do here and the momentum of and

288
