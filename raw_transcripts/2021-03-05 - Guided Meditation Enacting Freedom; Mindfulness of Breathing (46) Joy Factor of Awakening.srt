1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:09,120
so welcome to this meditation session

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:18,240
and a valuable perspective on mindfulness meditation

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,720
is that it is the enactment of freedom

4
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:34,160
where expressing in in mental action our capacity to be free

5
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:43,680
so when we decide to be mindful of something something as simple as mindful of the breathing we are making a choice

6
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:51,840
when the mind wanders off in thought and you're mindful enough to and

7
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:59,600
choose to be mindful rather than wandering off in thought when you're mindful enough to choose

8
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:06,320
beginning again with your breathing that's an expression of freedom to

9
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,400
choose what often happens is that

10
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:19,840
we will what comes along with that choice and which obscures the freedom is ideas

11
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,320
that i didn't do it well enough i need to do it better i should try harder i should

12
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,400
strain push make more effort all these uh you know that i'm a lousy

13
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,960
meditator or someone else is doing it better than me or the real thing is something different

14
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,079
and all these ideas and all these get carried along and all these shoulds

15
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:50,479
get carried along and obscures the fact that for one little moment

16
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:59,119
there was an ex an enactment of freedom the freedom to of where our attention

17
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:05,360
can be focused and uh and we and so to appreciate that

18
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,920
moment that initial moment that moment that's independent and free of all the thoughts

19
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,760
agendas fears that we might have all the ideas of self

20
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,599
that kind of come along with it obscures the fact that we have just

21
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,959
enacted a small little moment of freedom

22
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:38,480
and if then we choose to investigate to explore to look

23
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,239
more closely at the experience they're also

24
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:52,400
it's an enactment of freedom it's a freedom from our preoccupations

25
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,519
from all our judgments and reactivity

26
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,120
so to be first to be mindful is a little freedom from preoccupation from being

27
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,239
pulled into a world where we're trapped or not free

28
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:16,640
of thoughts ideas fantasies judgments just simple be mindful of this

29
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,560
that freedom is enacted a little bit more strongly in the initial moment we decide to look

30
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,840
more carefully and that's often obscured the freedom because

31
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:34,560
we think that we have to be successful there's it's an exam and we're gonna get it tested if we you

32
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:42,239
know how well we discover what we're gonna what's there and there's some magic key that we have to see and

33
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:49,920
and i have to really strain now and look and analyze and all these other ideas that obscure

34
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:58,840
the simplicity of the moment of looking more carefully looking what is this that's an enactment of

35
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:06,799
freedom and as we see more clearly the choices we make become

36
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,799
an enactment of freedom the choice not to strain as we look at our

37
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:20,400
breathing as we meditate on breathing the choice to

38
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:29,280
turn our attention from the breath to look at how we're being critical of ourselves

39
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:36,800
in the criticalness lost in that there's no freedom but in the moment of turning around to

40
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:44,000
look at it a choice to look at it rather than just going along with it is also

41
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,040
an enactment of freedom to see what is helpful and not helpful healthy and not healthy

42
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:57,840
and to choose the healthy is an enactment of freedom

43
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:06,720
and so to begin appreciating no the little hints the little hints of freedom in

44
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,560
mindfulness investigation in effort

45
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:23,120
and as we appreciate it we can that appreciation

46
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,560
is a pleasure that appreciation can be

47
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:36,160
can give rise to a contentment oh this is the path to freedom

48
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,280
i'm on a good i'm discovering something helpful here

49
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:50,479
they can give rise to joy the joy of freely

50
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,840
being aware of our experience

51
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:02,880
and then there can be even affection for the difficult things because we're

52
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,840
aware of them with our freedom

53
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:16,000
so as these seven factors awakening develop first they develop as little hints

54
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,759
little as little intuitions of how they're there but as we do this meditation perhaps you

55
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:31,199
can sit here now with an intuition the hints a recognition

56
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:41,440
of how you enact freedom in choosing to be mindful investigate

57
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:48,000
make effort and the freedom that's found before all

58
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,199
the complexities we bring to those things in their simplicity

59
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:03,039
so to sit to assume your meditation posture

60
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:10,319
and some of you probably didn't recognize that in assuming your posture you were expressing your freedom

61
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:17,520
there is a choice free will choice to now adjust your posture

62
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,319
take a posture

63
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,840
and then to gently close your eyes

64
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,960
and as you're sitting here with the eyes closed

65
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:48,400
what is the simplest freest way that you can allow yourself to be aware

66
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,120
of your body

67
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,560
a choice a free will choice if you want to take it

68
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,280
to become aware of how your body is right now

69
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:17,840
before preferences before likes and dislikes

70
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:26,400
just aware

71
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:33,520
and then to take a few long slow deep breaths

72
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,839
as you exhale relax into the posture

73
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:50,640
deep breath in exhale relax the whole body as if the posture

74
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,320
relaxing is a homecoming to this posture

75
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,680
and then letting your breathing return to normal

76
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,200
and as you exhale softening the muscles of your forehead

77
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:29,519
and temple and if they don't soften or relax

78
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:37,839
maybe you can the awareness of it can be spacious and open

79
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,839
as you exhale softening around the eyes

80
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,800
the cheeks

81
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,839
the jaws

82
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:14,160
as you exhale maybe there can be a relaxation and opening

83
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:21,839
in this the back of your neck the vertebrae just below the skull

84
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:33,839
can they soften and relax

85
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,800
softening as you exhale around the

86
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,839
collarbones

87
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:01,839
and then releasing the shoulders

88
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,320
as you exhale relaxing the chest

89
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:29,839
the heart center

90
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,839
and then softening the belly

91
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,839
in the lower half of your torso

92
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:11,519
lower back the hip area hip joints

93
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:25,839
and down your legs

94
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,279
and then gently calmly

95
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,160
become mindful of your breathing

96
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,920
and can you as you're mindful of breathing

97
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,519
feel or perceive how the choice to do so

98
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:03,519
if it's your own is it small little enactment of freedom

99
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:21,839
freedom from the tyranny of thinking just mindful for a moment

100
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:47,600
receptive to the inhalation receptive to the movements of the body

101
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,480
as you breathe in

102
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:02,079
and is there some way that that simple receptive awareness

103
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:09,040
have qualities of freedom independence

104
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:21,839
for a few moments maybe awareness free of being hijacked by thoughts and

105
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,240
ideas and judgments

106
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:45,839
simple awareness receptive to breathing

107
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:55,680
as you exhale allowing the exhale and allowing awareness

108
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,440
is there some freedom and awareness that is so simple it just allows the

109
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,160
experience to be there

110
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,839
even if you are thinking and judging

111
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:22,399
maybe part of the awareness of breathing can feel like there's freedom there

112
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:41,839
a silent freedom spacious open

113
00:15:51,680 --> 00:16:00,079
and very gently exploring the experience of breathing

114
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:09,839
feeling it more fully more clearly not dramatically so just a little more

115
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:16,000
and in that choice to explore and feel it more fully

116
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:23,279
there's also an enactment of freedom

117
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:37,839
enactment to be aware rather than being pulled into thinking

118
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:10,079
and if you find yourself thinking and you choose to begin again with your

119
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,558
breathing

120
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:22,400
that's an enactment of effort which might also contain

121
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:33,840
some freedom freedom of choice freedom of where your effort is placed

122
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,760
if while you're inhaling you choose to be with the inhale

123
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:09,760
but then when you exhale the choice becomes to be with the exhale

124
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,840
it's a simple enactment of liberated

125
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,840
effort

126
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,679
into whatever degree however small

127
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,320
you can feel that your practice enacts

128
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:42,160
freedom even if you keep getting caught and

129
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:47,279
thought and preoccupied in it

130
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:56,240
even so is there some little corner of awareness of effort

131
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:07,200
will you feel your freedom

132
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:14,799
and to appreciate that to feel the pleasure of that

133
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,880
maybe even the joy of that

134
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:39,440
appreciating our freedom is also an enactment of freedom

135
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,320
feeling the joy

136
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:54,480
of liberated mindfulness

137
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:04,240
and then it doesn't matter so much what we're mindful of

138
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:13,280
because we delight in mindfulness itself

139
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:21,360
we delight in investigation there's a delight in this effort or

140
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:31,840
choice that has qualities of freedom in it

141
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:40,400
and there's freedom in enjoying

142
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:46,559
the joy of freedom as we practice mindfulness

143
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:53,600
no matter what we're mindful of there can be a delight

144
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:59,840
in that freedom

145
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:22,720
if you find yourself caught up in thought or caught up in anything

146
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,640
if you allow yourself to clearly know that that's the case

147
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:39,840
there is some quality of freedom in that clear knowing

148
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:49,039
see if you can build on that freedom expand that freedom

149
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,840
by doing it again and again

150
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:29,840
in the last 10 minutes of this sitting perhaps you can feel your way

151
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:34,799
to stay close to where you're free

152
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:42,399
the freedom which is closely related to simplicity of being

153
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,919
nothing complicated

154
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:59,120
recognizing the simple freedom in choosing to be

155
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:13,679
aware the simple freedom in seeing what's

156
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:26,480
happening the freedom to en to appreciate to enjoy

157
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:34,800
the simplicity of being that's related

158
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:49,839
to our freedom

159
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,640
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

160
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:05,279
imagine what it's like for what would be like for you

161
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:12,800
to be resting in the simplicity of being

162
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,839
resting in a freedom of being

163
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,920
where you're not caught up in your reactions your judgments your criticalness

164
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:34,560
not cut up in the shoulds and shouldn'ts sense of obligations and

165
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:42,560
just resting in simple freedom where you're allowed to be free you're

166
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,720
allowed to be simple and present

167
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:54,000
and in this way imagine that you encounter another person

168
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:02,240
who's also free a person who has no agendas and has no

169
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:09,040
needs at the moment is not living in their judgments or

170
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:13,839
preferences likes and dislikes

171
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:21,280
this person is also at rest at ease in their own simplicity of being

172
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:27,839
at ease in their freedom

173
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:37,680
and to sit with this person you and your freedom and they and their

174
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,839
freedom

175
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:57,599
a freedom where it makes it safe to have good will love care

176
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:02,800
friendliness for the other

177
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:12,318
and perhaps you can open your heart safely fully

178
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:20,800
a meeting of hearts each of you independent and free

179
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:27,839
without any need from the other content to sit with each other

180
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:31,040
appreciating each other

181
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:41,119
and how much can you open your heart your good will your friendliness in this

182
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:47,200
circumstance and now imagine that you can do that

183
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:53,920
with others who are not so free people who come with agendas and

184
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:59,359
preferences and needs imagine that you can rest in your

185
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:05,838
simplicity of being even then

186
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:10,960
and without them necessarily knowing

187
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:18,960
to continue with your good will your friendliness

188
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,119
choosing freely choosing

189
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:36,240
goodwill and may it be that we learn

190
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:45,359
through this practice to open our good will to all beings

191
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:52,480
equally while being rooted in our capacity for

192
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:57,599
freedom freedom that allows us to return to a

193
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:01,839
simplicity of being

194
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:12,640
so that we might genuinely feel and think may it be that all beings be happy

195
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:18,880
may it be that all beings be safe

196
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:29,839
may it be that all beings be peaceful

197
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:35,760
may it be that all beings be free

198
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:45,040
and may i in my capacity for freedom

199
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:54,000
help make this possible at least radiating for me

200
00:46:54,160 --> 00:47:02,160
comes good will and safety for others

201
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:11,838
may all beings be happy

202
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:39,839
continuing on this series of the seven factors of awakening

203
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:46,559
the factor for today is joy

204
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:55,200
and joy is the particular joy that's a factor of awakening

205
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:03,440
is really a product of doing the practice of mindfulness so it's not a

206
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:10,400
joy that comes from reflection and that wonderful things are happening to us in the world

207
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:16,559
it's really a joy that rises out of the practice doing the practice really engaging in

208
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:21,839
the practice in a kind of sincere wholehearted way

209
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:32,839
and i'd like to think of this joy as being also a expression or enactment or

210
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:38,480
manifestation of our freedom that grows as we do the practice of

211
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:46,800
mindfulness and that these seven factors of awakening all can be seen as

212
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:53,520
enactments of freedom and rather than waiting for freedom to

213
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:59,760
occur in a big bang of enlightenment down the road if we just huff and puff

214
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:08,000
and get concentrated enough and still enough and then eventually maybe by magic there'll be a big aha

215
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:16,160
moment or a big transformation moment boom and now you live happily free

216
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:24,240
for the rest of your life you have it made in enlightened retirement

217
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:35,280
it's much more i think valuable to appreciate that we're beginning to move

218
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:40,800
we're taking a seed a a little of freedom the potential for freedom

219
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:46,160
inside of us and germinating it caring for it carefully in the greenhouse

220
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:51,440
tending to it carefully transplanting it out into the world

221
00:49:51,440 --> 00:50:00,240
and letting it grow and develop and and mature into something into freedom full freedom

222
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:08,000
because then we're beginning to take a little bit more responsibility for this freedom thing ourselves rather than thinking that you

223
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:14,720
know something else is going to do it for me and so these lit beginning to tune

224
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:21,839
recognize little movements of freedom that we all use all day long in fact i would

225
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:27,760
venture to guess that most of us have more moments of freedom through the

226
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:32,800
day than non-freedom but the reason we don't

227
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:41,440
feel like we're free is that we prioritize our our attention we let our attention prioritize or focus

228
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:47,119
on the ways that we're unhappy or the ways of what we want

229
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:53,839
what we don't want we get swept up into the world of thinking

230
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:59,839
where in the thinking there's not much freedom more often than not for people we're

231
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:06,240
kind of hijacked by our thoughts our concerns our fears our desires

232
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:15,280
and so it might seem that in the important ways psychological ways that we're not free

233
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:20,240
but there are plenty of ways that we are free

234
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:28,079
when you if you sit down in a chair you have a fair amount of freedom about

235
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:33,680
how you adjust yourself into that chair and you probably never really gave me

236
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:40,240
much thought to how you sat in the chair and how you adjust your yourself to be comfortable

237
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:46,480
but that movement of sitting down and choosing how you sit in the chair

238
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:51,838
is an expression is a manifestation of some freedom

239
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:59,280
reaching forward to open your front door is an expression of freedom that you can

240
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:05,680
do that there are people who can't do that for all kinds of reasons

241
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:13,520
there's lots of little moments of where you choose to do something and there's a freedom in doing it

242
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:21,920
as we start doing mindfulness practice to begin recognizing how mindfulness itself

243
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:28,079
can be an enactment of freedom and that's hard to do if mindfulness is

244
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:34,400
burdened by shoulds and shouldn'ts and gotta do better and supposed to get somewhere and

245
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:40,079
am i there yet then i'm not a good meditator and someone else is a better meditator or

246
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:45,520
i'm supposed to bear down and really strain and what's important they say is continuity

247
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:53,680
of mindfulness so i'm really gonna when i'm mindful i'm just just gonna be mindful i'm gonna you know really push and make strong

248
00:52:53,680 --> 00:53:01,760
effort you know and really strain so all this extra stuff comes along with mindfulness

249
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:07,440
a moment of mindfulness is something is phenomenally simple

250
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:14,160
and if just just to know in the moment what's happening and in fact you have many of these

251
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:20,079
moments throughout the day where you know something without the burden of anything more thing more

252
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:26,880
complicated than knowing that it's doing there chances that you open that door

253
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:33,200
half the time at least when you open the door you just know you something inside of you no it's a door

254
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:38,720
no it's a door handle and it's not anything more complicated than that

255
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:45,440
you're not comparing your door handle to your neighbor's door handle and who has the better door handle and

256
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:51,280
i should have a better door handle it's just a door handle

257
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:57,280
but the practice of mindfulness is also the practice of appreciating

258
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:02,319
that simplicity of awareness in the moment

259
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:08,480
and seeing can feel an enactment of freedom there's freedom in that knowing before

260
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:17,359
all the extra stuff is added on top of it and then the ch the freedom to choose

261
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:26,000
to investigate as soon as you choose to investigate to look more carefully to recognize more carefully what's here

262
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,839
you're not being swept off in your thoughts you know it's being swept off in your

263
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:37,920
agendas desires wishes there is it's a little movement i'm choosing not

264
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:43,520
to be the old way i'm choosing to take a better look to give a second look to what's

265
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:49,119
happening and that's enactment enactment of freedom

266
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:56,640
effort being having to do with choices choosing the endeavor which is more healthy for us

267
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:04,480
as soon as we make a choice towards health towards skillfulness to wholesomeness we're enacting our freedom

268
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:09,839
as i keep saying we don't recognize it so much because many of us carry with us this

269
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:15,680
huge huge huge backpack everywhere we go of shoulds and

270
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:23,119
desires and agendas and self-concepts and self-criticism and aversion and all this

271
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:30,880
stuff that we carry along and so we don't because of that heavy backpack we don't recognize

272
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:38,799
the ease and simplicity and freedom in these choices to move in the healthy direction

273
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:44,559
so part of this practice is begin recognizing something that's probably there in to

274
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:49,599
some degree all along the enactment of freedom the expression

275
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:55,119
of it and that brings us to joy

276
00:55:55,119 --> 00:56:03,440
the word joy is pity p-i-t-i and it means uh usually translates joy

277
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:09,839
sometimes as ecstasy sometimes as rapture but that's a particular theravada slant

278
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:17,760
on this or a meditation slant on this word pity it could also mean pleasure it can mean delight

279
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:23,520
enjoyment in sanskrit the pretty the sanskrit word can also

280
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:29,040
mean friendliness and pleasure and affection

281
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:37,280
which i think begins showing that it's a it's an emotional quality sometimes pure you know it's in

282
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:42,960
we're tapping into an emotional connection to the practice and to being free and what's being present

283
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:49,760
that comes from a kind of an emotional contentment i contentment i'm doing a practice i'm

284
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:55,760
practicing a path of freedom this is worthwhile this is a

285
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:02,160
healthy thing to be doing and we're enacting the freedom which

286
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:07,599
feels so good to feel like we're not

287
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:13,839
entangled trapped caught in things because the awareness the mind has

288
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:21,359
become free in the enactment of these freedoms and so the continuity of this free act of

289
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:27,680
mindfulness the continuity of mindfulness of concentration tends to give birth to

290
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:33,839
a variety of different kinds of contentment joys happinesses

291
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:40,000
and there's different all kinds of different types but some of it is simply like it's like

292
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,520
if you go to if you slide down a long long slide there is a joy of that freedom of just

293
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:51,119
letting go and going and it's just a delight

294
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:56,400
so the same way if you can have the continuity of these moments of freedom

295
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:03,280
continuity of choosing and engaging and being mindful and aware there's a feeling that oh

296
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:08,960
we'll start getting a more taste for that freedom and it feels like not necessarily a slide but

297
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:18,000
the same kind of the continuity gives birth to a joy and delight and boy am i lucky this is a great thing

298
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:25,040
it's not so evil it's not so much we evaluate that we you know it's not like we thinkers think our way into that

299
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:32,400
but there's a delight a joy a gladness just in the in the freshness in the

300
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:39,599
you know it used to be in the united states there was a reference point to the joy

301
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:46,400
of driving on an empty open freeway open highway

302
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:54,400
you know we don't think we'd be forgotten what that is like but this you know this joy this open

303
00:58:54,400 --> 00:59:01,680
you know free free highway of meditation of practice and the the amazing thing about this is

304
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:07,839
that then it doesn't matter as much whether what's happening to us is

305
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:13,920
pleasant and unpleasant because we discover how to be free and then be mindful aware

306
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:19,599
investigate make healthy choices this inner freedom is discovered even when

307
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:24,880
things are unpleasant even when things are in the world around us are not so

308
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:30,000
good and what an amazing thing to have discovered

309
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:37,359
that because we know how to be mindful because we know how to investigate and make choices and appreciate that we're

310
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:43,920
doing this there can even be joy and delight when conventionally when the world expects us

311
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:51,200
or even our people in our people want us to be miserable you're supposed to be miserable when i'm

312
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:57,200
miserable so you're supposed to be miserable we're supposed to commiserate in our commune in our

313
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:02,960
miserableness isn't it terrible things are awful

314
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:10,559
so what happens as we start moving through these factors of awakening and when i say what i'm about to say you

315
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:17,040
