1
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:10,000
so welcome to our earlier

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,400
meditation session and longer meditation of 45 minutes

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:23,920
and i'm very happy to be doing this with you and experiencing this

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:32,160
and so to introduce this meditation

5
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,280
i would like to say that um

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,040
the difference between someone who is a beginner in meditation and someone who's

7
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:50,079
practiced a long time doesn't have to be very different

8
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:57,280
if both people are entering the practicing meditation

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:04,239
is simply the there's something about the

10
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,920
simplicity of practice which is valuable for those

11
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,600
who are beginning and is part of the full realization

12
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:22,000
of those who mature in the practice and there's something

13
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:29,840
wondrous about being with the breathing in a simple way

14
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,840
as possible it's a wonderful challenge to do so because what gets

15
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,840
revealed are all the ways that we make it more complicated

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,920
all the ways that we have high expectations demands for how it should be the ways in which we judge ourselves as

17
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,000
things aren't quite right we're doing it wrong um ideals that we're trying to live by

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:04,000
or things we're trying to escape and to avoid experiencing and slowly over practice uh the movement

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,520
is to greater and greater simplicity which means that when we're sitting meditating with the breathing

20
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,680
it is it is

21
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,720
very forgiving that we're allowed to be as we

22
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:33,040
are in this simplicity and the art the key is a simplicity of awareness

23
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:42,000
just to be aware and and that is enough and

24
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,480
so to be aware of what's happening in the moment

25
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:56,000
and and to be with your breathing anyway so that's

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,280
what i'd like to suggest this morning is a simple attention to breathing

27
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,040
so to assume a meditation posture

28
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:14,879
that you might be able to be stable and still

29
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:22,560
for the duration of the sitting and to gently close your eyes

30
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:30,080
and and to

31
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:38,079
then simply be aware of your body

32
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:47,840
be aware of how the body is

33
00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:01,840
and then within this body take a few long slow deep breaths

34
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:09,040
partly as an embodied reminder that for this time sitting here

35
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:17,919
we're going to sit in the middle of our body allowing it to be as it is breathing

36
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:29,840
breathing in and breathing out

37
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:38,160
and as you take a deep breath in then on the exhale relax

38
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:46,560
the body in a certain way tension in the body

39
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:56,320
involves our making things more complicated than they need to be

40
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,680
and so if it's easy to relax the shoulders

41
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,840
relax let go

42
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,840
soften

43
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:39,840
and then to let your breathing return to normal

44
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:54,479
and again as you exhale to continue to relax places that are easy to soften

45
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:07,840
relax the belly letting the belly hang forward down

46
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,840
again softening some in the chest

47
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,560
and the shoulders

48
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,840
also maybe relaxing the face

49
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,960
and as you exhale relaxing

50
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:10,639
the mind any sensations of pressure tightness agitation

51
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:17,840
that's connected to thinking or to the brain

52
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:05,360
and then in in now just settling in to the experience of the

53
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,479
body breathing by finding where in your body

54
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:16,319
it seems easiest or perhaps even most pleasant

55
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:24,400
to experience breathing for some people it's in the belly

56
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,759
some people in the chest some people in the nostrils the air goes

57
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,240
in and out

58
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:43,519
and now to take the experience the experiencing of breathing for granted

59
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,600
experiencing breathing

60
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,560
is the meeting it's a place where awareness

61
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,680
and the body meet

62
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,240
it's the meeting place of awareness

63
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,320
and the body breathing

64
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,120
it's a bit wonderous the simplicity

65
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,839
of experiencing breathing

66
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,360
and then to hang in there with the breathing

67
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:09,040
to trust the simplicity of experiencing the breathing

68
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,120
and if anything it takes you away from that or distracts from that

69
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:24,959
maybe take a little bit deeper breath and gently lovingly begin again with

70
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,600
your breathing

71
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:37,040
appreciating that nothing else needs to be figured out or thought about or

72
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:47,839
that for now

73
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:56,160
meditation unfolds

74
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,560
with a simple experience

75
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,560
of the body breathing

76
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,839
being aware of the breathing

77
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:28,720
as you're with your breathing you might in

78
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:35,839
in a simple way for a few breaths notice

79
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:44,880
that part of the inhale where the inhale just feels like

80
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:53,600
it's doing you it's doing itself it started and it's just going to continue

81
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:02,320
natural clear way just that's what's unfolding is the inhale

82
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,320
maybe it doesn't start at the beginning of it but at some point the inhale just

83
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:17,839
is on a roll it's just going to happen

84
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:28,240
and when that happens allow for it the simplicity of awareness

85
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:35,760
is the simplicity of just allowing that experience to come to awareness

86
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,480
and notice in the exhale that point in the exhale

87
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,279
where exhaling is just happening and it's on on its own

88
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:59,839
it's gonna it's gonna complete itself if we allow it

89
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:27,839
allowing ourselves to be aware of breathing in and breathing out

90
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:57,760
if your mind is thinking a lot you might very very softly in your mind

91
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:03,360
say to yourself the thought in as you breathe in

92
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:10,000
and out as you breathe out just to give the thinking mind something

93
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,400
to do to do that keeps you on track with the

94
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,840
breathing

95
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,880
as you breathe in receive the inhale the experience of

96
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,360
inhale

97
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,840
with an attitude of allowing it to arrive allowing it to unfold

98
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:45,840
maybe noticing that part of the inhale that's doing itself

99
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:52,799
as you exhale receive the experience of exhaling

100
00:21:52,799 --> 00:22:00,400
allowing it to proceed allowing that sense

101
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:08,158
that part of the exhale that's doing itself it's going to continue

102
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:13,840
to the end of exhaling

103
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:51,840
mm-hmm so

104
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:23,760
and for a few breaths as you inhale notice

105
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:32,320
the thinking mind if there's pressure or tension or energy there

106
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:42,880
notice it on the inhale on the exhale relax soften the thinking mind

107
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,679
so the pressure to think is not so strong

108
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,720
sometimes relaxing the thinking mind letting go of thoughts

109
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,679
can be like making more room for the breathing

110
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:13,520
and then to allow the breathing to fill that room

111
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:25,840
feel the space of awareness

112
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:51,440
and then without thinking about it in what way might you experience the

113
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:57,760
simplicity of breathing

114
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:15,840
the simplicity of awareness of breathing

115
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:54,240
relax open up and allow yourself to experience

116
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,320
the fullness of breathing

117
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:06,720
the fullness of how you are experiencing breathe breathing

118
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:12,000
in the simplest way without any thoughts

119
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,320
thinking about the experience just experiencing it feeling it

120
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:25,840
embodying awareness of breathing

121
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:11,440
and then coming to the end of this sitting

122
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:17,119
i'd like to mention that for those of you who are new

123
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:24,640
that we end this sitting with a variation what in buddhism is called dedication of

124
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:30,640
merit it's a way of

125
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:38,319
offering up whatever benefit we receive through the meditation out into the world to benefit the world

126
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:44,560
itself and it's a little bit the principle of a

127
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:52,319
song my kids saying in kindergarten that was had the refrain

128
00:41:54,560 --> 00:42:03,839
now that when something like

129
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:11,520
that if you have any love give it away give it away give it away

130
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:18,240
because you'll only have more you'll end up having more

131
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:25,680
so this idea of letting go and offering to the world whatever calm or

132
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:31,520
subtleness whatever whatever known or unknown

133
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:38,400
benefits we received from meditation is opening up and letting go

134
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:45,440
releasing that continues that letting go releasing settling of

135
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:51,040
meditation itself and doing so without having any

136
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:56,480
boundaries or barriers maybe

137
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:04,240
for our good will and so directing our attention now out

138
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:10,839
into the world opening ourselves turning ourselves inside

139
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:16,160
out and may whatever benefit goodness

140
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:22,000
merit that has come from our practice together

141
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:30,480
may we share it with others both knowingly

142
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:37,119
intentionally and unintentionally may we go through the day sharing our

143
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:41,838
goodness with others our good will

144
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,560
may all beings be happy

145
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:54,720
may all beings be safe

146
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:59,680
may all beings be peaceful

147
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:08,640
and may all beings be free

148
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,318
and may we contribute to that

149
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:31,449
possibility [Music]

150
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:56,319
no sound i turned the sound off to take my glass of water and forgot to turn it on so i wanted to

151
00:45:56,319 --> 00:46:02,880
say that for those of you who joined um

152
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:09,599
at seven o'clock that for this week we're starting at 6 45 so we have 45 minutes sitting

153
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:15,200
rather than 30 minutes partly so that it feels like after

154
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:22,880
doing this early morning sitting since march many of us are ready to

155
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:29,119
um to um know sit longer

156
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:34,319
and uh and also the teachings of anapanasati that we've been

157
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:41,280
doing i think probably benefit a little bit with more sitting and but you know if seven o'clock works

158
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:57,838
best for you you're quite welcome to join then just know you're joining and you know as it's already started

159
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,720
so

160
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,839
so it's one of the i think

161
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:20,960
wonderful things that simplicity is one of the

162
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:27,280
hallmarks one of the characteristics of this meditation practice and sometimes that's not quite seen

163
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:33,520
because sometimes teachings teachers like me might give all kinds of instructions and it might seem like there's a lot of

164
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:39,119
instructions to keep in mind a teacher i i knew when i was in india

165
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:47,359
named munindra menindraji he was a student of many of the early western

166
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:55,359
practitioners of vipassana he had many wonderful sayings and one of

167
00:47:55,359 --> 00:48:00,559
them was if it's not simple it's not vipassana

168
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:06,480
and and so the idea is to keep it simple so how is it that this practice is

169
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:11,599
simple it's simple by relying on

170
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:18,559
the simplicity of how we can be aware of something and to be aware maybe in the simplest

171
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:24,240
possible way and and and for each of us

172
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:31,440
and in each of us at different times what it means to be aware will be different and so that part of

173
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:36,960
the fascination of it all is to see how the uh what what we call attention

174
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:42,800
or awareness shifts and changes um depending on how subtle we are how focused we are

175
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:49,920
and and the kind of attention that's useful in any given moment but the guideline is to always keep it

176
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:55,440
simple and partly that means not to be

177
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:01,520
striving for it to be different not to be trying to engineer your

178
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:08,000
meditation to get it just right it's partly to partly means to

179
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:14,240
not be trying to avoid experience and get away from something is not trying to overthink the

180
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:22,000
experience or think our way into something and trying to figure out analytically even what's the right way

181
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:26,720
and it's also not trying to do too much at once

182
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:36,000
the idea is to kind of be content with just being

183
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:43,280
now just being is not the end game of meditation but it's kind of a reference point for

184
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:48,960
keeping it simple rather than a lot of doing there's a lot of being

185
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:56,640
and in that being in the simplicity to allow whatever the native awareness is

186
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:03,440
allows us to know that we're in the present moment to be there and surface and show itself

187
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:11,359
because the mind drifts off in thought a lot and is caught up in thought that um then to

188
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:16,480
um one of the things that many people find useful and it's not necessarily

189
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:21,680
useful for everyone and then teachers can give other instructions

190
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:28,720
but is to the simplicity of breathing and the breathing is kind of like the

191
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:36,880
the sometimes you use like the the anchor line or the tether or the support for staying in the

192
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:42,559
present moment breathing is always in the present moment it has a rhythm to it

193
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:48,480
it's not a fixed experience it's a flowing or moving or changing experience and there's

194
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:54,559
something about attention following a moving changing phenomena

195
00:50:54,559 --> 00:51:00,960
that makes it easier to be relaxed in the present moment kind of like if we're watching a uh

196
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:07,280
we're sitting under under a tree relaxing in the shade of a warm day watching

197
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:13,119
maybe the river go by and we're kind of just watching the ripples and the little wavelets and

198
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:20,160
the currents just flow and flow and we're not studying it intensely we're just kind of

199
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:27,440
allowing the experience to come we see it maybe clearly and there's something about that movement where the mind doesn't fixate

200
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:32,880
on something but just allows things to flow it keeps the eyes soft and relaxed and

201
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:39,839
kind of moving along with it that part of the reason why it can be very relaxing and people can spend

202
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:46,160
long periods of time just watching a river go that by or watching the waves on the beach come and go

203
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:51,440
or watch a fire just a burn and the changing patterns of the flames as we watch the

204
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:56,960
little fire the fireplace perhaps and so it's the that movement of

205
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:02,000
breathing they're coming and going of the inhale they're coming and going in the exhale

206
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,359
that um that can can work for some people a very nice way

207
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:14,559
of just keeping us in the present moment and then of course for many of us especially if you're starting uh that

208
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:23,040
can be we start getting more complicated than we need to be and and part of simplicity is to relax

209
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:28,400
around making it complicated you don't have don't hold up simplicity as is

210
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:36,000
something to strive for and and to engineer into but rather kind of take yourself as

211
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,119
you are in a certain way meditation is a come as your party

212
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:48,559
so come as you are and sit down and allow yourself to be how you are and and that allowing

213
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:55,520
and settle into it and that and uh and the art is not to let yourself be as you are and continue

214
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:00,960
and have your thoughts galloping away but allow yourself to be as you are and

215
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:07,359
then really settle into the the direct experience the embody the living experience

216
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:14,400
of how you are so there's a turning of attention inward to the body and and what is the

217
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:21,520
embodied experience of all this what's the embodied experience of our mood our emotional state our mental

218
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:27,520
state or physical state and um and because it's the simplicity

219
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:32,559
of being has a lot to do with um what our experience

220
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:37,920
here and now in the present moment the body is always in the present moment

221
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:43,760
the breathing is always in the present moment so coming here and settling into it and

222
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:48,880
then as we settle into it at some point um to tune it

223
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:55,200
become attuned to or align ourselves with the experience of breathing

224
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:00,240
and um and to be with that simply sometimes we're controlling the breath

225
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:06,960
sometimes the breath feels tight and constricted or held in some ways not particularly comfortable and so the

226
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:13,520
experience of simplicity is just allow that to be and breathe with that breathe through it

227
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:19,280
make room for it to be uncomfortable or controlled because that making a room for giving

228
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:25,280
breathing room is part of the way of keeping things simple and allowing something inside

229
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:31,520
which is not yourself your own engineering efforts your own kind of trying mechanisms of trying to

230
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:37,280
fix and change something inside of you will begin to unfold

231
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:43,839
begin to unwind will begin to release begin to kind of find itself and

232
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:50,720
so that's one of the things uh that the the in the principle of simplicity

233
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:58,000
is uh trust the simplicity of just being with experience trust trust your experience if you're

234
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:04,319
present for it even it's even if it's not necessarily ideal or comfortable or something

235
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:10,960
and then something within begins to open unravel um relax

236
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:18,799
on its own there's a very strong momentum in our body in our in our whole being

237
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:26,480
towards the release of tension towards the release of holding and tension and pushing and pressure

238
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:32,559
and and so part of this giving breathing room to ourselves and allowing things to be

239
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:37,599
is in fact this movement towards allowing for this settling this

240
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:45,920
releasing this freeing that can happen when we just keep showing up and being present

241
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:52,960
so maybe what i've said this morning that was already too complicated so i apologize but it's all

242
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:59,280
kind of an uh effort to try to point to uh just being simple and maybe the

243
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:05,680
breathing can help you with that simplicity just be with the breathing trust the breathing i like the

244
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:13,599
expression entrust yourself with breathing and uh and and then it doesn't have to

245
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:21,040
you know it doesn't make me it doesn't look so sophisticated it doesn't look so wonderfully spiritual but to keep it

246
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:26,240
simple and in that simplicity of being with experience

247
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:32,640
being with the simplicity of it feeling the embodied experience of breathing that

248
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:38,640
something will begin to settle something will begin to open something will happen that um is the

249
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:45,200
