00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:07,719
hello and welcome to our meditation session and one of

2
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:14,839
the descriptions of meditation practice is to be

3
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:21,560
undistracted and collected so one of the purposes

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:27,400
of avoiding distractions is so that our mind our

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,679
awareness our very sense of being

6
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:42,559
alive can begin to collect itself here in a composed unified

7
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:50,079
way often the mind when it's distracted is scattered it's concerned with other

8
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:56,719
times and other places and our emotions can

9
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:05,600
be scattering can be distracting ing can be uh fragmenting can be

10
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:13,400
agitating the sensations of our body can be something we're reacting to and

11
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:19,200
wanting and avoiding so not everything is not

12
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:26,280
collected together and this unification collectedness that happens in meditation

13
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,479
changes the orientation of the Mind

14
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:37,119
changes how we see ourselves rather than

15
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:45,399
seeing a particular thing and then defining ourselves by it or judging ourselves by it or pushing against it or

16
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:54,920
pulling away from it grabbing it or there is um a sense of some larger

17
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:02,680
hole a larger immersion into our totality of our

18
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:08,080
experience and while we might be very clearly mindful of the details it's

19
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:15,319
clear the details are being seen in a much wider broader

20
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:21,640
perspective so we're not fixating on anything everything works together as a

21
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:28,760
whole so this collectedness of mind collectedness collectedness of mind and

22
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,680
body so to assume a meditation

23
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,800
posture and this assuming the posture is the beginning of collecting

24
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,319
ourselves collecting all the varied ways in which we're scattered and preoccupied

25
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:54,280
and and uh our energies and thoughts are elsewhere

26
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:01,720
and we begin to bring it here invite all of who we

27
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:07,760
are to come together in this spot this place of sitting so we assume the

28
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,120
postures beginning to do this beginning of doing this

29
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,959
physically and to no longer focus on looking at

30
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:26,560
anything the eyes don't have to be focused on something so either lowering

31
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:33,879
the Gaze and an unfocused gazing on the

32
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,319
flooor or gently closing the eyes and the closing of the eyes can

33
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:46,400
feel like explicitly another step towards arriving

34
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:53,560
here collecting ourselves into this experience so the eyes are not the

35
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,560
outwardly focused away from

36
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,680
ourselves

37
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:13,319
and then to take a few long slow deep breaths as a way of saying hello to this

38
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:19,880
body this being that you are clear

39
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:26,000
contact with the body here with a deep in

40
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,600
breath and a deep relaxation as you

41
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,919
exhale tension is

42
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:49,199
fragmenting it pulls together certain muscles so they stand away or contracted

43
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,720
into

44
00:04:54,919 --> 00:05:00,160
themselves relaxing our muscles softening

45
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,360
allows our muscles to work in harmony with the rest of the

46
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:15,840
body not frozen or locked away relaxing is part of the process of

47
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,120
collecting settling in

48
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:31,479
here letting the breathing return to normal

49
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:40,000
and to continue this process of relax

50
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:48,478
relaxing but every part of the body that relaxes is invited into the

51
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:57,800
whole collecting together maybe joining the sense of the

52
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:07,160
whole body here so you unified field relaxing the muscles of the

53
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:16,319
face tension in the face is often a place where we represents how

54
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,720
we fixate or get caught up

55
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,520
in the social dynamics

56
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:31,400
concerns fears

57
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:42,160
letting the muscles of the face fall away from the skull so they can be at

58
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,080
ease softening the

59
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,400
jaw relaxing the shoulders

60
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:09,199
if they don't relax easily you might try a subtle adjustments of how the hands and arms

61
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:15,160
are placed to give the shoulders more room to

62
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:28,319
relax or if there's no relaxation in the shoulders as softening around the

63
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,960
shoulders a softening that's okay with how things

64
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,759
are softening of the

65
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:05,000
belly feeling the weight of the belly and letting it relax downward into

66
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,310
the pelvic cavity pelvic

67
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:13,399
[Music]

68
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,440
Bowl and then taking a few moments to feel your

69
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:43,880
body as globally as is easy for you is WI a sense of being

70
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:47,440
embodied as you

71
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:56,959
can with the inhale breathing into that Global

72
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:03,880
body on the the exhale relaxing the whole

73
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:26,000
body and composing yourself here means nothing is left

74
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,640
out is there anything that's happening for you that now that you're overlooking

75
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,720
or denying trying to get away

76
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,200
from that you can recognize gently

77
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,480
softly and let it know you too have a place in the larger

78
00:09:53,279 --> 00:10:01,120
hole letting the global body make space for everything

79
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:20,079
where the breathing in is a acknowledgment of all that is

80
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,040
here breathing out a relaxing

81
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
opening

82
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
for

83
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:36,760
e the waves on top of the ocean the swells that move

84
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:45,079
through are just a surface of a vast collected

85
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:49,760
ocean that's whole that works

86
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,079
together so the waves of breathing in and

87
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:03,160
out so the Wisps and currents of thoughts and

88
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:17,600
feelings stay present here with your

89
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:26,320
breathing but open to all things within the ocean of your

90
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:34,360
experience pray present and open so all things can gather

91
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:43,360
here and have a place in the unified composed feeling

92
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,399
of being alive Here and

93
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839

110
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039

111

for

114
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
for

115

for

120
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:06,559
and then as we come to the end of this sitting to feel whatever degree that

121
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:11,120
you're more settled

122
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:19,679
calmer any degree to which now that I'm speaking you can be more aware of

123
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,559
yourself and how you

124
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:34,640
are any ways in which you feel

125
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,640
more collected or

126
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:47,960
whole content just sitting here with your

127
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:53,158
own lived experience of

128
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:59,519
now

129
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:15,480
if it's possible to make room for all of who you are either is an act of

130
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:27,519
imagination as if your very being is vast space that holds all of

131
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:36,880
who you are or as a gathering

132
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:46,679
together all the pieces of a puzzle here breathing together being

133
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:54,398
together feeling and sensing knowing all of that's

134
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:03,720
here not by thinking about it but more like feeling

135
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:12,760
sensing open no part left

136
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:25,480
out and to whatever degree that this works for you stay

137
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:32,039
there stay quiet enough as you are as you now turn your

138
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:40,080
attention out into the world around you this world that's full of suffering

139
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,919
and joys conflict and

140
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,760
friendships War makers and

141
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:59,320
peacemakers lovers and haters

142
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:07,440
for a few minutes for a minute or so hold it all as one large

143
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:13,279
hole because for this this minute or so it's

144
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:17,039
whole within your

145
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:25,799
awareness within the scope of your knowing of your

146
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:32,559
imagination all things are collected

147
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:43,519
together in a way that all things are safe with you right

148
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:59,320
now and then considering that whatever Ben benefits that this meditation has

149
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:05,279
brought you any way of being that it reminds you

150
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:10,600
of how to be that wish that you can bring a sense

151
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:15,919
of safety to all the people you meet that

152
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:21,399
they can feel safe at least from you you don't assert yourself you don't

153
00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:29,158
run away the gift of safety

154
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:36,880
may it be on this day that I walk in the world a safe

155
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:45,679
person for all that I meet may it be that in that field of

156
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:55,840
safety from me spreads out a wish a sincere desire to see the welfare

157
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:02,440
and happiness of all beings may all beings be

158
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:10,120
happy may all beings be safe may all beings be

159
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:14,919
peaceful may all beings be

so hello and welcome to this fourth talk on the five

166
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:51,000
faculties and the five to to translate a little bit more

167
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:59,840
literally from P maybe the five Divine forces within us

168
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:08,520
Divine um guides within us the literally the the qualities or

169
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:16,560
the aspects of Indra the great supreme god of the ancient Indian pan

170
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:26,919
Pantheon so this idea that we have Divinity within us um that somehow our capacities are

171
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:34,158
potentials are faculties of faith and making effort energy and

172
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:40,040
mindfulness and today concentration that there's something Divine about them they're special

173
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:45,560
they're may I dare say the word sacred we can take them for granted we

174
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:53,398
could take them for just of course it's just being human nothing special about them but in fact in Buddhism all we can

175
00:34:53,399 --> 00:35:00,839
do is special this is where the world of the Sacred or this of liberation of

176
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:06,520
nobility of dignity of uh begins in our

177
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:12,480
engagement and so hindrances we talked about last week are those that prevent

178
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:19,680
us from engaging in the world uh in a free way in a liberating way and a

179
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,720
beneficial way they they hinder the capacity for engaging with mindfulness

180
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,920
mindfully or with with um a sense of real

181
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:36,359
purpose and um and so these faculties kind of are they

182
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:43,359
alternative and so uh faith is the alternative to sensual desire

183
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:49,720
greed um courageous effort is uh the antidote

184
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:57,000
or the alternative to um ill will yesterday I didn't talk about about

185
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,160
it but uh that um mindfulness is uh the alternative to

186
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:09,839
sloth and torper rigidity freezing up and um it's not exactly an antidote but

187
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:16,359
uh uh it's clearly uh the alternative to being sloth and torper it's a shutting

188
00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:22,359
down shutting down becoming dull and the alternative is to wake up and be clear

189
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:27,480
but and mindfulness has a quality of peacefulness to it whereas and torper

190
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:34,400
has the opposite a resistance or shutting down uh it's it's uh it is kind of calm

191
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:40,480
mindfulness so that has that in common with Sloth and torper kind of it's not

192
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:46,079
activated and then today the topic is samadi often translated as

193
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:54,160
concentration and that's the antidote or the the the Cory to um restlessness and

194
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:59,520
regret restlessness and regret Keeps Us fragmented Keeps Us

195
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:06,040
agitated um samade is that which unifies and makes

196
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:12,079
peaceful uh quiet steady brings things together in a nice way so things are

197
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:19,720
operating in a harmonious flow rather than an agitated jumping around samadi is more than a laser you

198
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:27,359
know laser focus of the Mind in fact we probably shouldn't even think about it that way uh it's more the uh

199
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:36,079
one of the translators of these ancient Buddhist text biku suata sujato he um translates somat as

200
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:41,599
immersion and I love this idea of immersion because uh one of the classic

201
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:49,000
metaphors for somadi is a beautiful multicolored or many you know lotuses of

202
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,560
different colors lotus flowers floating not on the surface of the water but

203
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:00,920
opening up and floating uh under in the water under the water and um and the

204
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:06,839
idea the image is that very peaceful calm very clear and pure body of water

205
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:15,800
and just floating uh there peacefully completely immersed in the water and you these

206
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:22,599
metaphors are kind of very common even to this this in the modern world that some meditators will talk about it feels

207
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:28,720
like when they get immersed in the practice it's like they're dipping underw and if the mind starts thinking as they

208
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:34,760
go up and the head comes out and we start thinking and we let go of the thoughts and we sink down under water

209
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:42,520
and that I think that metaphor comes that idea of being underwater comes from a feeling of being immersed in a wide

210
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:48,640
field of well-being of Peace of subtleness where everything is collected

211
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:54,040
everything is held together in a peaceful quiet settled

212
00:38:54,040 --> 00:39:01,680
way uh sometimes I like the word composed for uh somebody being restless

213
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:06,880
and and filled with regrets usually we're not very composed we're unsettled

214
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:12,280
we're we're um you know we're you know quite

215
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:17,760
unsettled and uh samat is to be deeply settled here with all everything

216
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:24,920
included so to have a laser focus which people sometimes can do um uh can

217
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:30,160
actually push things aside too quickly and you people can get really focused

218
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:36,400
and deeply concentrated but they have done that by pushing aside uh their

219
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,480
distracted Minds their feelings their emotions thinking that that's the problem and they shouldn't you know we

220
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:48,520
want to get away from it get concentrated which is the better place to be but that continues the process of

221
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:55,240
fragmentation or or an exclusion of parts of ourselves from the whole the

222
00:39:55,240 --> 00:40:00,359
value of mindfulness practice is that it's an inclusive Pro practice

223
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:07,880
everything has a place in mindfulness that to be included just to be seen to be allowed to be there and to be known

224
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:13,680
but to be known so we're not troubled by anything easy to say more difficult to

225
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:21,800
do but to be present for all of it and in that state to become settled gathered

226
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:27,839
together to that from everything included not so much a lab are focused

227
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:35,520
but uh a deep settling into the into the bottom of the ocean and this beautiful

228
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:43,560
kind of soft peaceful sea or lake around us um refreshing holds it all

229
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:51,000
or and um so uh so when we're Restless when

230
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:59,119
we're agitated when we're filled with regrets um we can feel how we're uh um

231
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:05,599
you know divided up and maybe even uh troubled by ourselves or agitated about

232
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:11,079
ourselves and this kind of relaxing settling allowing things to settle back

233
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:19,040
together not grabbing things to hold them and make them whole but relaxing softening seeing being mindful of

234
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:26,800
everything so that in the mindfulness there's space there's breathing room for everything to be there and everything

235
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:33,480
wants to settle wants to come together nothing wants to remain

236
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:38,800
agitated and so samadi is an

237
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:44,520
action of inclusion an action of

238
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:51,720
unification so we start with faith confidence which is the desire to

239
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:58,440
practice sometimes we practice mindfulness with courageous effort to really this is you know the the C

240
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:05,520
courage say well this is really important clear that this maybe is the most important thing I can do because of

241
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:11,640
where it's going and then we practice with um uh a

242
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:18,599
clear Clarity of mind that's clearly accompanying our experience here to accompany everything to be present for

243
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:23,800
here to stand close to our lived experience all of it and find a way to

244
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:29,440
stand close to it that's calm the good friend not bothered but offering this

245
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:34,559
clear respectful attention to how things are that allows things to begin to

246
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:40,640
settle come together allows that kind of and then we gather things we steady

247
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:47,359
ourselves we practice continuity of mindfulness and um and so the

248
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:53,119
persistence the continuity that allows things to gather together gather

249
00:42:53,119 --> 00:43:01,359
together um come together um um little bit like um you know a snowball that is

250
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:08,040
rolling down the hill just gathers more snow and becomes bigger and bigger and maybe the cold analogy doesn't it's not

251
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:14,440
so nice but but the idea that we're we're we're we're everything is coming

252
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:20,960
in uh here because of the continuity of practice the steadiness staying here

253
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:26,640
staying with the practice mindful here every moment of mindfulness being

254
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:33,040
a breathing room for what's there so there's space for things to settle into

255
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:40,440
this big ocean of

256
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:46,839
samade and um so

257
00:43:46,839 --> 00:43:55,440
um samadi is what provides mindfulness with a feeling of uh deep contentment

258
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:01,880
satisfaction happiness peace and so it becomes easy and easier

259
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:07,160
and more and more inspiring to practice mindfulness of whatever is

260
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:13,040
happening uh without being bothered or judgmental or reactive to what's

261
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:20,520
happening and that reciprocal relationship between mindfulness and a deeper peace a deeper making space for

262
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:27,559
everything everything has a place then creates greater greater satisfaction contributes to greater and

263
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:32,680
greater sense of a wholeness the wholeness of

264
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:39,319
somebody so thank you and um so we have one more of these faculties Divine

265
00:44:39,319 --> 00:44:44,880
qualities if if you don't mind that uh we'll do tomorrow which is usually

266
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:51,000
translated as wisdom and uh and it's the Corel to the

267
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:57,520
hindrance of uh doubt or indecisiveness or in

268
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:04,920
action so um thank you
