1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:08,340
good morning everyone and it's very nice to be back here with you

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:15,480
all and and uh it's also very nice to be here just in

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:22,380
this posture my meditation posture because I feel like I'm

4
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:28,920
it's a continuity of being together with a group of people on Retreat this last

5
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,500
two weeks and it's a continuity with all the people who

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,200
I've Had The Good Fortune to meditate with and share this life and share these

7
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:47,340
teachings and explore the Dharma so and now here we are to do the same

8
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:53,460
and I'm very grateful and very appreciative of all of you being here

9
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,140
so that we can share this together

10
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:05,400
and um so

11
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,700
um a valuable question

12
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:18,720
for people doing mindfulness practice is what would I be experiencing right

13
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,079
now if I was not distracted

14
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:33,659
sometimes we miss a lot in our lives by being distracted we miss a deeper connection to our life

15
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:40,259
to in the immediacy of it as it's unfolding a deeper we make and miss a deeper

16
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:46,740
connection to ourselves and all the complexity of what it means to be a human being but to really be

17
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:55,680
present for it all and not be distracted and we if we're distracted we miss a

18
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,020
deeper connection to other people and that can simply be or not so simple

19
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:06,899
but be a deeper perception of others to take them in understand

20
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:13,160
them really be attuned to what's going on for them

21
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,660
and then we also miss the richness

22
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:27,000
the the something I would say the Prof found aspects of what happens between us as

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,180
human beings and between us and the world around us in that relationship and that

24
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:39,780
relatedness in the way that there's a give and take or there's a

25
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:45,300
ways in which how we are meets how the world is and how other

26
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:50,580
people are and in that mix there's a richness there's a profundity

27
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:57,360
there is so much of value so to not be distracted him

28
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,640
not be distracted by our judgments of what's Happening that keeps us removed

29
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,640
from a deeper perception seeing understanding

30
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:14,760
to not be uh just distracted by our

31
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:22,140
emotions especially fears and diversions and desires which Cloud the water

32
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:29,879
make it more difficult to really be present for ourselves underneath the desires aversions fears

33
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:35,159
and to perceive the world uh

34
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:40,680
more deeply than only what's seen through the lens of fear or desire or

35
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,379
aversion okay so what to happen what is your

36
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:54,540
experience of life when you're not distracted and that question can be behind any time

37
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:02,840
and place we find ourselves but it can be right now as we sit here in this meditation

38
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:12,180
and maybe you'll discover some answers to this question and at the end of The Meditation I will

39
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:18,380
offer a specific Focus for this question

40
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:24,479
but to live with this question for the first good part of this meditation

41
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:32,180
um and so I would encourage you not to answer the question

42
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:37,979
with the distracted mind meaning don't spend a lot of time thinking about the

43
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:43,160
answer which if it's commentating on the answer

44
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,620
thinking about the question or commentating about the question or or

45
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:53,699
reacting to the question just sit down and drop that question

46
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:59,580
into your meditation periodically as we go through this these

47
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:05,400
minutes together and see not what you answer intellectually

48
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:11,520
but what appears as an answer in your direct experience

49
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:19,080
of Here and Now so what is your experience

50
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,159
if you are not distracted

51
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:30,259
so to assume a meditation posture

52
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,120
and gently close your eyes

53
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:57,319
and the realm of what answers this question

54
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:05,820
is our direct experience and so they begin with a establishing a

55
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:15,000
connection to our direct embodied experience to take a few long slow deep breaths

56
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,300
a ritual of connecting to now and here

57
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:40,819
a feeling of your body from the inside out does the rib cages expand

58
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:59,600
and then letting your breathing return to normal

59
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:07,979
and for the next three or four breaths to continue relaxing your body

60
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:13,580
your shoulders your face your belly

61
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:37,940
and then settling into your breathing

62
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:44,660
perhaps with every exhale

63
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:50,240
letting go of the thoughts that have arisen

64
00:07:56,099 --> 00:08:02,419
maybe Letting Go twice once at the beginning of the exhale

65
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:09,840
and if there's enough time perhaps uh letting go in a relaxing

66
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,819
at the end of your exhale

67
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:22,280
maybe so the exhale continues

68
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,940
for a few moments more

69
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,198
relaxing into the silence

70
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:56,600
and what is your experience when you are not distracted by thoughts

71
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,820
okay

72
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,460
thank you

73
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,620
foreign

74
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:03,679
and then to add to the question

75
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:14,900
how might you appreciate others when you're not not distracted

76
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:22,320
when you're not distracted I'll make you better appreciate other

77
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,679
people

78
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:06,980
and it's customary or a deep practice

79
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:15,600
to dedicate the benefits of Buddhist practice do the welfare and

80
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,740
happiness of others

81
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:28,020
and that might begin by appreciating the value and the

82
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:34,580
importance of others

83
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:46,200
and simply that appreciating other people is the beginning of bringing them

84
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:51,559
benefit happiness well-being

85
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:59,600
and may it be that our ability to be undestructed

86
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:07,158
enables a greater appreciation of others

87
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,360
so that we're motivated

88
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:19,820
to be in the world to benefit others

89
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:27,500
may all beings be happy

90
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:31,460
may all beings

91
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:40,039
live into their potential to be happy

92
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:47,539
may all beings be safe

93
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:57,919
May there have capacity to feel safe inwardly and outwardly

94
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:02,179
come to a great fruition

95
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,240
may all beings be peaceful

96
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:17,000
May their capacity to experience profound peace

97
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,159
be easily accessible for them

98
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:28,039
and may all beings be free

99
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:39,500
May the inherit inherent possibility

100
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:45,020
of being free from oppression

101
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,360
inwardly and outwardly

102
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:59,600
may they be free of that may all beings be happy

103
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:15,839
[Music]

104
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:24,740
thank you [Music]

105
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:34,220
seems like I have to go and push another button to make all this work here hang on a minute

106
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:47,480
this okay it worked great so um

107
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:59,179
hello everyone and I'm quite happy to be here with you all

108
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:05,340
and what I'd like to do uh this week is to continue this intermittent series

109
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:13,080
that I've been doing when I'm here related to compassion

110
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:18,380
and the premise around this is that

111
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:23,640
the desire to live with compassion to be

112
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:31,260
more compassionate is supported by understanding the many things that come together to really let

113
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:36,960
allow compassion to be strong or full complete

114
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,360
and that a quick headlong movement into compassion

115
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:47,520
might be okay but it might leave out too much of ourselves it might leave too

116
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:52,799
much of our potential or the fullness the full embodiment the full

117
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:58,080
quality of compassion that is nourishing

118
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,480
that is beneficial certainly for the people we have compassion for

119
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:09,120
and also for ourselves that we don't leave ourselves out in

120
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:16,380
being compassionate and one of the reasons for that is that compassion we have the way we care for others

121
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:24,240
is so much better and cleaner if we have cared for ourselves properly if we

122
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:30,779
include ourselves as a foundation for a healthy form of compassion

123
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:35,820
so to understand the different elements and Dynamics within ourselves that

124
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:42,899
contribute to a healthy compassion is a is really important

125
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:49,320
and so many weeks ago I said there were five different elements that come

126
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:57,539
together for this kind of healthy compassion and um so there were five A's so

127
00:33:57,539 --> 00:34:03,799
awareness Attunement appreciation

128
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:11,820
aspiration and then the action and um and so to take time to understand

129
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:20,280
these different aspects of compassion and things that contribute the foundations for them and then to uh bring them along with us

130
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:26,580
when we're going to be compassionate and that can be second nature after a while as we understand it so it doesn't take

131
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:33,000
that long and or the each of these different foundations can be cultivated so that

132
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,060
they are there more often for ourselves

133
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:43,980
and so the um

134
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:49,919
so I've I've spent now a week on these different on some of these elements

135
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:55,919
there was a week on awareness and a week on Attunement and today I want to spend

136
00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:01,320
this week on the week of appreciation and I mean the depreciation is a

137
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:06,359
wonderful quality I hope that each of you understand that when you feel

138
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:13,460
appreciation for anything at all that it's a nice feeling it's an inspired feeling it's a it's a kind of a happy

139
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:21,060
feeling to appreciate something appreciate oneself appreciate others appreciate our experience our Good

140
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:26,280
Fortune what's happening and the ability to

141
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:32,579
um appreciate is a enriching experience for anybody's life

142
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:39,119
to spend more time appreciating in a realistic way the goodness the

143
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:48,140
benefits the well-being The Good Fortune we have is an antidote to spending too much time

144
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:54,839
ruminating about our Misfortune what is not going right

145
00:35:54,839 --> 00:36:02,880
and um there's a kind of sometimes a certain bias that many human beings have

146
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:09,180
for being a to of tuning in to their Misfortune and overlooking their Good

147
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:18,200
Fortune what it is to appreciate and um and some people who live lives that are

148
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:23,220
a dream for many people around the world who are poor and oppressed and

149
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:29,040
challenged in so many different ways um there's a dream that they could live that way

150
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:34,579
people who live that live in a you know and sometimes in a

151
00:36:34,579 --> 00:36:40,320
modern Western Society where there's so much

152
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:46,980
so much available for us we don't appreciate how much is available how much support how much

153
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:52,619
goodness there is how much benefit we get because we focus more on the areas

154
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:59,339
of our misfortune not to dismiss Misfortune but to put it

155
00:36:59,339 --> 00:37:05,520
in the context of something larger and put it in a more maybe a realistic context

156
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:11,700
and one of that those ways is to appreciate more and then take in the benefits of

157
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:18,300
appreciation and for compassion it's invaluable to

158
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:24,540
appreciate the people we have compassion for and to appreciate them in deep ways not

159
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:31,500
some surface way or not some policy of appreciation but really to take people

160
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:39,540
in and one way to really appreciate well is not to be distracted by our thoughts our

161
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:44,820
concerns our worries about people about what we feel we need to do not be

162
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:51,980
distracted by our sense of responsibility which sometimes can be activating and oddly enough

163
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:58,560
distance us from others if we kind of inhabit the uh the strong ideas and

164
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:05,220
feelings I should do something I'm responsible I have to do something it's up to me all of which kind of maybe puts

165
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:11,820
the focus back on oneself but to take time to be in our direct

166
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:17,160
experience to appreciate others in in deeper and deeper ways

167
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:23,700
so appreciation is a number of things one is to value

168
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:30,359
whatever we appreciate I think we value give give it value give it importance

169
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:35,700
so to appreciate other people is to see them through with if it's valuable see

170
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:42,900
if there's important to see them with uh um yeah see that they're they're

171
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:48,900
precious human beings they're valuable human beings that they're important human beings

172
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:54,300
and if we want to be compassionate to people we also need to consider what it

173
00:38:54,300 --> 00:39:00,839
is that supports people what what they benefit from and how they we they their situation can be improved

174
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:06,720
and not a few people their situation has improved if they experience others

175
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:12,240
appreciating them that others treat them as important as valuable

176
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:18,660
and just to stop and do that is invaluable

177
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:24,240
and and if we get caught up immediately we need to do something we miss the

178
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:30,839
opportunity there have been times when people homeless people have asked me for

179
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:35,940
something and maybe it's my circumstance that I'm not in a situation to provide them with

180
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:42,060
what they want and um and certainly been times in my life where I just kept walking and ignored them

181
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:49,980
but this idea that this that it's a gift to appreciate people

182
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:56,040
I've turned towards them and said hello or said I'm sorry or not right now or

183
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:02,040
but I wish you well or thank you it really stop and take them in and look at

184
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:09,540
them at least and and not to to you know to ignore them as if they're important people and so

185
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:15,359
this can be done in all kinds of circumstances in family and friends and work and that we take the time to

186
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:21,900
recognize them and they're important um and everyone is important to not see

187
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:27,140
everyone as a valuable human being in some way or other um

188
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:32,880
by looking past what they do to see their potential to see something deeper

189
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:39,300
in them than their their actions is one of the great things even people sometimes who

190
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:46,680
are doing things which are harming others sometimes they do it because they have never been valued themselves and they're

191
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:54,119
hurt and they're spreading the hurt around the others to others and the ability to stop and see them in

192
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:59,339
a deeper way than their actions sometimes transforms them that might be

193
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:06,839
beginning of what stops them from their maladaptive Behavior

194
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:14,099
so to see that everyone's important and part of appreciation also many

195
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:20,300
people feel or sometimes explained is gratitude that there's also a feeling of gratitude

196
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:26,940
that we're receiving something from others we're receiving their goodness we're receiving benefit from them we're

197
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:32,940
we're receiving you know that we benefit also from other presence of others

198
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:39,119
and what does it take to be grateful for a stranger grateful that they're alive grateful

199
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:44,220
that they connected us to life more fully grateful that here too is where we

200
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:50,460
bring our practice and our love our care here thank you

201
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:57,000
and um the um um and so the value to see the

202
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:03,119
importance of people to be grateful for people that they exist no matter their circumstance

203
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:09,000
that uh whatever their age is we appreciate them

204
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:15,119
whatever their nationality is we appreciate them whatever their race is

205
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:22,619
we appreciate them whatever their gender is and now we understand there are many

206
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:29,760
variations of gender many and to really allow people to kind of inhabit who they

207
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:35,280
are and and um and appreciate them for deeply

208
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:43,320
it would be as a gift to appreciate their sexuality through who they are sexually whatever Partnerships they have

209
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:50,040
without others whatever their orientation is and again there to appreciate the variety the richness

210
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:56,700
of uh sexual expression and and you know it's kind of pointless

211
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:02,819
to diminish people for their gender or their sexuality their nationality their race

212
00:43:02,819 --> 00:43:08,760
but to step forward and say yes hi you are important and valuable and

213
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:15,140
dignified and equal member of the human race and

214
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:21,420
people whatever ability people have and I appreciate so much now that we

215
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:28,440
understand that there's such a wide range of ways that brains operate ways

216
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:34,260
that uh abilities that people have and that each

217
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:40,160
one is if a pool the human being regardless of

218
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:45,960
or as they are and abilities and mental abilities emotional abilities physical

219
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:52,800
abilities and um and to really kind of no matter who comes in front of us

220
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:58,740
to have the first instinct the first kind of approach approach to take the time

221
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:06,599
to perceive them without distractions to perceive them without judgments to perceive them without commentary

222
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:13,319
to perceive them with a willingness and an openness and a wisdom to see this too

223
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:20,760
is a full maybe uh perfect maybe or something this too is a

224
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:26,339
human being that can be appreciated as a human being as they are

225
00:44:26,339 --> 00:44:31,400
and uh there's a lack of this in our world

226
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:38,400
probably all over we go we find a lack of people being appreciated deeply

227
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:44,280
and I know people who just simply going to the supermarket and shopping

228
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:49,700
they can feel that there's people don't appreciate them for whatever reason all

229
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:55,140
there's so many reasons we do this people who are short or feel like

230
00:44:55,140 --> 00:45:02,280
they're overlooked people who are old experienced feel that they're overlooked people ever who are of some minority

231
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:10,740
race feel that they're ignored people who display characteristics that or features

232
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:17,339
or of whatever way that people are ignored or dismissed or worse that goes

233
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:24,000
on it's a form of care and love and and

234
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:30,300
benefit for oneself and for others to appreciate them to be

235
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:36,660
grateful for them to open and allow ourselves to see them as dignified and

236
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:43,619
valuable human beings and wouldn't this be a good foundation for compassion

237
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:48,900
I said maybe less compassion is needed in this world

238
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:56,280
if we treat each other this way so appreciation will be the topic for

239
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:02,700
this week and um and I'm looking forward to I appreciate

240
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:09,060
the opportunity to spend this week on this topic and appreciate all of you for not only

241
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:16,859
being present here today for this but also so many of you have been present and for so long on these 7 A.M sittings

242
00:46:16,859 --> 00:46:24,180
as YouTube sittings and I really feel uh it's been invaluable for me and

243
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:29,460
to be able to come in in and offer these teachings and have these kinds of

244
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:35,400
considerations so I want to thank all of you and um

245
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,799
may we continue thank you
