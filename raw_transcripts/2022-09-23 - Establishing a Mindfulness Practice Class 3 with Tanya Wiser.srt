1
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:12,360
all right let's do a sound check Tracy how's that sound the volume

2
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,699
yeah not not too loud not too quiet

3
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:23,060
or no okay back there in that corner great

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,580
um so we've been having the teachers take off their masks while teaching if

5
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:35,940
everybody in the Hall feels comfortable with that are you guys okay with that okay

6
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:42,660
makes it um easier for you to hear and for me obviously

7
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:50,579
breathing in talking so welcome everyone and nice to have new

8
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:56,600
people we are in week three of a series

9
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,899
um which is not a problem if you weren't here for the first two

10
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:08,159
the first week the series is called establishing a practice

11
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:17,100
so just sort of trying to cover a lot of basic things teachings that have really

12
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:24,479
been supports for practice and so it's teaching them but not in a detailed way more like a introductory

13
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:31,860
way and so the first week we talked about wise understanding and and wise

14
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:38,119
intention um and the second week we talked about

15
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:44,040
mindfulness on and off the cushion and the five hindrances and sort of um

16
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,200
five common things that interfere with our ability to be mindful

17
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,600
this week I'll be talking about establishing actions that support Dharma

18
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,880
Joy so I think that they're all Standalone I

19
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:07,740
think that you'll be fine you're not going to get lost at all it's just sort of all the pieces that um

20
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:14,520
they're all different pieces that that support I think give us a foundation for our practice like the first week is

21
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:21,360
really about how to practice with suffering pretty important stuff so you can listen

22
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:28,500
to the recording if you want pretty much everything I've said in the talks will be on that handout so if you

23
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:34,379
sign up for the handouts I'll email them to you you can read it and you'll have all the information

24
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:40,020
that I shared okay all right so

25
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:45,720
um so you know

26
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,599
Joy I want to talk about Dharma Joy tonight and sort of

27
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:59,700
invite this idea that Joy arises as a result of actions

28
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:06,300
so Dharma Joy I'm not talking about Pump It Up try and make yourself happy

29
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:11,959
I'm talking about the joy that is a natural Joy sort of more of a a subtle

30
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:17,819
well-being Joy that comes when we feel good we feel

31
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:23,519
like that was nice or I did a nice thing or somebody was

32
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,739
kind to me it's a joy that is like sometimes

33
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:34,080
described in some ways as the Bliss of blamelessness

34
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:41,400
so that feeling of no there's no burden right that we did our best kind of thing

35
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:48,239
so Dharma Joy I'm trying to emphasize here we're not talking about simple happiness

36
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:55,799
right not just like haha funny joke or I'm happy because

37
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:02,159
you know I have enough money in my bank exactly it's a different it's a qualitative

38
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:08,220
difference it's not based on external things it comes up it arises from our

39
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:15,560
own actions and sometimes from the actions that we witness or experience around us

40
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:25,440
so with that in mind let's take a a little short set

41
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:32,759
maybe even inviting yourself during the sit to just I'll just drop in this question you can

42
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:39,720
see what comes up just is there something that comes up that you did that you can remember in

43
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,919
the last day or two week month year however

44
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:52,500
where it was an act of goodness an act of kindness an act of non-harming it

45
00:04:52,500 --> 00:05:00,360
could even be carrying a spider outside instead of killing it something like that so just if there's

46
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06,060
something like that causing extra long for somebody to walk across the cross

47
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:13,080
walk moving really far to the other side of the lane for a bicyclist

48
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:21,540
just an act that was really intended to avoid harm to create more safeness

49
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:27,259
just bring it to mind small is great

50
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:36,979
and just maybe appreciate that act and the intention behind it

51
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:52,020
may be consciously breathe in a few breaths to that to whatever it is you

52
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:57,180
can appreciate and connect with taking a little bit more time with it

53
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,440
than you might normally

54
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:31,380
and then if you'd like you can just just sort of check in take a few breaths

55
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:38,600
connect with your body just arriving here

56
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:47,000
giving yourself permission to put aside all the activities of the day

57
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:53,060
thank you and feel free to stay inward

58
00:08:54,660 --> 00:09:01,560
do you all feel like you'd like a few more minutes to meditate the room got very nicely quiet I'm happy to

59
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:08,760
take a little more time any thumbs up on that one everybody's is that a thumbs up major

60
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:14,540
okay let's take five more minutes let's just sit for five more minutes

61
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:37,279
foreign thank you

62
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,380
foreign

63
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:17,950
[Music]

64
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:29,000
thank you all welcome

65
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,019
so this Dharma Joy

66
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:44,820
and and this connection is to um you know the ethical actions

67
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:50,459
which in in really in Buddhism is about non-harming

68
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:56,700
non-harming and so Gil wrote the Buddhist emphasis

69
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:02,700
on harmlessness is explicitly directed both toward oneself and others so we

70
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:10,620
don't leave ourselves out we should not intend to harm ourselves

71
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:15,500
not intend to harm others or both

72
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:24,079
rather we should intend to benefit ourselves benefit others and benefit both

73
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:33,240
for the whole world really so the ideal of harmlessness is

74
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:40,380
literally referencing the absence of harm and you know concern for ourselves and

75
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:46,320
others so that's one part and I'll talk about

76
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:53,699
some of the specific teachings that Buddha gave for these non-hirming ethical actions

77
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:58,800
another part that I want to talk about and I'm going to start with

78
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:05,459
is that it's really healthy and and really nourishing to connect with joy

79
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:14,220
it's like we need it we need to feel okay we need to take in the goodness

80
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:20,040
and my experience that's not always easy for people to do

81
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:25,680
I think that's partly because the negativity bias in the brain

82
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:31,139
is oriented our survival is oriented toward noticing threats potential danger

83
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:39,260
or what we need to go and get so Rick Hansen he's a Buddhist

84
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:45,260
psychologist and neuropsychologist and he coined the the phrase

85
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:51,360
the negative sticks like Teflon or sticks like velcro you know how sticky

86
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:57,000
velcro is in the brain it really grabs on to anything that's negative

87
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,180
and the good slips through like an egg on a Teflon pan you just

88
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:10,500
right on through so the good stuff the subtle Dharma Joy can be more bubbly and can be very

89
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:15,899
subtle it's very easy for the brain to treat it like that fried egg

90
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:21,240
flips in and out of the pan gone bye-bye out of sight out of mind

91
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:28,500
so part of the invitation I'm going to be kind of inviting you tonight to think

92
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:36,000
about is to make a commitment to take in the good to take a make a commitment to accept

93
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,480
receive and nourish the joy

94
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:49,560
so um ethical actions really support Joy

95
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:55,860
arising because of like that idea of the Bliss of blamelessness when we haven't done anything wrong

96
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:01,380
and we know we've done things in a way that we feel okay about

97
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:08,579
we don't have to carry a heavy burden we don't have to second guess we don't have to spend a lot of time trying to make up

98
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:14,360
for things it's just lets us walk through life a little lighter

99
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:22,740
so it's um the Buddha kind of taught trainings around

100
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:28,500
three areas in particular speech actions and is a general category

101
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:35,039
and livelihood that support our walking through this life without feeling a lot

102
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:41,960
of blame and um

103
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:48,660
he he taught these things because they made him happier

104
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:54,360
they supported him and with everything that the Buddha

105
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,820
offers this is um not a commandment so anybody who has any

106
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:05,580
kind of connection to some religious traditions where there's

107
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:12,179
a lot of like sort of authority and you have to do this and you can't do that

108
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:19,260
the Buddha approaches this really differently the Buddha says come and see

109
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:24,960
engage with these practices and see for yourself what happens for

110
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:32,700
you so paying attention to the impact of operating in certain ways and how that

111
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:39,120
impacts your sense of well-being your mind States your heart States

112
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:46,200
so you know well I'll share the guidelines the rules the ethical actions he

113
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:53,220
recommends but it's really important to hold them in this way of

114
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:58,620
I'm being invited to see what happens if I act in this

115
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:04,080
kind of way and to notice the impact on myself and others

116
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:11,580
to notice how it affects my sense of well-being my sense of feeling comfortable and close with others how

117
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:16,860
other people respond to me how I what happens when I sit down in my

118
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:22,919
meditation yeah okay

119
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:27,500
because I'm not going to teach them unless you agree all right

120
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:34,260
so the first is why speech and why speech I'll go into more detail

121
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:40,320
later but just very simply it's speech that doesn't cause harm

122
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,720
is truthful it's kind and it's Timely

123
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,760
so we don't we have to be thoughtful about when we say things

124
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:59,039
right um wise action is another category

125
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:04,679
and there are three things to avoid three actions to avoid and those are not

126
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:12,419
killing not stealing and not causing harm through sexuality

127
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:19,679
so it's not you can't be sexual it's don't cause harm through your sexuality

128
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:25,620
yeah and then the third category is wise

129
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:31,559
livelihood and essentially the Buddha taught that it makes a

130
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:38,460
difference what we do for our our employment and our livelihood and some of us are

131
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:45,900
lucky we have more choices and more options and sometimes we don't so again we'll we'll practice on the

132
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:55,100
Continuum with doing the best that we can but ideally we don't work in an area that involves

133
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:02,100
making weapons right making and selling of weapons

134
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:08,100
things that cause and kill cause killing and harm um

135
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:13,200
it means um I wrote the I have the wrong list in

136
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,780
front of me um so Butch like being a butcher and stuff

137
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:24,000
like that we try not to do those things you know not having to to do to kill

138
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,419
either animals people and the trade of people sex trade

139
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:37,980
or other ways of smuggling people like those are the kind of big categories that we want to avoid and then you know

140
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:44,400
we each will come into our own work environment and you know there's a whole Continuum of

141
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,740
harming and non-harming that happens in work environments and what what a company does and how it affects the

142
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:55,860
environment there's a lot of subtleties but the big ones are just you know not

143
00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:01,559
not contributing to the killing or the ways to kill right or to trade or harm

144
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:08,700
people and animals does anybody want me to say any more

145
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:15,679
about those things right now or does that feel like good enough good enough yeah great

146
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:22,980
so one of the big supports for walking through life in a way that's non-harming

147
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:30,000
is being mindful pretty much there isn't anywhere we can go there's nothing that we can do that

148
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,100
we won't be supported by being mindful the opposite of mindful is being in

149
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:41,940
automatic pilot being checked out right just on sort of go and and not pausing

150
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:47,460
and checking and noticing how we're doing and how we're showing up right and

151
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:52,620
some of the the in some ways the trainings around why speech and wise

152
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:59,039
action help us bring and grow our mindfulness because we start to especially speech right internal speech

153
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:04,260
too you know like what are we saying in our heads how are we talking to ourselves

154
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:11,400
how are we talking about somebody else even if it's silently like we can really start to practice observing that with

155
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:17,580
mindfulness and with this commitment to not wanting to harm we can start to see how when

156
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:24,840
we're talking in our own minds even if we're not saying it out loud but we're thinking you know in harsh ways who

157
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:30,900
feels the harshness we do the person that we're upset with or the

158
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:36,780
people they don't feel that we're feeling it I mean maybe if we're around them and

159
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:42,720
we're exuding hate Vibes you know people pick up and that's not good but we're still

160
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,799
hurting ourselves when we're doing doing that and they're feeling it right

161
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:55,919
so um mindfulness strengthens it's like a muscle that helps us kind of be able to

162
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:02,220
respond instead of react in life and you know sometimes different

163
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:09,840
situations call for different kinds of responses so it's not like there's a a blanket way to be in this world so we

164
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:15,179
need to constantly be present and be assessing and viewing what's happening

165
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:21,240
so we can respond or restrain ourselves or or act sometimes it's actually the

166
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:26,640
opposite it's like we need to get ourselves to do something because we see something that's happening that's

167
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:34,260
harmful and we know we can do something to help and sometimes we're afraid but you know

168
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:39,840
if we if we if it feels safe enough and we can we need to help ourselves take

169
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:46,639
action all right

170
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:52,980
so that's kind of the summary of the kind of teachings

171
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:59,039
and now I'm going to shift to kind of talking about more practice tips and then I want to spend some more time time

172
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:06,000
talking about why speech so it's a big one and we'll do breakout groups and I'd

173
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,520
like to kind of review for you mindfulness of speaking and listening and you can practice it when you're

174
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:17,658
talking to each other all right

175
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:28,500
so um I mentioned this earlier but one really important thing that can help us and

176
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:35,220
reinforce our efforts to be mindful and to to practice non-harming is to take in

177
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:41,700
the good like to literally say okay it's like okay I'm gonna make myself a

178
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:48,600
nice cup of tea it's really delicious here it is my favorite and then we don't drink it

179
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:54,299
you know like so it's like we gotta we're gonna make the tea non-harming tea

180
00:25:54,299 --> 00:26:00,960
and then drink it like enjoy your cup of tea enjoy the benefits of your effort

181
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,559
and that's what will reinforce it that's part of what helps us kind of

182
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:12,900
recondition ourselves if you will recondition what is Habitual often

183
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:18,779
reactivity irritation impatience you know consuming into more thoughtfulness

184
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:25,320
more pausing more reflecting more caring more open-heartedness those kinds of

185
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:31,220
qualities so um

186
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:37,860
there's a if I can this just the free association

187
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:45,539
to my mind but there I just got this invitation to our Workshop and it's something like you know resting

188
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:52,080
or napping is the ultimate Act of rebellion right I really like that you know it's

189
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:58,020
like it's important to rest Joy is important being at ease is

190
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:04,200
important taking your breaks at work is important very important

191
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:10,799
you're not you're not doing anybody any favors to not take your breaks here because you're just going to Tire

192
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:18,080
yourself out you're not going to be able to be really present for yourself let alone anyone else

193
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:27,539
so take in the good take it in another thing it's really reinforcing to

194
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:34,799
um take and notice moments of Choice versus reactivity

195
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:40,080
it's it's so easy to walk away and think I should have done it even better

196
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:45,179
if I'd only done it differently or or oh that was no big deal you know like no no

197
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:53,039
no no no no every time we consciously choose to do something we're you know with this

198
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:59,820
intention these intentions of non-harming these intentions of being Mindful and we we come into a moment

199
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:05,520
where we get to choose like we say no it might be to the extra cookie or no to

200
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:12,059
you know maybe the next you know click link on the

201
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:17,880
internet or um you know just the the little ways in

202
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:24,659
our lives that we stop and we say no I don't need to keep chasing this you know where I don't need to ask this

203
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:29,880
person for another favor right these are all choices um

204
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:36,500
or instead of lashing out at somebody when they say something to you you don't like

205
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:43,340
take a breath and you pause and you wait and you wait till you're not feeling

206
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:49,440
motivated by the anger right so that you'll speak more differently or

207
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,539
choicefully choice is a superpower

208
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:59,580
there's a there's a woman called Molly Doodles or

209
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:05,700
something like that she does she does Buddha Doodles you can find her if you Google Buddha doodles

210
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:11,820
and she sends out these emails with these little Doodles and she says she has a little

211
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:17,520
Buddha with a superhero cape and her cartoon says choice is a superpower

212
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:24,480
it's really incredibly true it's a huge huge power for us to have

213
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,898
choice

214
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:36,299
another tip is um to you know I have I wrote the word

215
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:45,419
celebrate small benefits the small changes the small things that you see the small movements okay so you know

216
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:54,659
this week you sat five and a half times instead of five great right like

217
00:29:54,779 --> 00:30:00,480
um just you know oh I I was able to pause a little bit longer I didn't speak

218
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:10,320
quite as harshly great great we can get so fixated on being

219
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:16,559
critical and thinking we didn't quite do it well think about this

220
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:23,039
our attention that is like the most precious commodity

221
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:28,500
we have our attention what we pay attention to

222
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:35,480
and what we pay attention to grows in US

223
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:43,320
so if we spend our time criticizing ourselves for not quite doing it well

224
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:49,380
enough we're focusing on the negative parts

225
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:56,640
instead of on the useful helpful beneficial parts

226
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:03,720
yeah okay this is something I do a lot so you'll probably have heard me say this before but if I tell you not to

227
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:09,600
think about a chocolate chip cookie don't think about how they smell taste

228
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:16,620
don't think about what kind you like soft or chewy just just ignore me right can your mind help but know what I mean

229
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:20,539
and start to think about chocolate chip cookies

230
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:28,440
not really right it you know and and try not to think about them now Focus really

231
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:34,140
hard I'm not going to think about what they look like we're giving all of our

232
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:41,640
attention to something we don't want to be focusing on Instead This is the idea of like okay

233
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:47,820
well let's bring our awareness that's precious commodity that we have

234
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:54,659
and let's turn it toward what we do want to grow in ourselves

235
00:31:54,659 --> 00:32:01,580
give our awareness to what we want more of what we appreciate what's beneficial

236
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:07,980
very very important very important all right

237
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:15,840
um one other thing that well one other thing to talk about before I move into talking about why speech is

238
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:22,020
emotions how do emotions impact your ability to

239
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:28,620
be responsive versus reactive all right where's the microphone I want

240
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:34,559
to hear some examples of how emotions impact and so

241
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:40,260
um thank you Sage who would be willing to say something

242
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:47,580
about how emotions impact the likelihood what kinds of emotions

243
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:54,440
impact the likelihood that you're going to harm somebody else let me put it that way

244
00:32:54,899 --> 00:32:58,399
come on people's

245
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:09,360
like this can you hear me yeah yeah um

246
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:14,940
if you just let your emotions get to you you lose that pause and it's really easy

247
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:23,220
to just react uh oftentimes negatively to something someone says or does or

248
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:30,840
just something that's around you but it's pretty hard to not be emotional about things oftentimes right and that's

249
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:37,799
not the goal it's not the goal to be to not be emotional emotions are incredibly important part

250
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:43,679
of our lives they're what makes our lives rich and full and it's part of what creates a lot

251
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:49,200
of meaning but to not be ruled by our emotions

252
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,539
is what mindfulness can help us with right

253
00:33:54,539 --> 00:34:00,360
and and so it's the you know maybe you're talking specifically Brian to how it's you know you don't want to get

254
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:06,720
angry but you get angry and it's going to happen right and then it's really

255
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:13,580
hard you don't want to get angry because you don't want to say mean things or impatient things or whatever

256
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:20,339
so let's one of the things I'll do for the guided meditation later is a practice to work that can help us work

257
00:34:20,339 --> 00:34:26,878
with emotions so they're to give ourselves some skills and tools so those of you who are familiar it's the raft

258
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:33,240
practice so we'll do a guided raft practice but um

259
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:39,358
we need to learn how to be with them recognize them earlier rather than later

260
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:44,460
hopefully you know before they grow in us and get stronger and stronger

261
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:51,720
and how to relate each of us have to learn for our own selves how to relate wisely with different emotions some of

262
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:58,440
us have more comfort and less comfort with different emotions we're all unique right we have different patterning

263
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:06,180
different Role Models around what emotions trigger what kinds of things so we got we all have to come and see for

264
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:11,880
ourselves but working with emotions is huge and and being able to not harm

265
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:18,119
ourselves and not harm or others anybody else want to say anything else

266
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:26,240
about how emotions what you notice about how they can impact your movement toward harming

267
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:35,400
more a question um so

268
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:42,619
if you're mindful enough to realize that there is a difficulty motion

269
00:35:42,619 --> 00:35:48,599
seems to me that it's maybe it's wisest at least to just

270
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:55,980
stay away while that emotion's strongest rather than be in touch with

271
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:02,880
situations that you can cause harm say more Mitra like when would you

272
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:09,300
decide that that seemed like a good idea and what might you do I should stay in my room and not come out

273
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:15,240
stay in your room and not come home and when would you decide to stay in your room and not come out before I say

274
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:22,140
things before I come out and okay so so you have an opportunity so maybe you're in your room and you're seething you're

275
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:28,500
upset about something and you can see yourself rehearsing mentally you ever do that planning I can remember I'm gonna

276
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:35,940
go but I'm going to say blah blah blah right yeah it will it's not always that easy I mean I I do have to come out

277
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:40,880
eventually that's right yeah yeah absolutely

278
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:46,740
so sometimes you can and sometimes you can't just take more time let's say you

279
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:52,500
don't have very much time what could you do that might help you

280
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,520
when you do walk out

281
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:10,920
I mean the only thing I can think of is be so close

282
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,559
in touch with how you how I feel

283
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:26,760
so I don't react yeah there's something beautiful about

284
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:32,579
what you said there Mitra about be so close to what I'm feeling there's a you're not just talking about feeling

285
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:38,280
your feelings but there's a maybe like an intimacy with yourself

286
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:43,560
like witnessing and caring about how hard

287
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:51,720
your how it's feeling right now inside of yourself yeah but on at the same time keeping and

288
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:58,099
um keeping in mind that my goal is not to harm beautiful

289
00:37:58,099 --> 00:38:03,300
that's right and I never do that I can now say it

290
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:08,940
well that's not true that you don't ever do that it's not true okay

291
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:14,880
I can't lie to you I can't lie to me and remember notice are you doing when you

292
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:20,220
say it like that right are you following the negativity bias yeah for sure right

293
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:25,680
and so you're gonna grow witnessing and stomping in that land and do you want to

294
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:34,619
do that no but I never knew about that I mean read still the last few years yeah

295
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:41,000
great thank you anybody else want to say anything yeah good Caroline

296
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:54,960
uh I was just thinking about what other people had

297
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:00,000
said but there's also I find myself uh

298
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:08,460
meeting the emotion that I'm getting approached with sometimes and getting reactive there yeah because it's

299
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:16,140
you know although maybe I have some training to be like okay pause for a second before you respond maybe

300
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:23,099
um but when someone is coming at me with anger or fear or whatever it is it's really hard

301
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:30,060
to not just automatically get there and become reactive that way that's a

302
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:36,060
tough one thank you okay and I think that's really true emotions are communicated they're contagious you

303
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:42,540
could call them right you can feel it when somebody comes into a room sometimes they'll change the vibe you

304
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:49,680
know everybody gets you know really feels it yeah so number one knowing that that

305
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:56,940
happens is really important and so you know practicing mindfulness might be oh look at I'm recognizing what's happening

306
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:02,760
and and then for me there's a boundary exercise of like okay that's not me

307
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:07,980
that's not how I was feeling right before like okay this is their

308
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:13,280
feeling they can have their feeling that's the other part it's really easy to want them to stop

309
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:18,420
and you know we don't get to control that we we you know so we get to work

310
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:25,920
with ourselves like okay I don't need to own that I don't have to become that and sometimes that's enough and

311
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:32,940
sometimes it won't be enough because it's you get attacked maybe you know somebody says something harshly to you

312
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:38,220
um but staying close this the whole point

313
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:44,760
of mindfulness is to stay close to our experience to keep witnessing so that those we don't just get carried out and

314
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:52,920
we might and then we come back and then we might and we come back just don't stop coming back don't give up

315
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:59,220
don't ever ever give up it's always possible to come back always

316
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:04,680
and over time with the practice people get better at

317
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:12,240
it it gets easier part of it is um it is really like a muscle right that

318
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:17,579
we grow we get better at knowing our emotions emotions are

319
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:23,700
motivational systems they want us to take action you know that so we our body

320
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:31,440
starts to move so this is where that mindfulness the growing the power of mindfulness we can start to be that

321
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:37,740
close to what's happening that we don't get carried out before we see it

322
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:43,740
yeah so okay to shift

323
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:49,320
just to talk sort of start moving into getting ready for the breakout groups

324
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:54,540
and um yeah I think I'll just go through this kind

325
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:59,820
of quickly because I'm a little behind and I want to give you time in your groups

326
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:05,339
so part of non-harming is when we come into

327
00:42:05,339 --> 00:42:12,839
these groups and we share with each other we the idea is to like agree that we're going to keep each other's what we

328
00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:18,599
say in confidence so you know that's just a kindness that

329
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:26,300
we offer each other right so this is just an idea of how do we bring this practice into like active

330
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:31,619
use in the space so maybe you learn something a tool you

331
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:38,040
want to share but maybe you don't share about a person in particular and what they told you about that's personal

332
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:43,980
about themselves another thing in the small groups is to

333
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:50,220
consider that um if somebody wants suggestions they can

334
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:57,119
ask but that are we're not here to give advice we're here to witness to listen to

335
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:03,720
support if somebody asks for advice speak from personal experience like I have found

336
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:09,540
this helpful right these are ways of again just another way of trying not to

337
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:16,338
harm being really conscientious about your language and avoiding

338
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:23,160
avoiding things that can make somebody feel uh like their identities are being

339
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:29,400
called out in some way or another like you know our we have you know every

340
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:36,660
somebody who knows what is attached to somebody's identity but when we start to call out people's

341
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:44,339
identities we can easily move into territory that um can cause somebody to feel unsafe

342
00:43:44,339 --> 00:43:50,040
unwelcome or even if it's their own story in their head about themselves

343
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:56,640
so just being super sensitive like we're just people like if people you know like

344
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:01,920
I want to put it like that how can I put this just let people share what they want to

345
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:07,380
share and try and take it in and be as respectful

346
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:12,960
with it as you can does that make sense okay

347
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:18,900
um let's see when you have

348
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:25,079
um when you're talking if something comes up that you're sharing that has to do with a trauma a very significant

349
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:32,460
difficult experience in your life use headlines kind of like I had this really difficult

350
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:38,339
experience as a kid but don't go into the details and the reason is

351
00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:43,740
because you can trigger yourself going into the memory and you can trigger somebody else who maybe has similar

352
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:49,560
stories so the headline idea is you can reference these things but to to keep

353
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:55,859
yourself regulated keep it simple keep it simple

354
00:44:55,859 --> 00:45:01,740
all right so um I think it would be good to break

355
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:07,680
into groups and then I'll give some more tips but I think it feels like we need to

356
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:15,300
like shift s movement a little bit so how about groups of three to four and

357
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:21,359
you can just cluster if you know people I encourage you to get in a group with

358
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:28,740
different people um you don't have to but that's the encouragement okay so find three or four

359
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:35,540
people just kind of cluster and when you're settled I'll offer more

360
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:51,560
over here

361
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:07,099
nice work oh look at that okay there okay

362
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:14,900
oh and we got somebody else come on in just join a group we're just getting started with the small groups

363
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:23,040
all right so um I'll invite you to introduce yourselves in a second

364
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:30,540
um but to practice mindfulness of speech know you're talking when you're talking

365
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:37,140
kind of oh I'm talking as you're talking and when you're listening know you're

366
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:41,420
listening I'm listening

367
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:49,560
um it's easier to stay mindful if you talk a little slower

368
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:55,200
and quieter it's easier to stay connected to your body

369
00:46:55,200 --> 00:47:01,020
and easier to know what you're going to say before you say it as you're you know

370
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:06,240
like I don't mean planning I mean as the

371
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:14,280
words come out does that make sense okay pay attention to feeling of relaxation

372
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:19,980
or agitation just being mindful like keeping whether you're talking or

373
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:25,260
listening always keeping like 50 of your awareness internal

374
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:31,319
always keeping enough mindfulness with yourself even when you're listening to

375
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:35,060
track what's happening in your body

376
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:44,760
and noticing the impact of what's been shared after you speak or listen just just

377
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:50,780
letting yourself oh you wear a little bit like a bell you know

378
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:58,319
things come in and they resonate they move around us they affect us

379
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:05,599
so can you feel Can You Feel the vibration and the impact all right

380
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:13,380
so um what I would like to invite you to do is um I'll give you all these

381
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:18,660
instructions before you start one please share your names or and where you live

382
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:24,900
or something simple your favorite color maybe those three things

383
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:30,900
um and then um one at a time I'll have you go around in

384
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:36,060
the circle and share one to two sentences at a time

385
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:43,440
like not a paragraph and the question that you'll be discussing is what are you inspired to

386
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:50,520
do to support more joy of all the things that we've been talking about and maybe things you've heard elsewhere having to

387
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:56,220
do with this idea of non-harming and taking in the good

388
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:03,060
what are you inspired to do what would you like to see yourself doing differently yeah

389
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:09,540
any questions great so go ahead and start with just a go around with introductions

390
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:15,780
and and then you can one at a time just pop put in the circle like your one or

391
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:21,780
two sentence idea and then you can add more when it comes back around and then add more and let

392
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:27,060
yourself be impacted and inspired and changed by what you hear along the way

393
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:30,319
okay please begin

394
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:25,500
why is when I do the things I need to do and

395
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:31,740
letting goes like and then you know do the same thing but

396
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:34,280
relax

397
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:57,720
building inspired to invite is

398
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:02,359
doing as many expectations

399
00:51:34,819 --> 00:51:40,260
thank you please

400
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,440
together

401
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:46,079
yes appreciation

402
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:57,119
just to write down a couple of appreciations for this selfish Ness

403
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:22,200
how is it feeling does it feel like it's a one more go around or you feel you're

404
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:30,540
good you feel like you shared the most important things you got it you got it absolutely how

405
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:35,000
about one one more minute okay

406
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:45,800
go ahead and finish your sentences for sure yeah

407
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:48,680
yes

408
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:58,859
and maybe bow to your mates I heard some you know I didn't get to hear very much

409
00:57:58,859 --> 00:58:04,020
but I heard some good ideas so you know maybe just thanking yourselves and each

410
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:10,920
other for the generation of Good Vibes and energy and ideas

411
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:17,280
and um and then we'll we'll go into a guided practice so get yourself situated

412
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:22,559
for meditation and we'll do the rough practice many of

413
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:30,240
you have done it with me before some of you maybe have not um you know typically we use the raft

414
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:37,680
practice with difficult emotions but tonight I'm actually going to invite you to use how you're feeling something that

415
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:44,579
came good that was inspiring for you during this little practice tonight and sharing and connecting

416
00:58:44,579 --> 00:58:51,119
and the handout has the instructions don't worry you'll have plenty of

417
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:58,440
opportunities to practice with difficult emotions later so if if you feel so inclined my

418
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:03,540
invitation to you is to choose to savor and focus with this practice on

419
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:11,880
something you know some level of joy ease relaxation validation Comfort Care

420
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:17,280
Connection all right so

421
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:24,000
coming into your body so we've been listening and sharing certain amount of our awareness energy

422
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:29,700
goes out so let's invite it in invite it in

423
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:35,940
and with each breath you might just invite more and more of a settling

424
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:41,099
I often feel like I'm a snow globe I'm all shaken up and then I set myself

425
00:59:41,099 --> 00:59:47,480
down and I all the little snowflakes start to settle

426
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:22,640
maybe take three longer slower deeper breaths

427
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:28,399
ah [Applause]

428
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:51,299
and just sort of almost like you're looking around in a space taking it in

429
01:00:51,299 --> 01:00:58,559
sort of look around and recognize what emotional tones and energies are

430
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:03,619
present in your heart right now and your body

431
01:01:06,839 --> 01:01:13,099
and sort of just maybe gently naming them lightly naming them

432
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:22,520
and when you find one that you want to work with tonight in this practice invite it to come sit next to you

433
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:35,280
so the first part of the practice is are recognizing

434
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:42,119
really just the simple practice of naming recognizing kind of like this little bow

435
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:47,220
I see you to the feelings

436
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:51,420
emotional state Energies

437
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:59,640
the a in raft is allowing allowing space for these emotions

438
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:05,280
and our tendency is maybe not to give enough room to the

439
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:11,838
good ones to the Joy to the ease

440
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:21,480
so if it works for you creating space a sense of allowing

441
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:25,280
whatever you decided to work with

442
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:34,280
allowing it to be felt be seen be expressed

443
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:46,140
the F in raft is to feel it find and feel the emotion in the body

444
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:53,900
how it's expressed is it vibratory

445
01:02:54,180 --> 01:03:00,318
if so it might be subtle or it might be coarse

446
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:07,520
does it spread or is it like a solid and a block

447
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:14,880
is there warmth or coolness associated with the

448
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:22,559
feeling in the body trying to tune into the felt sense of it

449
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:26,299
not the story around it

450
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:38,420
in a sort of open-handed way a receptive way

451
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:49,280
emotions emote they want to move

452
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:56,599
a lot of times when we don't want to have a feeling they get stuck Frozen

453
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:10,680
so when we're practicing in mindfulness with emotions we're not trying to

454
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:17,099
suppress our emotions we're trying to be generous in giving

455
01:04:17,099 --> 01:04:24,380
them space trying to take good care of them

456
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:31,700
to let them know we feel them to let them touch us

457
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:36,859
as we breathe in and we breathe out

458
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:52,760
when we're doing the raft practice when we move from the F to the T

459
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:58,578
the t is about teasing apart

460
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:04,980
and this is when we start to maybe work with more of the mental activity

461
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:11,099
the stories the memories the associations

462
01:05:11,099 --> 01:05:15,680
the fears the hopes the beliefs

463
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:24,619
and sort of try and disentangle things often when they're difficult

464
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:30,480
if you're working with a pleasant emotion a positive feeling

465
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:37,079
it might be that you want to sort of see invite yourself to see and name what

466
01:05:37,079 --> 01:05:44,599
thoughts beliefs approaches supported the arising

467
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:54,920
the well-being just honoring the conditions

468
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:04,799
if you're working with something that feels more tricky and difficult I like to imagine a huge table

469
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:12,240
with lots of chairs and the different parts

470
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:17,460
that are happening the story the memory the belief the fear

471
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:23,160
they can each have their own chair at the table and you can put the ones that are

472
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:29,880
difficult at the far end of the table you don't have to have them close to you it's okay they can be there there's lots

473
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:32,180
of room

474
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:47,160
so we're we're just sort of um taking our experience and letting it

475
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:52,260
be seen piece by piece thought by thought memory by memory just allowing

476
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:58,140
it all to kind of unravel in a way to loosen up

477
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:02,720
for each part to have its own space

478
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:50,180
and when you're ready the next part there's another T and that's the trust

479
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:58,619
and this is this is the part where we say what can I trust here

480
01:07:58,619 --> 01:08:04,680
is it can I trust my knowing can I trust

481
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:10,859
that feelings come and go do I trust a sense that by paying

482
01:08:10,859 --> 01:08:16,280
attention to things I'll have more choices

483
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:23,960
do I trust that emotions are natural they're part of The Human Experience

484
01:08:25,259 --> 01:08:31,160
and finding something to rest in that you trust

485
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:17,600
so we'll sit together for another five six seven minutes or so

486
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:25,020
and you can keep working with the raft practice or you can just simply practice with mindfulness of breathing

487
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:30,838
or sensation or sound open awareness practice

488
01:09:30,839 --> 01:09:36,298
whatever whatever is right for you right now

489
01:09:36,299 --> 01:09:44,460
if you want to do raft again with something new just it's recognize allow

490
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:52,940
feel tease apart and Trust that's the process

491
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:53,720
[Music]

492
01:17:07,739 --> 01:17:14,520
is anybody willing to be the microphone microphone Bearer Mitra so

493
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:18,678
Sage you don't have to jump a Mitra will do it

494
01:17:21,239 --> 01:17:25,820
oh great we can maybe have two of them

495
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:34,320
so um what did you notice what did you discover in the The Practice

496
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:39,600
the raft practice what what came up for you what did you

497
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:45,000
see differently what you have questions about great and

498
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:51,420
and Rose hello good evening everyone I think for

499
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:59,040
me what came up was just the feeling of you know to quote brene Brown am I enough and

500
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:05,400
everything and whether or not what I'm doing is is it good enough and do I have

501
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:10,679
to do more should I do less and like I tried to tease it apart like

502
01:18:10,679 --> 01:18:19,260
and I think it was self-doubt insecurity I have to do more to to Showcase that

503
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:25,320
I'm competent in what I'm doing and it's it's a lot of pressure and suffering

504
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:32,219
that I've that's self-imposed and I know I could not do that but

505
01:18:32,219 --> 01:18:38,100
and having that awareness of that is is very it's very liberating but at the

506
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:45,179
same time it's like I I know that I have it but how can I just be with it and not

507
01:18:45,179 --> 01:18:52,140
try to control it because the other emotion or thing that I was feeling was the need to control and have everything

508
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:58,560
a certain way and yeah when it's not my way I'm like um yeah in it so yes that's

509
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:04,199
it thank you thank you so much for sharing and um I

510
01:19:04,199 --> 01:19:10,460
mean you know sometimes we just do this one minute at a time

511
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:17,480
it sounds like you gave more time to these parts than you have

512
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:23,940
right letting them kind of letting yourself see oh and I get to choose

513
01:19:23,940 --> 01:19:29,219
yeah yeah and it really kind of the way the

514
01:19:29,219 --> 01:19:36,840
mind works is it's always doing this stuff right it's always doing this stuff so it's it's like each moment we're just

515
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:42,239
gonna keep coming and trying to notice and keep finding

516
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:47,760
ground choice it's a process

517
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:54,659
and the as you stop automatically doing all of those things all the time

518
01:19:54,659 --> 01:20:00,440
it's like um my theory is the way they talk about

519
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:05,940
neurosynaptic Connections is you know a neuron you start and it

520
01:20:05,940 --> 01:20:11,120
has a bunch of branches where it can make a bunch of connections and

521
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:18,420
where you don't make connections where you don't reinforce them or keep using them they they go away

522
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:24,080
they just fade it's by not using them

523
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:30,900
that they lose their power or capacity to make connections

524
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:35,239
so it's a lot of it is about restraint

525
01:20:36,179 --> 01:20:41,340
and that's where the other part of Shifting toward what do you want to do

526
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:47,159
instead is helpful redirecting instead of trying to stop something

527
01:20:47,159 --> 01:20:52,800
we just let it be try not to engage in it and choose something else to to do

528
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:57,739
sometimes so thank you

529
01:20:58,140 --> 01:21:03,780
Ben thank you so I'm not sure how much of what I what

530
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:10,100
what is what's happening to me is related to this class or or the all the classes that I've taken prior to this

531
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:17,280
but uh one thing of uh come to conclusion with

532
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:23,300
that is this idea of being present

533
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:29,520
I don't know if there's anybody who's always able to be present so I've given

534
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:37,800
up on that but I'm aware I'm not present that's uh

535
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:44,460
that's the only thing that I think is my takeaway so I am

536
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:50,520
I'm figured trying to figure out the best I can

537
01:21:50,520 --> 01:22:00,000
be at the same when I'm not present which is pretty much most of the time anyway

538
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:05,640
um so let me just make sure I I I got you right Ben

539
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:11,040
so you kind of are reflecting that it you don't know anyone who's constantly

540
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:17,880
always 100 of the time present that people too now they drift off they

541
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:23,280
get distracted that people aren't always 100 present yeah

542
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:28,440
okay I think that's the case yeah yeah yeah

543
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:34,860
and um and then I think you said and so you have so did you say so I want to be

544
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:42,300
available did you say something so what I'm saying is that I've accepted that it's not gonna it's

545
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:49,040
not gonna happen don't have to be perfect it's just not gonna happen it's so

546
01:22:51,060 --> 01:22:57,719
but try to be aware that that's the case beautiful beautiful and you know there's

547
01:22:57,719 --> 01:23:02,760
things that we've been talking about that we can do to start growing more and

548
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:09,900
more of those times that we're aware so like we were talking I think it was last week about like choose an activity

549
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:16,260
a daily life activity like brushing your teeth or making the bed or making coffee where you normally

550
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:21,480
wouldn't be very aware but you start you make it a practice that every day okay I'm going to be

551
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:26,820
super aware when I'm doing this and you get you grow it and you start to

552
01:23:26,820 --> 01:23:32,120
do it automatically and then you might be ready to add another thing

553
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:37,980
I was um I'm doing this week I've been playing with setting my meditation timer

554
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:44,040
for like 10 minutes and doing my daily life activities while

555
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:50,760
the timer is going trying to keep in mind the timer's going and so that it's not like this one thing but it's

556
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:55,800
whatever's happening in that 10 minutes but with that kind of

557
01:23:55,800 --> 01:24:02,640
hopefully remembering that I've got the timer going I'm being Mindful and then the Bell that will ring

558
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:08,880
so there's different ways to kind of grow and there's ways to give up

559
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:13,980
you know there's certain things that are going to make you less and less Mindful and that's important to pay attention to

560
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:19,620
too what makes you tune out more what makes you less mindful

561
01:24:19,620 --> 01:24:25,739
um yeah thank you so much Ben anybody else

562
01:24:25,739 --> 01:24:30,139
willing to share great Nathan

563
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:35,060
foreign

564
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:44,340
had some parts of me that you know tend to vex me you know throughout the day

565
01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:50,100
and it's interesting how they don't show up at the table when they're doing this

566
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:56,100
and I wondering where are you guys yeah you're safe to be out here come on you

567
01:24:56,100 --> 01:25:01,500
know so um this is a recurring thing for me and

568
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:08,880
when I come to The Meditation Center usually I'm perturbed by a lot of things out there but when I come in here it's

569
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:15,360
feel safe you know everyone's nice here and so I settle and it seems too easy in

570
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:20,760
here and it's like okay well I'd like to use this space to

571
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:26,520
kind of engage with this stuff at the same time and it's sort of hard to

572
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:32,699
get the rest of parts of me along in the program I guess well what might be

573
01:25:32,699 --> 01:25:38,940
intelligent about what's happening what what might there be some wisdom at

574
01:25:38,940 --> 01:25:45,179
work here I don't know but I'm I'm wondering

575
01:25:45,179 --> 01:25:50,280
so how often in your life do you feel like you're around really nice safe kind

576
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:56,100
of cozy people in a room where you feel like okay you know like there's something

577
01:25:56,100 --> 01:26:03,840
special to me about coming to this space and knowing people's intentions here and

578
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:11,340
that they're wanting to be awake and non-harming that's pretty sweet right

579
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:19,020
so maybe maybe when you're here it's really good to let your system relax

580
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:24,600
maybe we need that maybe we need that

581
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:31,860
and and then maybe maybe as you do more of the practice or I

582
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:37,440
don't know what you'll it'll show up when you're out there and you're being vexed

583
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:43,320
or you can invite yourself to practice when you're vexed

584
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:50,460
I don't know is that resonating at all Nathan I hope so eventually it'll show

585
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:56,940
up yeah okay the good you know I don't know I

586
01:26:56,940 --> 01:27:03,679
just taking in the good when it comes up when it shows up

587
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:10,260
it's a gift so I know you want to do your work but

588
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:18,179
maybe this is the work maybe it is letting yourself have peace

589
01:27:18,179 --> 01:27:24,739
and ease for a little bit thank you

590
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:29,658
yeah great

591
01:27:34,199 --> 01:27:40,320
um something I've been working on is creative creating a sense of safety for

592
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:47,060
myself especially with regards to um

593
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:54,120
challenging bodily Sensations that I feel a lot of aversion to and so

594
01:27:54,120 --> 01:28:02,658
um yeah when I'm not feeling safe in my body noticing that and um

595
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:10,139
um relaxing and feeling the feeling the effects of the practice and appreciating

596
01:28:10,139 --> 01:28:17,400
that I'm like creating this safety for myself and appreciating that safety that

597
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:24,980
I feel um inside myself it sounds like a serious practice

598
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:30,120
um trying yeah beautiful it's very inspiring

599
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:33,560
thank you for sharing that

600
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:45,179
um what you just said really resonates with me too I feel like I invited worry in and feeling the sensations in my body

601
01:28:45,179 --> 01:28:52,980
and I know I've been really working on trying to also feel safe in my body and just that idea of allowing the places

602
01:28:52,980 --> 01:29:00,719
where I feel worry in my body I've had this tingling sensation in my hand and my neck and just allowing for that and

603
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:06,659
letting it be okay and my mind went to I want it to go how do I get rid of this

604
01:29:06,659 --> 01:29:12,300
and that's like my tendency I think is to not want to feel those things and so

605
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:17,699
that became a wearer I became aware of that and how I kind of drift away and then

606
01:29:17,699 --> 01:29:25,679
come back into my body it was like just being a witness to that whole process that I went through wow that's

607
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:32,239
great that's great learning how to stay

608
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:44,880
so maybe we'll no one's jumping up maybe we'll just do

609
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:50,820
a our final little sitting before we end for the night

610
01:29:50,820 --> 01:29:56,219
so finding your your meditation posture

611
01:29:56,219 --> 01:30:04,080
sitting up for yourself for your own experience showing up fully

612
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:07,460
right in this breath

613
01:30:10,199 --> 01:30:14,000
and taking a moment to

614
01:30:16,020 --> 01:30:21,300
reflect on any of the benefit any part of the benefit from being here

615
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:28,880
tonight and taking it in letting the good in

616
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:37,698
and imagining that good moving through you

617
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:45,179
to someone else and it moving from them to somebody else

618
01:30:45,179 --> 01:30:51,600
and just it's spreading the goodness of our practice may be a

619
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:56,239
benefit to all beings everywhere

620
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:08,480
thank you
