1
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:13,098
so hello everyone and welcome

2
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,139
I hope you're doing well and

3
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:25,920
your area is doing well enough that you can sit here and meditate

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,220
aware of the challenges of this world while at the same time

5
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:38,719
being able to put it aside wisely safely

6
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:46,680
knowing that sitting and meditating is a preparation

7
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:53,039
for being in the world in a wiser way carrying away

8
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,260
that sitting in meditation and putting aside The Wider world

9
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,859
the best we can is

10
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:12,840
has the idea of turning ourselves into a gift for the world it's not an escape from the world

11
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,119
it's a pause just as it would be to pause to go in the shower so that you

12
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:23,880
can be clean for the people you're going to be visiting

13
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:31,259
so meditation prepares us to be the better people if we're

14
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:34,340
entering into the world

15
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:42,720
so one of the important aspects of Buddhist practice a little

16
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,500
bit like what I just did is to reframe how we

17
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:58,920
think about our lives approach Our Lives how how we're aware of Our Lives

18
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,619
because often the framework the orientation which we use is part of the

19
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:10,920
source of the challenges that we have and if we take our existing orientation

20
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:16,319
for granted which is what is so easy to do we grew up with

21
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:23,580
it it's we've had it all our life it's almost as you know it almost seems like it's inherent to existence that

22
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:31,200
the way that I see the world see myself that's the way things are but as we begin to settle in meditation

23
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,680
and mind begins to quiet some we learn either on our own or because in

24
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,280
the extents and teachings we hear that there are other Frameworks other points of view or

25
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:51,959
other very foundational kind of uh understandings from which we can live

26
00:02:51,959 --> 00:03:01,040
our life so I'll offer Buddhism offers many of these but

27
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:13,080
I'll offer a few too today one is that when when we have anything

28
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:20,040
happening for us especially things that are challenging but even things that are really good

29
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,980
is not to dismiss any of them but allow us to be present in a wiser

30
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:31,319
way it's helpful if we don't identify with

31
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:38,040
them but don't take them to Define Who We Are and rather to add a very simple

32
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,440
four-letter word and that is with

33
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,900
so if we're filled with fear rather than saying I'm really afraid

34
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:56,480
we say I'm here with fear I'm here with

35
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:03,840
desire craving I'm here with anger and resentment I'm here with

36
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:10,080
doubt I'm here with distracted mind

37
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,420
I'm here with joy I'm here with calm

38
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:22,919
and when we say with rather than I am then there's a Gap a space

39
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:28,979
between us and what we're experiencing the and that space is invaluable

40
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:34,740
it might just be a crack initially but with that space with the width

41
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:40,979
now we can engage in deciding how close or how far away to be

42
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:46,440
with the difficulties we have what I mean with aware when we're aware

43
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:52,620
of it is awareness going to come in close and get really in touch with the feelings with what's

44
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:58,259
happening for us or can we do we want to step back almost

45
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:03,540
like we're standing across the street or up in a hill looking back at what it is

46
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:10,259
that's a challenge oh fear if I step back if I stay close it

47
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:15,900
just seems too much for me but if I step back 10 feet in my mind imagine

48
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:21,120
well still difficult but if I stand back up on the hill 100 feet away well I can

49
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:28,580
kind of then it's okay to feel the fear to be with it and I don't become it I don't get

50
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:35,820
influenced so strongly with it or there's a there's an agency there's

51
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:42,300
ability to kind of reclaim our life from the way we get swept up in what we identify with

52
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:50,000
and engaging in certain amount of agency certain amount of capacity

53
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:56,759
to say that oh I'm with this I'm with this difficulty and in that

54
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:02,039
width decide how close or how distant

55
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:08,520
you want to be or how close in or how expansive and spacious

56
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,919
you want to kind of oh I want to hold it how big of a container

57
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:19,080
do you need to make of awareness so that you can be with what's happening

58
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:25,819
so to experiment with this so

59
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:32,600
sitting and meditating sitting and

60
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:39,620
meditation posture and closing your eyes

61
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,680
and to then just check in with yourself how are you

62
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:54,979
just in the most General way and how are you sitting here

63
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:06,020
in whatever way you answer can you

64
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:13,340
kind of gently step back and say oh I'm with this way of being

65
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,160
so you don't have to identify yourself with it that this is who I am

66
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:27,060
but I'm with tiredness I'm with preoccupation

67
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:36,258
I'm with calm or agitation I'm with being okay

68
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:47,280
and then in that space of width or can you find a space between you in a

69
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:53,940
sense and with to decide how to

70
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:59,599
hold how to be aware of how you are

71
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:07,199
that's most helpful do you want to get in close and really

72
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,599
feel it intimately or do you want to open up and be

73
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:20,240
expansive spacious spacious rather than intimate

74
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:46,099
and then as you're sitting here your body is breathing

75
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:55,820
in a certain way you can just let yourself know that you're here with the breathing

76
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:07,580
and being with breathing does it feel nicest to be

77
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:15,959
intimate with the breath with a body breathing

78
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:21,800
or open up and be spacious spaciously receive

79
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,880
as if breathing

80
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:35,519
is a bird gently flapping its wings in a vast Open

81
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,000
Sky

82
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,779
or intimate and close

83
00:09:54,660 --> 00:10:01,920
is if you curl up with a comfortable blanket

84
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:09,680
you kind of curl up with breathing or breathing curls up with you

85
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:18,120
you are not your breathing but you are with your breathing it

86
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,080
accompanies you

87
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,560
now to identify with it

88
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,920
but to accompany it to be with it

89
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:43,040
and in that space between you and it how will you be aware

90
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:22,440
if you take a time out for meditation to step back and

91
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:27,320
check in with how you are what's happening

92
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:33,380
in what way are you identified or caught up in something

93
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:40,199
where you can switch to recognizing it

94
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:44,300
has just it's your Witness

95
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:50,060
with preoccupation

96
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:59,459
with sadness with confidence

97
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:05,120
whatever it might be what are you leaving out

98
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:13,920
and then begin meditating again staying close with a place where

99
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:20,160
awareness mindfulness allows you to be with things

100
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:27,199
instead of being what's happening just with

101
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:33,559
to clearly recognize you can be with whatever is happening

102
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,640
and in that width

103
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:45,200
there is a gap between you and the phenomena

104
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:50,600
and in that Gap you can decide whether to be intimate

105
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,880
or to be spacious

106
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:05,779
and if things are difficult sometimes it's easier

107
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:12,480
to be with it if you're very intimate with the direct experience of it

108
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,700
and sometimes it's easier much easier

109
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:25,020
to open up and be very spacious maybe even

110
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:32,240
being aware of it with the kind of a peripheral vision

111
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,380
so you're not being aware of it directly

112
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:48,500
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

113
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:55,158
the ability to accompany to be with

114
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:04,140
becomes kind of a power strength

115
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:09,179
when we can learn to accompany and be with others

116
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:13,820
rather than being preoccupied with ourselves

117
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:21,860
rather than being preoccupied with ideas or should and shouldn't

118
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:30,419
preoccupied with pleasing or protecting ourselves from

119
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:38,900
others the operating word is preoccupied

120
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:49,140
to shift the frame of reference from being preoccupied to learning to be with

121
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:55,820
with ourselves and with others

122
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,460
and may have a clear sense of being with

123
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:11,400
there is in that place of agency a place of choice

124
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,140
for how we will be with

125
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:22,100
and one way to be with others

126
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:29,299
his spaciously calmly

127
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:41,400
so that maybe we can be with others kindly

128
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:54,840
may we accompany others in their lives

129
00:28:54,840 --> 00:29:00,900
with our Good Will and encouragement

130
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:07,580
our appreciation of others our love for others

131
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:20,179
may we live with kind regard

132
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:26,580
for those we are with may all beings

133
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:31,679
be happy may all beings

134
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:39,679
be safe may all beings be peaceful

135
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:46,700
and may all beings everywhere be free

136
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:51,720
[Music]

137
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,279
thank you

138
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:18,779
hello and welcome to our five part five part series on them

139
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:24,240
kind of mindfulness check-in I guess I'm calling it The challenge check-in

140
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:30,120
checking in with ourselves when we having challenges in our lives difficulties

141
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:38,580
I think Troubles of some kind or other and um to kind of present this in a

142
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:45,840
slightly different way perhaps than I have first couple of days we are using the the Buddha's fun

143
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:51,320
foundational teachings on mindfulness as a way of reframing

144
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:56,600
our challenges our difficulties that

145
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:04,500
we are often enough some of us ing a framework or an orientation or a

146
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:12,960
belief that um or an attitude which is not supportive

147
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,240
not helpful when we're in middle of challenges

148
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:24,059
and so rather than you know avoiding the challenge or pretending it's not there

149
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:30,059
uh or fixing it uh what we do in mindfulness practice is

150
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:36,779
we can reframe the situation so we approach it we see it in a new way that

151
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:42,539
may be more productive more helpful for us for how to be in the middle of it all

152
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:48,179
and since a lot of what a challenge is is how we are challenged with our

153
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:54,000
emotions our beliefs our physicality our fears all kinds of things that go on inside of us

154
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,000
that unless there's a you know an immediate Danger

155
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,399
it's invaluable to check in with ourselves how am I what's going on here

156
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:10,500
for me and so for example just simply coming down a little bit

157
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:17,039
makes us in a much better space some usually to to really see wisely what's going on

158
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:23,159
and so just just to take a pause and really and check in and we check in in

159
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:29,100
these four different ways it's a reframing and the value of this is that we often

160
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:35,940
will be caught in a framework that is clearly not helpful well not clearly as

161
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:41,220
we don't we don't know that but sometimes is self-reinforcing

162
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:47,360
and if I'm allowed to use an analogy or an example maybe of

163
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:54,240
if you have a tendency to to Really distrust dogs and Earth and in that

164
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,940
distrust you're angry at them if a dog comes along and you angry and

165
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:06,659
you stare at it with his Angry Eyes the dog will take that as a threat and

166
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:13,858
is maybe more likely to growl or attack than if you just kind of are ignoring

167
00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:19,200
the dog and just kind of relaxed and at ease and you know not staring at it

168
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:25,740
and um and so to go around with an attitude a framework that all dogs are

169
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:30,960
terrible and bad and shouldn't be there and the Very attitude the dog picks up

170
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,118
something and then dogs all become that way

171
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:43,200
if we're afraid of dogs the same thing dogs have a way of picking up sometimes fear maybe sometimes we're afraid we

172
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:49,618
also stare at them trying to protect ourselves and the fear is it opens self-reinforcing

173
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:55,858
so it's a framework we have a fear or anger which uh

174
00:34:55,859 --> 00:35:01,440
we believe is true as this is how things are and it's accurate

175
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:09,060
but we don't realize how much we're we're you know kind of sometimes self-perpetuating the proof that that's

176
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:16,500
the case and this can be work with people as well so sometimes if we can then see

177
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:22,680
how we are oh I'm I'm really angry I'm really afraid

178
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:28,560
and say well that's the framework that's the attitude to which I'm seeing things

179
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:34,140
certainly there might be threats out there and difficult things out there don't want to deny that I have to be

180
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:39,599
careful but let me take a let me reframe this for myself let me look at this from

181
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:46,680
different points of view and that's kind of the wisdom of the Buddha is to take that different

182
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:53,640
framework and see if there's a different way that's wiser more beneficial for how to be

183
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:59,880
so we ask ourselves you know how is this physically for me I was in terms of

184
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:06,660
feeling tones and today the emphasis is how is it in terms of the Mind States

185
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:12,240
and what's a state of mind with which I'm kind of with this or state of heart

186
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:19,320
that with which I'm with this experience what's happening and for example so if you notice that

187
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:28,500
the state of mind is one of anger or fear or greed or doubt or agitation

188
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:36,500
whatever it might be or the state of mind is contracted or the state of mind is scattered

189
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:41,780
if you're able to see that the way the Buddha presents the mindfulness practice

190
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:47,160
is to know that the mind or we are with

191
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:53,520
fear he actually with them anger with Desire with

192
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:59,220
being scattered with being contracted and this word with

193
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:08,579
I think is so phenomenally uh simple humble easy to overlook but is so powerful

194
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:14,820
it creates a little space between what's happening with us

195
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:20,160
and and the mind or the awareness or in

196
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:26,760
simple lay terms between you know me and the experience

197
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:34,800
and in that Gap in that little pause or that kind of recognizing then the question is the reframing is now that I

198
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:40,500
know that I'm with this this is here and it's kind of filling me in many ways

199
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:46,380
but I'm not it or I'm not it's not the awareness how do I want to be with that how can I

200
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:51,900
be with it and and one of the reframings we're

201
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:58,079
doing for it's so important in times of challenges is to begin finding some degree of

202
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:03,839
agency and choice to do something that is wise

203
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:10,339
and in meditation at least and sometimes in daily life it's a it can simply be

204
00:38:10,339 --> 00:38:16,380
reorienting how we're going to be present for something so

205
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:23,700
um so uh and this meditation is a fantastic laboratory to work with this because

206
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:30,599
ideally you're comfortable safe in your meditation time maybe you've locked your

207
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:39,000
door so whatever you know close the door and really kind of feel okay you're clear that right now things are safe

208
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,099
uh you've looked around checked all the corners and under your bed and in the

209
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:49,980
closet and it's clear like okay it's okay for now and then to

210
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:55,680
um to uh um now ask the question of yourself how

211
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:03,720
should I be with this simply asking that question is an expression of agency of your own kind of

212
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:11,160
beginning of your of your own strength how do I want to be with us I'm with it now how do I want to be with it and it

213
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:16,920
might be that you'll learn very quickly I shouldn't be with us this is not

214
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:24,180
useful I I don't know how to be without spinning out or getting overwhelmed by it I need to take a break I need to

215
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:30,660
break the way in which I get sucked into it the whirlpool of it all and so we go off and do something

216
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:38,220
different something that you know stops that kind of being swept up in it

217
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:45,300
or we find a different framework to hold it so that we don't get swept up because

218
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:51,359
the framework itself creates a nice container and a nice balance a foundation a grounding

219
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:56,460
that that we can be with it in a good way healthy way

220
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:02,520
and so in terms of just awareness practice uh being with something you can ask the

221
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:09,359
question should I be intimate with it really close should I be very spacious

222
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:16,920
and there are sometimes I have difficulties physical pain or emotional pain and I find that it's most helpful to be

223
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:22,800
with it right in the in so intimate with it that I feel like I'm sitting at the heart of it

224
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:30,720
and sometimes that's useful and sometimes I find this that's not useful at all and what's useful is to step back

225
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:36,720
and kind of create a spaciousness or really be really wide

226
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:43,260
with it within a kind of expansive awareness expansive mind and sometimes we can use our imagination

227
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:48,900
to support this we can imagine that we're in this very very large room

228
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:56,760
and the road and the awareness is as big as the cathedral-like room and we can hold the challenge

229
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:03,540
or we're on a we're standing on a Hilltop you know 100 yards away

230
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:08,940
and we're at that distance and we're not holding at all we're just it's just like

231
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:14,339
so far away that oh yeah I can allow myself to be aware of it now

232
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:19,560
or perhaps we have some ability to shift the focus of attention

233
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:26,339
so maybe we come back to the breathing that's the center that's where we stay grounded the rhythm of breathing but

234
00:41:26,339 --> 00:41:33,540
then in the peripheral vision kind of on the side we're kind of aware oh yeah I'm afraid

235
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:39,240
I'm upset I'm sad I'm whatever I tend to get pulled into I'm distracted the mind

236
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:45,540
is really busy and it's but it's there but you're not looking at it directly just like with a

237
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:50,760
dog don't look at it directly but kind of look away but you want to stay aware

238
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:56,220
that it's there so use that peripheral vision to kind of you know know what's

239
00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:04,380
going on so in this third Foundation of mindfulness there are two ways that I

240
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:09,599
think is helpful that's emphasized here one is this word with

241
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:14,880
and the poly word that's used is the word it's a prefix being with a saw

242
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:24,060
essay and uh so uh with greed uh with ill will with

243
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:30,720
delusion and then also it's possible do it with uh healthy States

244
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:37,079
you know so the opposite whatever the opposite is of greed ill will and delusioned you know I'm

245
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:42,480
with this I'm with generosity I'm with

246
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:48,180
love I'm with wisdom and there's a fascinating thing that

247
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:54,720
goes on when we make this with is that some things

248
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:01,380
get weaker the difficulties the things that we that we are most react most reactivity tends

249
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:08,400
to get weaker tens is an operating word when we're with something that's re coming out of

250
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:14,339
our inner reactivity and it's um and it if it's coming out of

251
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:19,740
our on our inner Wellspring of

252
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:26,339
of wisdom Wellspring of innate capacity to be in within the world in a nurturing

253
00:43:26,339 --> 00:43:34,800
way then that is um it tends to grow

254
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:42,119
and as it grows it tends to let me settle we start recognizing more and

255
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:49,260
more that spacious mind the expansive mind and um and that's a reframing

256
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:56,838
and learning how to reframe to be with stuff in an expensive way spaciously

257
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:04,920
so it's a little bit complicated maybe what I said today but um uh it's well worth kind of beginning

258
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:10,140
to see how the four foundations of mindfulness all four of them are a

259
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:16,560
reframing how is my this Challenge from the point of view of my physical experience

260
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:22,859
and once I'm aware of it physically that maybe gives me a foundation to

261
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:30,839
learn to be with it in a helpful way be present mindful in a compassionate way

262
00:44:30,839 --> 00:44:36,300
how am I with the feelings is a pleasant or unpleasant and this gives you the power or the

263
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:41,880
strength to choose is it useful to stay with the unpleasantness

264
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:47,760
or would be useful to be more more bring in more of the pleasantness which is

265
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:54,960
here that's overlooked foreign state

266
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:01,980
what's this how are you what's the state of your yours you how are you with this what's the state

267
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:09,359
and to switch to I'm with this to help you find a more supportive way

268
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:14,819
to be with things so you might try today as you go through your day

269
00:45:14,819 --> 00:45:20,599
to have uh when there's difficulties maybe start with the smaller ones

270
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:27,119
uh to notice how you fall into it or lean into it or get preoccupied in it

271
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:33,359
and see if you can switch to accompanying it accompanying how you are

272
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:39,900
being with how you are so that how you are is not driving you

273
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:47,940
almost subconsciously but you're really present and you're with it so that the

274
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:53,819
reactivity doesn't have the upper hand but you and then

275
00:45:53,819 --> 00:46:00,000
see if you can figure out how to be with it wisely

276
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,980
so thank you my friends and

277
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,079
I look forward to tomorrow
