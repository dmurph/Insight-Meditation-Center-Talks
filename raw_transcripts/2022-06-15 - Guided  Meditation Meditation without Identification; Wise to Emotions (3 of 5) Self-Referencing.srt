1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,639
hello everyone hello everyone and all the places that

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:14,920
you're connecting from and i value very much the wide

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,000
network of people meditating right now

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,359
and different time zones continents

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:32,238
so um the topic for this week is emotions

6
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:40,960
and these are very rich parts of the human experience and to be respected to be

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,600
listened to to really pay attention to them carefully for many reasons i'll talk more about

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,320
that as we go along here but one of the wonderful

9
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:01,920
possibilities especially with this mindfulness practice is to have emotions be simple

10
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,880
to not pile on top of our emotions evaluations judgments

11
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,880
predictions meaning just let the emotion be there in a simple way

12
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,920
and one of the ways of having our emotional life and other

13
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:27,840
parts of our life be simple as we meditate is to do a simple shift if you can if we

14
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,240
can and that is that instead of saying

15
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:42,399
any something like my emotions i am having emotions just refer to the emotions that

16
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,680
are occurring as emotions so if there is

17
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,880
sadness just recognize their sadness but refrain

18
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,560
from calling it my sadness or to say i am sad

19
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,680
uh if you're angry if you're happy if you're delighted if you're

20
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,399
confused one way to make it very simple is to

21
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,760
free the whatever the state is from the identification with it

22
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,640
mine i i am

23
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,160
it's maybe reasonable enough to use the idea of me and mine

24
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,080
in ordinary language but it tends to come along with a lot of baggage it tends to come along with a

25
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:39,280
lot of ideas of who the self is what it means to have certain emotions what it

26
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,440
how it reflects back on ourselves and the world can get very complicated very quickly

27
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:52,800
and what we're aiming to do is to have the emotions be simple and at least when we're meditating

28
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,840
just the simplicity of each pristine emotion of itself

29
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:06,239
and so if we're sitting now you might see if there's some simple way without making it complicated

30
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,560
see if you can periodically notice a shift with a difference between shifting from

31
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:19,840
so maybe some unconscious pattern of identifying things as my pain

32
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:26,000
uh i'm i'm having pain my distraction i'm just i'm distracted

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,480
my thinking i'm thinking to just thinking just distracted

34
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,239
just pain the pain the destruction um

35
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,480
and so whatever it is shift to a non-identification

36
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:51,760
non-identification way of of being present for your experience not my breathing but the breathing

37
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,760
and with the goal to keep your attention very simple

38
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,359
and it's a simplicity it allows things to settle and become peaceful

39
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,480
so assuming a meditation posture

40
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:20,400
not your posture but a posture the posture

41
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,280
and gently close your eyes

42
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:43,840
and taking a moment to see if you can notice the simplest way

43
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:51,880
of being here now the simplest things to notice about the present moment

44
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,759
the simplest things to notice about your body

45
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,840
the simplest things to notice about your breathing

46
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,400
not my breathing or just the breathing

47
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:38,960
and the simplest ways of acknowledging whatever mood or emotional

48
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:47,120
state is present for you now as if it's free floating

49
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,639
without any reference to me myself and mine

50
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:11,280
and then within this experience settling into the experience of the body

51
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,280
breathing

52
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,639
on the exhale relaxing

53
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,479
physical relaxation relaxation of the face

54
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,360
around the mouth

55
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,039
of the shoulders

56
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,479
and relaxing the belly

57
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:34,159
perhaps allowing now the breathing to breathe itself

58
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,120
not your breathing but rather

59
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,440
the breathing

60
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,400
and as we go along here today

61
00:07:53,599 --> 00:08:00,319
when it seems easy see if you can switch from ways of recognizing what's

62
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:09,360
happening from identifying with it as mine or i

63
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:15,360
to simply the experience the emotion

64
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,280
floating free of identification

65
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,200
so

66
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:39,760
recognizing thinking as thinking not my thinking i'm thinking

67
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,920
recognizing your emotions his emotion

68
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:55,040
not mine or i am pain and sensations in the body

69
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,839
whatever is happening let it float free

70
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,399
from identification

71
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,399
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

72
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:45,840
to bring forth the simplest sense of goodwill

73
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:52,240
may be free of i have good will or i

74
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:58,000
am loving just goodwill

75
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,120
and letting that good will live in your body

76
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:14,399
and to make a bridge between this meditation and her wider wider social life

77
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:21,679
have that good will now extend itself to the people around you and your

78
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:27,120
communities work family friends

79
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,000
neighbors strangers

80
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:46,640
and letting the focus be on them and not on you

81
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,520
may others be happy

82
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,000
may others be safe

83
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:05,278
may others be peaceful

84
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,240
may others be free

85
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:19,840
and now to bring the attention to you in this way it's useful

86
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:27,278
that you say may i contribute to this possibility

87
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:36,279
may i contribute to the welfare and happiness of everyone

88
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,320
so

89
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:55,429
[Music]

90
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,080
um

91
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:16,720
so hello and we're here to continue on this topic of emotions

92
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:22,000
and an important part of mindfulness of emotions is to recognize

93
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,720
how some emotions arise out of

94
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:33,679
uh an appraisal of the situation and evaluation of the situation we're in

95
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:39,360
i know i like to call these secondary emotions that arise from the

96
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:44,559
stories the judgments the meaning we assign to the situation

97
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:52,880
and i call primary emotions those which don't require much appraisal evaluation

98
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:58,080
assigning a meaning to the situation if [Music]

99
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,679
there's you know certain kinds of things can happen suddenly and you're working in the kitchen

100
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:10,080
and with a knife and the knife suddenly falls off the counter and maybe towards your

101
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:16,240
foot the there might be a sudden very quick reaction of fear

102
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:22,000
and response that doesn't take much evaluation isn't like you look at the knife falling and

103
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,240
say oh there's a knife falling the point of the knife is heading to my foot this wouldn't be a good idea to have it hit

104
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,840
me there's not enough time for that level of evaluation it's just very quick

105
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:41,200
or fear that arises very suddenly because maybe a car appeared out of nowhere

106
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:47,278
right next to you driving fast you know and and so there's fear

107
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,279
but some emotions arise because of the valuation and

108
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:59,279
then sometimes those evaluations have to do with me myself and mine

109
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:04,840
that the situation is what it is but that we then refer to

110
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,440
ourselves and we hit or we or we

111
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:17,919
evaluated in reference to how we identify ourselves how we think about ourselves how we consider ourselves

112
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:24,320
and so for example if we have this idea that i'm supposed to be in control

113
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:29,919
then all the time in every situation then that we bring with us a

114
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:35,679
pre-established evaluation meaning idea and when

115
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:41,118
the idea of control doesn't work then we're disappointed or is despondent

116
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:49,040
and so that's a secondary emotion because in my vocabulary because it arises not out of the

117
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:55,839
simplicity or the basicness of the situation we're in but the situation travels through

118
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:03,440
our need to be in control we have this idea that i should be capable of taking care of things

119
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:09,760
and so if we don't take care of it properly then it goes through that idea i should have

120
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:15,359
been able to do it and then there's disappointment or there's angry or grief

121
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:20,480
and so this idea of referring it back to some idea of self

122
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:26,640
and then emotion arising out of that is not a primary but a secondary

123
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:32,560
and maybe in being secondary maybe it's not always needed

124
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:38,320
maybe sometimes it is and but uh but to be able to consider how this works

125
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,359
and to be able to question it uh is this emotion i'm feeling now

126
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:49,760
is it more primary or is it more secondary and some emotions uh lend themselves to

127
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:55,680
being more primary primarily secondary

128
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:03,280
so for example if um if uh

129
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,720
something like guilt uh many reasons for guilt

130
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,760
but one aspect of guilt is with it when we have the idea

131
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:19,839
that i am who i am myself i'm wrong or i'm bad

132
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:25,280
and um and so i've see people who feel guilty for no

133
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:33,200
reason that i can tell that they have done anything wrong but they have this almost like a pre

134
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:38,240
conceived policy that if anything in the in the world is going wrong they should

135
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:43,599
say i'm sorry and they feel guilt or they feel somehow

136
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:50,400
you know something the anger

137
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,520
we can have self-concepts about ourselves and if those self-concepts are

138
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,880
threatened or are attacked we can get angry sometimes there's other reasons for

139
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:07,760
anger but so i'm sitting here today and maybe i read

140
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,320
the news and the news says that

141
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,160
that

142
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:26,720
self-respecting dharma teachers should own only wear blue shirts not red shirts

143
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:32,320
and uh and so then wow you know where is that coming from now i get angry i've

144
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:39,040
chose this shirt carefully and i'm happy and proud of my shirt and and this is essentially kind of

145
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:45,200
is a it's a broadcasting of my importance as a dharma teacher to wear a red shirt and so now someone is saying

146
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:50,400
something different and i'm angry with them for somehow threatening me or hurting maybe or because i have this

147
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:58,160
idea of what a dharma teacher should be like the or perhaps i i read the headlines and it

148
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:03,440
says that you know dharma teachers should wear blue shirts and now i'm in front of you all of you you've read the

149
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:09,440
same headlines and now i'm afraid because i'm afraid of

150
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,720
the judgments i'm afraid of that now i'm wrong and uh and i'm going to be threatened in

151
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:21,520
some ways all about this image about who i am i'm defined by the shirt i wear

152
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:28,000
and sometimes boredom is a sign that the self

153
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,079
that we a self-concept we have is not being pumped up it's not being

154
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:42,320
reinforced sometimes when our concept of self gets praised

155
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:49,119
or it gets criticized then we feel um energized by that

156
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:56,560
uh maybe we feel a certain kind of uh joy when we are praised maybe we're ready to

157
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:02,640
be angry if we're criticized or and or if something doesn't really

158
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:08,160
support or challenges or our status or sense of self

159
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:15,440
but when when nothing happens it doesn't neither neither supports itself nor threatens it

160
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,880
then boredom can arise a particular kind of boredom that arises from somehow

161
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:26,000
evaluating everything through the filter of my self-concept and who i am and how

162
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,599
i'm being supported or or undermined by situations

163
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,800
so um so all these different there are secondary emotions

164
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:42,320
that all of these can be primary emotions in the sense that they can come just from a

165
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:48,960
moment's experience without going through the channels of my self-concepts my self-definitions

166
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,640
my ideas of who i am being myself and mine and um

167
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:00,320
and um but so much of the so many emotions people have

168
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:06,400
are triggered by some idea that it's threatening or praising or challenging

169
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,599
for some idea we're carrying around with us of how things should be

170
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:18,160
some of those ideas are probably fine and may be appropriate even but some of them are not and

171
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:23,359
particularly the ones that are most painful have to do the ones where we're attached

172
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:29,839
to some concept some image of ourselves that we want to hold up or want to

173
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:35,760
defend or we want to use to create safety for ourselves

174
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:42,000
some idea of self that has to do with status conceit but i'm better than others

175
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,319
and uh and how that how does that get threatened some idea that uh what a self is what a

176
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:53,920
being is we have ideas of what we're supposed to be to be a successful human being

177
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,960
and so if we don't have that success then we can feel despondent

178
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,319
because that's what a good human being is supposed to be like and

179
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:11,440
so certain these secondary emotions uh can do very uh we do very well to

180
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,480
ask ourselves what are we believing what are the stories what are the

181
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:24,000
evaluations what is the appraisal we're making that has triggered this emotion

182
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:30,720
if we don't do that investigation we might think that the emotion is a primary one act this is just built

183
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:37,040
into the nature of the universe that if someone says something about the color of my shirt that

184
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:42,880
that casts some kind of you know character on who i am and who i need to depend to

185
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:49,599
defend myself for who i am um but uh maybe i could look at that and

186
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:55,119
see in my mind that uh you know maybe even if people do judge a

187
00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:00,240
dharma teacher by the color of their shirt um that's their problem that's their

188
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:07,040
thing to do i don't have to why do i have to pick up what their judgments are their ideas are

189
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:12,800
um i can you know i can be free of that and i'll wear what i'd like to wear and

190
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:20,160
and let it be that way so i don't know if my example is very good but the point being that there are emotions

191
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:26,640
that arise that are primary that are core central emotions that are maybe important to

192
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:33,119
listen to they have important messages for us and then we have some emotions

193
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:38,480
where the message what they're about is not really to our best interest

194
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:44,720
they come from appraisals they come from valuations they come from ideas of self

195
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:50,000
concepts that are not really well founded or very useful

196
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,680
but when those ideas of self ideas of whatever ideas

197
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:01,839
encounter situations with threaten them which support them which

198
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:09,359
offend them which you know then we can have these secondary forms of guilt and anger

199
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:14,480
and fear and boredom and despondency or joy or

200
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:19,839
or excitement or all kinds of things and it's these secondary ones

201
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:25,680
that i'd like to leave you with today as an investigation and that is

202
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:31,040
as you go maybe at some point through the day a couple of times maybe end of the day

203
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:36,160
sit down again maybe with a pen and paper or with a friend or something and going

204
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:42,000
for a walk and review a little bit some of the stronger emotions of the day

205
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,280
and ask yourself did those emotions get triggered by some

206
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,960
evaluation some appraisal of the situation some idea and concept

207
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:59,839
that we carried with us and that in and of itself the situation didn't trigger an emotion but it only

208
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:05,440
triggered an emotion after it went through the appraisal

209
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:13,280
and was that appraisal that evaluation some somehow related to your self-identity to the concepts ideas of

210
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:18,720
who you think you should be and how you should be in the world and

211
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:25,680
uh and then once you do this exercise then ask yourself

212
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:31,760
is there a simpler way is there a way to be present for that

213
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:37,599
experience any experience without the filter without the curtain

214
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:43,920
of these appraisals evaluations self-concepts can we set

215
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:51,280
our experience free of of the sometimes the incessant

216
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:56,800
ideas and concepts we're using to constantly appraise situation

217
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:02,400
often in terms of what it does for me me myself and mine

218
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,839
so um

219
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:14,800
so um i hope this isn't useful for you

220
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:22,520
and we'll continue in this exploration of emotions tomorrow thank you
