1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:07,600
so so hello hello and welcome friends lovely to be with you in this moment in

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,719
time i've missed you earlier this week and i know you've been in good hands with

3
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:19,439
others so for today's practice um

4
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:27,029
what i'd like to invite us to explore um [Music]

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,520
is is one of finding our place

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,440
finding our place and what i mean by that finding our

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,879
place in some ways it seems like it's it's

8
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:51,280
personal yes it is personal finding our place finding our home

9
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,520
our home in our hearts and yet it's our place our place it's

10
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,800
the sense of not just in my own small world

11
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:09,840
me me me all about me because as we know we know that when we fall into

12
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:18,000
our own difficulties challenges maybe physical pain aging difficult

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,200
whatever it might be the world becomes kind of small becomes very small and the heart feels

14
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:32,400
tightened maybe a sense of pity even arises poor me poor me

15
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,000
and it's all a matter of perspective the same issues the same

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,799
matters um seen from a different perspective

17
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:52,479
as we see our place as they find our place in the midst of this amazing

18
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,680
life this amazing interconnected humanity open up to our condition and

19
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:04,320
everybody else's condition and holding it up with awe with

20
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:11,280
with amazement with lack of expectation there is so much that can shift in our

21
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:19,440
in our expectation maybe gratitude arises maybe joy arises um

22
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,720
it's a matter of finding our place with shifts of perspective where every shift

23
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:31,599
of perspective are are helpful are

24
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:37,599
supportive i'll give you one example so um so recently um

25
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:43,360
someone that i care about they've gone through an operation and

26
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:50,480
they've been in a knowledge of physical pain which is normal after the operation completely normal and another person who

27
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,400
cares about them they were so unhappy and they were so depressed and sad oh

28
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,599
this beloved person is in pain after the operation

29
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:08,560
and the refraining that that we that i offered this this dear person who was

30
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:15,040
really in grief thinking about pain was gosh if if this person if their

31
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,760
operation had been unsuccessful and say all the nerves were cut

32
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,599
and they had no sensations if they had become a paraplegic

33
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,440
wouldn't you give anything you had to transform this situation so that they

34
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,760
would feel pain right now so yay this this sign of pain in this

35
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:46,640
particular situation is actually a good sign so so what are

36
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,159
what are some reframes what are some ways that we can see

37
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,680
our situation as wow if it wasn't for this this this

38
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,680
what seems like a challenge right now it seems like a very difficult situation actually

39
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,439
it's it's a gift in disguise can it be a gift in disguise is it a matter of

40
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:16,000
shifting our perspective to see how things are gifts in disguise because the

41
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,479
opposite would be so much worse so um

42
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,919
so difficult so and i trust i trust there's so many examples

43
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:33,870
you have in your own life i'll share some more at the end

44
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:41,360
[Music] like for example if a pipe burst and you know say your home

45
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,720
um there was water leaking everywhere it would be very upset and then what if you

46
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:53,040
think all of a sudden wait this could be sewage i'm so glad it's not the sewage pipe that broke it's just fresh water

47
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,960
that broke yay totally fresh water that has broken the pipe right it's an

48
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,160
instantaneous shift in perspective and

49
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,240
it's still the same situation a pipe has broken and yet our perspective shifts

50
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,600
and these are all wise perspective in fact the number one

51
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,840
on the uh list of um

52
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,440
the eight-fold path the eightfold path number one is wise perspective there are

53
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,600
many many ways to consider what a wise perspective is

54
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:43,600
of course everything is impermanent to really appreciate that it's a wise perspective it's not personal it's not

55
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,800
about me to to open up from the prison of me me

56
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,360
me to a bigger perspective of care and love for ourselves and others

57
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:02,639
as well as [Music] unsatisfactoriness things will be satisfactory perhaps

58
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:10,000
wonderful for a period of time and then they will shift and change so what is a the wise perspective how can we shift

59
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
our perspectives um so i think i've said plenty there's a lot

60
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
more i can say but i'm going to pause now i think that's enough setting uh

61
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,240
enough framing just to get us out of perhaps our our

62
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,240
um yeah whatever perspective might have been challenging let's open it up let's open

63
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:41,360
it up anyway so let's practice together let's meditate together friends

64
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,319
so arriving arriving

65
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:55,039
ah arriving in your seat whether you're sitting

66
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:01,120
you're lying down whatever this body needs in this moment

67
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,039
to feel supported in this impermanent moment in life

68
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:15,960
precious moment of this life this heart this mind is body breathing

69
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:32,400
letting go letting go of all the words letting go of all the words thoughts

70
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:39,960
concerns letting yourself be simple in this moment

71
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,400
can this body release can the body relax

72
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,759
as the body releases and relaxes the mind

73
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:16,160
tends to release and relax so see if there's there's any tightness

74
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:25,639
any holding in your body gently gently kindly

75
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,198
offer it up

76
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,839
letting the breath breathe you

77
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:16,320
the body knows how to breathe how to be breathed

78
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,240
not to make breathing into a project

79
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:28,959
letting it happen in breath of breath

80
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,880
let it be enjoyable

81
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:20,399
those thoughts arise as they will inevitably do not a problem not a mistake

82
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:28,040
clearly seeing what thoughts have arisen

83
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:10,079
i'm then releasing this moment to release

84
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,959
any thoughts perspectives that are not helpful

85
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,320
for the benefit of this cultivation

86
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:39,839
feeling the connection [Music] the feet

87
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,680
on earth the sit bones contacting

88
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:51,040
cushion the seat your hands touching each other or your

89
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:59,040
lap the breath moving through the whole body

90
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,320
received in the lower abdomen

91
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:54,519
here here just this breath

92
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,720
just this breath the entirety of the breath

93
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,000
entirety of the opera

94
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:36,360
calming soothing nourishing just this is enough

95
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:58,240
letting go releasing releasing whatever is not helpful

96
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,839
is not supportive in this moment

97
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,919
and now i'd like to invite you

98
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:23,918
with care with kindness with metta

99
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:31,399
before this being who is you

100
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,919
this being who suffers this being who has high

101
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,799
intentions

102
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:49,120
for goodness for cultivation

103
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:57,840
values this being who is you who cares for

104
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,280
others sense of dedication

105
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:10,480
love kindling rekindling the sense of

106
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:17,120
kindness warmth

107
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,200
care for this being who is you

108
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:47,600
i'm as if you were your own wise friend

109
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:53,600
wise and loving friend as if you're stepping out of yourself

110
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,960
the sense of wisdom and compassion for yourself

111
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:05,840
or if it's easier you can imagine some other being whom you consider to be wise and

112
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,960
compassionate it could be the buddha kuan yin

113
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,080
another human being

114
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:27,120
holding you with care with love

115
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,640
with unconditional acceptance

116
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,600
letting yourself be held before we proceed

117
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,600
and now see yourself with this dear friend

118
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:22,480
it might be yourself or the buddha kuan yin the deer being

119
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,520
symbolizing compassion and wisdom

120
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:35,360
as you're held with kindness and care maybe you bring up something

121
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,720
that you are maybe upset about or

122
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,360
challenged by

123
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:59,559
let me share this with this being compassionate wise being

124
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,759
and

125
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:18,158
imagine them listening with care with compassion wisdom

126
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,520
really listening really holding space

127
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,480
as you describe they give you their complete

128
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:39,880
attention non-judgmental attention

129
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,640
and maybe what is needed is just for them to hold whatever you shared with them

130
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,799
with compassion with kindness letting yourself

131
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:38,200
and whatever you brought up to be held

132
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:54,039
yes it's not easy yes

133
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,360
and now if it feels appropriate it feels appropriate

134
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,480
not necessary but it feels appropriate

135
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:20,480
maybe you invite your wise compassionate being

136
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,799
to help open your eyes to a different perspective

137
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:33,600
regarding what is happening for you that is difficult

138
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,840
or challenging

139
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:49,640
maybe they have a wise and wide perspective

140
00:23:53,440 --> 00:24:00,640
spacious perspective about what is happening

141
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,840
they allow you to see it they invite you to see it

142
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:12,640
what's happening from a different perspective

143
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,840
let yourself be surprised

144
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:17,440
and when perhaps this different surprising

145
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,278
perspective has been offered to you

146
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:31,760
notice what arises in you in your heart so surprise gladness appreciation

147
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,760
gratitude

148
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:46,080
equanimity and can you rest with that

149
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:53,840
can you rest with this breathing in and out

150
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:03,640
with the sense of goodness that might have opened up

151
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:23,600
trust trust your inner wisdom

152
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:29,480
symbolized by your wise compassionate being

153
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:25,840
maybe a gratitude arises for this moment

154
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:32,960
feeling okay enough in this moment

155
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,720
just this moment can it be enough as it is

156
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:45,840
in fact plenty a gift of grace as it is

157
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,919
here just here this moment

158
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,559
letting yourself be held in kindness

159
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:13,278
with care with meta

160
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:21,360
may i be safe from inner and outer harm

161
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:33,000
may i be happy and joyful

162
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,360
may i be healthy and strong

163
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,440
or may my life flow with ease

164
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:53,360
let yourself rest with kindness with mental or this wise perspective

165
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,960
that has been opened up to you opening up the sense of gratitude and

166
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:06,440
appreciation for what is even if it's challenging

167
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,040
what would you do what would you give

168
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:22,398
if things were different what is this challenge significa signifying that's actually a

169
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:30,079
blessing it's a pain in your body

170
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:35,280
that actually your nervous system is working

171
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:42,598
and you can feel pain that you're alive

172
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,680
and for the last moments of this practice period

173
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:18,960
letting whatever rose or did not arise be just as it is without judgment

174
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:24,160
needing it to be different offering kindness wisdom equanimity to

175
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:29,400
ourselves for this period of practice

176
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:36,560
and trusting that there is kindness goodness generated and offering it freely

177
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:42,000
generously to all beings everywhere including

178
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,920
ourselves may all beings everywhere

179
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:58,920
be safe happy healthy and happies may all beings everywhere

180
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:09,359
be free from suffering and causes and suffering especially those in more zones

181
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:13,559
may all beings be free

182
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:24,960

189
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:14,160

190
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,599
so what's any reflections anything you notice especially

191
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:24,720
with the invitation for the wise being to show you a different way

192
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:30,240
to see what might be challenging it might be difficult

193
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:38,000
was it surprising did it surprise you finding your place

194
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,589
mary [Music]

195
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:49,440
hi thank you um

196
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:55,520
so it this is kind of a very uh simple maybe question which is

197
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:01,200
i think at one point i heard you say offer it up

198
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:07,200
and i was raised catholic and offer it up kind of

199
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,320
in in my culture said you should keep suffering

200
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:18,560
so i know you meant something different yeah

201
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:26,400
i did so so let me help me understand so in your culture offering it up means

202
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,920
accept suffering or like well you know

203
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:37,040
i'm sure it was twisted but it but it was sort of like

204
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:42,880
and especially for girls women you know that's your lot in life

205
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:50,400
accept it accept it this is what god's giving you oh offer it up oh yeah i see i hear it

206
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:56,720
different okay so yeah yeah that i see how the words can fit there okay so thanks for bringing that up mary so the

207
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:03,040
way that i actually offering it up i have this image this vision sort of offering

208
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:08,650
up like like okay i'll just talk about the way i see it is um

209
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:15,599
[Music] i have this image of our practice our being our existence

210
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:21,520
with so much beauty and sacredness and the world as a sacred

211
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:28,400
and there's this altar our our practice our what we do we're offering it up we're

212
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:34,640
putting it on an altar of humanity we're offering up even our suffering as a gift

213
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:41,040
it's just we're offering like this is this is my peace or our gifts are our

214
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:48,800
happiness we offer it it's just like everything we are our practice here is my practice my mind was distracted but

215
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:54,480
but i offer it dear humanity dear universe it's kind of offering it

216
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:01,680
in that way making an offering of ourselves whatever is going on i love that making an offering of ourselves

217
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:07,440
and and our efforts i guess that's what how i'm hearing it our efforts our commitment

218
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:13,119
our desire of everything of commitment efforts

219
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:18,319
of ourselves even i would even and this might be

220
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:24,000
this is this might be kind of surprising or not make sense so i'll leave this for

221
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,079
later reflection perhaps but even our joy we offer to the world right it's our

222
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:36,560
joy is an offering so is our suffering not in the way of oh i'm just gonna suffer so well i'm gonna carry but there

223
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:43,920
is some there's a nuance of of um of i mean not that we that's that we

224
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:49,599
want to hold on to our suffering that's not the idea but there can be a sense of

225
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:55,040
beauty there can be a sense of grace and yet this is what i'm going through right

226
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:01,760
now dear humanity this is what i'm going through right now it's just so it's it's subtle it's a

227
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:07,200
sense of sharing it's a sense of offering making an offering of all of ourselves

228
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:13,440
bright the light and the the shadow all the challenges

229
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:19,200
yeah thank you thank you mary thanks so much

230
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:30,119
any other reflections questions

231
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:46,960
okay since i don't see anything else any hands raised or any reflections in chat

232
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:52,240
maybe i'll give it another pause i'll talk about

233
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:59,760
um relating connecting in sangha together with other human beings this is

234
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:05,200
where our practice meets the road and um

235
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:10,640
of course a lot of times we consider practice to

236
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:16,079
be private internal but it isn't right it isn't it's it's in

237
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:22,560
it's relational our practice is so relational we cultivate all this not just to have internal peace in our minds

238
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:28,800
but to also as we're just talking with mary earlier offer ourselves offer the best of

239
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:34,880
ourselves offer ourselves to others to the world to be this vessel of

240
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:41,119
of stability equanimity love and care so can we do that in small groups

241
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:48,240
together groups of roughly size three and let everyone each person

242
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:53,680
is invited to speak just from your own experience

243
00:42:53,680 --> 00:43:00,160
not commenting not reflecting not managing the group just speak from your own

244
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:06,319
experience few words perhaps about how this practice was for you what came up

245
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:11,599
there's no right or wrong it's challenging it was lovely it was terrible it's all it's okay you're just

246
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:17,040
sharing your humanity it's all right you just share for about just one minute and then

247
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:23,200
the next and then the next person will say one uh nugget and then the next person

248
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:31,040
one nugget short nugget they'll come back to you and you'll go round and round a few rounds and it comes to you and

249
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:39,119
there's nothing you want to say you can just hold space and say pass just hold wise compassionate space for

250
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:44,800
others so that's the invitation

251
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:50,319
and i will create the breakout rooms now

252
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:55,599
and you can go and say alphabetical order just so that it's

253
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:01,119
easy i'm creating the rooms

254
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:07,200
uh here we go okay i think i need to recreate the

255
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:13,280
rooms um there we go let's see i think

256
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:21,440
what's going on here oh i see what's happening the count just changed okay recreating the rooms all right

257
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:27,680
and i see one comment before i open them thank you for the refraining i was able

258
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:32,720
to refrain a seemingly heavy-handed remark from someone else now i know how

259
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:39,040
that feels grateful oh beautiful thank you for their reflection yay maybe there will be more insights coming

260
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:44,960
back after you you share in small groups so i'm opening all groups take care of yourselves take

261
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:50,560
care of each other okay

262
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:56,319
the rooms are closed everybody's back and we have a few minutes for

263
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:01,599
any reflections that might have come up um

264
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:09,280
i'd love to hear from you if you like to share you can type in chat or you can raise your hand i see more smiles than

265
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:15,200
when you went into the group it's always sweet to see

266
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:21,359
what did you notice with this practice any a-has you like to share

267
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:27,920
for the benefit of yourself and others was there a shift in perspective

268
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:34,318
for anyone yes debra

269
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:43,119
i think i think it really helped me to [Music] look at it as the reframe and to

270
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:49,119
just know that i'm where i am today i don't like it but i know that

271
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:54,560
i'll be somewhere else tomorrow and i'm just offering it up

272
00:45:54,560 --> 00:46:00,720
and it's just kind of like a um a temperature take taking your

273
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:06,160
temperature and realizing that well i've come a ways with my practice because i realize

274
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:12,240
it's okay to be this way there's no right way i'm not going to just sit here joyful

275
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:19,440
all the time so yes exactly thank you debro what a

276
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:24,880
beautiful insight it's okay it's not it's it's the human condition we're not

277
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:31,760
always joyful all the time yeah we have a body i mean hello

278
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:37,200
but the realization's important because you know we don't want to think i'm i'm going to be here for the next 20 years

279
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:42,319
this would not be fun oh the truth i mean if of impermanence is

280
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:49,599
on your side that bruh if everything changes of course it changes it's never gonna stay the same

281
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:54,800
of course it's the truth of impermanence we just have to see it over and over and

282
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:59,920
over again as it becomes internalized as you're saying yeah i'm

283
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:06,000
just this is temporary i may not like it okay it's like that that's saying if you don't like the weather in london just

284
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:12,079
just wait five minutes you know it's like you don't like the internal weather just wait the conditions are going to

285
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:17,280
change it's all impermanent yeah beautiful thank you for that

286
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:24,280
thank you for that reflection so dear ones we have come to the end of another

287
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:29,760
happy hour practicing together bringing our hearts and minds together

288
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:35,838
may all of our practice be a cause and condition for

289
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:42,960
ease freedom freedom for all of us and all things everywhere may all

290
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:48,200
beings be free may all beings be happy

291
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:52,590
