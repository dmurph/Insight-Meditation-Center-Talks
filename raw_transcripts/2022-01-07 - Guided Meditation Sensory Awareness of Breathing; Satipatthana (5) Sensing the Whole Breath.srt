00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:07,838
so hello everyone and warm greetings welcome

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,120
and some of you have been commenting a chat i see that it's cold

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,279
where you are and sometimes when the weather is

4
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,880
warm or cold in between there's a way of

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,280
using the temperature of the place where it's meditating as a

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,440
reminder to be involved in the sensory body to be connected to the body in some

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:46,079
deeper way where we're sensing and feeling it sometimes when it's uncomfortable the

8
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,960
weather it's easy to be in the control tower

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:01:01,600
you know a little bit upset with what's happening or not liking it and an alternative is to

10
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,960
kind of enter into the sensations of cold or warm

11
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,439
and rest in them and feel them receive them and there's a some occasionally a very

12
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,560
different way in which the body receives warmth and cold

13
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:25,520
if the mind is not resisting or reacting to it but the mind is helping us to

14
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,040
feel it and sense it in the body and that's kind of the theme for this

15
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:38,159
morning's meditation is um a kind of sensory awareness exercise

16
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,560
which the buddha's is pointing towards and that is to

17
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:51,680
have a sensory experience of the breathing it means to

18
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,479
step out of the control tower of a lot of thinking and analyzing judging and trusting

19
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:05,040
that we don't have to do that trusting that instead we can rest ourselves rest attention

20
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,560
in the body as it's being experienced as as it's felt

21
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,400
the sensory body and um

22
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,520
and not only does it uh in being grounded in the sensory body

23
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,599
is a protection from being wandering off in wayward thoughts

24
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:33,599
it's also a little protection from being excessively self-concerned

25
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:40,879
which is naturally enough and certainly appropriate enough at times but it can be overly done it's nice to

26
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,920
take a vacation from self-preoccupation

27
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:53,440
and so this dropping into the body and feeling the body's experience for some people can see this it provides

28
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,760
them with that vacation from self-concern at least for these minutes of the meditation

29
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,280
and finally there's something very special about sensations

30
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,640
that we experience sensations are the meeting place

31
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:19,360
or the synthesis or the dynamic kind of experience that arises

32
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,599
when the mind is connected to the body

33
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:31,280
the body has sense nerves all over it that can be triggered

34
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:38,640
stimulated to give a sense experience the mind is what knows that

35
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,680
awareness is what knows that and the meeting of the body and the

36
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:50,319
awareness the meeting place of the body and mind is in the sensations themselves

37
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:57,200
and the sensations occur where the sense nerves reside

38
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,920
and so sensing our capacity to sense

39
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,599
and sensations uh are like two two sides of a hand they

40
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,280
can't really be distinguished in experience

41
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,199
and that's the meeting place of the mind and body and we're trying to in this meditation

42
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:27,280
practice to have the mind and body be together working together

43
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,560
if the mind ones are under often thought or in commentary discursive thought

44
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,080
then the mind is somewhere else besides the body but when the bot when the mind is

45
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:46,000
they're connected meeting with sensations with sensing then they're working together

46
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:53,280
and one way today that we'll talk about dropping into that is by relaxing into it

47
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,720
so to assume a upright meditation posture

48
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,319
and sometimes by being careful

49
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,160
with your meditation posture the body

50
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:20,880
begins to support you in being aware through the body

51
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,080
in intentional posture

52
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,400
has a tension in it

53
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,879
gently closing your eyes

54
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,320
and as you inhale sense and feel

55
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,840
what happens in your body with a deeper inhale

56
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,400
and on the exhale a longer gentle exhale

57
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,360
relaxing the body

58
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,840
breathing in and breathing out

59
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,000
and it's a little bit of a ritual to take some deeper breaths at the beginning

60
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,199
a ritual of being reminded here this is the body

61
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:56,160
this is the place to be during these minutes of meditation

62
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,240
letting your breathing return to normal

63
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:14,560
and as you exhale relax different parts of your body

64
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:22,400
but as you relax them see if it can be like a relaxing into

65
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:29,120
the sensations of that part of your body almost like you're resting in that part

66
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:36,160
of your body maybe beginning with your belly

67
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:46,479
on the exhale softening the belly and resting

68
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:03,560
softening the belly and then softening settling into feeling more of the belly

69
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:21,360
on the exhale relaxing your legs settling into your legs feeling the more

70
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,000
as you relax

71
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:51,040
breathing in and exhale softening the shoulders

72
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,879
and feeling the soldier the shoulders more as you relax

73
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:31,600
on the exhale relaxing the muscles of your face feeling those muscles

74
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,040
feeling your face as you relax

75
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:57,519
and if there's any tension or pressure associated with thinking thinking mind thinking muscle

76
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,800
as you exhale relax the

77
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:08,160
mind and feel whatever sensations are associated with

78
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,760
that tension and pressure or what replaces it

79
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:46,079
and then open your awareness to that place in your body where you most easily experience the

80
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,560
body breathing

81
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:13,800
and as you inhale receive the sensations of inhale

82
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:27,000
as you exhale relax into the sensations of exhaling

83
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:39,760
as you exhale relax whatever keeps you separate

84
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,680
from the sensations of breathing

85
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:54,160
relax into the sensations of the body breathing

86
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,760
perhaps floating on the changing nature of those

87
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,760
sensations

88
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:48,240
if you're intimate with the inhales you'll probably feel more than one

89
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,600
sensation as you're breathing in

90
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,839
one more than one sensations of inhale

91
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,760
and probably one more than one sensation as you exhale

92
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:15,440
it can be two or three or a kaleidoscope of sensations that come and go

93
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,480
are fleeting as the body goes through the motion of

94
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,000
breathing in and breathing out

95
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:29,360
as you exhale and feeling the sensations of exhaling

96
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:36,399
see if you can relax into them relax with them

97
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,640
settle further into your body breathing

98
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,360
relax the thinking mind

99
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,840
relax into the sensations of breathing

100
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:30,919
and have the sensations be where the mind and body meet trusting

101
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:39,960
that staying close to that meeting point is valuable

102
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,799
and for a couple of more minutes see if you can

103
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:32,880
be continuous in your awareness of the whole length of

104
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,080
breathing in beginning middle and end

105
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,919
the whole length of breathing out beginning middle and end

106
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:55,360
really staying connected like the mind is holding hands

107
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,080
with the body breathing

108
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,158
and as we come to the end of the sitting

109
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:49,120
learning to stay true with the breathing meaning

110
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:55,520
learning how to stay attentive to the breathing

111
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:01,600
is a life skill where we also learn to then develop the

112
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:08,720
attention to all kinds of things in our lives

113
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:17,840
including an attentiveness a presence that we can offer to others

114
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,760
we can listen better without

115
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:30,640
quickly as inserting our ideas and thoughts

116
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,000
hear people deeply

117
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:44,000
we can take time to see and feel and sense situation we're in before we assert

118
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,200
ourselves into it

119
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:55,600
and this ability to sense and feel and see and attend

120
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:02,960
is the basis for wisdom to living wisely

121
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:09,120
it's also the basis for living kindly

122
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,519
because to be wise in buddhism

123
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:25,480
goes hand in hand with being friendly and caring

124
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:33,440
so may it be that whatever ability we develop to

125
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,640
be mindful to be present to attend

126
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:44,240
with attention may it serve us

127
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,080
to contribute to this world

128
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:57,360
so that we contribute our care our love our kindness our compassion

129
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:04,399
our friendliness for the welfare and happiness of all

130
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:12,480
may all beings be happy may all beings be peaceful

131
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:19,840
may all beings be safe and may all beings everywhere

132
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,158
be free

133
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:35,570
[Music]

134
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:49,120
so this practice of mindfulness sati developing awareness establishing

135
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:55,120
awareness begins with a breathing

136
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:00,399
now we know that not breathing as a meditation object doesn't work for everyone

137
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:06,399
so there are other ways of practicing mindfulness and some people will establish

138
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:13,278
awareness not so much with breathing but with the body more generally

139
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:20,480
and the um uh

140
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:26,000
maybe maybe ignoring the places in the body where breathing occurs because it's

141
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,679
somehow compromised it's a difficult place for some people but

142
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:39,679
it's also a classic and uh primary focus of meditation and buddhism

143
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:47,120
a teacher in japan told me that everything you need to learn about buddhism can be discovered through mindfulness of breathing

144
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,880
and or i'd kind of prefer to reword it and say everything you

145
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:59,600
need to know about buddhism will be revealed through practicing mindfulness of breathing but it's actually true that

146
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:05,760
for any engaged mindfulness practice whatever the object is whatever the way of practicing is

147
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:12,960
mindfulness has this capacity to reveal everything we need to know for the purposes of freedom

148
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:18,720
so um but right now we're doing mindfulness of breathing

149
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:25,760
and um and the emphasis now is to experience it in the body

150
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,960
the word is the big word in poly is pati

151
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:37,279
verity patti sam verity and it's um it is uh

152
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:42,799
means to experience to feel uh in a brief in a reflexive way in a

153
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:49,679
subjective way your own deep subjective experi feeling of what's going on but not feeling in

154
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:57,039
the english word it's meaning that sometimes it has um where how i feel is really how i

155
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:02,159
um what i want or what i'm thinking about it or my attitude

156
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:08,799
about something here we're talking about something simpler uh we're feeling is the sensory

157
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:14,080
experience we're having independent of our preferences

158
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:20,399
and and we're learning to be close to that simple with that

159
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:25,440
and using this sensory experience as a way of cultivating some degree of

160
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:31,120
concentration stability which also serves the purposes of

161
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:36,399
protecting us from wandering off too easily into distracted thoughts

162
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:44,080
and so to have a a a place where the attention gets established rooted this is where we're

163
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,519
going to be um and of course the mind wanders away

164
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:55,360
and then rather than being upset with that take it for granted the mind will wander away

165
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:02,080
but that what we're developing here is what we're practicing here is a rhythm of uh

166
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:07,760
just like there's a rhythm breathing in and breathing out there's kind of a rhythm of coming into the present moment

167
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:13,679
with breathing and then wandering away and then coming back wandering away

168
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:19,118
and coming back and you're not really in charge of the wandering away

169
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:24,320
but your role is the coming back and if you think of it as a rhythm as a

170
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:30,720
flow then you maybe do it more harmoniously rather than jerking the mind back or

171
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:37,280
rather than taking time out to be upset with the fact that you were distracted just there there there it is and you

172
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:43,040
kind of get into the sense of the rhythm okay and you're not going to participate with

173
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:48,878
the mind being distracted if you have a choice and but what you're

174
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:54,960
doing is bringing it back to the breathing and then to stay close to the sensations

175
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:01,119
of breathing which are the meeting place of the mind and the body and we want to bring the have the mind

176
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:06,960
and body working in harmony and working together that's part of the unification practice

177
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:12,079
of what meditation of meditation the unification that gathering together so

178
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:17,839
all of us all of who we are begins operating in harmony rather than being

179
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:24,480
working at cross purposes so if the idea is to be in the present moment in our direct experience

180
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:31,200
and the mind keeps wanting to think about something else then we're kind of in cross purposes with ourselves

181
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:37,359
in this uh exercise we're doing now around breathing the task is to come back to breathing

182
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:42,880
and there's this is a also a very common down through the centuries kind of

183
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:49,599
practice is to offer a little bit of a

184
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:56,240
of a dedication a commitment to staying with the simplicity of breathing

185
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:03,359
so there's some strength there that uh with time overrides the tendency to wander off in

186
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:08,880
thought and so the rhythm begins to slow down you're less wonder

187
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,480
you're more you're less often going to wander off you're more going to stay with the

188
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:20,320
breathing and also you're going to come back more quickly to the breathing slowly this changes and you could more

189
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:25,920
and more hear and and so offering some strength some

190
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,839
commitment okay this is what i'm doing uh is a way of not offering a lot of

191
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:38,640
energy fuel to our thinking mind and you know it's it's a slow process

192
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:44,880
slowly slowly we begin to switch the orientation switch the

193
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:50,160
commitment of the mind from being committed to our issues in our life

194
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:57,119
to being committed to in terms of meditation practice to just being here in the simplicity of breathing

195
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:03,680
it can be hard sometimes for the mind to appreciate that this is valuable that it's we're safe we're going to make

196
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:10,320
our life better and everything just by staying simply with the breathing when we have important things to think about

197
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:17,119
but in fact this is one of the great ways of making ourselves safe because we're learning how to drop into

198
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:22,240
a quieter deeper place within that's a source of wisdom source of

199
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:27,599
better understanding and a source of um of a shift of

200
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:34,400
identity a shift of how we understand ourselves that uh is sometimes a much better place

201
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:41,040
wiser place than the identity that's supporting distracted thinking

202
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:47,920
and so we're coming in and so this training to come in for landing

203
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:55,760
with your breathing just being with the body as it breathes and um and then the instructions is um

204
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,960
at this point is in the elbow in the text it says

205
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:08,560
breathing in one experiences the whole body breathing out one experiences the whole

206
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:14,960
body and um and there's two meanings of this experiencing the whole body

207
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:21,119
one is that it is experiencing the whole breath body the whole duration of the breathing

208
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:26,720
and the other is you're actually experiencing the whole body beyond just experience of

209
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:33,440
breathing for now i'd like to emphasize the first that as we're cultivating

210
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,560
continuity with the breathing it's possible to have continuity

211
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:45,040
within the inhale so there was a time in my life where i did the check

212
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:52,560
checklist approach to mindfulness so i would knew i had to be mindful of the in-breath and so i would note it as

213
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:58,800
in and as soon as the mind has recognized that this was an in-breath then it was vacation time and my mind

214
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:05,119
would wander off because i did my job i just checked it off in and then with the out breath out

215
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:10,400
and what i learned was that rather than just be checking it off and being done with it

216
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:17,359
it's uh staying present for the whole duration many years ago i took a massage class in

217
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:22,560
college and the instructions was as you're massaging someone

218
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:28,320
always keep a hand on their body so there's always a continuity of contact

219
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:34,079
and so they're not surprised if you take your hands away to get more oil or something and then put it back is a little bit surprised or

220
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:40,160
something or you've lost contact and so the same way with the

221
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:45,280
breathing stay in touch with a full duration of the in-breath

222
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,320
and the beginning the middle and the end and as you get more intimate with the

223
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:55,599
experience you'll feel a kaleidoscope of sensations as you breathe in maybe there's a

224
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:02,000
beginning of a lifting of the chest or expanding of the belly or beginning of a tingling on your

225
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,680
nostrils and then what happens to those sensations how do they morph and change

226
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,720
just in the course of the inhale and

227
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:19,839
and then same thing with the exhale stay and touch now sometimes we sit down to meditate and the breathing is short and quick

228
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:26,400
and uh and so you just kind of ride it like the bronco writing in the rodeo you just ride the

229
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:32,000
bride the shortness of it coming and going and maybe relax the best you can on the

230
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,640
exhale but as meditation gets calmer the breathing tends to get slower and longer

231
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:45,760
and then that's when you start feeling and sensing savoring having an intimacy with all the physical

232
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,480
sensations that come into play as you breathe

233
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:56,640
and it helps if you uh are not measuring everything through the perspective of

234
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:03,040
your preferences and whether it's comfortable and not comfortable or whether you like it or not like it or

235
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:08,319
whether you think it's good or it's bad that's belongs to the control tower it

236
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:15,119
belongs to a way of separating ourselves from the experience and if you get bored with the breathing

237
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:22,160
that's also a separation from the experience you probably won't be bored unless you're kind of pulled away

238
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:28,560
from it the idea is to come into it and be really close and intimate with the experience

239
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:35,040
and and just feel the whole inhale and the whole exhale

240
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:40,400
and if you get into that then also doing the same kind of delicacy even

241
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:48,640
to experience the transition from breathing out to breathing in and breathing in to breathing out

242
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:53,920
so um so what i'm describing today

243
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,680
i'm not suggesting that it's easy but it's kind of the direction that it's possible to go

244
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:07,680
to settle in and let the mind become quiet and really develop this sensory awareness

245
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:14,720
and sensory awareness is one of the forms of awareness forms of attention in the toolbox the

246
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:20,400
buddha is offering us in doing satipatana and doing this mindfulness practice

247
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:26,400
and so to cultivate develop and hone this tool

248
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:32,720
the tool of sensory awareness is really fantastic for the purposes of mindfulness

249
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:40,640
so i would encourage you for you know until we meet again on monday

250
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:46,079
to um spend the spend the next couple of days

251
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:51,839
um studying being curious about the sensations involved in your

252
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:58,720
breathing take little times out through the day maybe even a minute or two maybe in times when you're waiting for

253
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:04,480
the traffic to move or you're waiting for something to happen standing in line in a store

254
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:12,160
and use that as a time to um to really um

255
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:18,319
just be curious what's happening with your breath what's how is your body experiencing the experi

256
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:24,720
the process of breathing and get intimate with that and curious and wise and and start becoming familiar

257
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:29,839
with a range of different ways in which breathing is experienced and then we'll continue with this

258
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:36,480
process next week and and then at some point expand it into mindfulness of the whole body

259
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:42,640
as we're breathing and and uh and go through all four all these

260
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:48,000
different steps of the first exercise and mindfulness of breathing

261
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:53,520
so thank you very much i have a couple of announcements

262
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:58,880

00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:54,400
the kind of effort or kind of engagement the four wise ways of engaging uh that

272
