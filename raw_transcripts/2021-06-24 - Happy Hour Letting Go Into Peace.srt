00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:10,480
hello and formally welcome to this edition of happy hour

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,080
so for today's practice

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,279
my invitation is to explore

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,679
letting go letting go as a way to make space

5
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:37,600
to make space for more peace for more love for more space within

6
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:45,200
letting go of what is not necessary in the moment what is extra and there is so

7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,840
much extra often both internally and externally and

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,840
internally often many thoughts many [Music]

9
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:07,040
judgments criticisms you should do this you shouldn't do that just all extra so much reactivity is

10
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:16,320
just extra extra it's not needed what is extra can it be ah just put down

11
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:23,520
so for that we need to notice it with mindfulness with awareness and

12
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,640
simply putting it down and by putting it down then we can

13
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,159
notice oh there's more space for silence for peace

14
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:40,799
for goodness for love for care for nurturing for nourishment

15
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:47,759
so making space for love making space for love by letting go

16
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:58,479
and before we start i'd like to share a quote by john cemeto

17
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:06,880
and the quote is is longish one and a funny one

18
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:13,520
and i'll paste cut and paste the resource it's

19
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,680
here we go and later uh this especially for neil who's going to

20
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,319
be thank you neil for sharing for finding it later and sharing it with the sangha in the google

21
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:32,480
groups but here we go so here's the quote so ah john sumato

22
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,830
who's a monastic in the theravada tradition in the ajancha forest

23
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:44,480
[Music] forest practice so

24
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:51,440
he says the practice of letting go is very effective for minds obsessed

25
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,040
by compulsive thinking you simplify your meditation practice

26
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,800
down to just two words letting go rather than try to develop

27
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,920
this practice and then develop that and achieve this and go into that and

28
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:15,280
understand this and read the suttas and study the abi dhamma and then learn pali and sanskrit

29
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:22,000
then the madhyamika get ordination in the hinayana mahayana

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,280
vajrayana write books become a world renowned authority on buddhism

31
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,360
instead of becoming the world's expert on buddhism and being invited to great international

32
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,599
buddhist conferences just let go let go let go

33
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:45,920
i did nothing but this for about two years every time i tried to understand or

34
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,280
figure things out i'd say let go let go until the desire

35
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,879
would fade out so i'm making it very simple for you to save you from

36
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:03,120
getting caught in incredible amounts of suffering there is nothing more sorrowful than

37
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,840
having to attend international buddhist conferences some of you might have the desire to become

38
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,760
the buddha of the age maitreya radiating love through the world but

39
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:22,320
instead i suggest just being an earthworm letting go of the desire to radiate love

40
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,360
throughout the world just be an earthworm who knows only two

41
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:35,280
words let go let go let go you see ours is the lesser vehicle the hinayana

42
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:42,320
so we only have these simple poverty stricken practices so

43
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:49,280
[Laughter] it definitely has a sense of humor so

44
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:55,520
so let go so we'll practice a simple practice of letting go making space

45
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:03,120
making space for peace ease love letting go of whatever is extra

46
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,320
keeping it simple tonight so with that

47
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,720
ah i'd like to invite you to get into meditation

48
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,639

49
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,240

whatever is extra whatever is not needed

52
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,960
letting go of any tension you're holding

53
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,720
in your head and your forehead

54
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:21,840

55
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:35,840

63
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,520
letting go of their weight

64
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,120
letting gravity support pull down

65
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:13,840
the arms and hands

66
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,880
releasing any tension in the chest

67
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,720
inviting your heart to relax heart center

68
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:09,839
the proverbial space of emotions

69
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:37,839
releasing any tension ah tightness in the belly

70
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:56,640

71
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:04,079
letting go

any holding in the upper legs knees lower legs and feet

73
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:22,720
letting gravity support entire weight of the legs

74
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:33,839
the sub bounce

75
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:46,480
letting the body be breathed naturally on its own

76
00:10:46,480 --> 00:11:01,839
with each breath

77
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:35,600
letting go of whatever is extra in this moment the tension in the body tightness

78
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:42,480
any muscles

79
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,000
extra not needed

80
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:57,680
the natural state

81
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:11,839
this human body heart and mind is of profound peace clarity

82
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:25,839
and if thoughts preoccupations

83
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:37,279
anything that comes up that's not needed in this moment is giving as you give yourself wholeheartedly to

84
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,839
this practice

85
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:50,079
notice what's there isn't this is needed right now

86
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,560
is this really needed right now

87
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:03,519
this is needed at all simply let go

88
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:11,199
then notice what opens up what happens when

89
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:19,760
letting go when something is let go of then turn your awareness

90
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:25,519
to the space and the heart and mind and body that opens up

91
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:35,839
notice if there's more peace more freedom more ease more space

92
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:42,678
to love to be to care to be still [Music]

93
00:13:44,000 --> 00:14:03,839
self-care self-love in the stillness

94
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:13,839
mindfully notice what's extra

95
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:27,440
let go and notice what opens up mindfully

96
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:41,839
what is here when what is extra not needed is let go of very simple practice

97
00:15:52,839 --> 00:16:01,440
foundation for more peace self-care

98
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:09,839
and love

99
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:36,240
and if hindrances arise of restlessness

100
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,840
or boredom

101
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,400
or sensual desire oral will

102
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:54,080
or doubt can they simply be noticed

103
00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:08,720
as extra heavy not needed can they be simply be let go

104
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:21,200
and returning to the body and the breath

105
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:35,840
letting go of what's neat what's not needed what's extra

106
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:44,799
letting go again and again

107
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:50,080
patiently joyfully gladly

108
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:58,960
simply lovingly

109
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:13,840
not throwing anything with hatred or will but releasing releasing

110
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:27,840
releasing letting it fly away

111
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:41,840
feeling lighter upon the release

112
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:30,320
as if you're opening a door a window letting a bird fly away that was

113
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:37,840
previously inside thrashing about confined

114
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:46,080
in your mind and your heart open the door the window release let it go

115
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,840
ah

116
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,840
okay

117
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:17,280
and as we approach the end of this practice

118
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,400
session together

119
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:27,680
if any judgments any thoughts

120
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:35,520
arise of self-criticism

121
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,838
mindfully see them clearly

122
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:54,720
they are not needed they are extra they are really extra bumping

123
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,520
inside

124
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:09,200
open the door window let them fly away they're not needed thank you

thanks everyone thanks for your practice

129
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:17,040
what a lovely practice to let go what's extra what's not needed

130
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:22,400
so much we realize is extra not needed

131
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:30,720
so i will change the settings now in the chat

132
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:38,400
you're welcome to type in chat your reflections your questions your discoveries share

134
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:52,240
read your name it'll be private if it's the sangha i'll read your name you can also raise your

135
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:57,279
zoom hand your physical hand i may not see

136
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:04,960
yeah marie christine says simple and yet so powerful yeah powerful

137
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,480
indeed would you like to say more murray christine

138
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:18,079
yes or no you can shake your hand i'm seeing you yes that's it yes i think okay i'll ask

139
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,560
you to unmute yourself

140
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:32,240
okay you can unmute yourself if you wish i suppose powerful in the sense of um

141
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:38,320
the impact it can have on one's well-being with a physical and mental so something that seems so little can be

142
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:46,480
so transformative yes yes exactly absolutely right right it's a little

143
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,440
practice that could

144
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:59,760
and um yeah it's um and as you say this i want to

145
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:07,920
emphasize and really appreciate highlight what you're saying regarding the power of this seemingly

146
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:14,960
simple practice of letting go because it is a liberative practice it's

147
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:20,170
a practice of that leads to freedom to letting go and

148
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:27,520
[Music] um see what can i say without getting too

149
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:33,200
technical um it seems a very simple practice

150
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:39,680
it oh yeah it seems like a beginner's practice and almost but and yet there are

151
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:46,720
stages in practice very very um deep meditative

152
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:53,440
i'll say advanced state stages of insight practice where actually the

153
00:40:53,440 --> 00:41:02,319
technique of letting go is what unbinds it unbinds the um

154
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:08,960
the the just the remaining attachments and leads to a profound opening this state of

155
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,240
freedom it's the very movement of the mind i hope that makes sense yeah

156
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,480
it feels like it undo it undoes me or you from the addictive behavior from the

157
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:29,520
addiction in a way yeah of doing things in a particular way and thinking in a particular way yeah yeah exactly it's so powerful

158
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:36,400
it makes so much space for what's good and wholesome yeah yeah

159
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:44,319
thanks for underlying that it's simple yet so powerful thank you mark christine

160
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:49,440
ah the other reflections observations

161
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,480
do you notice complaints questions

162
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:08,960
anything hello yes hi hi i i well what i have

163
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:16,720
heard is um we can't let go it's like um

164
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:24,640
we think we are in control of that but i think if we just set intention

165
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:32,800
uh you know a good intention or aspiration to let go that it goes on its own

166
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:39,440
so if if we are if we are in control it is

167
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,880
you know a couple steps removed or quite a few steps

168
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:52,079
you never tried to go let go let go the more you try try try the farther you

169
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:57,920
are from actually doing it yeah yeah thanks for raising that so there

170
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:03,760
are a couple of different things here actually so um and i appreciate you raising that

171
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:10,400
because when i teach i bring up both so there is this idea of setting the intention to

172
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:19,520
let go and yet there is this movement of the mind that does let go and yet there are times

173
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:25,040
that that some things are so so so the letting go is actually practice

174
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:31,440
for the simple movements of the mind and yet sometimes there are things for

175
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:36,640
example resentments say or say

176
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:44,160
yeah you want to forgive and you don't want to have the resentment or the upset it's better or the anger and

177
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:50,400
letting go if you try to let go in that way sometimes actually you get yourself kind

178
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:57,040
of tied up even more and more so there is a wisdom to know the

179
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:03,440
difference between the two so as i johnson mega points out in this simple yet powerful

180
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:09,200
practice there is a wisdom in not just setting the intention but actually practicing letting go in the

181
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:14,960
way of because the mind can't let go we can't just say oh we can't let go and just it's not possible so

182
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:20,560
so there my some movements in the mind that you can actually feel it it's subtle but

183
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:28,000
you can see it and feel it um that oh yeah this this thing that was heavy

184
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,440
you you it's let go of you set the intention oh it just let go of there's

185
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:39,760
lightness brightness and and ease and yet there are times when you set the

186
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:47,359
intention you try to let go you offer the the the practice as in the words of virgin tomato let go let

187
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:52,480
go and and yet it's tied in place so instead of beating yourself

188
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:59,280
up realizing those times that it is not so much

189
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:05,520
a doing but it's a non-doing so the practice can feel a little

190
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:12,800
quizzical or or perhaps non-dual in some ways you're both doing the letting go and

191
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:18,640
you're both not doing the letting go so i think both aspects of those are

192
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:26,720
of the practice are important to be held not to say it's just one or the other

193
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:36,720
so stephanie my stephanie says hello all i

194
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:43,520
was trying to let go of stories around strong physical sensations and to just be with the powerful

195
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:48,720
sensations lovely lovely that is beautiful yeah letting go

196
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:56,079
of the stories and just being with the sensations nice great yeah

197
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:02,079
beautiful i want i'd love to hear more from you stephanie and i do see anthony's hand

198
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:08,480
and i also realized hi so let's hold those two comments for when we come back from

199
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:15,359
small groups because i want to make sure we have enough time for those so so let's practice

200
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:22,720
let go of being in the big community in the big room and move to smaller

201
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:28,480
groups where we will practice together

202
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:34,640
in groups of three or four and let's start with 15 seconds of

203
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:41,680
silent meta for one another and then share as little or as much as you'd like to share

204
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:47,920
about this practice and how it was for you so i will open the rooms now and we'll come

205
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:57,440
back with some time at the end for reflections okay here we go welcome back welcome back

206
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:03,040
so um we have a few minutes and yes anthony had

207
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:09,680
his hand up and it'd be nice to hear more from stephanie if she's she'd like to if she wants to

208
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:15,599
share more it's okay if not so anthony please

209
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:21,920
yes thank you nikki uh i'm actually gonna change what i'm gonna say uh from the group meeting uh one of the

210
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:28,000
crew members mentioned something that really connected with me about how she had some uh i think she

211
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,040
said aches in her upper back or something like that and uh

212
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:38,319
and then she let go but and then that that just brought up to me that wow that's so

213
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:45,200
amazing that that's a i literally thought that's the best way to connect with letting go is our bodies

214
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:50,559
you know because we're usually we have some kind of tension going on somewhere you know contraction

215
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:57,359
and uh it's easy to connect with the body and to let go you know i just wanted to bring that up yeah

216
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:03,440
fantastic yeah thank you thanks for bringing that up great and um

217
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:10,079
and stephanie if you like to share you are welcome to and if not that's okay too

218
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:17,760
we'll open it up for you hi okay hi hi um yeah so

219
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:24,480
in the group we kind of continued on that theme a little bit and how when you drop

220
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:31,119
what you're thinking you are left with body that's it and sometimes it's really

221
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:36,640
intense um and that that's pretty much

222
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:42,079
it i'm not yeah that's it yeah yeah that's that's great that's a

223
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:47,200
great observation when you let go of the busyness of the mind you

224
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:53,119
come actually that's very profound you come to the body that oh oh sweet dear body i've forsaken you

225
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:59,520
