1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,020
so good uh good day everyone warm greetings

2
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:16,080
and to come and sit in meditation

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,660
for me is often a very what kind of a homecoming

4
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,920
but it's also kind of uh

5
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:36,140
um I don't know if sobering is the right word but it's a time to

6
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:44,280
settle down in a meaningful way into the fullness of life in all the

7
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,340
different aspects and since this week we're talking about challenges

8
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:59,699
even when I've had a major [Music] challenges with tragedies and things

9
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:06,060
I've always felt that coming to meditation was not an avoidance of

10
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,280
but all but there was a rightness

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:18,299
there was a satisfaction in sitting present for it all

12
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:25,140
that borders on being Pleasant but to say it's Pleasant seems to be too

13
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:32,700
much given the enormity of what's Happening so I say that it feels like a rightness

14
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:39,180
to it all it's right to sit in the middle of it it's right to

15
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,540
be with what's happening it's right to be

16
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:50,700
non-defensive non-resistant non-critical

17
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:58,680
non externalizing it's right to be here for these minutes

18
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,280
in the middle of it all breathing present

19
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:12,920
and even though it might seem disrespectful to the challenge we have

20
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:20,879
that sense of rightness can be a partner or be a sibling

21
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:29,180
or be the same as a certain kind of pleasure a certain kind of pleasantness

22
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:37,040
a certain kind of pleasant that it comes from breathing easy

23
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:44,099
a pleasantness or that comes from an awareness

24
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:51,680
of it all that is tender and gentle kind

25
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,680
supportive compassionate

26
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,360
or is non-again non-resistant non-critical non

27
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:10,379
not caught up in thoughts and ideas so sometimes in Buddhism we call this

28
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:16,260
wholesome wholesome attention a wholesome attention to what is

29
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:23,400
difficult where you know all the

30
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,700
the cracks of our preoccupations and thoughts

31
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:34,680
maybe we begin getting a glimpse of this feeling of rightness and

32
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:42,299
even a maybe we call it bordering unpleasant Pleasant attention

33
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:48,420
and when there are no challenges it's a time to train and develop our

34
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:53,900
capacity to take in

35
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:01,200
Pleasant big part of this practice is to show up

36
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,440
for what is happening but we often have a selectivity

37
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:13,439
bias sometimes to the negative

38
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:19,680
and there's an art to this practice of being present for what is

39
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:27,060
that takes into account what is Pleasant takes it into account enough that it has

40
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:33,300
a influence on us that it kind of settles us helps the

41
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:41,900
Mind want to be in the present moment so to

42
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,320
enter into your meditation posture

43
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:59,460
and adjusting your posture looking for a posture that has some modicum

44
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:04,100
of rightness feeling right

45
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:11,520
feeling right for the purpose of being attentive not right for the purpose of being

46
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,400
relaxed though that's nice

47
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,960
but for the emphasis is on alertness

48
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,720
gently closing the eyes

49
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:42,120
and taking some long slow deep breaths in a way that's right for you

50
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,520
feels like a good way of connecting to yourself to

51
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:54,020
your body how deep that is is up to you

52
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,780
and relaxing on the exhale

53
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:26,699
letting the breathing return to normal and scan through the body and see where

54
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:31,800
on the exhale you can soften and relax the body

55
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:39,780
and as you do so to feel whatever pleasantness or relief

56
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,639
that comes from that relaxation

57
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:40,440
and then to calmly

58
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:45,259
settle into the body breathing

59
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:04,620
where awareness has a light enough touch with breathing most likely

60
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,780
the physical sensations of breathing

61
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:17,599
or the place where awareness touches the body

62
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:35,880
where the touch is light soft

63
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:44,820
where awareness yields to the sensations of breathing

64
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,639
the movements in the body of the breathing

65
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:41,459
and is there anything Pleasant in the cycle of breathing the in-breath

66
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:47,820
or the out breath anything that feels Pleasant or

67
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:56,100
satisfying or or simply has a rightness goodness

68
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,600
in attending to it

69
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:47,839
without denying any unpleasant or

70
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:54,620
painful experiences in the moment

71
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:05,480
as you're aware of your breathing also be aware of what is Pleasant

72
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,579
and can you relax the mind that's mindful

73
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:54,980
so that awareness mindfulness of breathing itself has some pleasure in it some rightness

74
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:04,680
the awareness of breathing is open allowing receptive

75
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:09,019
kind gentle

76
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:24,140
or there's a certain Joy or Delight in the application of attention

77
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:39,140
that maybe is similar to Joy or Delight I'll be playing a musical instrument or

78
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,500
doing a craft

79
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:55,880
being involved with breathing with interest and giving ourselves over to it

80
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:05,660
where wherever whatever is unpleasant now

81
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:14,760
is included on this in the side with at the center

82
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:20,480
taking in whatever is Pleasant in the moment

83
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:30,300
without holding on to it or insisting on it just gently hear

84
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:44,160
when we tighten up around something resist

85
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,980
something when we become antagonistic towards

86
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:58,639
something afraid all those movements of mind

87
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:05,520
are unpleasant and that other unpleasantness

88
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:13,460
has an influence on us as in if if those things are happening

89
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:20,600
recognize it but don't linger there

90
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:27,299
look for what is Pleasant see if you can adjust and find a

91
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:34,100
pleasant way or to be aware to be present

92
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,679
let yourself be influenced conditioned

93
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:47,059
by what is Pleasant no matter how small it might be

94
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:57,799
so that you're less likely to be adding the unpleasantness of reactivity

95
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,960
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

96
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:02,179
is there a way that you can now bring to mind

97
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:09,299
people of your life known and unknown strangers and

98
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:15,080
known people friends and neighbors colleagues

99
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:26,760
bring them to mind or gaze out upon them in a way that feels has some

100
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:33,960
pleasure in it some positive feeling of

101
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:40,200
pleasantness to relax settle back

102
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:47,059
to calmly gaze upon the world where the gazing

103
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:54,960
has a kind of pleasantness in it or goodness in it

104
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,840
that you wish for all people to have

105
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,260
May everyone have the ability to

106
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:12,419
be aware pleasantly calmly

107
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:19,400
where they enjoy attending to others

108
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:25,279
where there's our rightness no there's no stress

109
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:31,799
where there's no resistance or worry mixed up with

110
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:35,539
the awareness of others

111
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:42,658
The Gaze upon the world kindly

112
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:49,400
into wish others to have

113
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:56,580
also to have well-being

114
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:02,480
to be able to come from a place of their goodness

115
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,620
their kindness their care

116
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,140
may all beings

117
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:19,260
know their own goodness may all beings

118
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:24,620
no how to tap into

119
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:31,700
the pleasure of awareness

120
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,700
the freedom of non-clinging

121
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,899
the warmth of generosity

122
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:55,220
the safety of non-harming

123
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:02,360
may all beings be happy

124
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:07,759
may all beings be safe

125
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:17,600
may all beings be peaceful may all beings be free

126
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:31,039
[Music]

127
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:12,919
so to continue the topic of the Dharma of challenges

128
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:22,020
we will be challenged in this life that's uh that's a certainty

129
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:30,179
and how do we meet it how does the Dharma help us with it and so building on last week The Fourth

130
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:38,640
Kind of meaning of Dharma is Dharma as teachings and so for Buddhists the teachings of the Buddha

131
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:44,940
and so how can they be a resource a support for us and our challenges

132
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:50,520
one of them is to orient us in a Direction that's effective and

133
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:57,659
meaningful and to kind of take in the teachings of the Buddha maybe in their fullness

134
00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:03,419
and to see sometimes you have to it's not necessarily what's predominantly taught

135
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:09,179
but the the overall

136
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:14,520
kind of uh foundation for what's being taught there

137
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:19,559
and so there's a two things that uh stand out to me that when I read the

138
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:27,659
sutas points to a very important Direction in which to help us in times of challenges or this

139
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:32,940
challenging life one is I'll start with a metaphor

140
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:39,139
because then maybe what I'll say will kind of

141
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:45,899
be more understandable less protests

142
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:51,059
and that is that if a person is an athlete

143
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:57,659
and say they're going to do a very important they're going to run a race

144
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:02,820
and it's important to raise them and for them

145
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:09,299
and they need to be kind of at their very top physical ability to do this

146
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:16,080
so in the hour before the race that person is going to take

147
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:22,679
responsibility for how best to be ready for the race

148
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:30,000
and they're going to be very focused on that and very intentional and so if they need to do something

149
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,340
they'll make sure that that can be done some of that is warming up some of them

150
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:41,520
might be doing gentle runs doing they're doing the very thing that they're going to be doing at the race but doing it

151
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:47,520
kind of slowly warming up a little bit faster and faster getting the body kind of limber and ready for it and the

152
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:53,460
system going and uh but they're taking responsibility they're not asking their trainer to run

153
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:59,460
for them um if they need to kind of set their mind in a certain State they might

154
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:05,700
meditate or do something maybe they even take a nap or maybe they just you know

155
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:11,520
do something like I don't know uh that clearly it takes them their mind off the race

156
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:17,100
so that they're much more can relax more deeply and not be kind of caught in some

157
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:22,980
tension around it and so they're very intentional and they're taking responsibility for doing

158
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:28,980
the thing that will take their mind off the race so the the athlete is taking is really

159
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:34,919
taking responsibility more than maybe anybody else they're not kind of looking at the weather every

160
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:41,279
every five minutes uh you know uh you know thinking about whether the weather's not particularly good and

161
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:47,399
maybe it'll get better and and they're just you know or they're not kind of going around complaining that the track

162
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:53,279
is not as even as they wish it could be and they're going around kind of to everyone say look this is not right then

163
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:59,580
no one can do anything in such a late time but you know if it's important to go and complain

164
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:06,000
they don't do that they take responsibility for how they're going to show up getting themselves ready

165
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,000
so what we find in the teachings of the Buddha is that the orientation that he

166
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,099
has can be a little bit like getting ready for life

167
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:23,280
and uh and taking responsibility for ourselves to get ourselves in the right

168
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:29,460
frame of mind the right capacity the right skills the right strengths so that

169
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:34,679
we can engage in life fully and it's uh and so there's a distinction

170
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:39,960
here that I think is useful the distinction of seeing the Dharma Dharma

171
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:45,540
practice as that part of uh life where we're

172
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:51,898
kind of preparing ourselves for life we're loosening ourselves up freeing ourselves up getting limbered up getting

173
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:58,500
ready getting wise understanding ourselves in a way that only we can take responsibility for

174
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:04,920
when we're in the middle of a challenge then the challenge has its own

175
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:12,300
uh dynamics that we have to take care of and do and address but in terms of the Dharma of the

176
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:18,660
challenge a big part of that is taking responsibility for our end of it how are

177
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:25,260
we participating and so um you know so like I can imagine that if a

178
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:32,640
racer is racing along and um and some fellow Racers next to next

179
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:38,220
next running next to him and says something really mean just to kind of trip up you

180
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:43,440
uh during their race um you don't kind of letting go argue

181
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:50,040
with the person and tell them that let's let's have a meeting and talk about this and work it out if you're in the race

182
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:56,820
you just kind of take responsibility for yourself in order to kind of kind of manage with your feelings so you can do

183
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:02,099
the race when we're in the world of challenges with our people and arguments and

184
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:07,320
difficulties we take care of the difficulty in an appropriate way and sometimes we do have the conversation

185
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:13,320
with people do say tell things to people but that what's important to remember is that

186
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:18,540
Dharma is always kind of taking responsibility for how we are

187
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:24,180
to see what we're contributing to the challenge to see how we're contributing to our own suffering and distress around

188
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:29,820
this even though the other person has caused a lot of distress the Dharma is

189
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:37,020
found by really centering here and finding out what are we doing and finding the freedom here

190
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:42,599
so that when we are in the race of life if we are in the middle of the challenges of life and what's going on

191
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:48,480
we're in a good place to be able to do that effectively and honestly and

192
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:55,440
clearly and and do what needs to be done in it not to avoid anything but to really be

193
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:01,859
able to come from this place of freedom and generosity and kindness and non-stress

194
00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:08,700
so you find this tremendous emphasis on it's kind of a very strong individualistic teaching

195
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:14,220
that the Buddha gave this kind of really take responsibility for yourself

196
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:21,420
so that you can care for others it's not an individual it's the culture is very collectivist and connected to people and

197
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:26,760
what's going on but there's something we have to do here that's what the Dharma practice is found

198
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:32,099
it's a big degree we do it together with other people we're supported by each other we're

199
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:37,140
married each other and but this kind of emphasis on what are we doing here

200
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:45,000
what's our contribution and then when we do that another part of the teaching which uh is a phenomenal

201
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,940
and I think in the modern world we're learning how important it is for many circumstances

202
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:57,540
and that is um the willingness to feel pleasure

203
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:04,140
uh the Buddha's teachings is very very focused now we're both taking responsibility for what's happening but

204
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:09,300
also understanding that what we do conditions us

205
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:15,440
what we do uh creates a habit what we do creates an environment that then

206
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:22,200
conditions conditions us and if we do things which are unhealthy that kind of creates an unhealthy

207
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:29,460
conditioning within us and we're more likely to kind of feel often when we feel off we're more likely

208
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:35,220
to do unhealthy things and so in taking responsibility for

209
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:42,540
ourselves the idea is to find what conditions us positively do that do the things that create a good

210
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:48,480
environment for ourselves so that that influences us and it's not being Pollyanna it's just

211
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:55,740
not be coding over and pretending that there isn't difficulties in suffering the Dharma practice is the opposite of

212
00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:01,079
that it's really being honest for what's happening and showing up but in doing so

213
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:06,720
how do we be present for this all this so that the way we're attending the way

214
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:12,180
we're being with our experience and ourselves is has a positive influence on

215
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:18,420
us is a positive conditioning so if we show up with stress if we show

216
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:24,300
up resistance and anger if we show up with um with um

217
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:30,900
with you know Greed for something that's going to condition Us in ways which are not really helpful and long

218
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:37,680
term we have to kind of condition but if we show up to difficulties with and

219
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:42,960
sometimes rather than showing up with positive States the best we can do is

220
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:49,560
show up with the absence of the negative ones we show up without giving in to anger we might be angry we won't give

221
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:56,880
into it we don't complain we might be greedy we don't give into it so it

222
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,760
doesn't it's the giving into and the participating that uh is what where the conditioning

223
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:09,119
is so um so a big part of mindfulness practice

224
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:15,720
is to be mindful for what's happening but we can carry along with us that

225
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:21,720
awareness that mindfulness of the present moment we can carry it baggage with us where there's as little

226
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:26,820
complaining a little fear a little stress or big going on or little kind of

227
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:32,339
sense of Duty and pushing and trying hard or expectation or wanting it to be

228
00:40:32,339 --> 00:40:38,700
different all kinds of conditioning things we do that are reinforcing

229
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:45,660
something which is not so pleasant for us not not beneficial for us doesn't prepare us for the race

230
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:52,619
but can we learn how to be mindful even of great difficulties so that how we're

231
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:57,780
mindful is satisfying how mindful has a positive

232
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:05,339
influence on us even if all that is and it's not not a minor thing is we can

233
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:12,180
be aware of what's happening with clarity we're clear and open

234
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:18,300
and available for what's there and we can't some summon up kindness we can't sum it up

235
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:24,359
compassion we can't sum it up uh generosity or but it does feel good to

236
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:30,200
just kind of step forward openly and be aware oh yes

237
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:37,859
that's a good conditioning so it can seem like a big burden

238
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:43,320
to be involved in a practice that we have to take responsibility for

239
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:50,480
ourselves in it and that it's a central feature and it can seem like somehow

240
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,980
not a realistic spirituality to start

241
00:41:55,980 --> 00:42:02,520
being conditioned by what's Pleasant the enjoyable

242
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:07,859
but it turns out that that

243
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:14,220
is a path away of preparing ourselves for being in this

244
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:19,400
world in a very realistic way and a beneficial way in a full way

245
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:28,260
that we are not prepared preparing ourselves if we show up with complaining

246
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:35,160
and anger and fear and distress and kind of clamping down giving up

247
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:41,640
there's all these things the Mind does that we give into or allow for

248
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:49,140
and it's a phenomenal thing to be beginning to reclaim

249
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:54,780
a certain kind of personal power certain kind of personal strength

250
00:42:54,780 --> 00:43:02,099
where we don't succumb we don't collapse and we don't give in to things which are unhealthy for us and

251
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:09,240
unhealthy for the world and out of that grows the Lotus and Muddy Waters

252
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:14,700
if the all the complicated difficulty of our life the ways in which we're caught

253
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:21,480
up in in attachments and clinging and and unhealthy Behavior

254
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:26,880
rather than seeing it as being unfortunate it's the compost

255
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:34,740
from which can grow the lotus and um and ha and and I mean it becomes

256
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:40,319
compost if we don't participate in it if we don't grow it

257
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:47,640
but allow it to kind of settle back into the soil and Decay and and support the

258
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:52,880
growth of something quite beautiful so that's uh

259
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:58,560
uh you know the Dharma is also teachings and this is I think some of the central

260
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:03,599
teachings that from the Buddha that I think can challenge us can enliven us

261
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:08,900
can give us a directionality for being with challenges that begins this process

262
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:15,180
of showing up for challenges with a certain kind of personal strength

263
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:21,839
personal agency that um that uh

264
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:28,640
is so important and challenges is when we don't have agencies when we feel helpless and hopeless

265
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:35,880
it really has a powerfully negative conditioning for us and the Dharma says you're never

266
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:41,339
helpless because you can always show up and bring practice to it

267
00:44:41,339 --> 00:44:47,220
even if you can't change what's going on even if you do all the preparations in

268
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:54,720
the world and you're at your Peak shape for the race you might still lose the race

269
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:00,180
but boy was it good to show up and be present to do the race in the best state

270
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:05,339
that we can be in maybe that was the winning not the literal winning of the

271
00:45:05,339 --> 00:45:10,980
race so thank you and um May you look at

272
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:17,640
today as you go through the day look and see about how the state of your

273
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:24,660
mind how the state of your reactivity to what's going on in the world how you participate in anything you're

274
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:29,819
doing how you might be conditioning

275
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:35,700
yourself it has a what influence does it have on your state of being your state of mind

276
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:41,339
just study that and maybe to really get into that study I have some

277
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:50,460
conversations with people about how this works for you so thank you and um we'll go back have

278
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:53,480
another challenge tomorrow
