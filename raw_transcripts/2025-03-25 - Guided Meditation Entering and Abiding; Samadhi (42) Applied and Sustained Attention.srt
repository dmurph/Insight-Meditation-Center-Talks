1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:09,480
so welcome to this meditation session and to

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:16,358
begin to assume a meditation posture that

3
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:21,400
is supportive for you to

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:28,119
feel embodied an embodied connection to here and

5
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:35,360
now it's not so much that you're going to use your

6
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:43,920
mind to direct yourself to be here now but

7
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:53,399
to start with the body and when you're careful with your

8
00:00:53,399 --> 00:01:00,079
posture this is the beginning

9
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:10,680
of coming into the present with your body as if your body is the very

10
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:18,240
foundation the beginning the source for being here and now

11
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,280
and so being a little careful with your posture adjust making small

12
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:34,560
adjustments you might sway back and forth sideways and even forward and

13
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:40,840
back as a way of finding a

14
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,200
midpoint for your sitting bones your tailbone to hold your

15
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,680
weight if you're sitting upright if you're lying

16
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:59,000
down to adjust your to a little bit rock back and forth to adjust your shoulder

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,078
blades so they're a little bit more down your

18
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:12,440
back those sitting maybe can sit with a little straighter but bringing in the

19
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,400
spine between the shoulder

20
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:26,040
blades and there's an art to closing your

21
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:32,360
eyes where you do that quite consciously

22
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,879
carefully attending to the eyes as you close the

23
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:44,599
eyelids and allowing the eye eyesight the eyes to

24
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:53,000
rest and closing the eyelids is a practice of beginning to turn your

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,200
attention into the body so you can feel

26
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,160
sense the body more fully

27
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:11,040
closing the eyes and in a sense what we're

28
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,959
interested in is the subjective experience of the body if we live in our

29
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:24,159
heads in our thoughts where we direct our attention

30
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:31,280
to the body the body becomes the object

31
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,200
but the body is a field of sensations with the

32
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:44,799
eyes closed what we actually experience is this field of

33
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:52,319
sensations and they are just as much part of ourselves as a thought

34
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:01,439
is in some ways maybe it's more deeply who we are

35
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:09,920
because all the sensations of the body connect are connected to a

36
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:19,799
deep mental feel of understanding

37
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:26,880
responding feeling that in a certain way is the

38
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:35,840
foundation for how we understand ourselves so not to hold yourself apart from the

39
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:43,639
body be here in the body be your body for a few

40
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:48,000
minutes and as you

41
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:54,160
exhale soften the

42
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,440
body relaxing

43
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:09,120
the body and as the body softens and relaxes it can have a nice effect on the

44
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:14,720
mind maybe the mind begins to

45
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:25,160
relax feeling your body more fully as you inhale

46
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,440
releasing into your body as you

47
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:53,360
exhale and then centering yourself on your breathing in a certain way breathing is

48
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,360
at the nexus the crossroads of almost everything that

49
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:06,080
goes on in your body breathing adjusts and changes

50
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:12,639
depending on our emotions level of agitation or

51
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:23,280
energy and as we relax and settle and get calmer the breath slows down

52
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,960
the heartbeat slows

53
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:38,080
down stress hormones in our body

54
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,840
reduce centering yourself on your breathing

55
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,639
at the end of the exhale taking a moment to

56
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:05,800
pause don't breathe in right away pause just long

57
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:12,199
enough to feel where deep

58
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:18,080
inside is the urge the original urge to breathe in

59
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:24,680
and as soon as you feel that then allow yourself to

60
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:31,199
inhale starting from that place where the original urge the

61
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,000
first urges the deepest

62
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,440
urge and follow the inhale

63
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:53,039
calmly relaxedly accompany the whole length of

64
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,280
your

65
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:09,000
inhale and let there be a short pause at the top of the inhale

66
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:20,720
becoming quiet in your mind so you can better feel the urge to

67
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:26,479
exhale and then release the

68
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:33,159
exhale relax with the exhale

69
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,959
accompany the whole length of the

70
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:59,560
exhale and feeling the whole sensations of breathing in and breathing

71
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:06,640
out continuously allows the influence of

72
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:15,040
awareness the influence of feeling and sensing to

73
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:23,800
spread beyond the edges of breathing the sensations of breathing

74
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:56,320
letting the thinking mind

75
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:04,279
quiet during the transition from breathing out to breathing in

76
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,399
and for the thinking mind to become

77
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:22,360
quieter in the change from breathing in to out out to in

78
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,760
and then a small image metaphor

79
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:09,600
for being focus focusing on

80
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:17,519
breathing imagine you're going to thread a needle and you want to do so in the

81
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:23,519
first attempt so on the

82
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:32,800
inhale you line up the thread and the hole of the needle and you allow yourself to be very

83
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:40,600
very still and quiet so everything is quiet

84
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,319
still and then the

85
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:52,200
exhale it's like you focus on the exhale the sensations of

86
00:11:52,200 --> 00:12:00,399
exhale very carefully and precisely as if you're threading the

87
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:08,240
needle but again letting the thinking mind become

88
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,040
quiet so you can be fully there for this

89
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:22,440
delicate and precise act of threading the exhale being right

90
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,920
there to the end

91
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,760
threading the eye of the

92
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,880
needle by sensing

93
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,160
feeling the whole length of breathing

94
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:57,680
out preparing to do it by feeling the whole length of the breathing

95
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:11,279
in quieting the thinking mind don't have to stop thinking but let

96
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:16,920
thinking become quieter calmer

97
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:42,920
where the eye of the needle that you're focused on is whatever is

98
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:51,040
pleasurable whatever pleasant and sensations there are related to

99
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:59,160
breathing maybe it's a generalized sense

100
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:06,720
of pleasure well-being goodness

101
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:14,240
sweetness around the edges of breathing

102
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,000
feeling that as you breathe

103
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:38,320
in and in its precise way pass through pass your awareness

104
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:44,680
through the eye of the needle of pleasure

105
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,160
well-being as you

106
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,920
exhale as if you're entering

107
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:10,319
Gently calmly with a

108
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,120
loving dedication

109
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:24,600
enter into your breathing the

110
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,480
pleasure well-being of

111
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:35,440
breathing and abide

112
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:43,600
there rest there over and over again gently with

113
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:52,679
each inhale and exhale enter and abide

114
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:32,360
whatever sensations of pleasure or joy

115
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,720
well-being are here as you

116
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:46,880
meditate enter into the subjective feeling of that

117
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:56,559
as if that's who you are more than your thoughts and

118
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:05,840
ideas and as you breathe feel it as you breathe

119
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:14,440
in enter it as you exhale rest in it

120
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:29,720
like a gentle massage entering and abiding

121
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:40,120
when you come to the end of your exhale pause for a brief

122
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:46,759
moment until you feel the urge to breathe in

123
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:56,520
give in to that urge and as you breathe

124
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:03,159
in imagine that your field of awareness spreads

125
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:09,760
outward through your body beyond your body out into this room

126
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:16,840
you're in place out across the lands

127
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,480
and that as you exhale you're abiding

128
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:33,400
resting in the middle of this wide field of

129
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:40,840
awareness breathing in and entering the whole

130
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:46,720
world with awareness with your imagination

131
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:53,840
with your sense of spatial s spatial

132
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:02,120
awareness entering a wide field that you breathe

133
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:07,120
in and abiding in it as you

134
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:13,799
exhale almost as a subjective field of

135
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:20,039
becoming awareness that embraces the whole world

136
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:42,600
and then letting

137
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,799
that wide field of

138
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:53,600
awareness become a channel for your good

139
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:02,000
will for your care your

140
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:10,880
kindness as if you're able to

141
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:19,799
nourish the whole world by the unseen ways in which our

142
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:26,880
kindness travels through our speech our act actions our

143
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:34,120
thoughts may all beings be happy

144
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:40,240
may all beings be

145
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:48,639
safe may all beings be

146
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:55,919
peaceful may all beings be

147
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,720
free and if nothing else may this practice show

148
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:18,200
me how I can free all beings from my own desires aversions and

149
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:25,320
projections maybe we can start with that may all

150
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,639
beings be free

151
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:42,539
[Music]

152
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,158
thank you

153
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:58,240
so hello and welcome to this next talk on samadei

154
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:04,039
and we have now reached the point of uh immersive

155
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:12,520
samadei which the word in poli is janna j h a n

156
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:19,679
a and there is some idea that demology of janna might be uh connected to the

157
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:28,158
word for a flame and if that's the case then it's um the

158
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:35,320
um a candle flame which uh it's completely out of any kind of

159
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:41,799
wind and so the flame is completely still but it's luminous and

160
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:48,960
dynamic and um and so this luminosity and dynamism of samadei

161
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,440
um that comes when things are really completely still and so we're kind of

162
00:30:54,440 --> 00:31:01,559
entering almost a kind of a stillness that has dynamism in

163
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:09,159
it and uh and uh so it's the fully full stillness is partly fully in the present

164
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:17,440
moment fully just here and to think of it as fully in the subjective experience

165
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,880
not the subjective interpretation of this experience not the subjective

166
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:29,120
opinion about the experience but the subjective sensations of it the feelings

167
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:34,399
the direct experience of it um so you

168
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:41,600
know you could watch someone uh go for a nice dip in a peaceful quiet

169
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:47,600
safe lake and you can just appreciate that uh they seem to be it's just a

170
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:55,519
luxuriating and the cool lake in a day when it's really hot or a warm lake day

171
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,720
when it's cold and um but it's you know it's out

172
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:08,080
there it's kind of objective it's very different to go into the lake oneself

173
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:14,000
and feel how subjectively ah this is good the subjective experience comes

174
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:22,159
with a feeling ah this is good now I'm here this is really feels nice um and so

175
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:27,640
the feeling of niceness of goodness is very subjective and it's very kind of

176
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:33,760
embodied it's not a thought that's not an opinion it's not a conclusion it's

177
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:42,080
something that's deeper than that and that's one of the reasons why to go into deep absorption the thinking mind gets

178
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:48,320
very very quiet eventually in deeper states of concentration thinking mind uh

179
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:54,600
especially the discurs the thinking mind seems to stop entirely or almost

180
00:32:54,600 --> 00:33:01,080
entirely and but for to go into the first Janna what stops is discursive

181
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:07,480
thinking there's no more telling stories no more coming to conclusions and having

182
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:13,200
opinions there's no more thoughts about the past and the future these are all

183
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:20,320
story making mind the discursive mind and so that level of the mind which takes a lot of energy takes a lot of

184
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:26,000
abst ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab ab abstraction and ideas and bringing them together into kind of in a story

185
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,440
into a conversation that becomes quiet." And so what happens instead is there

186
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:37,440
might be still very simple thinking but it's thinking just about being here he

187
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:43,880
it's almost like we're telling ourselves oh good stay here oh this is good and

188
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:50,320
so at some point there's this transition then where the ordinary discursive mind

189
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:55,600
becomes quiet and sometimes that can go happen kind of quickly kind of suddenly

190
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:01,679
we feel something shifts or changes or turns upside down or settles in the mind

191
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:09,118
and now that mind is the thinking mind is no longer there the discursive mind and sometimes it's some inner

192
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:14,800
feeling that of being kind of arriving boom We're here and there's no doubt

193
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,720
about it then the mind doesn't want to wander off we've entered and abided in

194
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:28,878
the first Janna the the um uh this arrival here still is dynamic in some

195
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:34,158
ways and the the the uh important qualities that are present is something

196
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:40,480
called vaka and vichara which uh is we've talked about this earlier has to

197
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:46,919
do with um uh one way of understanding it is applied attention and sustained

198
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:54,158
attention entering and abiding applying like stay right here it's kind of like

199
00:34:54,159 --> 00:35:00,760
the movement you do with uh kneading water into flour uh massaging

200
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:10,640
something it's kind of the the movement of um um of uh uh you know a bird that's

201
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,839
lifting itself up off the ground by gently maybe a very big bird flapping

202
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:22,720
its wings calmly and fully um powerfully and uh so it needs to do that flapping

203
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:30,800
it needs to lift and push down uh there is a kind of connecting and sustaining a

204
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:38,160
kind of um um you know placing yourself on the slide and then sliding down

205
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:45,400
placing yourself um in the waves and being carried by the wave of uh kind of

206
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:52,640
entering into and then abiding there so there is a kind of very gentle and if

207
00:35:52,640 --> 00:36:01,160
there's any thinking involved um it's the thought of stay here go here be

208
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:07,680
here some people think that it's a very there's a this uh these two qualities uh

209
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,880
speak vara are a little bit more thoughtful

210
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:19,119
with thoughts that are a little bit more evaluating it's more like oh yeah here

211
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:26,000
this this is where to be ah this is good this feels nice it's kind of like we're

212
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,520
we're really getting close and into this experience of samadei and kind of

213
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:37,680
becoming without trying to attain anything get anything just a very gentle

214
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:44,079
kind of being present feeling it one analogy is like putting a taking a cloth

215
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:49,119
to polish a brass bowl a bronze bowl and

216
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:55,599
um and and then touching it and then uh gently kind

217
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:03,599
of rubbing it the ancient analogy would is that of a bee that um is kind of just

218
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:09,359
it's a comes to the edge of a flower and then walks around the top of the flower

219
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:14,960
looking for the nectar kind of getting to know it or just flying around it um

220
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:23,760
so connecting or being and circling around stay here enter and abide

221
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:33,680
and in particular what uh supports this is uh is the joy the the thrill the the

222
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:40,640
goodness the pleasure of the the pleasantness something that we enjoy

223
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:46,640
about the meditation itself and sometimes this initial Janna that

224
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:53,599
enjoyment the joy the the enjoyment the pleasure um it's kind of dynamic

225
00:37:53,599 --> 00:38:00,720
It's it feels a little bit like the flame that is uh completely still but still there's a kind of you know that

226
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:06,680
inside the flame there's this wonderful movement that of um of the heat of

227
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:16,480
the and um and so there is this kind of of feeling of um of um

228
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,520
uh this uh applied and sustaining it's a

229
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:28,960
little bit like uh blowing on the flames sometimes um like a like a bellow or

230
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:34,079
you're blowing and and it flames gets stronger um then you stop blowing and it

231
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:40,400
gets quieter there's a kind of dynamic relationship between now staying there

232
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:46,400
with the experience staying with the pleasure and the pleasure kind of gets a

233
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:52,760
little bit stronger or fuller because we feel it we sense it we make room for

234
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:57,920
it and then as that happens um what's uh

235
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:03,359
very useful to do and maybe even important to do is to let that pleasure

236
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:10,480
let the joy to spread through your body some people in these janna uh are little

237
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:16,000
are tight or a little bit concentrating too hard there's a kind of narrowness of

238
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,599
focus kind of one pointedness of focus that the mind has gotten tight and uh

239
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:26,800
maybe even the the the eyes have gotten tight a little bit uh something's often

240
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:32,480
kind of contracted and then the the ability for the body to be unified and

241
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:38,400
whole and things flowing through it gets limited and it can feel like some of

242
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:44,800
this dynamism of the the good energy um is blocked then gets stuck someplace and

243
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:50,800
some people it's in the forehead there can be kind of a tightness and tingling

244
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:57,680
that's quite strong sometimes it's in the spine sometimes times it's other places and

245
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:05,119
the idea is to keep softening keep letting it spread just

246
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:10,320
gently don't make it it this is not shouldn't be a project um like so don't

247
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:17,040
don't be looking to do anything or make anything happen but there's a way there's a art to just kind of being with

248
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:25,680
it um entering and abiding connecting and sustaining and and this abiding this

249
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:31,880
resting is what spreads spreading it out spreading it

250
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:38,240
out it's um kind of maybe like um uh you

251
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:46,160
are blowing on a flame the flame gets larger and you feel the warmth spread further out into your body and that

252
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:55,839
warmth that spreads because it's get it's warm not because you're making it spread um and um so it's a it's a

253
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:03,359
wonderful world it's maybe a little bit unimaginable for people who don't get close into this state that um this is

254
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:09,359
what's going on but it feels really right it feel you can feel and as we

255
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:14,640
enter into this first Janna that the alternative of going coming coming out

256
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:21,760
of it and getting uh back involved with the usual preoccupations with the usual

257
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:29,680
uh kind of hindrances of the mind desire and aversion doubts anxieties that um is

258
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:35,680
uh that's not as as uh doesn't feel as healthy or as good or as satisfying or

259
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:42,599
as meaningful as really being here fully like now we've entered our life in a

260
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:48,880
complete there's a sense of vi vitality or aliveness or goodness or you know

261
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:56,440
this is satisfying so um

262
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:04,079
so we can't wish ourselves into this exactly we can't force ourselves into it

263
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:12,240
and um and but uh if we sit with sincerity then from time to time this is

264
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:18,800
what we begin dropping into and um and so the instructions here are not meant

265
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:24,400
that now you're able to actually do this but It may be hopefully you give you a

266
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:30,400
feeling for it a sense of it so that you it's kind of a little bit uh a sense of

267
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:36,960
showing you the landmarks of what's up ahead and and then if you come to that

268
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:44,720
place you see the landmark say oh now I know where I am this is a good thing and it may be easier to be here and there's

269
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:51,920
not a few people who drop into the first Janna and they get so excited they pop out they come out they say well this is

270
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:59,400
really great so um so stay

271
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:08,640
calm enter and abide in the deep calm and peace of uh of being immersed in

272
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:15,160
this here and now practice so thank you very much and

273
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:21,520
um we'll continue talking a little bit more about the first Janna for the rest of this

274
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,720
week thank you
