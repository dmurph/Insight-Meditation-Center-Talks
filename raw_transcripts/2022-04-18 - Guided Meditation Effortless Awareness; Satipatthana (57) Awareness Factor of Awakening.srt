1
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,599
so good morning everyone and

2
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:19,680
um so i'm here in the fog

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,359
at spirit rock spirit rock meditation center in northern california

4
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:32,240
i'm teaching a retreat currently and and uh

5
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,399
this is uh i'm sitting outdoors just outdoors outdoors from the little

6
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,600
room where i'm i'm sleeping uh living well during the retreat and uh

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:51,280
behind me it wasn't as foggy when i first set up here the morning fog is coming in

8
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,280
it is um you see behind you the rolling foothills of marin county

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:04,158
and maybe in the course of the 45 minutes maybe the the fog will clear and maybe you'll get

10
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,240
to see the the the hills occasionally there'll be turkeys walking

11
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,240
by

12
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:23,119
so so happy to be here happy to be with you

13
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:29,280
and this week we are doing um the getting to the end of this satipatana

14
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,400
sutta and we're doing the what's called the seven factors of awakening and i'll say more about them

15
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,640
later but if you can think of them as the culmination of

16
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,840
the of this uh close to the culmination

17
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:54,720
of this long practice of satipatana meaning practicing for a long time not just

18
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,159
sitting down and being introduced to mindfulness and expecting that the seven factors of awakening will

19
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:07,280
arise but that these arise through

20
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,360
practicing and developing and settling in and so for this meditation

21
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:20,239
uh imagine that um all the best moments of these

22
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:26,959
weeks that we've been doing sattvatana if you've been following along all the best moments of your meditation

23
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:34,239
are bundled together and you feel a tremendous trust

24
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:40,560
in the practice in your ability to practice and um and that you're settling down

25
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:47,599
here not so much to practice mindfulness

26
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,720
as to allow for mindfulness to allow for

27
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,040
a kind of natural awareness to appear to float up

28
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,480
to arise and your job is mostly to get out of the way if you let go of thoughts and

29
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:10,159
distractions it's mostly in order to allow

30
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:18,800
for the kind of love the form of awareness which is always here

31
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:25,120
and and then to be aware of to recognize what the mind is aware of in those

32
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,599
circumstances so some of this can still be directed towards the breathing

33
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:37,360
but the but the breathing now is uh not something that we're working

34
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,040
or that we're intentionally focusing on

35
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,319
but it's more that we're opening to it to allow the naturalness

36
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,360
of the sensations of breathing to enter into awareness or to say it differently

37
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,720
we're noticing what sensations of anything what experiences of anything

38
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,560
including breathing arise effortlessly in the mind

39
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,680
in relationship to the breathing it's kind of like the door

40
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,200
doors of awareness are open to the experience of breathing and

41
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:21,040
rather than bearing down is what noticing what is effortlessly arising

42
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:28,240
in relationship to breathing into awareness so to

43
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:38,240
take a meditation posture and to

44
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,600
settle down by now first taking a few

45
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,360
long slow deep breaths

46
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,960
some breaths that as you breathe in

47
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:02,479
you're gathering together all the momentum or the associations best associations of

48
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:10,560
sitting down to meditate and then as you exhale

49
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,160
you're letting go into

50
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:25,639
the practice that arises from your body you're letting go into

51
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,960
the natural capacity we have to be aware that does not require

52
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,360
intention it requires allowing it

53
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,840
noticing that you are aware

54
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:12,639
then letting your breathing return to normal and we'll begin with a little exercise

55
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:18,880
here and that is

56
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,840
of all the present moment experiences that are occurring

57
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,600
what arises obviously easily effortlessly

58
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,720
into awareness for you

59
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:44,720
what arises maybe it's not even planned maybe you can't even expect it that an

60
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:53,360
itch or an ache or a pressure particular thought or feeling

61
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:05,280
and before there's any reaction on your part to it notice the effortless way in which it

62
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,440
arises in awareness just there

63
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,160
and if you notice any holding and tension in your body

64
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:55,520
rather than relaxing see what happens if you just effortlessly are aware of it meaning

65
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:02,400
you're not trying to do anything or fix anything or make anything happen

66
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:09,759
and maybe you're not even holding your attention on the tent on the tension

67
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,919
but you recognize it's there when it arises effortlessly

68
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,160
and your awareness little bit maybe floats

69
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,319
between different experiences

70
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,560
man

71
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,080
and then not so much as you're directing your attention to the breathing

72
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,519
as you are opening the door or the window

73
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,720
and then you become aware breathing comes into awareness

74
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,000
and becoming aware of what is obvious about breathing

75
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:56,640
or and what comes effortlessly what parts of breathing the experience

76
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,920
come effortlessly to awareness

77
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:12,480
and if your mind floats between different things the sounds of the birds my voice

78
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,880
anything else that's happening in the present just allow yourself to know that

79
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,320
now the mind is aware of that

80
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:05,200
you might be confused by these instructions and if you are

81
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:12,720
then no simply no confusion allow that to be there effortlessly

82
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,839
in awareness

83
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,279
so

84
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:21,009
when the mind becomes aware of anything [Music]

85
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,279
maybe there's a little movement of relaxing you can do

86
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,560
relaxing trying

87
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:39,920
letting go of the mindfulness which is a trying or work

88
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,360
in favor of just keeping the doors of awareness open

89
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:53,720
to receiving the experiences that float through

90
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,600
so

91
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,839
so

92
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,639
so

93
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,399
if you're able to be aware of what arises effortlessly

94
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,880
sometimes it's the more pronounced strongest

95
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,320
experiences of the moment and sometimes it's the more subtle ones

96
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:31,920
or the quieter ones sometimes the louder experiences recede

97
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,519
to the background and the quieter ones are what come

98
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:44,000
sometimes the other way not having any choice not choosing what

99
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:51,199
to be aware of so much is noticing

100
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:58,079
that quality of the mind that aspect of attention

101
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,279
that seems to operate effortlessly

102
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,360
the quality of awareness

103
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,880
that you could not turn off

104
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,480
if you stayed relaxed and present for the

105
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,399
present moment you couldn't you could can't not be

106
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,399
aware

107
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,640
so

108
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,600
so

109
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,160
so

110
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,559
so

111
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
so

112
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:52,320
if you're trying to do anything trying effortfully

113
00:22:53,520 --> 00:23:00,640
see what happens if you let go of the trying and just let awareness mindfulness

114
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:07,600
know what is obvious rather than trying to overcome a

115
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:13,120
distracted mind relax

116
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,158
and simply know

117
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:27,320
simply let there be in awareness the fact that you know the mind is thinking

118
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:53,440
keep returning to being aware of

119
00:23:53,440 --> 00:24:00,919
how awareness how knowing can operate effortlessly

120
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:15,320
by noticing the new things that come into awareness unplanned

121
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,520
for a moment they're there they arise

122
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:30,320
before you try to do anything with it try to be mindful

123
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,679
there's a simple knowing simple awareness

124
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,480
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

125
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:33,200
is there anything about being aware that you can recognize that you

126
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,120
recognize is peaceful

127
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:45,120
that you recognize is

128
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:55,520
safe for something you appreciate

129
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,400
maybe even joyful

130
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:23,600
and then think of the people in your life or the animals in your life or

131
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,880
the world around you

132
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:37,039
and perhaps you can wish for them to have some of the same peace

133
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:42,640
some of the same well-being or

134
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,640
appreciation

135
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,600
and perhaps with your simple awareness

136
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:02,960
taking in and being aware of others you can wish them well

137
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,760
you can wish that your ability to be attentive

138
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,639
can be a support for them

139
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:23,360
may it be through this practice that we do

140
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:30,880
that we're able to bring greater safety and peace happiness

141
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:37,600
and freedom to this world may all beings

142
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,640
be happy may all beings

143
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:48,000
be safe may all beings

144
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:56,120
be peaceful may all beings be free

145
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,640
so i didn't bring a bell with me here outside so um

146
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:12,799
maybe with this saying thank you for being part of this we end this sitting

147
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:16,039
thank you

148
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,600
uh

149
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:20,399
i saw a comment about the volume being low i just increased the volume uh

150
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:27,480
output for the mic on this computer i wonder if that made a difference

151
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,919
okay so

152
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:59,519
so good morning everyone and so this is the beginning of the week on

153
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:06,960
the second to last exercise in the buddha's discourse on the establi uh on

154
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,799
establishing awareness and um

155
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:18,880
it is the seven factors of awakening and there's nothing in this uh exercise

156
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,679
that talks about

157
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,159
making these factors arise it's more recognizing they're there

158
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:35,279
and then maintaining them so the seven are

159
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:40,640
mindfulness usually the second one is called the investigation and tomorrow we'll talk

160
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:47,039
about it some so mindfulness investigation

161
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:52,559
effort joy tranquility

162
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:58,320
concentration and equanimity and these are considered to be

163
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:04,480
the crown jewel of buddhist practice sometimes because they come

164
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:12,320
when practice begins to mature and develop when there starts to become kind of an inner momentum or naturalness of the

165
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:17,840
qualities of the practice living in us and coming forth and

166
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:23,600
and flowing through us in a certain way this is not an easy thing to experience

167
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:29,200
for beginners it's not so easy sometimes it takes a long time of practice

168
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,799
begin to these things get awakened and as they become awake they're present

169
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:41,519
and they support us the um but when they so this remember this is the

170
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:47,200
second to last exercise of that it's a 12th exercise of 13 exercises in the

171
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:53,039
this discourse we have and i'd like to understand that the others provide the foundation we're kind

172
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:58,960
of building momentum developing learning how to be mindful in the body and feelings in the mind

173
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:05,840
and as that learning happens and as the muscle of attention becomes stronger

174
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,880
much muscle of being in the present moment become stronger

175
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:17,039
then we find ourselves that these things begin to arise

176
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:25,840
and the first one that arises or the first one is talked about is sati or mindfulness itself

177
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:31,120
and as i said the text doesn't say you know now practice mindfulness now

178
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:37,279
apply yourself more to being mindful but it says basically it says notice that there is

179
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:45,120
mindfulness there and so the question is what is mindfulness here

180
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:50,960
and i prefer to translate the word sati as awareness

181
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:58,159
and what we're doing is we're establishing awareness uh we're abiding in it we're dwelling in

182
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:04,000
it we are not doing awareness nowhere in the buddha's teachings does

183
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,520
the buddha say do awareness awareness itself is not a verb of

184
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:19,520
something that we actively do but something that we establish or allow for we abide in

185
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:25,919
and um so the um and that's kind of in the very beginning of the text if you remember along this

186
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:32,839
at the start it talks about um abiding observing

187
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:38,480
uh the four foundations it's the city of abiding in something

188
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:46,000
um knowing it's there in this very simple way so to um

189
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:53,118
um uh so so in that nas meditation i talked

190
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:58,800
about the effortless quality of attention there's certainly attention that can

191
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:04,800
take effort and sometimes that's useful to apply and and there's but sometimes there's a

192
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,000
kind of effort that is effortless if you are just kind of minding your own

193
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,359
business and suddenly a loud bird nearby uh whistles

194
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:23,040
uh the first hearing of that bird just appears without any effort on your part

195
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:29,280
if um i'm sitting outside and just as i was saying this i felt cold going through my

196
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:35,359
thighs and that cold was effortless that it appeared that knowing of it it just

197
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:42,000
there it called attention to itself and my mind knew it and and um pretty equanimous and content to

198
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,400
be here and it was not a problem to just know it and um

199
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:56,240
and so then um and so what would uh so begin appreciating as practice deepens as

200
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:01,440
certain moments of practice of meditation practice or other times

201
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,560
as it continues and matures there'll be times when

202
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:13,520
we can tune into this effortless quality of attention and it might take some little gentle

203
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:18,720
effort to let go enough to allow that to be there but

204
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,839
with time it becomes kind of maybe the backdrop or it becomes a foundation it

205
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:29,920
becomes the support for how we go through our lives because there's a kind of a constant

206
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:36,160
awareness of present moment experience as we live it we don't get lost in our thoughts we

207
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:42,880
don't get lost in conversations we don't get lost in the work we're doing we can do it wholeheartedly but there's

208
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,800
a sense of feeling a knowing that seems almost like effortless that

209
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:54,480
oh i'm here this is where i'm present for it's almost like being present for or the

210
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:01,040
feeling of presence some people might say ever-present presence

211
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:07,280
ever-present kind of awareness attention and

212
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:13,599
and why this is uh useful as we develop awareness is that

213
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:18,720
it's an awareness that doesn't um automatically

214
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:24,560
come with attachment with greed or clinging with ill will with diversion with

215
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:32,640
pushing things away things are just allowed to be there um without us being for or against them

216
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:38,000
we don't have to accept them and we don't have to condone them we don't have to

217
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,880
um criticize them the awareness is not awareness in in and

218
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:51,119
of itself is not involved in being for or against is not involved with needing to accept

219
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:56,720
it or needing to reject it it's just there with the experience

220
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:02,640
to practice acceptance is an extra step

221
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:09,200
this allowing things to appear in the in the mind effortlessly might might be evaluated thought as a kind of

222
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:14,240
acceptance practice but there's no acceptance being done

223
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:19,440
it's just things arise in awareness and here we are

224
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,480
to do that with the breathing um at the same time

225
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,839
is part of the art of this that's possible to do and i'd like to give you if i can on on

226
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:36,240
this format of the video here i'd like to try to show you something

227
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:42,000
um if um if this finger of mine

228
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,280
is my breathing breathing in and breathing out and

229
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:54,320
and then one way of being aware of it if my other hand is my mind and so the idea of focusing on the

230
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:59,440
breathing really being there with it and the mind comes and is really

231
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:05,839
close down focuses and it gets kind of tight and it bears down it focuses on it all

232
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:12,240
together this way now that's fine it can be done and it's possible to get very focused and concentrated this way

233
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:18,560
that is very kind of nice another way is not to make any effort in the mind like that

234
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:24,640
keep the mind relaxed and open soft and and just kind of available

235
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:29,920
and now i'm sitting outside so i feel when i do that i start feeling the wind and the palm of my hand the back of my

236
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:35,760
hand the cold in different places it's kind of nice and

237
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:41,119
then gently i bring these two together this is the breathing

238
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:46,960
and this is the um you know this is this the hand open hand

239
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:52,000
is the awareness and i bring the them together so that the breathing and

240
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,400
the softest part of the hand most sensitive part of the hand are in touch with each other and now i'm really

241
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:05,599
feeling intimately the breathing and the world around me begins to fall away disappear recede

242
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:12,800
because the the breathing becomes the only thing i'm aware of but the breathing is known effortlessly

243
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:18,160
the coming and going the rhythm the different sensations are known effortlessly

244
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:24,000
there might be a tendency to want to do something again to stay there to stay not not lose it

245
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,480
and the mind begins to tighten up again and hold on but the idea here in the when you come

246
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,680
to this part of the seventh seven factors of awakening is to

247
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:41,280
for sati to be awareness to be less and less work

248
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,319
and more and more arresting and abiding in awareness

249
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:53,000
and then in that abiding letting things be known effortlessly

250
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,960
and um and then and the uh if there is any work at this

251
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,560
stage of practice it's to um remember to do this

252
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:10,319
remember to do this because it's not easy to be this way there has to be some momentum in the

253
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:15,520
mind um don't try to do it if it's not easy

254
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:20,720
rather be very content even to go back to the very beginning of satiptana

255
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:28,319
go back just the simplicity of practicing breath meditation and the first four steps of this whole

256
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:34,160
enterprise of sati patana is to really know experience no know

257
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:40,800
your breathing you recognize the experiences of breathing and that takes a little bit more effort

258
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,079
then as you know it know and recognize your whole body

259
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:52,240
and then relax your body and that's how it begins so you always go back to do that that's a fantastic

260
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:58,880
practice in his own right and it leads to where we're going here with the seven factors of awakening so if you're not

261
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:05,520
there yet in the seven factors don't worry about it it's um it's not important for you then

262
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:11,520
but as the momentum builds then you'll see that you can

263
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:17,280
that there'll be a kind of an effortless awareness that arises that can hold things peacefully

264
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,400
hold things openly and clearly

265
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:28,640
and this is a gift this is one of the great gifts of practice and it sets the stage for the other

266
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:34,880
seven factors of awakening and tomorrow i'll talk about

267
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:40,319
investigation and which sounds like a lot of work but

268
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:47,440
is also meant to have an effortless quality to it and how does that work is what i'll talk about

269
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:54,079
so thank you and i delight in being here outdoors and at spirit rock doing this
