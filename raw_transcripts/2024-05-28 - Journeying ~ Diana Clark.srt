1
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:09,880
welcome welcome good evening hello and happy Memorial Day here we are

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,080
on a holiday

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,400
wishing I for all those families who have lost loved ones

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,760
and in Wars wishing the best for

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,480
them and honoring those people have died

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,320
in so many different

7
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:45,440
ways sometimes for a memorial day we didn't do it this year but in years past

8
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,640
my mom and I we would get some um this like some plastic flowers and we would

9
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,879
bring them to Graves of you know of our family people have died and then I just

10
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:03,719
love to bring tons and just put them on other people's Gra you know I don't know who these people are but uh just this

11
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:10,200
idea of honoring other people and Imagining the Delight of a

12
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:18,680
family member were to come and like oh look somebody uh left some flowers for this our family member

13
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:26,400
here so just holding in our hearts those families and who have lost

14
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:33,920
loved ones and so today I'd like to talk about um

15
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:41,520
something um maybe I'll like weave together a tapestry in some kind of

16
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:49,719
way but using a different elements different um I use this word elements to point

17
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:57,920
towards something and this whole idea of journeying or this idea of being on a

18
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:04,680
path maybe a road trip in some kind of

19
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:12,280
way and I'm going to start with the passage that's um from the majam

20
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,480
Manaya and uh this is ganaka molana who was talking to the

21
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:26,040
Buddha and um and he had asked the uh Buddha like is do you have like a

22
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:32,599
training program like all the other per professionals have training programs the

23
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:38,440
accountants he's an accountant guka means accountant so he's mulana the

24
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,519
accountant uh that people who do archery have training programs there people who

25
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:50,239
uh work with elephants have training programs in ganaka mulana asks the Buddha do you guys have a training

26
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:56,319
program also and the Buddha says yes and he describes this training program which

27
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:02,800
is the gradual training I'm not going to go into the details of that right now but then after

28
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:12,640
the Buddha gives that a long explanation uh to galana k m Kaka molana asks so when your

29
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:21,080
followers are instructed and in and advised by you do all of them achieve

30
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:27,640
the goal this is a legitimate question you have a training program but does it

31
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:34,080
work does anybody become awaken do they reach nabana I appreciate that kind of you

32
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:40,560
know he's G molana is just asking them do all of them achieve it or do some of

33
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:48,599
them fail and the Buddha response some succeed While others

34
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:53,720
fail and then the natural next question is

35
00:03:53,720 --> 00:04:02,159
why why do some of them fail why though nibana exists the path leading to nibana

36
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:08,239
exists and you are present to encourage those who wish to find nibana why do

37
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:14,519
some succeed and others fail this is a good

38
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:20,880
question and then the Buddha he answers this question by asking a question

39
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,800
back well I'll ask you about this in in

40
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,680
return and you can answer as you like do you know how to get to rajagaha the

41
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,720
Buddha asks gak molana do you know how to get to this other city that's a far

42
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,759
away yes I do so what do you think suppose a person

43
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:54,000
were to come along who wanted to go to rajagaha this person would approach you and say I wish to go to rajagaha and

44
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,720
please point the way and then you would say to this person this wrote goes to rajagaha go

45
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:07,680
along it for a while and then you'll see a certain Village then continue and Go a

46
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,680
little bit further and then you'll see a certain Town continue and go a little further and there you'll see Raja

47
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:21,120
gaha in my mind this maybe goes like go to this Village and then hang a left or

48
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,360
something like this and then go to a town and hang a right or you know something like this but it's just like

49
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,440
you know here's some different uh landmarks that you'll see and here's how

50
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:38,000
you get to rajagaha and then the Buddha asks him

51
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,520
um or says to him to the ghak mulana so

52
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,560
instructed like this by you they might still take the wrong

53
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:58,479
road but a second person might come along and ask you how to get to rajagaha and they may make it there to rajagaha

54
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:05,000
and then the Buddha asks him why is that why even though you gave them clear instructions on how to get there some of

55
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,520
them make it and some of it don't and guka molana says I don't know

56
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:17,560
I gave them instructions it's up to them to follow the instructions and the Buddha says well

57
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:23,599
it's the same for me too the Buddha shows the way but all of

58
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:31,120
us have to walk it ourselves can't do it for us of course not

59
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:39,120
so then I'd like to share this other little uh excerpt where the budha gives a little bit more details about this uh

60
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,680
path this road to nibana and this time he's talking to

61
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:51,599
somebody named Tisa and he says to

62
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:58,280
Tissa Suppose there were two people one who did not know the path and one who

63
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:03,960
did know the path I could say like knew the road KN knew the directions or who

64
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,319
didn't and the person who didn't know the path would ask the person who did

65
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:14,680
know the path about how about the path and then

66
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:20,120
the person who knew about the path would say come this is the path and would show

67
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,879
them then this would be the part of the description so go a little way and then

68
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:30,919
you'll see a fork in the road avoid the left hand branch and take

69
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:38,240
the right hand Branch then go a little bit further and you'll see a dense Thicket go a little bit further and

70
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,560
you'll see a vast marshy swamp and then go a little bit further

71
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:52,120
and then you'll see a steep precipice then go a little further and then you'll see a delightful expanse of

72
00:07:52,120 --> 00:08:00,840
Parkland so he's describing you know these like literal landmarks that you'll see this um Fork in the road and this

73
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:07,120
Thicket a swamp steep precipice and then you'll get at this park like and then

74
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:14,840
the Buddha says this is a simile and I've made up this simile to describe the path of practice and these things stand

75
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:21,280
for certain things these uh these what we what you would might find in

76
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:28,560
nature and he says and the person who doesn't know the path this is for a regular practitioner

77
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,360
a follower but someone who is not awakened but someone who does know the path is somebody who's

78
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:40,919
awakened and then the fork in the road is a designation for

79
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:46,160
doubt we can think about doubt is often how it gets described as a hindrance as

80
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,440
this hesitation this velation like should I go here should I do this should

81
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,000
I do loving kindness practice or should I do mindfulness practice should I do open awareness practice or mindfulness

82
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,560
of the breath or you know this kind of way in which we might not not it might not be clear on what practice we should

83
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:09,360
do that's a way some way that often a doubt shows up but often doubt shows up

84
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:16,480
too is like well I'm not sure about this whole mindfulness or Insight tradition

85
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,600
or maybe I'm not so sure about the teachers or maybe I'm not so sure about the Buddha or maybe I'm not even so sure

86
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:30,040
that I can do it maybe it's a fine path but it doesn't seem like it's the one for me so doubt can show up in all these

87
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:36,079
different ways and so I love that he's describing as the fork and the road because often what happens when we have

88
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:41,440
doubt we just get to this place and we stop and we're not sure like how to go

89
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,959
forward and we end up kind of like stuck there with this uh

90
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:55,120
doubt and then the budha goes on to explain and he says well the left hand path is the wrong Eightfold Path and the

91
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:01,040
right hand path is the right eight-fold path I think many of you have heard this

92
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,760
before that right we might translate this as wise or helpful I think may be

93
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:13,279
helpful so it's the unhelpful path and the helpful path I'm not going to go into details

94
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:18,560
about this but many of you are probably familiar with this wise view wise

95
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:25,640
intention wise speech wise action wise livelihood wise energy wise mindfulness

96
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:32,320
and wise concentration these are like eight different elements that really um

97
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:39,399
support our movement towards greater and greater freedom but there's a way in which we can have you know unwise action

98
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:47,639
and unwise livelihood and which were causing harm and that would be like you know going down the left

99
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:54,399
fork and then he uh talks about then you would go to this dense

100
00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:00,760
Thicket where you know it's you can't see your way through it's not clear how to go forward and when you're in the

101
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:07,920
midst of it you're just like uh kind uh stuck in it and the Buddha says this is a

102
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:15,279
metaphor for um ignorance like just not knowing that's often how it is like we

103
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:21,760
can't see like we don't know and there's a we have to use like a different

104
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,880
um different faculties to know how to go forward like we can't use the visual faculty in the way that we are

105
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:34,040
accustomed to so when we're in the middle of a Thicket maybe there's a way in which somebody

106
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:40,760
shows us the way or maybe we follow Intuition or maybe we follow just a

107
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:46,200
trial and error it's just not clear we don't we

108
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,600
just don't know the way forward and then after this dense

109
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,959
Thicket is this marshy swamp and the Buddha describes this

110
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:04,600
marshy swamp uh was getting stuck in sensual Pleasures there's a way we can do it's

111
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,920
like chasing one pleasure after the next after the next after the next you know

112
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:15,440
psychologists call this the hedonic treadmill right even though we might have one thing that's pleasurable well

113
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,920
okay then that starts we starts to get accustomed to that and then we want something even more and then we get

114
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:27,120
accustomed to that then we want even more and we can spend our whole life just chasing pleasures and I kind of

115
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:35,560
like how this is a swamp it can't feel like you kind of get quick sand like maybe sunk down in there and it's not

116
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:41,079
easy to get out especially because uh there's so much of our society that's

117
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:48,639
really promoting this sense of entertainment you know find something titillating even the news often is given

118
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:55,560
in a way just to you know poke you a little bit like oh I better pay attention you know it's given in a way

119
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:03,519
to you know entertain you in some way even though it's uncom able off in the news but it's also meant to grab your

120
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:12,279
attention and keep it in the way that entertainment does so then after this uh marshy swamp

121
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:17,480
is this deep precipice and again this is like all on

122
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:24,440
the path to nabana so I don't know I just love this he's not saying okay look it's neat and tidy just go here hang a

123
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:31,000
left and you'll be there it's like no there's these swamps and there's this dense Thicket like a forest and you're

124
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,160
upt to get lost in there and there's going to be this steep precipice which

125
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,720
he describes is anger and agitation and I kind of like this as

126
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:47,839
being a precipice because anger like can be helpful indicate to us like when

127
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:55,040
boundaries are being crossed or when things are inappropriate are being done but there's also a way in which anger

128
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:01,440
can tip us over into the off of a precipice and when it's uh mixed with

129
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,079
hostility when it's uh mixed with this maybe it's a subtle sense but of wanting

130
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:12,480
to cause harm in some kind of way and then agitation right we just

131
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:20,000
often don't have access to the best version of ourself when we're agitated so this deep precipice of you know

132
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:30,320
agitation maybe a having to watch each step and be careful on the way to Nana

133
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:36,000
so that's one of the ways that the Buddha describes this

134
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:41,759
path Guk molana described it as oh you see this Village you see this town and

135
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:47,360
you'll get there and the Buddha say well here's some specifics in a different sua he's saying here are some

136
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:54,120
specifics and then the Buddha uh ends this by saying you should be be happy

137
00:14:54,120 --> 00:15:00,399
Tisa for I am here to advise I'm here to support you and I here to instruct so

138
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,759
he's saying you know look there are these uh difficulties along the way but

139
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:13,720
I can help I appreciate that it's it's not it's uh you know saying it's not

140
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,759
pretending like everything's easy peasy or something like this because sometimes

141
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:26,880
it's not uncommon for people to feel like oh this is really hard or I'm getting lost or I'm confused and somehow

142
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:33,519
we feel like oh I don't understand it there's something wrong with me or something like that but

143
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:39,160
instead I mean here the Buddha he's just pointing out that's part of the path is this

144
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:45,480
way is that there will be confusion there will be uncertainty there will be

145
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:53,000
difficulties and just to make like to normalize that instead of this idea that we have to know everything and have to

146
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:02,199
should be comfortable all the time so then we might say well why are

147
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:09,199
some reasons why people don't go on this path the Buddha was saying some people

148
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:14,480
don't reach it and it might be that maybe they don't

149
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:22,319
really start maybe they they have a maybe an inkling that okay there is a different

150
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:29,160
direction that's possible but they don't really want to like they maybe like dip their toes toe

151
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:35,720
in which is okay that's certainly how I started and I think that's how a lot of people start with just maybe dipping a

152
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,959
toe in but also there can be this hesitation

153
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:48,680
to begin maybe it's doubt or maybe it's just a uncertainty or about what to do

154
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:56,120
or how to do it or maybe they realize oh this is going to be hard there's going to be swamps and

155
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:01,160
thickets and and and steep precipices

156
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:06,438
Cliffs and they feel like it's feels dangerous it feels

157
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:13,038
scary and it's not uncommon for people in their meditation practice when they reach like some different meditative

158
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:19,959
experiences that they haven't reached before some people are like oh cool check it out never experienced this

159
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:26,079
before and some people are like whoa what was that and it's okay whatever

160
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:31,679
experience we have is the one we have so there can also be some hesitation based

161
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:37,080
on you know just uh tasting something that's different and not quite sure what

162
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,799
it is and how to hold it or how to be with

163
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:47,360
it or maybe there's uh people don't kind like finish on this path or maybe they

164
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,760
just start a little bit because they get distracted and part of the reason why

165
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:57,840
they get distracted is because maybe their life is better they've started a meditation practice maybe they have a

166
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:04,640
little bit more ease in their life maybe they have a little bit more uh ease in their bodies a little bit more

167
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:11,120
relaxation and they feel like okay that's that's enough you know my life is

168
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:18,640
better than before but I'm don't really want to look in some of the corners of my

169
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,919
mind and the corners of my life I'm not I'm not quite ready to do that I might

170
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:30,840
have to make some difficult decisions if I do that I might have to do things radically different and

171
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:36,799
maybe they don't want to do that it's perfectly fine all of us get to choose our own way our

172
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:44,159
own pace our own path certainly there's no requirement to do

173
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:49,799
any of this it's kind of like an if then statement if you're interested in more

174
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:55,919
and more freedom and peace and well-being then here are some things to

175
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:01,200
do it's completely you know up to us of

176
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,960
course but now I'd like to point to uh rather than reaching back you know

177
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,280
thousands of years ago somebody who's talking about this path that goes to

178
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:19,960
Awakening and freedom to use a modern voice from a poem was published in the

179
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:27,039
early 1960s but I think it does a good job of describing part of what it might be like

180
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:34,440
to maybe endeavor on this path partly on the beginning of this

181
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:40,480
path the poet is Mary Oliver many of you have are familiar with this uh poet she

182
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,600
I think she won the Pitzer prize but I regret that I don't know which year she

183
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:53,120
did so she's a recognized poet and this uh the name of the poem is

184
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:59,480
called The Journey so again again that's a Mary

185
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:06,919
Oliver's poem The Journey one day you finally knew what

186
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:12,360
you had to do and began though the voices around you kept

187
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:20,559
shouting their bad advice though the whole house began to tremble and you felt the old tug at your

188
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:28,919
ankles Mend My Life each voice cried but you didn't stop

189
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:33,960
you knew what you had to do though the wind pried with its stiff fingers at the

190
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:39,799
very foundations though their Melancholy was

191
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:45,520
terrible it was already late enough and a wild night and the Road full of Fallen

192
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:52,080
branches and stones but little by little as you left

193
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:59,559
their voice behind the Stars began to burn through the sheets of clouds

194
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:05,159
and there was a new voice which you slowly recognized as your

195
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:10,360
own that kept you company as you stroe deeper and deeper into the

196
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:17,520
world determined to do the only thing you could do determined to save the only

197
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,960
life that you could

198
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:29,600
save and it ends there it's part of this poem that I just

199
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:35,360
love about this poem there's a lot of beautiful elements here but I love this

200
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,679
uh ending like determined to do the only thing you could do determined to save

201
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:47,200
the only life that you could save and then I think many of us in our

202
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:54,559
minds are going oh yeah save my life or save your life like we're completing the poem in some kind of

203
00:21:54,559 --> 00:22:00,960
way or as the you know the poet she's uh leaving it to us to kind like make that

204
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,559
next step she's leaving it blank I'll read this one more time and

205
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:16,480
then uh I'll point out a few things again this is Mary Oliver The

206
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:22,200
Journey one day you finally knew what you had to do and

207
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:27,279
began though the voices around you kept shouting their bad

208
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:33,159
advice though the whole house began to tremble and you felt the old tug at your

209
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:41,039
ankles Mend My Life each voice cried but you didn't

210
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:47,159
stop you knew what you had to do but the wind Pride with its stiff fingers at the

211
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:52,440
very foundations though their Melancholy was

212
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:58,520
terrible it was already late enough in a wild night and the Road full of Fallen

213
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:06,360
branches and stones but little by little as you left their voice

214
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:11,440
behind the Stars began to burn through the sheets of

215
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,080
clouds and there was a new voice which you slowly recognized as

216
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:23,120
your own that kept you company as you stroe deeper and deeper into the

217
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:29,640
world determined to do the only thing you could do determined to to save the

218
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,720
only life that you could

219
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:42,400
save so this poem begins with one day you finally knew what you had to

220
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,520
do in Buddhism they sometimes point to this as this feeling of urgency this

221
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:53,240
feeling like oh I this uh I need to find a way to Greater

222
00:23:53,240 --> 00:24:00,159
freedom and sometimes this arises because we have a lot of suffering or sometimes it AR is we you know receive a

223
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:06,039
terrible diagnosis or a loved one has a terrible diagnosis or maybe it's just an

224
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:13,120
intuitive hit I worked in Corporate America for

225
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:21,520
quite some time and I had this fantastic job I had a great job and I felt like I just don't quite

226
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:27,200
feel happy in the way that I expected to having this great job I got I have my

227
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:33,159
professional success that I wanted and like what am I going to do

228
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:39,360
now and at that time I worked for a company that yeah was it was a great job I'll just say

229
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:45,679
this and then um I was thinking like oh should I leave this job but it's not

230
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:52,360
going to get better anywhere else I'm not going to get find a better job I think and it took me quite some time

231
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:58,799
thinking that should I do this feeling like you know like no I can't oh yes I

232
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:05,039
should and then for some reason one morning I woke up and it was just so clear to

233
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:11,600
me I will always think that I should work more I should you know get higher

234
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,640
in the corporate letter earn more money you know all these things I will always

235
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:22,240
think that there's like that's not going to go away but somehow I don't know why

236
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:28,799
I can't explain I just had this intuitive hit I need to leave this job

237
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:33,919
and this story I told myself I'm just going to leave for one year and my life

238
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:41,159
situation allowed me to do that certainly that's not available for most people and then I'm going to come back I

239
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:47,000
just need one year to figure out what to do next I was working so hard I busy all the time but I couldn't figure out what

240
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,159
to do next I thought okay I just need a little space to figure out what to do

241
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:58,440
next I can't believe that was uh so many years ago now that what I

242
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:06,279
said I'd be gone for one year and I guess it's been 18 years now so didn't find my way back instead I

243
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:12,240
found the Dharma and this is where I've been ever since but it was just like I

244
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,399
just had some clarity this doesn't hit so often but sometimes it does where we

245
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:22,880
have the sense of like y this is going to be hard or it's not clear I can't figure it out but you know what I'm

246
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:29,320
going to do it anyway there's something inside of us I'm going to do it anyway

247
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:35,159
and the story that I told right my life situation allowed me to do that maybe making a radical change isn't available

248
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:41,640
to people because they have a responsibilities and other people that they care for but my point is that

249
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:49,679
sometimes there is a a god feeling that we have not always but sometimes there

250
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:55,679
is or maybe not it's not a gut in in gut

251
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:01,120
feeling or an Insight but maybe it's a just an

252
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,760
understanding sometimes with a meditation practice we start to see things differently we start to see

253
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:14,120
ourself differently we start to understand like oh I'm like

254
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:19,399
that because of these conditions it doesn't mean I'm a bad person it just

255
00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:25,279
means because I'm always hungry at 3:00 and that's why I'm yelling at the person that does something or other you know

256
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:31,679
I'm just making this up on the spot but when we start to realize oh yeah all these things are

257
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:38,080
connected and we as individuals are not like unique that we're not connected to

258
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:45,799
everything we are connected to our conditions everything around us of course we are so the things that we do

259
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:52,279
we sometimes like take credit for them but we also like blame ourselves for them and not

260
00:27:52,279 --> 00:28:00,120
recognizing oh yeah well the person that we were speaking to was uh

261
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:05,840
really angry because their partner didn't take out the garbage like they

262
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:12,919
said they were going to and uh they come into work and they're irritated because they had to take up the garbage or you

263
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:21,120
know whatever it is things that we have no idea about impact us and affects us so maybe

264
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,600
that's this type of understanding we start to see oh it's not that I'm always

265
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:33,320
this way it's that that there are conditions in my life which

266
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:40,720
uh creates the conditions for me to be that way support that way and there's something we can have a

267
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:47,880
little bit more sense of Freedom a sense of possibility oh yeah maybe if I spend

268
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:53,679
less time um watching things on social media

269
00:28:53,679 --> 00:29:00,240
that is mean and hurtful and demeaning and disrespectful to other people you

270
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:06,159
know of course it impacts us whether it's uh geared towards us or not just to

271
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:12,919
know that humans can do this and to know that that kind of Venom is exists there in the

272
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:21,120
world so maybe there's a way in which you can listen to sometimes these quiet

273
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:27,760
voices that are saying yeah something else is possible and maybe we don't even know

274
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:33,120
what that something else is and maybe the change that we make is

275
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:39,919
something small very small it doesn't have to be some radical thing about going down a whole different

276
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:45,559
path it's like well maybe I'll meditate

277
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:52,720
more maybe I'll spend time in nature more maybe I'll do something creative

278
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:58,080
more you just allow something for our hearts and Minds to Blossom and have

279
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:04,200
have some Breathing Room often our lives are kind like feeling cramped and and

280
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:10,519
we're feeling like we're pushed around so there's so many ways that this

281
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:17,320
one day you finally knew what you had to do well maybe we can interpret it as the

282
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:22,640
poet here saying you knew what you had to do and maybe all you know is that you have to do something

283
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:31,278
different and maybe it's not even clear what it is just this feeling like oh yeah maybe even something different is

284
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:40,000
possible and then just this willingness to be curious about well what what would be different what would be helpful for

285
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,919
my life because the next line in this poem says though the voices around you kept

286
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:55,440
shouting their bad advice the people that are uh in our

287
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,919
orbit so to speak you you know often especially if we've um had relationships

288
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:06,919
with them for a long time there's a way in which we kind of set up this dance like okay you do this and then I do that

289
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:13,000
in response and then I do this and then you do that in response you know I'm looking at the really really big picture

290
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,200
I get angry and then uh you get quiet and then I'm mad that you're quiet so

291
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:25,399
then I go call my friend you know or whatever it is you know these uh dynamics that uh get developed in all

292
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:31,279
relationships and sometimes this shouting their bad

293
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:38,360
advice is like no don't change even though you can see that it would be helpful for you to maybe let go of some

294
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:45,440
patterns of behavior letting go of staying up late and not getting enough sleep because

295
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:51,200
you're on social media I don't want to beat up on social media but there is a

296
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:57,399
lot of bad things on there right we all know this right there's some helpful things there too but there's a lot of

297
00:31:57,399 --> 00:32:02,960
very helpful things so there might be a way in which

298
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:09,559
they uh want us to stay the same in some kind of way or maybe these voices that

299
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:16,360
keep shouting their bad advice maybe it's part of the inner critic that's you know these are voices inside of

300
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:22,600
us and so this uh poem is pointing to like knowing that there's something to

301
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:29,360
do even though there is pressure to not do things differently

302
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:35,480
but instead to go on this journey and then the next line is though

303
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:41,919
the whole house began to tremble like things start excuse me

304
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:47,559
start to feel a little bit more shaky right when we decide okay I'm going to do things a little bit

305
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:52,919
differently doesn't feel as solid doesn't feel as

306
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,919
steady but that's what it feels like to grow that's what it feels like to to

307
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:06,720
stretch our capacities that's what it feels like to touch something new experience

308
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:14,519
something new Go a different direction a little bit like the house began to tremble it's not the same and

309
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:20,399
also maybe if we start taking a few steps on the this

310
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:25,559
journey maybe we look back at the house and we see oh maybe it was trembling all

311
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:31,840
along and we just didn't notice it cuz we were in it and we were shaking along with it maybe we take a few steps and

312
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,919
notice like oh yeah it's a little

313
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:46,440
shaky and then I'll skip forward to this uh other line in the poem it says it was

314
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:54,080
already late enough and a wild night and the Road full of Fallen branches and

315
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:59,120
Stones so this is describing when they're like going out onto this journey

316
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:05,600
I love this it was already late enough we could

317
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:11,320
interpret that a number of different ways it was nighttime maybe but late

318
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:17,358
enough this could be like later in our life it's maybe often when we are

319
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:22,919
younger that we make these decisions and then it's not until later in real life

320
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:29,398
you know this is not uncommon for people to feel like hm I think I want to make some changes and go a different

321
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:35,158
direction so she's uh the poet is pointing to maybe the late in life too

322
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:41,040
we don't this isn't just something that uh young people do as they go off to start their

323
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:48,158
lives and then it was a wild night with the Road full of Fallen branches and

324
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:54,440
Stones it wasn't perfect setting it wasn't neat and tidy and clear and

325
00:34:54,440 --> 00:35:01,119
pretty but there was going to be these obstacles on the way here they're getting described as uh

326
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:07,320
Fallen branches and Stones the Buddha he was describing it

327
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:15,599
as uh swamps and thickets and cliffs this a recognition that uh

328
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:21,000
journeying going to or Awakening going towards greater Freedom going towards

329
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,040
greater peace and ease in our lives going towards the best version of

330
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:34,440
ourselves is going to encounter some difficulties that's part of the path it

331
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:40,720
doesn't mean you're doing it wrong and there's others that can

332
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:46,960
help there's teachings that can help there's friends that can help there are teachers that can

333
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:52,800
help this is some place maybe where social media can help too there are communities

334
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,839
online that can be a support as for this uh Journey

335
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:07,319
and then lastly I'll end with this uh line from the poem that says there was a

336
00:36:07,319 --> 00:36:12,640
new voice which you slowly recognized as your

337
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:20,119
own so pointing to transformation pointing to like this new voice this new way of seeing things the

338
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:28,119
new way of thinking about things or speaking about things any

339
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:34,240
realized oh yeah this is some of my wisdom that I've earned on this journey

340
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,680
of life that's uh supporting

341
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:45,920
me so the path of practice of going towards greater

342
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:51,280
freedom and the Buddha talked about it and described it

343
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,440
as you know having difficulties not necessarily being neat

344
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:02,040
and tidy sometimes when we hear like the eight-fold path it's just you know here's these eight things and do them

345
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:08,640
and you'll be fine it would be great if it were that easy and

346
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:17,119
straightforward but it's not always easy and straightforward and I kind of I want to normalize that that this path is has

347
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:24,560
beautiful parts and it has difficult Parts because that's what it means when we like transformation of course isn't

348
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,599
going to be completely um simple and straightforward and

349
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:35,599
painless it's uh there's going to be some stretching and growing and we're going to realize oh yeah this cloak that

350
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:42,560
I used to wear doesn't really fit anymore but it's my favorite one and I really like it something like

351
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:48,119
this to this idea of the journey the

352
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:53,200
journey and I'll end there and open it up to see if anybody has any questions

353
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,800
or comments

354
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:10,680
just talking to it okay yeah well is a simple straightforward I get these little messages and I ignore

355
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:16,240
them it's terrible that you said something about little messages earlier and it's exactly

356
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:22,119
that perfect I hear them I mean I I don't really hear them but they come to

357
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:28,040
me and I it's like I say oh no that's not for me that's not me it's ter you

358
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:35,280
have to listen to those little messages well that's why take on it but yeah and part of this skill is is

359
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:41,160
learning like well which ones do we listen to all of them do we listen to some of them and how do we know which

360
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:47,640
ones right that's part of the I think part of uh maybe maturing in this path

361
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:56,400
but uh uh here's here's a Something That I Used To Guide Me On whether to listen to these messages or not is that and

362
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:02,520
often this is very subtle so I has to be uh I have to pay attention If the

363
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:11,480
message says do this and then very quietly it says in order to get this

364
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:18,079
whatever this is usually those are the ones that aren't so helpful if the one that says

365
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:24,119
do this because it's the right thing to do those are the ones that tend to be

366
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:30,680
more helpful but the ones that are are trying to like to are means so that you can get something I mean maybe it helps

367
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:36,280
you get that thing but uh I'm just this is what I'm using for myself as a guideline of which one of those little

368
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:42,000
voices to pay attention to when it says that well because it's the right thing to do and then how do

369
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:49,040
you know what right thing to do is maybe I'll say something because there's a certain sense of ease or spaciousness in

370
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:54,520
the body like yeah okay that's the right thing to

371
00:39:54,520 --> 00:40:00,839
do you're not in your heads you recognize this even though it might feel difficult or

372
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:06,359
not what you want to do or something like that yeah thank you does anybody

373
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:11,280
else have a comment or a question or something they'd like to

374
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:26,440
share it would have be nice if all those obstacles were visuals that as you described yeah that's true that's a very

375
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:33,880
good but uh unfortunately uh I see it as more kind of a mindfield where you're kind of walking

376
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:41,280
along things are going well and then boom something just comes out of

377
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:48,359
nowhere and uh that could be challenging yeah yeah do you have the

378
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:56,800
feeling that they come out of nowhere I'm just asking maybe some um sometimes yeah yeah um just a interpersonal um uh

379
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:02,560
relationship ship or a um well for me re recently it was uh I

380
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:08,839
came home and my roommates like um I'm not redoing my lease and um you know

381
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:16,440
this is your 30-day notice you know and I'm like oh darn you know yeah uh things

382
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:22,520
like that yeah yeah or I'm a teacher so in schools too it's you never know

383
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:29,240
what's going to what you might step on you know yeah so that

384
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:36,280
kind of the way I look at it great thank you this idea of mindfields that just sounds brutal or

385
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:41,359
gory know you know there goes you a limb

386
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:46,359
or something great thank

387
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:52,680
you does anybody else have a comment or something they'd like to

388
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:01,200
say I should have voices instead of what I said I think you said Little Voices

389
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:06,400
