1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,679
so good morning everyone

2
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:18,560
and perhaps i hear that getting ready for meditation

3
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,599
i'm already becoming quiet

4
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,399
maybe if i look for words to say i won't find any but if i maybe just talk maybe

5
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,879
they'll come

6
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,920
one of the teachings implications of buddhist buddhism

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,280
is that nothing that we see and touch and smell

8
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,879
and hear uh

9
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:05,119
or say this is the way everything that we see and touch and hear and smell and

10
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,880
and even think is made up of parts

11
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,640
is made up of other things is a composite

12
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,320
made up of things that have proceeded that led to it conditions that led to it

13
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,159
and also um coming together of different elements

14
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:36,640
different other things and those things are composite as well

15
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,399
and in that composite nature of these things there are actually no things

16
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,680
they're only processes some things arise and persist for a

17
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,720
while and then they pass but one way the other all things are in

18
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:02,079
process and when we look at our inner life our emotional life

19
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:07,759
our mental life the things that we can know there uh

20
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:15,760
except for concepts ideas give the semblance of nouns of things

21
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,800
that this is the way it is but

22
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,560
all our emotions our thoughts our body sensations everything that we can

23
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,760
feel and experience and sense is made up of other parts

24
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,120
it's a composite and in some way or other is in process

25
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,200
and moving and it's when we get caught in nouns

26
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,840
it's possible to be caught in nouns and this is the way it is

27
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:56,080
that we get hung up we get caught we suffer we

28
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,840
leave the river of change we leave the dynam dynamism

29
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,879
of a life made up of all the comings and goings of our life the life around us

30
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,720
this dynamic inter interdependent process

31
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,560
interdependently rising of phenomena so

32
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:27,920
we sit to meditate in the middle of many many things that make us up

33
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,840
this moment we are dynamic processes

34
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,680
though our thinking might not think so

35
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,400
so assuming a meditation posture

36
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,239
and the posture you take is a composite made up of different

37
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:02,319
parts of the body assuming different positions

38
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:11,200
the body itself is composite made up of bones and

39
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:18,560
flesh and muscles and organs and nerves skin hair

40
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:27,520
and we take this composite body this and assume a posture that

41
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,160
promotes attentiveness

42
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,800
to here and now

43
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,560
and then to gently close your eyes

44
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,880
one of the dynamic processes that's costly shifting and changing

45
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:07,240
one of the important pieces of the whole is our breathing

46
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:26,080
and to gently breathe more deeply

47
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,800
we're fully maybe three quarters full

48
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:41,120
and a long exhale settling in

49
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,840
to the body

50
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:56,360
exhaling and relaxing into the body

51
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,840
and letting the breathing return to normal

52
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:47,960
in an ordinary life part of the composite of who we are that contributes to the whole

53
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:54,400
is the tension we have in our body the holding patterns

54
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,000
we create a different whole when we begin to relax and

55
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,240
let go the body

56
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:13,080
on the exhale relaxing the muscles of the face

57
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,919
on the exhale softening the shoulders

58
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,960
softening the belly

59
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:03,439
and then to settle your attention into the body breathing

60
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,199
feeling the movements of the body as you breathe

61
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:28,080
and the experience we call breathing is a composite made up of

62
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,719
other parts other activities

63
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,760
it's made up of the inhale and the exhale

64
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,000
the movements of the body

65
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,120
the air going in and out through the nostrils

66
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:12,000
one way or other the breathing is under the influence of often under the influence of our

67
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,279
mood or emotional state

68
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:36,519
breathing is under the influence of the level of excite the level of excitement in the body

69
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,480
activation

70
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,600
breathing is little bit influenced by it whatever degree of

71
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:04,839
pleasure discomf comfort or discomfort

72
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,880
that comes along with the experience of breathing

73
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,199
the experience of breathing is made up of

74
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,440
the choices we make the interests the ideas we have about breathing and

75
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:45,720
about how to notice breathing where in the body to pay attention

76
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,880
and finally part of the experience of breathing

77
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,240
is the awareness of breathing itself

78
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:21,480
without some awareness there's no experiencing of breathing

79
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:39,600
and all these things all these parts of the experience

80
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,279
i don't think we can very well control them or guide them or

81
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,800
make them be just right

82
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:01,600
perhaps you can surrender into the experience of breathing

83
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,760
let it be what it is a dynamic process

84
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,800
made up of many parts

85
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,639
that you can allow to operate as it does and for you

86
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,759
just to be aware of it

87
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,519
so

88
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,400
minutes

89
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,240
uh

90
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,919
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

91
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,440
one part of human life is

92
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:03,840
what motivates us the wishes we have

93
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,880
and of course there are many wishes many motivations to be had

94
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:18,960
we end with the particular form of love good will friendliness

95
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:25,840
that is wishing well for others being motivated

96
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:32,799
to bring about the welfare and happiness of others

97
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:38,480
and may it be as we end this meditation

98
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:44,399
that we spend these next two minutes reflecting and thinking about

99
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:52,799
whatever motivation we have whatever desire wish we have for the that others be well

100
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:58,240
that others be happy safe

101
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,200
our wishes for the welfare and happiness of everyone

102
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:13,840
may all may everyone be happy

103
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,480
may everyone be safe

104
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,080
may everyone be peaceful

105
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:29,759
may everyone be free

106
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:37,360
and may it be that each of us also has the wish

107
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:42,640
to contribute to that may it be

108
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:49,000
that we contribute to the welfare and happiness of all beings

109
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,840
so

110
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:16,360
thank you

111
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:49,279
so today i'll continue this five-part series on getting wise to emotions

112
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:57,440
a wise relationship to them and part of it is to realize that

113
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,720
emotions are not a singular uni uh unitary thing

114
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,159
but they are composites they are made up of the elements and pieces

115
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:16,240
and they're made up of elements in different ways different parts make up emotions in different ways

116
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:22,559
and maybe that's part of the reason why it's not so clear exactly what an emotion is

117
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:30,000
and we don't have to know exactly what an emotion is as a category we might want to know what anger is or

118
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,080
we might want to know sadness or happiness or love there's a whole range of these things

119
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:42,290
that fit under the umbrella term of emotions and whichever ones we fit in there

120
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:49,279
[Music] they are composites they're made up of component parts

121
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:54,720
and why that's important is that sometimes people will have

122
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:01,039
attitudes beliefs relationships to emotions

123
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:07,120
with it with the idea that it's a singular thing anger is anger and it justifies things

124
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:14,480
it drives us it we have relationship to anger as a you know it's good it's bad

125
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:20,880
but when we start kind of not looking at it as only as a solid singular thing

126
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:26,960
but start seeing the component parts then we can have relationship to the different parts

127
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:33,840
and the relationship to the whole becomes different we might realize that some of the elements that

128
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:39,600
can make up an emotion are actually more important and perhaps

129
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:44,720
more important for for our motivations for understanding

130
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:50,640
for our healing for finding our freedom with it all

131
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:55,679
sometimes it's hard to uh work with an emotion when we only see it as a

132
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:01,039
singularity as a solid thing in and of itself and

133
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:08,878
and it can be kind of overwhelming but once we kind of drop down underneath the veneer underneath the label or the

134
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:15,280
general kind of solitary concept we begin seeing it in a different way and have a whole different relationship to

135
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:22,878
what's happening so i'd like to offer you some of the things that make up emotions and you

136
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:30,240
maybe you can think of some more as well so part of an emotion is

137
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:35,280
a bodily experience a physiological shift in change that

138
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:41,358
happens in the body when an emotion becomes present for some people the physiological change

139
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:46,480
is very strong and clear for some people it's very quiet and maybe even they

140
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:53,200
would say there is no physiological change but i think that emotion is always something and the quieter we become and

141
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,240
meditation for example the more attuned we can be to even the subtlest changes

142
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:04,240
of physiology as we have emotions activations of uh

143
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:09,520
muscles of energies probably of hormones and biochemical things that all this

144
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:17,280
stuff begins to shift and change in the body as we as emotion arise as it persists and as it dissipates

145
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,320
some of that physiological change might precede the actually rising of the emotion

146
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,680
itself we might have a lot of stress and the stress hormones the stress

147
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,880
sensations that tightness in their body is a condition

148
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,320
for the arising of anger and

149
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:45,359
or fear and and and it we might and that the condition

150
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:51,440
that precedes it in the body is often sometimes the way to heal it as well

151
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:58,400
because sometimes as the body relaxes and settles then the fuel for the particular emotion

152
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:04,320
is not being provided the physiologic physiology sometimes

153
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:09,599
drives the emotional lives so dropping down into the body and really

154
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:14,960
getting familiar with all the different bodily expressions of emotions bodily

155
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,000
manifestations of them is it can be very important

156
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:27,119
another thing that makes up a good number of emotions is cognitive and we might start with the

157
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:34,000
stories that we have um you know it's a kind of a classic

158
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,079
thing in meditation is to be relatively calm and peaceful and minding your own business with your

159
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:46,480
breathing and for some reason that is not obvious at all your mind produces a thought from long

160
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:53,839
ago of a person you knew maybe a person who harmed you or hurt you or annoyed you

161
00:36:53,839 --> 00:37:00,240
and and uh and just thinking about that story and what happened to that person

162
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:05,839
our physiology changes the energy in the body that maybe goes from being centered in our

163
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:12,160
torso and up into our head maybe the hands get tight their jaws get tight

164
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:17,359
or they feel a contraction in the mind and because the story still has a lot of

165
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:22,720
juice a lot of impact on us and what's fascinating there is to see

166
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:28,079
that the movement is from the story that arises to the story is a condition for the

167
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:33,359
bodily manifestation and the body was fine by itself

168
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:38,480
but then the story kind of evokes something very powerful

169
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:45,839
and then the bodily expression came and uh when stories are part of emotions

170
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:51,280
then when we we are we can be if we are storytellers telling

171
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:59,119
and retelling the story that can perpetuate the emotion that can keep it going can strengthen it can

172
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:04,320
can influence very much the course of the emotion because of the nature of the

173
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:09,599
storytelling sometimes the stories change as we tell it and so then the emotions change as

174
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:15,599
well and we might have started off for example being angry and we telling our story about

175
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:22,320
about how we've been you know slighted by someone and then we tell ourselves a story well

176
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:27,760
if that person knows that i'm angry they'll probably retaliate and now i'm afraid and

177
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,880
and now suddenly fear arises and then uh we realized something with

178
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:38,320
another story we maybe we realized oh the person's actually moving to another continent

179
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:44,640
and um and they said never going to come back to this country and and then you say oh you can feel yourself relax and

180
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:50,880
then there's a happiness that might arise and so we tell ourselves stories and the stories have meaning

181
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,079
associations another part of this component part of

182
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:02,800
emotions that's sometimes more obvious with the story is that there's a self in relationship

183
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:09,359
to the emotion self understanding self how we view ourselves how we

184
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:15,680
have other people see us how we are personally affected by the story the

185
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:22,880
events of what's going on what emotions mean for me what's going to happen if i'm

186
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:29,119
maybe i feel happy and and i'm the one who's happy i'm so happy that i'm happy and

187
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:34,320
and um and this will be great my life is made i'm gonna be happy forever

188
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:42,079
and um and there's a lot of uh eye making and me making and part of the happiness might be in relationship to

189
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:48,079
i'm the one who's happy and so the the self-identification with the emotion

190
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:53,680
and the role of i and self-understanding of who i am and how that that's a

191
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:59,680
component part of motions as well i'll talk more about that tomorrow

192
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:04,720
and there's also motivation that's part of the

193
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:10,640
emotion um i talked about that a little bit with metta earlier that

194
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:16,480
emotion like loving kindness is one that has motivation built into it

195
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:24,240
it's wishing someone well wanting them to be well maybe wanting to support that to happen

196
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:30,480
if there is anger there is a motivation perhaps to get rid of something to push it away

197
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,920
and get angry with your computer and you throw it across the room to kind of get it away

198
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:42,160
there is some emotions come with motivations and intention uh something needs wanting something to

199
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:48,800
happen and sometimes that's really helpful to notice what motivation comes along with an

200
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:56,480
emotion what motivation comes along with sadness or what comes along with joy

201
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:02,640
just noticing this shift and changes what's what what wants to what's the motivation what's the desire

202
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:08,079
that's connected to it emotions are also connected to

203
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:13,599
perceptions um and it's a little different than the stories but overlaps with them

204
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:19,359
and that is um what we what we are what we think we're perceiving the ideas

205
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:26,800
we have about things and the um

206
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:36,240
there's a ancient chinese story of that the vignette that's told of a man who's in a

207
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:41,599
sailboat going across a lake big lake and another sailboat comes along and

208
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:46,800
unexpectedly bangs into his sailboat and the person gets furious

209
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:52,480
and then he lifts up and looks over the edge of the boat and sees that there's no one in the other boat it's just

210
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:58,000
somehow gotten loose since floating around and the anger was there

211
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,520
thinking there was a person in charge that they could be angry with and then the person realized well

212
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:08,880
he should always be attentive to what's floating around and paying attention

213
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:16,079
and [Music] we perceive things a lot differently

214
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:21,200
when it's done by some another person versus if it's done by

215
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:27,280
a natural phenomenon if a if some beautiful

216
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:32,640
deer maybe walks across your garden

217
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:38,400
uh maybe you're upset uh or maybe you've never seen a deer in your property that haven't been around

218
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:45,599
for you know hundreds of miles and you're like rather than upset you're just like amazed wow there's a deer with it's fawn

219
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:52,960
and and and but if a neighbor comes across and walks across your garden maybe accidentally

220
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,960
um there's a lot that we perceive it differently and we interpret it differently

221
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:05,760
are the perceptions we make the most useful perceptions are they optional are they particular

222
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:12,400
interpretation of events maybe they're good perceptions good interpretations but to see it as that

223
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:18,560
way so these are some of the i can go on further but um

224
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:24,400
to spend some time looking at your emotions as they occur uh at what is the

225
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:30,880
physiology of it what is the stories related to it

226
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:36,160
what are the motivations related to it what are the what's the how do how are

227
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:43,119
you as a person as a self as a your identity your idea of yourself how does that come into play

228
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:49,440
and what are the perceptions and ideas that operate when an emotion is there

229
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:56,560
and are they built into the fabric in the of the universe that that's the perception the idea the interpretation

230
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:02,319
to have or are there others to be had there are others that are more

231
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:08,800
maybe appropriate or more peaceful and and maybe there's a range of interpretations

232
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,839
and maybe they're all equally valuable but why choose the one that's stressful

233
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:20,319
for you maybe choose one that brings you a sense of awe and delight and joy

234
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:27,359
so um so what you might do this next

235
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:33,280
you know 24 hours is take some time to

236
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:38,560
sit down maybe with a piece of paper and and kind of map out

237
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:43,599
the different component parts that make up your emotion and

238
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:49,040
different ones you have especially the ones that are live but also you can review other ones you've had

239
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:56,240
and maybe lay them down piece of paper like a little mind map or you know like a mandala of what they all are

240
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:02,839
and then consider the component parts themselves what kind of permanence what kind of

241
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:08,000
solidity what kind of art do they have what kind of relationship do you have to

242
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,599
the parts and as you begin looking more carefully at the parts of

243
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:20,319
an emotion what happens to the emotion does the emotion shift and change

244
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:26,720
in surveying the parts that make it up so thank you

245
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:33,119
and i hope your emotional life is rich and valuable and

246
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:39,599
supportive for you and if it's not i hope that this deeper investigation into it

247
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:44,760
will be supportive thank you
