1
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:11,420
welcome back from lunch

2
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:29,400
and just maybe taking a minute to fill your bodies full not hungry hopefully I'm not too

3
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:38,000
full feel the impact of being with Sangha

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,340
socializing quietly or actually

5
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:51,140
notice how the heart and the body are stirred the mind is stirred

6
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:04,100
taking some deep breaths into whatever is happening for you right now

7
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,220
foreign

8
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:21,780
instructions on mindfulness of emotions and thinking a lot for one sitting

9
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:28,200
and to add to that before I'd like to talk a little bit about love

10
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,360
and about the feeling of being at home

11
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:43,219
I have a little quote from Anne Klein

12
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:52,579
says attention is the start of love there can be no love without attention

13
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:59,640
and cultivating attention or cultivating a possibility for intention

14
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:06,540
and possibility for connection and that's to ourselves as well as to

15
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,220
others to all

16
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:20,840
attention is the start of love there can be no love without attention

17
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,819
so have we been attending today

18
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:37,260
and then notice our relationship to how we've been attending

19
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,800
what we've been attending to has there been love there

20
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:49,080
[Music] has there been love and how we're

21
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:55,140
attending to our experience of breathing of itching of pain

22
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,920
of restlessness

23
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,060
of body

24
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,680
hopefully some maybe even a lot

25
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:24,599
it's very um different experience

26
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:30,379
to cultivate awareness that meets things with love

27
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:38,540
maybe so different it's hard to stay with sometimes

28
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:47,040
this is important because of this other word I want to talk about

29
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,640
home

30
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,900
what is it to be at home

31
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,599
what is it to be at home wherever you go

32
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:15,900
right here even is it possible to be at home in the body

33
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,000
to be at home with awareness

34
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,120
much more likely if there's love there

35
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,880
this idea of being at home maybe could also be described as

36
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,060
embodiment as presence

37
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,220
that feeling of being yourself or being with somebody who feels

38
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,860
right there right there

39
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:07,259
and often we think about home in the external world or homeless in the external world and

40
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:12,600
if we're at home in about in a structure

41
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,820
there's this belief

42
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:23,820
often truth but not always that okay the doors are shut I'm here

43
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,720
it's my space

44
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:36,380
if we're homeless without a structure

45
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:43,759
there's a feeling that anybody at any time can come along and shoe us off

46
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:55,500
what if we apply the idea to

47
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:03,060
our practice if we can be at home in our bodies with

48
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:09,419
awareness what is it that helps us

49
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:14,538
feel settled present

50
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:22,940
and what is it that makes us feel like we're being pushed out pushed away

51
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:32,720
very often it's our thinking or our emotions

52
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:42,000
what if it's possible to have emotions and thoughts

53
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,759
and stay at home to not get pushed out

54
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,419
of our presence not get pushed out of embodiment

55
00:06:53,460 --> 00:07:00,080
to not abandon ourselves our awareness

56
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:09,860
what if it's possible to be with all of these things that are happening internally

57
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:17,759
without getting pushed out without losing

58
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:25,520
that sense of home of righteousness

59
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:31,440
of embodiment of presence

60
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,440
awakeness

61
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,819
sometimes hard to do that with emotions

62
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:53,099
sometimes hard to do that with thoughts actually

63
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:59,580
there's so many ways we're compulsive habitual reactive

64
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:06,840
so many ways the sound of a phone an itch

65
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:12,800
somebody's breathing anything at all

66
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,580
if we're reactive to it

67
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:25,680
so what we're doing here is simple but not

68
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,020
easy simple and that there's not a lot

69
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:38,300
complicated about it it's staying

70
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,020
being with

71
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,060
but that's not always easy

72
00:08:52,019 --> 00:09:00,660
and sometimes we miss delightful experiences because we're so busy bopping around

73
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:05,180
getting caught up in a fantasy here and there

74
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,459
so we'll start the meditation working with emotions

75
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:22,579
and and transition to working with thinking

76
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:32,459
in the same way that we started the morning with an anchor and the breath of

77
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:40,399
course we'll start there too in this meditation pretty much always that's the starting

78
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:52,980
options when you're trying to focus on thoughts but we'll try and use our awareness our

79
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:58,380
choicefulness to be more tuned into an attentive to

80
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:04,980
certain parts of our experience so we can get to know them a little better

81
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:10,440
we can get to know the compulsions the habits the emotions and even the

82
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,700
thinking patterns better

83
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,600
so this idea of love loving attention

84
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:36,720
and if you don't like the word love maybe you like the word caring or kind

85
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,500
or allowing finding the word for you

86
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:50,420
that supports and inspires a way of relating to whatever comes up

87
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,339
that helps you stay present stay home

88
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:04,740
and one of the things that we'll do is focus on emotions

89
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:10,200
not the thinking about them but the experience of them

90
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:16,740
how they come alive manifest show up in the body

91
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,920
where you feel them what they feel like

92
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:31,519
emotions can get a bad rap

93
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:40,260
sometimes we try not to have emotions sometimes we try to just have really

94
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:47,700
good emotions but the thing is is there it's energy

95
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:54,300
that moves through us and we try and block negative difficult

96
00:11:54,300 --> 00:12:00,380
emotions we end up blocking all emotions

97
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:10,620
so when Koto and I were teaching intro

98
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:16,680
Series in August he brought this beautiful metaphor to

99
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:24,139
working with emotions the idea of being like a river

100
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:33,060
thank you and being the river the water itself perhaps being the stream of feelings

101
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:39,360
emotions in this particular situation and the bed

102
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,540
the body being our awareness our capacity to

103
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:53,600
allow things to move through the way a riverbed allows the water to flow

104
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:06,019
we can be wide Broad and Deep River beds

105
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,860
everything and just keep moving through there's no problem

106
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:22,700
and other times it might feel like we want to contract close up build the dam

107
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:31,339
put water like emotion is pretty amazing it can find its way around

108
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:39,660
so maybe we become smaller reverse we try and just be as wide as we can and

109
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,399
let as much as we can come through

110
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:54,420
foreign to be into that bed the riverbed to feel

111
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:59,899
the water the emotion moving through us

112
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:15,500
so let's find our meditation postures or re-establish them

113
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:24,920
maybe breathing in deeply and with it feeling the spine and the shoulders lift

114
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:30,500
maybe rolling those shoulders back and open

115
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:45,839
and just noticing if there's anything needed for your posture to be supported

116
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,360
a pillow a shift

117
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:10,260
and taking some nice full intentional deep breaths right now

118
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:18,600
as we begin the formal practice of meditation with the body prepared

119
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:27,420
we bring it more oxygen with these deeper breaths which tells the body it's okay to relax

120
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:35,940
and feeds the brain and you can even possibly feel

121
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:41,120
the blood or the oxygen moving through your system

122
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:46,759
being aware of breath and body at the same time

123
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:04,760
coming home into this body In This Moment

124
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,360
feeling into it

125
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:20,120
sensing the experience of being here

126
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:44,899
and whatever your anchor

127
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:53,160
when you're ready picking it up in your practice

128
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:58,040
with devotion with care

129
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:05,060
letting it help you come even more fully

130
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,140
in a continuous way breath after breath

131
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,580
foreign

132
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:14,240
maybe bring your awareness into the heart into the chest

133
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:24,480
with your anchor just notice the emotional tone

134
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,220
or emotions present

135
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:41,000
maybe as you see them just to say hi and name them simply

136
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:50,600
hello hi there

137
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,880
I see you peeking over there

138
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:13,279
anything from boredom to Joy to grief

139
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:21,259
to anger to happiness welcome them all

140
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:40,160
part of the richness of living in a human body

141
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,640
his emotions

142
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:53,779
so we're beginning a practice called raft

143
00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:01,380
the r is to recognize bull recognition

144
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,460
of emotion

145
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:13,100
no a in raft is to allow

146
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:19,880
to give space to the emotion

147
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,220
being that riverbed

148
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,660
and maybe choosing one emotion in particular to work with that doesn't

149
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,740
feel too difficult

150
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,120
something you know you can be with

151
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:53,539
thank you

152
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:05,520
and then to feel it that's the F of raft to feel it in your body

153
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:11,820
how it's living being expressed this is the sensation the language of

154
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:17,280
the body and feeling it is how we let the body

155
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,780
know it's heard

156
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,780
foreign

157
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:39,960
to seeing if it is changing in any way

158
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,860
moving

159
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:57,380
maybe simply noticing if it feels Pleasant unpleasant or neutral

160
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:11,940
working here with the direct experience not the story

161
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:19,760
but the manifestation the experience the sensation of the feeling

162
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:38,480
and when you feel you have felt the emotion

163
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:46,220
and if you feel ready to move to the next part of raft

164
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:52,980
you might imagine a great room

165
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,120
lots of space

166
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:03,620
there may be many chairs or a giant table in the center

167
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:20,960
and you could invite this emotion to have a seat

168
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,840
and if there were some thoughts that were connected to this emotion

169
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,460
maybe each thought memory story

170
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:45,659
judgment reaction can also have a seat

171
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:52,080
in their own spot in this way we're teasing apart the

172
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:59,640
experience of many things coming together around

173
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,659
the emotion

174
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:24,539
and maybe just getting a feel for how many characters how much history how

175
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:32,120
much story who's involved in this particular feeling

176
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:39,200
and maybe almost alone at the table you may be in a crowded room

177
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:52,399
but what happens when you give all of it its own space

178
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:56,659
bowing to each part

179
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:04,340
I think them untangle from each other

180
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:26,940
and as you're ready we'll shift into just mindfulness of

181
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:34,820
thinking practice you can allow this

182
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:42,299
collection of thoughts and emotions to reside where they are or

183
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:46,039
maybe they're moving through

184
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:04,940
maybe imagine that the thoughts are like leaves or boats on that River

185
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:18,440
awareness being the riverbed Waters being the energies and emotion

186
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:26,340
little boats or leaves can represent the thoughts

187
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,419
coming and going

188
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,320
and to keep it simple

189
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:46,919
you might want to just start by noticing the types of thinking

190
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:53,700
that is happening types of thinking can be visual

191
00:26:53,700 --> 00:27:01,399
seeing images they can be auditory hearing

192
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,460
they can be literally words spelled out

193
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:17,360
it can be like a mini movie multimedia collage

194
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,700
just seeing them in this simple form

195
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:43,440
not all minds think in the same way you might not realize it but the person

196
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,500
beside you can be thinking entirely differently

197
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:57,559
so can you recognize the way you think how your thoughts appear and disappear

198
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:19,620
another simple way might be to notice and label Thoughts by categories of

199
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:25,080
planning or conversing

200
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,340
or rehearsing

201
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:40,700
or remembering maybe just simply thinking

202
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:07,380
it's also possible to just notice the volume or intensity of the thoughts

203
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:12,480
they may be coming rarely slowly

204
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,240
in groups clusters

205
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:26,960
what's the pacing what's the level of intensity

206
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,860
what's the speed

207
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:50,600
and sometimes we'll find a thought really sticking around

208
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:57,899
if that's happening maybe very useful to notice if there's

209
00:29:57,899 --> 00:30:01,820
an emotion present with the thought

210
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:09,240
and then you can do the practice of raft silently in your own process if it's

211
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:14,940
helpful to recognize the emotion allow it to be there

212
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:21,500
feel it in your body and teasing apart the pieces

213
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,860
foreign

214
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:04,820
it might be possible for thinking to kind of go to the background

215
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:12,059
and for awareness being with your breath or Sensations

216
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:18,740
sound to be more primary

217
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:25,880
letting the flow of thinking move through

218
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:35,419
not needing to speed it up or slow it down change it

219
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:47,520
and just remembering that moment that we recognize we're caught in thinking we're

220
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:52,559
aware already aware

221
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:59,120
home and then love

222
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,700
Love Is Possible

223
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:20,279
can we just let thoughts be thoughts events in the mind

224
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:27,799
what a mind does the same way a sensation arises in the body

225
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:32,899
they come and they go

226
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:55,100
and not me not mine even

227
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:01,278
just the nature of the mind to make thoughts

228
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,240
foreign

229
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:54,320
right here at home

230
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,260
In This Moment aware

231
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:10,400
knowing thinking knowing sensing knowing hearing

232
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:17,099
knowing breathing maybe feel into the awareness that

233
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:20,660
recognizes this all

234
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,480
thank you

235
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:42,740
[Music] thank you

236
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:47,389
[Music]

237
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:58,460
taking your time [Music]

238
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:08,220
moving slowly to walking practice we'll be back at 2 45

239
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:14,540
for our next practice session thank you

240
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:17,900
so I have this idea

241
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:27,198
that IMC has a specialty

242
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:36,260
and that that specialty is simplicity

243
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:44,659
simple name Insight Meditation Center

244
01:14:44,820 --> 01:14:49,158
simple situation here simple room

245
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:59,000
and the practice of a simple straightforward awareness

246
01:15:04,020 --> 01:15:11,219
if I were pressed to come up with a one sentence

247
01:15:11,219 --> 01:15:18,080
summary of The Practice it might be something like

248
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:29,599
clear awareness of present moment experience

249
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:35,900
with a ballot with a balanced mind

250
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:45,920
clear awareness of present moment experience with a balanced mind

251
01:15:53,219 --> 01:15:59,400
and so the way I understand it is all of the instructions we've been giving this morning and

252
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:05,699
we'll go for the rest of the afternoon are all elaborations on that one simple

253
01:16:05,699 --> 01:16:13,040
practice to be aware of what's here

254
01:16:22,679 --> 01:16:30,320
I think if we started with just saying oh be aware of what's here there's so much we might miss

255
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:36,678
so we go bit by bit starting with the breathing

256
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:44,960
settling in with the breathing connecting to embodied experience

257
01:16:46,679 --> 01:16:53,540
than including emotions including our thinking

258
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:59,840
to be at home right here

259
01:17:05,159 --> 01:17:12,440
simple not always easy

260
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:24,620
so with this next step of instructions

261
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:32,780
keeping that simplicity nearby

262
01:17:42,179 --> 01:17:49,320
the next step we will take is that to include all of our experience

263
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:53,480
everything that comes in our experience

264
01:17:54,360 --> 01:18:00,140
rather than focusing on one area everything

265
01:18:00,780 --> 01:18:05,599
including everything one thing at a time

266
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:16,698
so we call this practice open awareness

267
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:32,699
there's another very old metaphor to share after these hours of practicing it may

268
01:18:32,699 --> 01:18:38,219
be a comfort to think of yourself in this metaphor as sitting sitting back

269
01:18:38,219 --> 01:18:45,360
in an easy chair sitting back in an easy chair

270
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:49,580
in the middle of a simple one-room house

271
01:18:54,179 --> 01:19:00,260
one room house one door four windows

272
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:09,260
and we're just sitting in our chair peacefully

273
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:15,500
the one room house was this old metaphor for our being

274
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:29,280
and each of the let's say each of the windows in the

275
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:35,820
door is one of our senses the eyes the ears the nose the tongue

276
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:41,360
the body and of course the mind

277
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:49,219
so here we are sitting in our easy chair

278
01:19:51,780 --> 01:20:00,500
and in mindfulness practice and open awareness just letting whatever comes

279
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:06,780
arise and pass away so we're sitting in the easy chair and

280
01:20:06,780 --> 01:20:14,900
maybe a one of these neighborhood dark gray or black squirrels runs by the front door

281
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:25,380
we see the squirrel run by we don't get out of our chair we don't pursue it

282
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:30,780
we don't pull away from it we don't follow it

283
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:38,100
or tell ourselves a story about it that just comes right by

284
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:42,800
and then maybe a bird lands on a windowsill

285
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:48,500
and then flies off

286
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:57,659
we don't move toward we don't move away just clearly aware ah the bird and there

287
01:20:57,659 --> 01:21:00,140
it goes

288
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:07,820
house cat same story

289
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:15,659
for our practice to stay back in the easy chair just having an easeful

290
01:21:15,659 --> 01:21:22,980
simple relationship to whatever arises

291
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:26,239
at any of the senses

292
01:21:53,580 --> 01:22:00,719
again put in one phrase as we're sitting back in the easy chair

293
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:08,239
whatever comes we just know and we let it be

294
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:13,040
we know and we let it pass

295
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:20,179
whatever is known

296
01:22:24,420 --> 01:22:30,860
with an as easeful or kind attitude as is available

297
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:51,320
so in terms of the meditation practice we've been doing

298
01:22:54,900 --> 01:23:01,860
we can here again begin with our breathing settle in with our breathing as the

299
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:04,760
focal point

300
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:15,360
and then as anything becomes predominant

301
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:22,679
say a sensation becomes predominant let the attention land there

302
01:23:22,679 --> 01:23:29,780
just know it and let it pass

303
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:38,719
the change we're making with open awareness is this one

304
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:47,820
it's not it's that we're not making any deliberate effort to direct the attention one place or

305
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:52,860
another but attention is allowed to move about

306
01:23:52,860 --> 01:23:55,460
freely

307
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:05,900
that might look something like

308
01:24:07,620 --> 01:24:14,280
I noticed the inhale I noticed that then the attention moves

309
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:21,620
vibration in the foot sound

310
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:30,380
train horn sensation in the shoulder

311
01:24:34,020 --> 01:24:39,020
to wherever attention moves on its own

312
01:24:39,719 --> 01:24:42,800
we accompany it

313
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:55,679
foreign in this sense you can think of attention as like a soft spotlight

314
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:59,540
that lands in one place or another

315
01:25:01,739 --> 01:25:08,100
the soft spotlight points to this object

316
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:11,960
it becomes known in our experience

317
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:20,280
and then without our doing anything Spotlight has found a new object

318
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:26,300
known in our experience Twan after the next

319
01:25:55,440 --> 01:26:01,020
if you find that the attention becomes

320
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:08,659
difficult to follow or you find yourself moving into distraction

321
01:26:08,699 --> 01:26:15,320
just come back to the breathing or whatever your anchor happens to be

322
01:26:16,860 --> 01:26:19,820
settled back in

323
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:31,158
perhaps for a few minutes

324
01:26:33,780 --> 01:26:42,920
and then again release any intention to accompany the breath

325
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:50,699
just accompanying attention as it moves here now there

326
01:26:50,699 --> 01:26:53,300
now there

327
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:37,760
at times

328
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:47,719
the attention may seem to move from thing to thing

329
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:52,219
from experience to experience

330
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:08,480
perhaps that's why one name for this practice is choiceless attention

331
01:32:11,820 --> 01:32:15,800
we don't choose what arises

332
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:22,040
or where the attention is to go

333
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:27,199
so we accompany the the attention

334
01:32:29,159 --> 01:32:36,320
and recognize what is known in a simple way

335
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:48,020
so at times the attention may be seem to move

336
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:59,840
and at other times it may feel or seem

337
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:07,460
like the attention like the Mind itself doesn't move at all

338
01:33:10,679 --> 01:33:16,519
and instead experiences come and they go

339
01:33:17,940 --> 01:33:26,400
almost like the vast openness of the night sky

340
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:33,719
doesn't seem to move but there may be a little Sparkle of a

341
01:33:33,719 --> 01:33:40,280
star or a planet or a twinkle

342
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:47,239
comes into space and then vanishes

343
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:21,960
foreign

344
01:41:05,300 --> 01:41:09,138
any experience

345
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:17,420
internal or external

346
01:41:22,860 --> 01:41:26,600
to accompany attention

347
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:33,020
knowing each thing simply

348
01:49:34,820 --> 01:49:39,320
accompanying attention

349
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:46,940
now here now here

350
01:49:53,159 --> 01:49:58,940
and if the mind is currently prone to distraction

351
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:02,480
no problem

352
01:50:07,219 --> 01:50:12,920
just direct the attention to the breathing for some time

353
01:50:16,380 --> 01:50:19,380
simplifying

354
01:50:23,460 --> 01:50:31,080
and then when you are ready opening awareness again

355
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:34,820
to choiceless attention

356
01:55:23,400 --> 01:55:25,520
thank you

357
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:51,159
foreign [Music]

358
01:57:05,580 --> 01:57:11,178
attention open awareness

359
01:57:14,719 --> 01:57:21,480
every experience that arises can be incorporated

360
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:26,719
every experience that arises is welcome

361
01:57:27,659 --> 01:57:34,619
maybe counter-intuitive experiences may be pleasant they may be

362
01:57:34,619 --> 01:57:41,420
unpleasant it's not an indication that something has gone wrong

363
01:57:43,860 --> 01:57:50,460
but with choiceless attention open awareness we're knowing

364
01:57:50,460 --> 01:57:58,760
feeling sensing our way along the path with whatever experience comes

365
01:58:00,239 --> 01:58:03,860
and maybe to hold as a question

366
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:11,940
what is the freedom that's to be known right there in the

367
01:58:11,940 --> 01:58:16,520
knowing in that simple experience

368
01:58:20,159 --> 01:58:27,000
so now let's take care of our bodies we have about 15 minutes for a stretch break

369
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:34,860
um we'll we'll continue to keep silence here and then we will come back at

370
01:58:34,860 --> 01:58:40,739
oh 3 45.

371
01:58:41,400 --> 01:58:44,119
thank you

372
02:14:36,679 --> 02:14:44,659
thank you coming back

373
02:14:49,739 --> 02:14:54,320
near the end of our day of practice together

374
02:15:02,579 --> 02:15:07,800
maybe it's worthwhile to just notice the impact

375
02:15:07,800 --> 02:15:15,260
how are you feeling how's your state of being

376
02:15:22,199 --> 02:15:29,840
we're switching the schedule up a little bit in case you were following it closely

377
02:15:30,179 --> 02:15:36,079
and I'm gonna give a little talk now and then we'll create space for some

378
02:15:36,079 --> 02:15:41,400
Reflections questions we'll do a little loving kindness

379
02:15:41,400 --> 02:15:47,219
practice and um I'm gonna bring it to an end

380
02:15:47,219 --> 02:15:53,579
so I thought it might be helpful to um

381
02:15:53,579 --> 02:16:02,239
bring a little energy back into the room as we transition out of quiet and still

382
02:16:02,760 --> 02:16:10,340
and just notice how that lands inside of you right now that idea

383
02:16:13,880 --> 02:16:21,719
sometimes people are ecstatic and looking forward to you know moving out and talking and

384
02:16:21,719 --> 02:16:28,940
sometimes there's a bit of a pain

385
02:16:29,599 --> 02:16:37,380
reluctant or abrasing to go back into a lot of a lot more

386
02:16:37,380 --> 02:16:42,978
stimulation expectations

387
02:16:43,559 --> 02:16:51,320
ours and others so just checking in

388
02:16:51,960 --> 02:16:56,780
and noticing you know what's true for you

389
02:17:03,059 --> 02:17:06,619
it's an unusual sound

390
02:17:10,019 --> 02:17:16,040
remember how you felt when you walked in the door this morning

391
02:17:19,260 --> 02:17:25,978
do you remember your first sit which was pretty much silence for the

392
02:17:25,979 --> 02:17:34,219
first half hour and then the guided breathing meditation

393
02:17:35,639 --> 02:17:39,199
and then the walking period

394
02:17:40,679 --> 02:17:44,660
and then the mindfulness of body

395
02:17:46,800 --> 02:17:50,358
and then the lunch

396
02:17:54,120 --> 02:18:00,240
coming back to mindfulness of both emotions and

397
02:18:00,240 --> 02:18:07,461
thoughts another walking

398
02:18:07,860 --> 02:18:13,138
an open awareness practice it's a lot of meditating a lot of ground

399
02:18:13,139 --> 02:18:19,380
to cover in one day nice work

400
02:18:19,380 --> 02:18:25,380
some of you this may be your first time doing a long day long or first time in a

401
02:18:25,380 --> 02:18:32,358
long time nice job

402
02:18:32,719 --> 02:18:36,678
yeah wow

403
02:18:49,920 --> 02:18:55,800
I'll read you a little poem by Sarah jodakau

404
02:18:58,080 --> 02:19:03,300
when the mind is not mindful it feels like a homeless person very insecure

405
02:19:03,300 --> 02:19:08,518
very unhappy when you're mindful

406
02:19:08,519 --> 02:19:14,479
you feel really at home so mindfulness is my home

407
02:19:14,519 --> 02:19:21,558
when you're mindful you are at home when you're not mindful you are on the road to going nowhere

408
02:19:23,040 --> 02:19:29,280
he says get in touch with the spiritual Part of Yourself the beautiful part of yourself

409
02:19:29,281 --> 02:19:32,120
be mindful

410
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:48,380
I wonder if you felt a sense of coming home at all today

411
02:19:49,859 --> 02:19:56,220
a sense of coming back into connection with more or

412
02:19:56,220 --> 02:19:58,880
all of yourself

413
02:20:07,800 --> 02:20:14,820
I wonder if in the guided instructions or in the before the emotions talk

414
02:20:14,820 --> 02:20:21,960
I made it clear enough this idea that um you know when strong emotions come up we

415
02:20:21,960 --> 02:20:28,260
want to leave our bodies often right the feeling

416
02:20:28,260 --> 02:20:33,300
it can be so strong we we want it to stop we want out

417
02:20:33,300 --> 02:20:38,340
and that's an example of becoming homeless right

418
02:20:38,340 --> 02:20:43,460
of of having emotions come in and

419
02:20:43,460 --> 02:20:48,620
losing our capacity to be with them

420
02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:59,399
and there is a way with this practice we cultivate the capacity to be with really

421
02:20:59,399 --> 02:21:07,859
intense things emotions thoughts experience

422
02:21:08,100 --> 02:21:13,739
and we can have this capacity

423
02:21:13,800 --> 02:21:18,920
to maybe be like I say Weebles that wobble but they don't fall down

424
02:21:18,920 --> 02:21:26,399
probably you guys are too young to remember this toy it was called the Weeble and it was a

425
02:21:26,399 --> 02:21:33,479
they were like kind of little people but they had these round bottoms this round base

426
02:21:33,479 --> 02:21:39,359
and so they would be on your you know the table and you could knock them and they'd

427
02:21:39,359 --> 02:21:46,560
wobble but they don't fall down they wobble and they come back up

428
02:21:46,560 --> 02:21:51,720
and so we can Compass you know cultivate the capacity to be like that ourselves

429
02:21:51,720 --> 02:21:57,899
to be like a tree that bends in the wind but we don't lose our ground we don't

430
02:21:57,899 --> 02:22:03,000
get uprooted we don't completely fall over we can let

431
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:09,620
it come and move through us and okay right here right here

432
02:22:11,520 --> 02:22:19,319
sometimes our thoughts you know I see people really having a

433
02:22:19,319 --> 02:22:27,840
hard time with their thinking I've seen people hit themselves because of their thinking they're so upset and distressed

434
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:35,580
it's another way of leaving and not meeting our experience trying to

435
02:22:35,580 --> 02:22:38,600
escape from it

436
02:22:41,479 --> 02:22:48,240
so we're cultivating in this practice we're learning how to see that these

437
02:22:48,240 --> 02:22:54,899
things come up and they go away how to stay grounded how to use an

438
02:22:54,899 --> 02:23:02,580
anchor to help ourselves not get unknowingly carried out to sea with

439
02:23:02,580 --> 02:23:08,000
these thoughts and feelings and compulsions and habits

440
02:23:08,399 --> 02:23:13,439
the conditioning that's been building up our whole lives

441
02:23:13,439 --> 02:23:17,721
it causes a lot of reactivity

442
02:23:19,620 --> 02:23:26,640
so we're learning how to see these things come up and stay and in that process

443
02:23:26,640 --> 02:23:34,500
we're freeing ourselves we're bringing an end to that conditioning by not responding

444
02:23:34,500 --> 02:23:39,380
in the traditional way the habitual way

445
02:23:57,140 --> 02:24:03,840
so I'm going to just kind of go back over some of the instructions from the the day

446
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:10,859
maybe to remind you and also maybe to bring them up so if you have questions about them they're fresh for you

447
02:24:10,859 --> 02:24:17,240
as we move into the question or response reflection time

448
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:24,560
so we talk a lot about this anchor this idea of having this anchor

449
02:24:24,660 --> 02:24:32,100
and very frequently the standard is the breath we talked about using the sounds

450
02:24:32,100 --> 02:24:39,780
or Sensations as optional anchors and this is something our anchor is

451
02:24:39,780 --> 02:24:48,560
something actually we can really create a relationship with that we can start to cultivate a very

452
02:24:48,560 --> 02:24:55,800
fond familiar rapport with our anchors

453
02:24:55,800 --> 02:25:02,399
and they can go with us everywhere and in fact we can start to if our breath for

454
02:25:02,399 --> 02:25:10,680
me it's been the breath or breath and body or breath and sound sometimes I do a combo

455
02:25:10,680 --> 02:25:17,520
but it's like um when I'm walking the breath starts to come into Focus

456
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:24,000
driving the breath starts to be my companion doing the dishes the breath starts to

457
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:30,180
show up starts to come into the foreground again so it's off it's always there in the

458
02:25:30,180 --> 02:25:36,420
background of how far back and as we grow this familiarity this connection

459
02:25:36,420 --> 02:25:44,160
this appreciation for our anchor it really can start to show up more and

460
02:25:44,160 --> 02:25:51,180
more and more for us help us come back come back into this moment and the next

461
02:25:51,180 --> 02:25:56,460
one so you don't just have to think about

462
02:25:56,460 --> 02:26:03,780
using your anchor when you're sitting on the cushion you can actually cultivate it when you're walking

463
02:26:03,780 --> 02:26:11,100
or driving or stopped at a stoplight that can help you

464
02:26:11,100 --> 02:26:17,600
stay on your path throughout everything you do

465
02:26:19,680 --> 02:26:24,840
so that's kind of how we started the day and we wove this in

466
02:26:24,840 --> 02:26:29,939
and then getting to know the breath and how it expresses itself in the body

467
02:26:29,939 --> 02:26:36,780
you can feel it in small parts the nose at the throat or the belly or the whole

468
02:26:36,780 --> 02:26:42,319
body there's so many ways to experience breathing

469
02:26:42,600 --> 02:26:48,660
and then we talked about the body and how the body expresses itself it's a

470
02:26:48,660 --> 02:26:55,680
storehouse of memories and it has Intelligence and it expresses

471
02:26:55,680 --> 02:27:02,399
itself it speaks through Sensations and the way it's heard is by us feeling

472
02:27:02,399 --> 02:27:09,359
those Sensations whether they're emotions or itches or pains

473
02:27:09,359 --> 02:27:15,200
but they're designed for to be heard to be known

474
02:27:15,240 --> 02:27:21,479
so we practice with the body becoming more and more comfortable and

475
02:27:21,479 --> 02:27:26,520
familiar with all the ways it speaks to us less reactive to the ways to speak to

476
02:27:26,520 --> 02:27:31,740
us getting to know that too and how that is

477
02:27:31,740 --> 02:27:36,260
this tremendous part of our experience

478
02:27:37,680 --> 02:27:45,359
kodo talked about the Sixth Sense doors right six of them one is the mind

479
02:27:45,359 --> 02:27:51,660
the rest in the body that's where we live

480
02:27:51,660 --> 02:27:58,818
we find the gateway to the presence of this moment is through this body

481
02:28:02,340 --> 02:28:08,760
foreign we're working with emotions

482
02:28:08,760 --> 02:28:14,340
I offered the raft to recognize allow find and feel

483
02:28:14,340 --> 02:28:20,880
tease apart this can help us kind of pull the

484
02:28:20,880 --> 02:28:27,840
thinking the story the energy behind the emotion kind of tease it apart so that

485
02:28:27,840 --> 02:28:33,060
we can meet the emotion more like raw energy that moves through us

486
02:28:33,060 --> 02:28:38,220
without refueling it re-tripping it so an emotion if we measure it

487
02:28:38,220 --> 02:28:45,079
biochemically you said to last about 120 seconds

488
02:28:45,720 --> 02:28:52,920
now do all your feelings come and go in 120 seconds no right why well because we

489
02:28:52,920 --> 02:29:00,600
we trigger them with more thoughts more fuel so this pulling apart helps maybe slow

490
02:29:00,600 --> 02:29:07,280
down this process of feeding and refueling and re-triggering emotions

491
02:29:09,899 --> 02:29:16,740
and then we worked with thinking and we tried to work with it around noticing

492
02:29:16,740 --> 02:29:24,300
um kind of how we're thinking are we thinking in images movies

493
02:29:24,300 --> 02:29:32,100
are we thinking in conversations narratives words that are typed across the screen

494
02:29:32,100 --> 02:29:37,439
sometimes it's just sort of this background noise

495
02:29:37,439 --> 02:29:45,180
we all think in different ways some of us don't see images some of us don't see words some of us it's dominantly talking

496
02:29:45,180 --> 02:29:51,600
in our minds what how do you think what did you learn about your own

497
02:29:51,600 --> 02:29:54,080
thinking

498
02:30:05,580 --> 02:30:12,600
when we moved to open awareness so we spent all day right differentiating these parts learning how

499
02:30:12,600 --> 02:30:19,500
to meet each part of our experience and then we learn are invited to sit back

500
02:30:19,500 --> 02:30:25,500
in our easy chair with the one door and the four windows

501
02:30:25,500 --> 02:30:32,460
kind of like the five senses in the body and just let things come up come in come

502
02:30:32,460 --> 02:30:39,899
out flow in flow out and as one thing becomes dominant we're

503
02:30:39,899 --> 02:30:47,420
with it and then it passes away and we're maybe with our anchor until the next thing comes up

504
02:30:47,819 --> 02:30:54,720
foreign less awareness we're not choosing what to be aware of but we're allowing

505
02:30:54,720 --> 02:30:58,460
whatever comes to be known

506
02:31:02,160 --> 02:31:07,560
so the practice is simple really it's natural we're not trying to make

507
02:31:07,560 --> 02:31:13,260
anything happen we're trying to learn more about how things do happen arise

508
02:31:13,260 --> 02:31:19,760
and pass away we're inviting more ease

509
02:31:20,939 --> 02:31:28,560
and we're learning that we can be mindful of any experience that we can meet any experience

510
02:31:28,560 --> 02:31:36,199
it is possible to meet any experience and this is good news

511
02:31:36,540 --> 02:31:41,640
it points to the fact that we can use and be supported by mindfulness in every

512
02:31:41,640 --> 02:31:49,859
aspect of our life on the cushion off the cushion on a retreat daily life

513
02:31:49,859 --> 02:31:56,220
when somebody's screaming at you when you're looking at a car accident at

514
02:31:56,220 --> 02:32:02,960
any moment we can be mindful mindfulness can become a very

515
02:32:02,960 --> 02:32:09,840
trustworthy friend I'm going to end by reading the same

516
02:32:09,840 --> 02:32:15,720
poem I started with it's not mindful it feels like a

517
02:32:15,720 --> 02:32:23,340
homeless person very insecure very unhappy when you are mindful you feel really at

518
02:32:23,340 --> 02:32:28,439
home so mindfulness is my home

519
02:32:28,439 --> 02:32:35,960
when you're mindful you're at home when you're not mindful you are on the road to going nowhere

520
02:32:39,590 --> 02:32:44,540
[Music] so

521
02:32:45,180 --> 02:32:50,700
now we would love to hear your voices we would love to hear how the day has been

522
02:32:50,700 --> 02:32:56,220
for you any of your questions reflections

523
02:32:56,220 --> 02:33:01,560
we battle to you for your practice your endurance

524
02:33:01,560 --> 02:33:08,100

525
02:33:08,100 --> 02:33:13,319
here with you today so we've got the mics

526
02:33:13,319 --> 02:33:19,200

527

will check so who's willing to hold the mic and speak

528
02:33:27,359 --> 02:33:30,021
thank you

529
02:33:34,100 --> 02:33:39,960
this keeps coming up again and again in my practice

530
02:33:39,960 --> 02:33:48,180
I can be mindful and what I consider a good Buddhist for about like all day and

531
02:33:48,180 --> 02:33:54,600
um and and do my meditation and

532
02:33:54,600 --> 02:34:01,859
uh but by at nine o'clock or right before you know like that it's like okay

533
02:34:01,859 --> 02:34:07,319
you've done it and I want to just be human I want that ice cream and I want

534
02:34:07,319 --> 02:34:13,200
more of it I don't want to have to think about oh everybody is worried oh every

535
02:34:13,200 --> 02:34:18,359
bite is great and I don't want to have to I want to I want to think about all

536
02:34:18,359 --> 02:34:26,640
these people in all those situations that I've avoided all day because that's not good intention I have an hour to do

537
02:34:26,640 --> 02:34:34,020
this and I want to go for it and I keep running into that you know I'm exhausted

538
02:34:34,020 --> 02:34:41,640
and I want to just you know just just have that for me

539
02:34:41,640 --> 02:34:48,960
and so I don't know whether I'm capable of extending this practice

540
02:34:48,960 --> 02:34:55,140
24 7. I don't know I really don't know

541
02:34:55,140 --> 02:35:02,460
I don't know would you like one of us to venture a response Noah okay and do you have any

542
02:35:02,460 --> 02:35:06,800
sense of what would be most helpful to hear

543
02:35:10,859 --> 02:35:16,260
I'm not what I am open okay great Cody you want

544
02:35:16,260 --> 02:35:21,720
to give it a go oh sure do you have your mic on I think so okay great am I

545
02:35:21,720 --> 02:35:30,420
audible okay yes um first thank you very much uh for the honesty and the passion and

546
02:35:30,420 --> 02:35:35,819
like the real Flesh and Blood Humanity of your what you shared

547
02:35:35,819 --> 02:35:41,880
uh to speak for to speak from my own perspective Dharma practice

548
02:35:41,880 --> 02:35:47,160
is about real life it sounds it can really sound like

549
02:35:47,160 --> 02:35:52,979
uh we're just dealing in ideals especially when we're talking about instructions

550
02:35:52,979 --> 02:35:58,080
um but the the place that the practice actually happens and what it actually

551
02:35:58,080 --> 02:36:03,540
looks like is it's the messy Humanity messy that's the

552
02:36:03,540 --> 02:36:09,000
term Endearment for me it's not a judging term um

553
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:15,720
and then and then what I what I hear in that last hour

554
02:36:15,720 --> 02:36:21,780
um it sounds like it sounds like actually you're recognizing what's happening

555
02:36:21,780 --> 02:36:27,120
but there's a the tension seems to be what what's happening is at odds with an

556
02:36:27,120 --> 02:36:33,859
idea of um maybe skillful or wholesome conduct

557
02:36:34,020 --> 02:36:39,600
I think to me the the the conditions for an onward leading

558
02:36:39,600 --> 02:36:44,880
practice are already there and that's like clear awareness of okay what's it like now

559
02:36:44,880 --> 02:36:51,780
to be saying to myself I'm setting aside my practice for this hour that you can you kind of still have it

560
02:36:51,780 --> 02:36:58,020
because you're asking yourself okay what is it really for this moment to happen Okay this is craving I'm really going to

561
02:36:58,020 --> 02:37:05,340
dig into this ice cream and I'm going to have it what's that what is that what's that like in here without

562
02:37:05,340 --> 02:37:11,700
um without adding or without a without without the the

563
02:37:11,700 --> 02:37:18,859
evaluation being in the foreground that may still be there too it can just be in the background

564
02:37:18,859 --> 02:37:25,140
that's my that's my first impression I don't know if there's anything you would add I want Kanye to say something

565
02:37:25,140 --> 02:37:30,540
because I think you like ice cream oh okay

566
02:37:30,540 --> 02:37:36,720
um well what I was gonna say um is I love what kodo said I agree

567
02:37:36,720 --> 02:37:43,560
absolutely and I would say I wonder if there are small things in the day many

568
02:37:43,560 --> 02:37:50,880
many small things in the day where you're doing a little bypassing where you're you're shutting off your

569
02:37:50,880 --> 02:37:56,819
process because you think you shouldn't have a reaction and that those little bypasses are

570
02:37:56,819 --> 02:38:02,280
building up it's like it sounds like you know building building and you get to nine

571
02:38:02,280 --> 02:38:07,740
o'clock and it's like okay I can't do anymore I can't breathe anymore and and

572
02:38:07,740 --> 02:38:13,140
so then it's like okay I'm taking the lid off and what would happen what would

573
02:38:13,140 --> 02:38:19,439
it be like if there were little more a little more time lingering when you feel

574
02:38:19,439 --> 02:38:25,319
upset a little more time when

575
02:38:25,319 --> 02:38:32,220
um you know with most likely the things that aren't

576
02:38:32,220 --> 02:38:39,060
so pleasant the thoughts the feelings the exchanges

577
02:38:39,060 --> 02:38:47,700
appetite yeah so maybe you're also you're using your

578
02:38:47,700 --> 02:38:54,660
reservoir of willpower up you know if you're trying to resist

579
02:38:54,660 --> 02:39:00,600
eating craving whatever it is the appetite for food or other things

580
02:39:00,600 --> 02:39:09,680
you're repressing that you know you may be getting you're doing too much of it

581
02:39:10,020 --> 02:39:15,240
and so it doesn't mean we have to give into a

582
02:39:15,240 --> 02:39:21,060
craving necessarily for ice cream or alcohol or whatever it is

583
02:39:21,060 --> 02:39:26,220
but we might need to be figuring out how to um

584
02:39:26,220 --> 02:39:31,398
we fuel ourselves along the way

585
02:39:31,439 --> 02:39:38,280
there's a book by Kelly McGonagall called will power Instinct she's a yoga teacher mindfulness practitioner she was

586
02:39:38,280 --> 02:39:44,160
a professor at Stanford she talks a lot about the willpower

587
02:39:44,160 --> 02:39:49,979
um that you know we have we only have so much we can't just keep saying no all

588
02:39:49,979 --> 02:39:56,220
the time right so there's two parts there's the saying no restraint but then

589
02:39:56,220 --> 02:40:04,080
there's also processing the emotions and the feelings and the thoughts that don't get addressed because of what's going on

590
02:40:04,080 --> 02:40:09,720
so both both pieces not totally bypassing the little bits that maybe add

591
02:40:09,720 --> 02:40:17,399
up and and then also looking at how much you're having to work to say no to things and how can you make that easier

592
02:40:17,399 --> 02:40:22,620
for yourself so what do you think Noel

593
02:40:22,620 --> 02:40:28,760
I thank you both thank you

594
02:40:30,660 --> 02:40:37,920
for I feel like my question has been honored great I definitely honor and bow to your

595
02:40:37,920 --> 02:40:40,220
question

596
02:40:51,120 --> 02:40:55,460
who else would like to say something

597
02:40:59,939 --> 02:41:05,720
Joe would you like to talk about anything about the day

598
02:41:06,359 --> 02:41:11,479
right here Joanne right here okay

599
02:41:11,520 --> 02:41:16,680
okay hi is this Omnia Okay so

600
02:41:16,680 --> 02:41:23,720
this way towards you like yeah yeah it's all ready

601
02:41:29,180 --> 02:41:36,720
okay yeah yeah okay so so this was my first

602
02:41:36,720 --> 02:41:44,840
retreat the first hour that was the longest meditation I had ever done

603
02:41:45,420 --> 02:41:51,000
I'm surprised I lasted the day

604
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:57,140
but I'm I had an inkling I would hmm

605
02:41:57,180 --> 02:42:03,180
things came up for me that

606
02:42:04,620 --> 02:42:11,220
like I bought the next I was expecting other things to come up for me and it didn't but what I was

607
02:42:11,220 --> 02:42:16,439
working on instead of I was probably in

608
02:42:16,439 --> 02:42:22,020
anticipation of what was coming up so I was controlling it to a degree

609
02:42:22,020 --> 02:42:27,359
but I also resonated with the story the

610
02:42:27,359 --> 02:42:32,399
storyline running through our minds

611
02:42:32,399 --> 02:42:40,140
so that made me more aware and also this leaflet

612
02:42:40,140 --> 02:42:45,240
like on the covering page it's either you have a wholesome mind or

613
02:42:45,240 --> 02:42:50,580
non-wholesome mind and that was a really simple distinction for me

614
02:42:50,580 --> 02:42:55,979
because I like to be happy I like to be joyful so it's like okay well let's

615
02:42:55,979 --> 02:43:01,140
focus on that but I should still be mindful of when

616
02:43:01,140 --> 02:43:10,260
the sad things come up and that I can still process them but they just Fleet in they squeal oh squirrel cat dog

617
02:43:10,260 --> 02:43:17,700
and the other thing that was coming up it's like sometimes how to process things

618
02:43:17,700 --> 02:43:22,740
yeah so if you keep looking at things like cat dog

619
02:43:22,740 --> 02:43:29,780
squirrel are you really closing things out because they tend to go with the thought

620
02:43:29,780 --> 02:43:35,520
to reach a conclusion so then I feel like I've processed the

621
02:43:35,520 --> 02:43:41,358
thought so a couple of those instances came up

622
02:43:41,819 --> 02:43:47,580
okay that was wonderful to hear Joanne and

623
02:43:47,580 --> 02:43:55,200
I'm really grateful you hung in there with us today do you um do you have any want any

624
02:43:55,200 --> 02:44:02,819
response or a question in there you just sounded great you sounded aware I don't know if there was anything in there that you want a response

625
02:44:02,819 --> 02:44:09,180
I suppose the question about processing you know when events happened to us or

626
02:44:09,180 --> 02:44:16,380
around us like the leaf blower and when the Deep blower came I was

627
02:44:16,380 --> 02:44:21,979
telling some of people here at lunch I wanted to run out

628
02:44:21,979 --> 02:44:28,500
and tell him to switch it up then I wanted to run out and tell him they were going to be banned next year so we

629
02:44:28,500 --> 02:44:33,660
wouldn't be able to do it and then I wanted to run out and have compassion

630
02:44:33,660 --> 02:44:39,060
for the person blowing it he wasn't wearing a mask because of all that dust

631
02:44:39,060 --> 02:44:44,100
that was going into his lungs or through lungs I should say

632
02:44:44,100 --> 02:44:49,140
and then I was just watching my thoughts go but yeah I suppose the question about

633
02:44:49,140 --> 02:44:57,660
processing and sometimes we get carried away on our thoughts to find the root of what's

634
02:44:57,660 --> 02:45:03,960
bugging us so or sometimes I'll just put it in my mind and look like literally I

635
02:45:03,960 --> 02:45:11,819
have like all these little locks in my mind and it's gone behind the lock and I close it but sometimes it'll pop up to

636
02:45:11,819 --> 02:45:20,000
be processed again so what's happening there no you

637
02:45:21,380 --> 02:45:27,979
well since I didn't get to say thank you for hanging in there today first

638
02:45:28,140 --> 02:45:33,240
how wonderful taking a moment with that

639
02:45:33,240 --> 02:45:38,640
in terms of processing such a valuable way to get to know ourselves

640
02:45:38,640 --> 02:45:44,340
to to be with thoughts to their conclusion I think that's one of the reasons that a journaling practice is so

641
02:45:44,340 --> 02:45:51,720
powerful you know um one of the

642
02:45:51,720 --> 02:45:58,020
I think one of the that's one of the reasons that I keep a journaling practice sort of in as an adjunct to

643
02:45:58,020 --> 02:46:04,260
what I do in meditation because they process in different ways uh I'm going to borrow the term process

644
02:46:04,260 --> 02:46:09,800
and apply it to meditation to my mind and to my experience

645
02:46:09,800 --> 02:46:15,359
the the activity of knowing seeing sensing through the body

646
02:46:15,359 --> 02:46:22,200
processes just in a different non-discursive way it's like things get maybe instead of

647
02:46:22,200 --> 02:46:27,660
processing they get metabolized or they get digested um

648
02:46:27,660 --> 02:46:36,140
as as we heard today the body is like a storehouse of memory and often our thinking will be

649
02:46:36,140 --> 02:46:44,300
cued by processes that are happening in the body it may or may not be aware of as we were talking about earlier so

650
02:46:44,700 --> 02:46:50,040
as far from the perspective of mindfulness practice one of the routes to take

651
02:46:50,040 --> 02:46:55,620
is to sink down into the body again you can let the thought go on back there I

652
02:46:55,620 --> 02:47:02,520
keep doing this as if it's somewhere in space not not deliberately pick it up just for

653
02:47:02,520 --> 02:47:07,680
the the time span of meditation if it's important then you can pick it up after

654
02:47:07,680 --> 02:47:15,840
and then go into the body and all the sort of like cascading Sensations and changes and the combination of that

655
02:47:15,840 --> 02:47:24,020
with clear knowing it's like it metabolizes and digests just in a different way

656
02:47:26,100 --> 02:47:33,240
anything to add that was lovely um I guess the only thing I would add it's

657
02:47:33,240 --> 02:47:38,340
a small thing but that sometimes by um

658
02:47:38,340 --> 02:47:43,979
maybe if you imagine that the raft practice when you're sitting with all

659
02:47:43,979 --> 02:47:51,960
these different pieces um if you can just sit there and watch what happens you'll notice patterns

660
02:47:51,960 --> 02:47:57,479
and if you can if our normal pattern is to go with the first thing that comes up

661
02:47:57,479 --> 02:48:04,260
we miss that there's other things connected or other things to see as well

662
02:48:04,260 --> 02:48:09,540
so that's a reason to process in this

663
02:48:09,540 --> 02:48:15,300
slightly different way is it may it may just reveal some other things that that

664
02:48:15,300 --> 02:48:21,680
we weren't so aware of if that makes sense foreign

665
02:48:29,340 --> 02:48:35,700
great two questions

666
02:48:35,700 --> 02:48:41,220
can you hold it like this and a little closer Yeah question number one is

667
02:48:41,220 --> 02:48:46,920
um like today was a longer seat so you you know when you get out of it

668
02:48:46,920 --> 02:48:53,580
you have that peace the serenity which lasts for maybe few hours

669
02:48:53,580 --> 02:48:59,160
he do a longer retreat maybe say four or five days you take the peace and

670
02:48:59,160 --> 02:49:06,300
serenity the ability to be I would not call equanimous but at least you know Center may be the world where

671
02:49:06,300 --> 02:49:11,460
you don't get so hindered or you know perturbed by what's going around you it

672
02:49:11,460 --> 02:49:16,740
it's it's just wonderful to see that you know after the retreat if you have done

673
02:49:16,740 --> 02:49:22,680
a normal Retreat it lasts a little longer let's say you know the four or six day Retreat will last

674
02:49:22,680 --> 02:49:29,340
two days and then when you it's it's like you know you're living two lives of sorts

675
02:49:29,340 --> 02:49:35,240
when the effect kind of weighs down then you know your old

676
02:49:35,240 --> 02:49:42,120
conditioning or whatever you call it it kind of clashes or you know your own it

677
02:49:42,120 --> 02:49:50,460
kind of comes back you know you see it because you're enough mindful to see it the idea is one question to it

678
02:49:50,460 --> 02:49:56,220
is does this require you know prolonged degrees of hours and hours of meditation

679
02:49:56,220 --> 02:50:03,000
to kind of make it your own as if not that peace doesn't kind of have this

680
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:10,500
running away kind of phase the part two of the question is occasionally this

681
02:50:10,500 --> 02:50:19,020
happens very occasionally it probably with me it happens with a little bit of try to kind of you know unhook the idea

682
02:50:19,020 --> 02:50:26,399
of self it happens only when it's deep deep inside and you know the mind is

683
02:50:26,399 --> 02:50:33,359
kind of a little rare I don't know if that's the way to say it it's kind of a little thing and that's when you get it

684
02:50:33,359 --> 02:50:41,939
when it if you get it there is a sense of fear and you kind of go into it and

685
02:50:41,939 --> 02:50:47,220
then you try to hold on to it but I think somewhere either the Mind comes in

686
02:50:47,220 --> 02:50:52,740
or the fear comes in is is a is this

687
02:50:52,740 --> 02:50:58,439
heard of or is this normal or is this something that people experience because

688
02:50:58,439 --> 02:51:04,500
you know it's hard to talk about this to a regular person

689
02:51:04,500 --> 02:51:12,899
two is um what is the way if to kind of you know hone it because hey I assume that's

690
02:51:12,899 --> 02:51:18,660
where you want to be some point in your practice wherever at

691
02:51:18,660 --> 02:51:25,020
least during the practice if you can hone it I think bringing it to you know walking talking in the world might be a

692
02:51:25,020 --> 02:51:30,960
little hard but at least for that you know half an hour of practice to hold it

693
02:51:30,960 --> 02:51:35,640
a little longer but

694
02:51:38,160 --> 02:51:44,000
you might want to hold on the mic just for to see if uh okay

695
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:50,460
yeah yeah let's let's both yeah yeah so the first part of your question

696
02:51:50,460 --> 02:51:59,460
um you know was about the the how long the more calm or Equanimity lasts

697
02:51:59,460 --> 02:52:07,040
and um and I would say that um

698
02:52:08,040 --> 02:52:15,120
foreign with devoted practice practice happens

699
02:52:15,120 --> 02:52:20,520
all the time right so there's a way in which

700
02:52:20,520 --> 02:52:28,020
um you know given a normal day practicing as you're going through life staying

701
02:52:28,020 --> 02:52:33,120
aware that that peace that ease that balance

702
02:52:33,120 --> 02:52:39,300
stays with you as you move and then there's going to be times maybe where

703
02:52:39,300 --> 02:52:45,899
it's a little bigger there's too much and things build up I mean part of what

704
02:52:45,899 --> 02:52:55,140
happens in meditation is we let things move through that are getting backed up and I think that's part of what um

705
02:52:55,140 --> 02:53:00,600
inhibits our our ability to stay equanimous

706
02:53:01,020 --> 02:53:08,819
so that's part one of the question does that feel like an answer to part one a response great yes

707
02:53:08,819 --> 02:53:15,620
to let go and try and let go be aware enough to let go yeah but that's also

708
02:53:15,620 --> 02:53:21,479
you know this idea of the riverbed you know sometimes we can be a big river and

709
02:53:21,479 --> 02:53:29,340
a lot can flow through and it can move and it is it's just gone but sometimes it's it's either too much for us no

710
02:53:29,340 --> 02:53:36,600
matter how big we are or we're just not that capable in the moment so we have and

711
02:53:36,600 --> 02:53:42,479
that's going to change it's a fluid thing how much we can let move through us and

712
02:53:42,479 --> 02:53:49,260
so it's noticing the residual and maybe sometimes we have to practice more and sometimes less you know depends on

713
02:53:49,260 --> 02:53:56,700
what's Happening yeah okay do you want to take part two sure sure

714
02:53:56,700 --> 02:54:03,420
great question um thank you for the question and I I'm related I I believe that they're related

715
02:54:03,420 --> 02:54:09,779
I do too these are these two questions uh I want to start by saying at the at

716
02:54:09,779 --> 02:54:15,180
the end of a very long retreat I asked the teacher in a practice

717
02:54:15,180 --> 02:54:21,000
discussion um do I have to go back because

718
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:26,399
I don't want all of the all of the distress to come

719
02:54:26,399 --> 02:54:32,160
back the um the the states where we're just so

720
02:54:32,160 --> 02:54:37,920
nourishing and so beautiful and he said to me

721
02:54:37,920 --> 02:54:45,200
anything that you can regard as a state will pass away

722
02:54:45,720 --> 02:54:52,080
but you may see something as as those glacios are rearizing

723
02:54:52,080 --> 02:55:00,420
you may see what an important period of practice this is how do I pick them up how do I pick up

724
02:55:00,420 --> 02:55:07,319
my habits of mind and appropriate appropriate them as mine

725
02:55:07,319 --> 02:55:12,479
what are the processes by which I fabricate a cell

726
02:55:12,479 --> 02:55:18,060
and that's where the the second part of the question comes in and I picked up there was a word you

727
02:55:18,060 --> 02:55:23,760
used that was like sinning thinning sinning

728
02:55:23,760 --> 02:55:28,800
um I think you described the mind as very thin so it's easy for the sense of self

729
02:55:28,800 --> 02:55:35,880
to not arise so true and the

730
02:55:35,880 --> 02:55:41,520
just to directly directly address one of the questions you had about that is is

731
02:55:41,520 --> 02:55:47,340
the the sort of fear normal and yes that's that's part of the

732
02:55:47,340 --> 02:55:54,620
process I feel like that that deserves many minutes so I'm sorry to have to be brief about that

733
02:55:54,779 --> 02:56:00,660
the part about thinning is not only does the Mind become thin

734
02:56:00,660 --> 02:56:09,180
but the the influence of greed and hatred and delusion

735
02:56:09,180 --> 02:56:15,779
and sense desire gets very very feminine and then in our daily life in the way

736
02:56:15,779 --> 02:56:21,840
that Tanya was saying it's like things don't move through quite as much so those those two get thicker it's like

737
02:56:21,840 --> 02:56:29,460
they get thicker our self gets thicker and our one of the ways I see the training is

738
02:56:29,460 --> 02:56:36,840
that when we're off the cushion looking for the keeping an eye out for

739
02:56:36,840 --> 02:56:42,000
and watching the processes for of grieve hatred and delusion and

740
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:48,240
how they're like how they're operating in our daily life like I said are there ways that I'm showing up in my daily life that are

741
02:56:48,240 --> 02:56:53,720
thickening those and thereby thickening a sense of self

742
02:56:54,540 --> 02:56:59,600
there's a lot of ground to cover in what you said so I think maybe we'll start there

743
02:56:59,600 --> 02:57:03,020
thank you so much

744
02:57:05,580 --> 02:57:12,960
it's 4 28. we did great 428 is great 428 is great and um I'm sorry if anyone

745
02:57:12,960 --> 02:57:18,660
wanted to say something more and they didn't get to because it was delightful

746
02:57:18,660 --> 02:57:25,439
to hear and um to be with you so just the briefest of

747
02:57:25,439 --> 02:57:31,620
meta practice and then Sally is here to help with cleanup so

748
02:57:31,620 --> 02:57:37,920
um it takes about 15 minutes to tidy the Sangha so if you're all willing or able

749
02:57:37,920 --> 02:57:44,880
to stay after many hands make light work and Sally's a master at making it all

750
02:57:44,880 --> 02:57:51,899
dance so um all right back in the body

751
02:57:51,899 --> 02:57:59,960
taking a breath bringing in just maybe the spirit of good will

752
02:58:00,960 --> 02:58:08,300
the spirit of Sangha the teachings

753
02:58:08,819 --> 02:58:15,840
the generosity what a gift that we are in the space

754
02:58:15,840 --> 02:58:22,800
that actually comes from Donna people gave money to create this space to make it possible

755
02:58:22,800 --> 02:58:31,399
for us to be here may all beings be so blessed

756
02:58:32,279 --> 02:58:39,438
may all beings everywhere be safe and protected from inner and outer harm

757
02:58:40,260 --> 02:58:45,420
may all beings ourselves included everyone included

758
02:58:45,420 --> 02:58:51,359
be happy healthy and at ease

759
02:58:51,359 --> 02:58:58,100
and may the benefit of our practice be for the benefit of all

760
02:58:59,220 --> 02:59:13,238
