1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,879
so hello everyone welcome

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:17,359
and i read recently that the buddha

3
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,960
likened the eightfold path to a guest house

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,080
a guesthouse that all people were invited to come

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,880
and rest in the house but the nature of the guesthouse as a faithful path is that somehow

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,879
it um brought out the best in people

7
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:46,079
brought out the best in the person that was wholesome

8
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,079
so here we sit and when we meditate we are

9
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,280
a guest house where we invite everything

10
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:06,320
not so much to invite everything but we are a guest house that

11
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,360
welcomes everything that comes we don't go looking for things but if it

12
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,119
comes we welcome it here and there's something about

13
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,960
that welcome that ability to be mindful in an open generous way

14
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:29,200
without being for or against anything inviting all people all

15
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:36,159
states of mind all experiences that transforms

16
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,479
us into the best of ourselves and come forth

17
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:48,000
so the beginning of that is this ability to

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,920
receive equanimously openly a certain kind of impartiality or

19
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,640
all that all our experience and this ability to know to be aware to

20
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:10,319
be receptive without being for against without judging without closing the door

21
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:16,000
is transformative it brings out the best in us eventually

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,360
not immediately so taking a comfortable

23
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,680
alert posture and

24
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:35,640
lowering your gaze relaxing your gaze

25
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:43,160
and if it's comfortable gently closing your eyelids

26
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,879
and then lower yourself into your body

27
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:02,720
feel that the three-dimensional body that you are

28
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,440
the fullness the global body sitting here

29
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,040
your legs your torso your arms your

30
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,000
head make room for it to relax

31
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,959
to settle in

32
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:36,080
the more the tension in the body the more the less we are an open

33
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,080
welcoming guest house the more we operate from our

34
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,840
our preferences and our fears and our desires and our aversions

35
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,360
the more relaxed we are the more we become a guest house for all

36
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,840
things

37
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,239
and to help that process in a leisurely way like you have all the

38
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,360
time in the world breathe as deeply as is comfortable for

39
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,360
you

40
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:29,840
breathe deep breathe in deeply in the top of the in-breath hold the breath for a moment

41
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:37,320
just long enough that you feel the gentle urge to exhale

42
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,919
and give in to that urge to exhale

43
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:59,040
breathe in deeply exhale fully at the end of the exhale

44
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,160
pause for a moment a fraction of a moment

45
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,800
until you feel the body's urge to inhale and when you do

46
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,840
allow for that to happen

47
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:41,120
breathing in breathing out and as you exhale relax the body more

48
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:57,039
relaxation together with alertness with clarity of

49
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:02,599
attention is profound

50
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:16,639
and letting your breathing return to normal on the exhale

51
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,160
relax the muscles of the face

52
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,639
the forehead

53
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:35,840
around the eyes temple

54
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,440
the nose and the cheek

55
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,800
the jaws and the lips

56
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,840
as you exhale relax the shoulders

57
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,520
the area around the shoulder blades

58
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,879
and also soften the belly

59
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,560
and then instead of inviting

60
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,759
the body breathing inviting it to awareness

61
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:23,680
welcome it when it comes when the inhale comes

62
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:30,160
a simple welcoming awareness a guest house that receives the

63
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,800
experience

64
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:41,440
as if it comes out in from the cold or from being away

65
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,159
welcome it into the guest house of awareness

66
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:54,000
without any prejudice or judgments about what's there

67
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,600
and the exhale when it occurs welcome it allow it to

68
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,240
exhale

69
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:11,279
and if anything takes you away from breathing even if it's thinking

70
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:18,800
don't invite it but when it occurs have a welcoming attitude towards it

71
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,160
not to indulge in it but so it feels safe and

72
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:32,120
there's space and awareness awareness is the guest house

73
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,200
that receives everything equally

74
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,839
allowing each thing to be itself

75
00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:02,399
and perhaps you'll see as you do that it's a simple welcoming awareness

76
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,920
that the best in you begins to

77
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,320
peek through

78
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,320
in the guest house everything is welcomed

79
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,200
and left alone

80
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:37,240
to find its own way to where it can rest

81
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,920
you

82
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:07,200
and near the end of the sitting can you be the keeper of the guest house

83
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:13,200
everything is welcomed not so that you engage in it or do

84
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:20,400
anything with it but so you don't judge it or need it to be different

85
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:26,640
but clearly recognize what's here in the guest house

86
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:32,960
allow it to rest to rest house for travelers

87
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:38,440
welcome and allow them to take their rest

88
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,600
and as we come to the end of the sitting

89
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:29,679
is there anything that the metaphor of the guest house being a guest house that is open to all

90
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:36,960
things that come welcoming but also doesn't

91
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:43,679
interfere with people's business allows all beings to come and rest and

92
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:52,399
be themselves without judgments without wanting something from them

93
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:03,600
and can you become a guest house for the people you encounter today

94
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:10,880
or the experiences you have or those you communicate with

95
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:18,559
they don't have to know that you're a guest house but in your heart you welcome them as

96
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:25,200
they are so they can maybe have a little experience

97
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:31,039
of being respected as they are allowed to be as they are

98
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:38,480
where they don't have to be worried about your judgments your needs your desires

99
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:44,399
your aversions that first and foremost you're there to

100
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:50,159
welcome them in your guest house of your

101
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:58,080
presence your awareness and may it be on this day

102
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,919
that your ability to hold all beings in your heart

103
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:12,159
with your heart as a guest house that you support others to feel happier

104
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:20,398
you support others to feel safe you support others to be peaceful

105
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,880
and you support others to be free

106
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:32,720
may we contribute to the happiness safety

107
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:39,600
peace peace and freedom of all beings everywhere

108
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:45,200
may all beings be happy and safe and peaceful

109
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,440
and free

110
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,919
so

111
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,819
[Music]

112
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,360
um

113
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,360
so

114
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,799
we continue today in the talks about mindfulness of mind also could be called

115
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:40,240
mindfulness of attitude or in the purity of it the mindfulness

116
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:46,000
of recognition and that's the theme for this from tuesdays

117
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,520
is recognition and recognition is a

118
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:57,440
powerful factor if it can be simple

119
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:03,200
if we can simplify our recognition of all the baggage all

120
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:09,600
the associations that it comes along with it so for example if you

121
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:16,399
maybe look around wherever you are sitting and can you find something to look at

122
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:23,679
where you can recognize what it is but that it's very neutral this doesn't evoke any

123
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:30,640
ideas of for and against i want that i don't want that it's just there in a simple very very

124
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:37,679
simple way and um so for my eyes now are landing on from the far

125
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:43,279
wall there's an electrical cord to a clock and i see the electrical cord and

126
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:49,120
it's just there i don't have any reactivity to it or preference around it or

127
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:55,840
for against it it's just there and then if i look turn my eyes up now

128
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:01,840
and look at something that i find that i like there's a statue of buddha statue

129
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:07,919
on the other house near near the electrical wire and now i find that there's a kind of a

130
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:13,200
liking and wondering and engagement with it where that's not more

131
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:20,320
not just recognizing it but now there's appreciating remembering history where it came from who gave it to us all

132
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:26,960
kinds of things and then i look down and there's some

133
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:34,320
tape on the floor here at imc and i have a little bit of a

134
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,919
issue about the tape on the floor because it's a long

135
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,919
piece of tape to mark a spot on the floor but it's crooked it wasn't laid down straight

136
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:51,039
and so i thought oh i should should i change it and can i use the same tape do i have to

137
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:57,840
throw it away and so suddenly my involvement is much more much more complicated

138
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:03,679
and i look at the electrical wire again and it's just very simple just a wire

139
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:09,840
so if you could look around in your space and you could see the different ways that you can recognize something

140
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:15,279
there how simple can it be just recognizing it and how much is it are coming with

141
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:21,840
preferences coming with judgments coming with for and against

142
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:29,360
coming with commentary it's in meditation in other times

143
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:36,240
the movement is towards becoming cleaner and cleaner simpler and simpler with recognition

144
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:43,360
so that we can see things as they are not as we want them or not through the

145
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:48,640
lens of what we don't want there simply there is a time there is a place

146
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:55,279
for preferences for desires for things we don't want there's definitely a time and place for that this is not doing

147
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:01,279
away with that forever but it's there's also a time and place to

148
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:07,158
learn the art a very simple recognition

149
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:13,280
and um and so simple that we're not it's not this recognition is

150
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:20,878
not distracted by our desires and our thoughts our commentary it just we recognize so simple just

151
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:26,878
there there's an in-breath it's just an in-breath and um

152
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:36,398
the uh it you know so simple that the in-breath has doesn't isn't tied to connected to

153
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:41,760
notions of time oh if i need to get concentrated i need

154
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,839
to stay here so that in the future i can be concerned so that i

155
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:53,520
don't so so that i'm present for the next exhale which is coming in the future

156
00:34:53,520 --> 00:35:00,880
uh i lost it i lost my attention to the breath a few minutes ago a moment ago a few breaths ago

157
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:07,200
i can't have that happen again i have to kind of be able to stay with the breath

158
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:13,200
all those ideas are complicating the simple act of recognition

159
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:18,960
for this moment i'm able to recognize this inhale

160
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:24,160
as if there's no before and no after it's that simple

161
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:29,920
and if you mind wonders off in between and at some point you come

162
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:35,599
back to the next inhale the past is gone

163
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:40,640
just this inhale just that recognition and um

164
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:47,200
and at some point as the simplicity of recognition is there just this breath this step

165
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,240
this chewing my food this sitting in a chair

166
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:57,680
this walking down a hallway in the simplest possible way

167
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:05,200
then at some point what we recognize is recognition itself

168
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:11,119
we recognize that recognition as we're recognizing

169
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:16,400
we see that recognition is simple we see that recognition is free

170
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:22,000
of associations commentary preferences desires

171
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:29,680
and and then wow there's this thing called recognition there's this thing this experience this movement of recognition

172
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,880
of knowing of being aware and it becomes its own kind of object of

173
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:41,040
awareness and it starts being kind of special wow

174
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:46,240
there's this clarity there's this openness it's kind of like awareness now becomes

175
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:52,079
a guest house that all travelers are welcome to come into the

176
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:58,320
guest house but the guest housekeeper is very gracious and allows each people

177
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:03,680
everything to have its room and so it can rest

178
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:09,119
so it can be left alone so be accepted as it is nothing's needed

179
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:14,320
no judgments no nothing so this idea of recognizing recognition

180
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:21,680
aware of awareness knowing that we're knowing can seem like a hard thing to do

181
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:27,440
challenging you know and even nonsensical to some people but

182
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:33,680
one of the ways we come to that is that we begin recognizing

183
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:39,200
as a guest keeper welcome we started recognizing that

184
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,480
we are seldom aware simply

185
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:51,760
there's all kinds of things we bring along with the recognition we recognize something and we recognize

186
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:57,760
that we don't like it we do like it we want it to be a little bit different it should be sitting over there not

187
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:04,480
there can i have that we go into a room of people

188
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,839
and we start recognizing what's there but it's not just simple recognition

189
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:16,000
is who is it nice to sit next to who should i not sit right next to is it safe here where is the

190
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,640
where's the the good snacks and i think i'll you know that's what i want

191
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:30,160
and so there's all these preferences and agendas going on that and our awareness our recognition is

192
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:36,160
being used by our agenda it's being driven by it

193
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:42,079
now of course this is normal and healthy to do that in many circumstances it has to be that way

194
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:48,720
but the meditation practice and mindfulness one of the potential it has

195
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:54,960
is to start recognizing how we complicate or engage

196
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:00,800
awareness use awareness in the service of our agendas our preferences

197
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:06,560
and sometimes it's wise choices we make what we pay attention to when we're driving pay attention to the

198
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:12,000
road but sometimes our attention is hijacked

199
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,520
by things that we don't really if you thought about it you would say i don't want to do that

200
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:22,800
um focus on that again i've i've had the same complaint about

201
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,480
my neighbor down the street now it's probably a thousand times i've had that thought

202
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:36,000
and i feel lousy after i have it doesn't feel good to have it and it kind of hijacks my attention

203
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,760
and whenever i drive down the street and see that neighbor or see that house

204
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,880
you know i get contracted my attention i feel my awareness looking and i pull

205
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,720
away from the house so all kinds of ways we see how awareness

206
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:58,160
is being used and hijacked and influenced

207
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:05,680
as it's being used when we do that in mindfulness meditation sitting in meditation

208
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:10,800
welcome it all don't add judgment on top of judgments

209
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:18,000
but there's an r to welcoming it allowing it to be there which is paradoxically

210
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:24,560
a movement towards simplicity of recognition when we're not for or against things

211
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:31,280
then it can just be itself and there's room for us to recognize it as it actually is

212
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:36,480
and then as i've said this a kind of very special time comes

213
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,720
when we start recognizing recognition itself in and of itself

214
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:48,319
that recognition is this jewel is this amazing capacity

215
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:54,560
and this ability to recognize or to be aware or to know depending on

216
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:59,760
how that attentional faculty is showing itself at any given time

217
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:06,160
can become its own strong presence its own strong kind of entity not or i don't know what

218
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:11,599
the right language is to don't uh feeling of strength its own

219
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:17,599
territory it's it feels like a guest house feels like it has a room for things

220
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:23,440
and it's okay for things to arise and you know the idea of welcoming is

221
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:30,000
too much i just allow them to be there why do this

222
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,599
it seems like maybe then you're just victims of the circumstances things come and happen

223
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:42,960
because when we can keep our attention very simple just recognize

224
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,000
just recognize the thing that's happening including just recognizing how

225
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:54,160
we complicate recognition how i have desires and aversions we just keep doing the simple

226
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:59,280
recognition being the guest house allowing it to be there

227
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,560
then the best in us begins to come forth that which needs to rest that which

228
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:13,040
needs to relax that's which has a chance to relax it's not being fed it's not being egged on or encouraged on

229
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:18,800
and as in in this as as the simplicity of recognition if awareness starts

230
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:25,440
happening then um it's almost like there's space then for us to hear ourselves

231
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:31,839
there's space to know ourselves in a deeper way there's space to start recognizing

232
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:36,880
that there is goodness here there is wholesomeness here there is

233
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:43,520
space begins to be cracks in our in our in our in our crack center

234
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:51,839
maybe our hearts so that we can see where there's kindness and love and care generosity

235
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:58,079
goodness that resides the simplicity of recognition the

236
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:05,680
simplicity of awareness is a key to recognizing our own inner beauty

237
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:11,280
because we just welcome all the inner ugliness it's okay come

238
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:18,480
i'm a guest house for all of you and it's in the guest house in the space it makes in the allowing

239
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:24,000
that there is this welcome this generosity this goodness

240
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,599
that allows something to settle and relax and i suspect you'll be surprised by how

241
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:37,440
much goodness exists within you through this simple act of recognition

242
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:44,000
so all along in mindfulness practice we're practicing recognition of the breath of the body of emotions of

243
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,200
thoughts and everything i've been teaching before still applies

244
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:54,720
but at some point as we continue this practice at some point

245
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:02,000
it's appropriate to start recognizing recognition itself and recognizing that the way we are

246
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:08,079
aware of breath body emotions and thoughts is not

247
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:13,680
neutral it's not welcome it there's an agenda there's

248
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:20,319
complications we bring to it and so this turning around and being mindful of the mind mindfulness of

249
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:26,560
awareness of attitude is begins to free awareness from all

250
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:33,680
this extra baggage all this extra stuff that we add to it and

251
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:39,280
and goodness has a chance to grow

252
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,839
so thank you and uh may um

253
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:52,319
may you did for this day may you practice being a guest house

254
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:57,520
for all things that come along and maybe look for you know remind

255
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:04,800
yourself look particular appropriate places where try being receptive and welcoming

256
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:10,480
instead of maybe the usual habits of mind of how to be with things

257
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:18,039
so thank you very much

258
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,560
you
