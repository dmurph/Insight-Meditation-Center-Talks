1
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:23,199
so welcome to our meditation session together and

2
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:29,760
and uh as i sit here reflecting on all of you

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,360
coming here and um and

4
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:42,320
thinking about um just all of us gathering i am aware

5
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:49,200
there's a gathering of our physical bodies we bring our bodies when we meditate

6
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,520
uh the our physical bodies are kind of the vehicle the important

7
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,440
vehicle for meditation practice and while you know it might be silly to say

8
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,680
there is no meditation without the body and to

9
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:17,840
care for this body to connect to this body to have the body at the center is uh

10
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,600
so important sometimes there's a tendency for many people to live in their minds and

11
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:31,680
their thoughts and their ideas and and it can create quite a

12
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:39,680
divide between the body and the mind the body is forgotten disconnected with and

13
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:47,680
we can kind of kind of nominally be aware that we have a body but to awaken in the body

14
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:56,079
to discover the body being more alive is is one of the great benefits and

15
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:04,240
possibilities of mindfulness practice so here we are with our bodies

16
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:11,840
as our bodies so being our bodies

17
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:20,720
following the lead of our body in establishing a posture that feels

18
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:29,040
appropriate that feels beneficial for being

19
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:37,840
centered and at ease if we can in this body

20
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:47,040
but not only at ease a posture that also allows the body to become more awake

21
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:56,480
more alive and to explore through the body

22
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:08,800
what it's like to live in this body to feel your sensations of body

23
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:19,440
and as a way of entering more deeply into this body

24
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,200
sometimes body is difficult place to be there can be pain and challenges of all

25
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:33,120
kinds but still to enter into it you might take a few long

26
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,560
slow deep breaths

27
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:47,840
where the torso is stretched expanded in the end of in-breaths

28
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:56,480
where the in-breaths begin deep in the body and there's an expansion outwards

29
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,840
and long relaxed exhale

30
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:14,080
where there's a coming together pulling in settling of this body

31
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:21,519
as you take these deeper breaths to quiet your thinking mind

32
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,520
notice how if you're thinking a lot about things even about the exercise

33
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:35,759
maybe there's a way it removes you a bit from feeling and sensing the body from the

34
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:48,960
inside and then letting the body feeling the breathing return to normal

35
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:58,720
and take a few moments to feel the simplicity of the body breathing

36
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:06,000
and even if you are still directing your breath unconsciously or unintentionally it's

37
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,520
okay just quietly familiarize yourself

38
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:25,840
to the body breathing

39
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:55,039
and then bring your attention to the top of your head the crown of the

40
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:01,840
head and as you exhale feeling the sensations

41
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:09,280
there soften relax the top of your head and

42
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:21,840
that kind of relaxing that is further settling into your body

43
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:34,000
and as if it's if there's a refreshing flow of water flowing from the top of

44
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,919
your head over your body out through your your through your head

45
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:48,720
let your attention settle and flow down to your head your face

46
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,360
and as you exhale to relax the head the face

47
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:03,840
the eyes

48
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,240
letting the flow of awareness down to your neck

49
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:17,840
the back of your neck

50
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,599
sides of your neck the front

51
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:31,840
as you exhale to relax and settle

52
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,319
the flow of attention down into your shoulders

53
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,520
allowing yourself to feel very simply any tension or holding in your shoulders not to make it

54
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:55,199
a problem but something to care about lovingly

55
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:05,120
and as you exhale whatever way you can soften and relax your shoulders

56
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,840
soften the shoulders

57
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:29,680
and the flow of awareness down into your chest ribcage front and back

58
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:41,839
and on the exhale settle further relax into your body into your torso

59
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:55,839
in the whole area of your solar plexus your diaphragm

60
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:09,839
relax soften

61
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:23,839
and then the belly soften the belly

62
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:37,120
as you exhale relax the smaller the back

63
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,560
relax the weight of your torso down into the pelvic cavity

64
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:51,839
all the way down to your sitting bones

65
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:08,640
and then to feel your legs the upper legs the thighs

66
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,399
softening relaxing any holding they might be there

67
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,160
tightening the flow of attention down into the

68
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:33,839
lower legs and feet and similarly relaxing softening

69
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:49,120
any ways that you might be holding and tighten the arms and the hands

70
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:15,839
as we relax tension maybe there's more feeling of flow of energy in the arms the hands

71
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:29,839
and then opening up the attention as wide as is easy for you throughout the body

72
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,880
maybe letting the thinking mind become quieter and stiller

73
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:46,560
to make more room for awareness to feel and sense discover the body

74
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,839
centered in the body

75
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:40,399
noticing if it happens how being pulled into

76
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:47,279
thoughts and fantasies is it pulling away from being centered

77
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:53,839
in the body

78
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:38,720
and then we'll sit quietly but breathing through the body with the body

79
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:44,000
connected to breathing within the body

80
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,839
as if the body

81
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,800
is the source of deep understanding

82
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,600
as if the body is the source

83
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:16,560
for freedom for being at home

84
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:23,040
for where we discover the path to peace

85
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:31,600
for these next minutes trusting the body breathing in the body with the body

86
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:40,079
through the body with the mind relaxing quieting

87
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:59,839
softening the mind to just breathe in this body

88
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:35,840
coming back to your body

89
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:49,600
and coming back again and again each time you return to settle deeper into it

90
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,559
be content to do so forever long

91
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:02,480
you can rest in the body awareness resting there

92
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:17,840
and then do it again

93
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,919
and then coming to the end of this sitting

94
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:09,120
once again is there more you can do for these last couple of minutes to rest

95
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,919
in your body

96
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:25,440
to center yourself in your body as is as if the source of

97
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,960
all things source of your feelings your thoughts your intentions

98
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:49,840
your experience of life begins here in the body deep in the body

99
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:57,200
and perhaps the resting in the body

100
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,320
is where is also the beginning

101
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:13,440
of love of kindness care

102
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,840
compassion

103
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,320
and to stay rooted in the body

104
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:38,159
when we have impulses for kindness and care and compassion

105
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:46,158
so we don't lose ourselves in the object of our care

106
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,600
we don't lose this connection to our

107
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,840
body

108
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:13,840
and turning your attention outward into the world

109
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:20,399
maybe in a sense turning your body inside out

110
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:26,480
to be present for this world of ours

111
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,480
while being rooted in the body

112
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:37,679
perhaps we can wish that whatever benefit that has come from

113
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:44,320
this practice that we share that benefit with others

114
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,080
in small ways big ways

115
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:58,879
that the benefits we experience are expressed in a care for this world

116
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,278
may all beings be happy

117
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,679
may all beings be safe

118
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:17,759
may all beings be peaceful

119
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,840
may all beings be free

120
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,399
and may we contribute

121
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,720
to bringing this planet into a kind of harmony

122
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:51,840
an ecological harmony where all beings can be well

123
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,720
so

124
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:34,320
as we begin this week the theme i had in mind is practicing in

125
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:40,399
our lives and then you could say that all of buddhism is about practicing

126
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:48,480
in our daily life in our ordinary lives in our lives and and certainly so many of the

127
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,679
teachings are completely connected and relevant to how we go about our

128
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:59,519
living our lives but the orientation i have for these talks

129
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:06,399
this week is for people who would like to

130
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:13,120
live a more dharmic life sometimes they consider it would be nice to go live in a retreat center or in a

131
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,960
monastery maybe for a while or find some way to live more

132
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:25,840
fully in the dharma and then maybe it's easy to do and

133
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:31,760
um in a daily life where there's work and family and busyness and things to do

134
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:37,279
so what is it that we can do so that we have you know dependent we can see that

135
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:43,120
receive some of the benefits that uh that a life that's absorbed in a

136
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:49,039
contemplative life absorbed in a renunciant life absorbed in a monastic life how could we

137
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:55,200
have some of those benefits in in ordinary lay life that we live in

138
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:02,799
so for that i want to talk about five different ways we can bring more practice into our lives or live more in

139
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:10,398
the dharma that i would like to believe is available to all of us and and to really pick these five areas

140
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:16,320
up that um you'd find tremendous benefit

141
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:22,800
of uh not only would you find the dharma the dharma would find you and you would

142
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,919
you could you'd create you allow yourself to be a receptive

143
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:33,679
receptacle for the dharma it might fill you in a

144
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:39,118
wonderful way so the first of these five is

145
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:46,079
to be more connected to your body to practice mindfulness of the body

146
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:53,440
to center yourself on your body and um is one of the things that uh

147
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:59,119
i delightfully and surprisingly discovered in practicing in different

148
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:04,560
buddhist traditions that one way or the other they seem the ones i practice seem to all

149
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:11,920
emphasize being grounded connected to your body sometimes it was not explicit but for

150
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:19,839
but there was a lot of the body was clear you had to bring it along and practice with your body

151
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:25,359
when i was practicing zen i don't know if there was a really

152
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:32,320
active discussion about mindfulness of the body but so much of the practice was embodied

153
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:39,040
you sat in a particular posture that really required you to be embodied to sit in the posture

154
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,160
if you were eating you did it in a way that was an embodied eating eating

155
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:50,960
when we eat when we ate more formally it was in practice we would walk in ways that encouraged

156
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:56,640
more embodiment and connection to our body we would when we were doing work we were

157
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,839
instructed to really put ourselves fully into it and be connected and involved in the

158
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:08,000
work being kind of absorbed in the work but in a way that our body was really there for it

159
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:15,359
and and so there was all this emphasis on just being in your body and i learned so much about being embodied

160
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:22,640
by working in the monastic kitchen when i was a zen student and really being present with my whole body

161
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:30,160
as best i could it wasn't always easy to um to be connected to

162
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:37,760
whatever physical work i was doing in the kitchen it was all physical work and so to do it with both hands full

163
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:44,800
body real connected to doing it absorbed in the physicality of it um you know for do i did it for a whole

164
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:52,000
year and and um and it really did wonderful things for me and teaching

165
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,359
me how to be in the world an embodied engaged way

166
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:05,839
the people would teach teach me when i was doing zen in america and also in japan to uh

167
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:10,880
to you know to do is things with my body enthusiastically

168
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:17,200
so not just the kind of i had a tendency maybe to kind of use one hand kind of be there for it part of my body

169
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:23,040
was not involved other things other thoughts and kind of half-heartedly do things

170
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:29,280
and that did not go over well in zen you had to be really there wholeheartedly and one way

171
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:35,119
that was emphasized a lot in japan was you always did things with two hands

172
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:41,680
and so if you picked up a pot of food or you picked up a tool or

173
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:49,040
if you gave someone a gift whatever it was you'd always do it with two hands so you were fully in it it feels

174
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:55,040
different to give someone a gift with two hands than to kind of just here here you go and kind of like give it

175
00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:02,160
the only part of who you are but to do it fully um the um

176
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:08,560
i i love the the anjali the you know putting the hands together and

177
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:13,839
bowing because it brings you know these two sides of who we are in a sense the left and the right and

178
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:19,839
the coming all of us are involved that is different than shaking our hands

179
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:26,079
which is you know only part of us our our bodies involved and i think shaking hands is a wonderful

180
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:32,079
thing when people come back to do it again um but it has its own value and and

181
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:37,920
wonderfulness i don't want to diminish its value but uh there's also something valuable

182
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:43,599
but really coming together and offering kind of like all of ourselves in that greeting

183
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:50,560
in that respect and um and then to becoming more attuned to

184
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:58,400
the sensations of the body these sensations of our body are not senseless uh to to

185
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:04,240
feel like there's you know no sense and no meaning no value and being involved

186
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:09,520
with the census of the body in fact makes the body senseless we get

187
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:15,760
disconnected from the sensations but to value them because they are

188
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:21,599
the carriers of so much information they are the expressions of our

189
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:26,880
attitudes expressions of our emotions and feelings they are the expressions of our

190
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:34,240
reactivity and our response to what's happening in the world around us and there's layers and layers of

191
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:39,280
subtlety that we can be aware of when we're really connected in our body

192
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,480
if we're not so connected at all then just a little bit of connection to the body will

193
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:52,160
provide the early warning signals of feelings and sensations and attitudes and and information about

194
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:57,680
what's happening in the world around us that is often there before our thinking

195
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:04,000
mind is aware of it and uh the first sensations of anxiety the

196
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,280
first sensations of anger or for sensations of of love or

197
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,319
kindness or warmth towards someone there's all these different things that

198
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:19,599
the body sometimes comes through the body that if we're

199
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:25,040
busily thinking and wanting and reacting and being thinking about what's wrong

200
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:31,760
we don't really pick up and so i uh one zen teacher i studied with

201
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:37,359
talked about the body being an antenna and uh and the more your you tune yourself

202
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:43,760
to that antenna the more information you pick up and i would emphasize not just the antenna to what's the

203
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:52,079
information's outside of us our body but also what's inside and you know the the

204
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:57,599
you know if we're not really a divided being between the mind and the body

205
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:04,000
the body is a really rich repository of intelligence of responsivity of

206
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,920
feelings of emotions of information that's so helpful for our lives

207
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:16,880
so to spend more time uh being sensitive to the sensations sensing

208
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:23,839
what's happening in the body it begins kind of shifting the emphasis

209
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:31,440
from thinking that the mind is going to solve everything to allowing the body to participate

210
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:38,480
allowing the body to receive and experience and to help process what's going on

211
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:46,000
some of the difficult emotions we have can be well processed in the body if we allow the body to feel it can be

212
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,920
difficult sometimes we feel all these things more acutely and that can be painful in a sense

213
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:58,560
but there's an art to learning how to keep opening in the body opening the body in a wise way in a supported way in

214
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:03,599
every compassionate way that allows the body to support us to

215
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:11,119
become free to free up things to release things and part of that is because

216
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:18,720
any holding in the mind any attachment and clinging we have often gets expressed in the body

217
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:26,800
becoming tense becoming held with muscles being held in tight and and that tightness tends to numb the

218
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:34,000
body but as we become more aware of the body it tends to free the places of tightness

219
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,839
first we may become aware of all the tension we hold in our body but that's a stepping stone for the body

220
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:46,319
to begin to release releasing itself and open up and so the more we can practice you

221
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:51,839
being in our body when we do things and really being present and more we can become more

222
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:58,640
aware sensitive to the sensations of our body the feelings of our body what's going on in the body

223
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:03,680
that is a way of starting to live a more

224
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:09,599
dharmic life to let the dharma all the benefits of mindfulness and

225
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:15,920
and wisdom to begin kind of showing itself in being accompanying us through our body

226
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:22,960
through our life the less we're connected to our body the less the dharma accompanies us

227
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:29,280
through our life unless we're quite good at at the cognitive aspects of keeping in

228
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:36,319
mind and thinking about it and that can be useful but and some people maybe that's the primary

229
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:41,359
vehicle but for most people i think that the

230
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:47,520
tremendous benefit to being rooted in the body and connected to what's

231
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:53,440
happening in this body of ours and so if you would like to live

232
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,880
if you would like to avoid having to go and become a monastic and go live a monastic life where you're

233
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:05,440
going to full-time dharmic life if you would like to live a contempo contemplative life

234
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:13,680
a dharmic life in your ordinary everyday life then um your monastery is your body

235
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:21,359
and uh your temple is your body and so keep coming back

236
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:28,160
being in your body and then i'll continue on this theme tomorrow with a whole other

237
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:33,200
area that you can focus on if you like that's part of daily life

238
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:40,800
and in the meantime in these next 24 hours maybe you will

239
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:47,359
experiment give more emphasis on your body and what's happening there

240
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:53,839
and how you use it and the feeling sensations what's happening if you allow your body to be more in

241
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:59,520
receptive mode to feel all these sensations that we have

242
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:05,280
so i hope you enjoy um if not now i hope this mindfulness of

243
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:10,720
body will bring you to great enjoyment a great delight in having this physical

244
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:18,720
body thank you
