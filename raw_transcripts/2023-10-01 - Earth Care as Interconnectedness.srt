1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,859
oh so in some parts of the Insight Meditation communities

2
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:12,179
there was a decision 10 years ago to celebrate the

3
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:18,779
first week of October as their Earth care week and so when it comes for of October so

4
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:25,140
when it comes to the beginning of October when I come and give talks I like to give a talk on that topic today

5
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:32,640
is October 1st and so uh I just love this word this

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,800
combination putting together in the same phrase Earth care

7
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,520
on the surface at least or you know in kind of first thoughts

8
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,800
associations to the word Earth it's the planet out there

9
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:56,699
and but care is something that's in here in our hearts or in our in our life it's

10
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:02,160
something that arises from us and so to put these two together is such

11
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,880
a beautiful thing that we have this capacity for care and we have this Earth that we live in

12
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,760
and so we couldn't care for it and then you could say Well it cares for

13
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:21,000
us Earth care could mean not that we care for the Earth but Earth care is recognizing that we're cared for by the

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,240
Earth and but that's not maybe so popular to think that way both of them cannot be

15
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:34,020
so popular that we should care for the Earth or that we are being cared for it I suppose

16
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,420
to have the idea that it's caring for us then we feel like well you better do something in return

17
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:46,079
and um but you know if we don't you know the Earth is just a hunk of rock

18
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,720
floating into the face and we don't deserve we don't need to do anything for it it's just for us too

19
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,180
live our life for our love say to bring him together Earth care

20
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,340
and uh it also for me raises some of the points

21
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:08,220
to some of the great spiritual questions I think people religious people spiritual people are grappling with in

22
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,560
one way or the other explicitly or implicitly questions like who are we

23
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,879
who are we in relationship to the world who are we relationship to the other people

24
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:26,280
what is this world we're in it and what relationship does the world have to me who are all these people who are sharing

25
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,620
this planet with and what's their relationship to me and you know how do we fit into all this

26
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:38,819
and um and in our particular inside meditation tradition if people just you

27
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:45,840
know the anthropologists from Mars came to see us you know study what what are these people doing they go back to Mars

28
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,260
and say they just close their eyes and they tune out the world and they

29
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:59,519
just sit there look inside you know and uh they seem to be oblivious of the world around them it's a very very

30
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,920
peculiar species and or subspecies

31
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:12,540
and um but uh um but as we do this investigation into who

32
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,580
we are and what it means to be living here there's all kinds of interesting things

33
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:26,879
that become clear one is that um we divide up our world in all kinds of

34
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:32,519
ways that are not natural to the world out there but their constructs of the

35
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,680
human mind and today is October 1st

36
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,819
the construct it could be some other month that you know in Ancient India they had to they

37
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:51,900
used the lunar calendar so I don't know if it's we just had the full moon so what two days ago so this

38
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,060
wouldn't be the first it would be the second of this particular cycle of the moon

39
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:06,120
and um and then there are you know probably other calendars people use and uh and uh for us at Sunday and that's also

40
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:13,560
kind of a you know arbitrary it was really fun when I lived in the Zen monasteries that they don't follow the

41
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,440
seven day week there they have a five day week and so this Monday to Sunday that just

42
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,600
wasn't relevant and we wouldn't you know no one would would you say it's you know tomorrow's

43
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:31,139
Monday the days were named by their the number so days off we're not Sunday days

44
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:38,160
off where the days that the number of the day the month day that was had a four or a nine in it so they say four

45
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,280
and nine days the next four and nine day will have it some time off to do your laundry they would say

46
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,440
or something and then three and eight days there was a special

47
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,080
ritual they did in the monastery so so you know no one you know we kind of

48
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:03,419
forgot about days of the week when we were there and but I think for those of us living in a seven day week Society we

49
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:10,139
kind of know you know what the weekday it is but it's a division that we make up and to make it even more clear this

50
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:15,780
whole crazy way in which we divide up our reality um I don't know how many of you know

51
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:21,600
that um if we were if we knew Latin that we

52
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:29,699
would understand that October 1st is the first day of the eighth month because October in Latin means eight

53
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:34,919
and then that you know like we have it wrong right we're confused the Anthropologist for Mars I'll say what's

54
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:41,639
going on and then uh November is the is the ninth

55
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:48,300
month right no it comes from the Latin word for nine December is a Latin word for ten it's

56
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:54,479
our 12th month so you know these names that we put on things not

57
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:02,820
only is it arbitrary to divide up the Year this particular way but also it's a you know we kind of arbitrarily there

58
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:08,100
were the names we put on it and um and so we keep making this Latin

59
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:13,320
mistake every year so you know it's a little bit amusing

60
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:19,620
maybe but uh oh what happens is that we do the same thing to ourselves

61
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:27,060
and to the world we live in we have concepts by which we divide it up and just a very idea that there's me

62
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:34,199
here and you there is kind of self-evident and of course we have to operate in a world like that but

63
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:39,360
it's not completely so straightforward what that division is

64
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:46,440
um some people will Define themselves as a radical individuals completely separate from who

65
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:52,680
are you and they'll say well I'm this person who's you know this age the size this color

66
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:59,220
here this kind of interests It's All About Me Myself and mine it doesn't tell any any you don't say anything about who

67
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:06,840
you are in relationship to your family or your community or something and um and whereas some cultures if you

68
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:13,860
ask who's who they are then maybe immediately first and foremost say well I'm I'm the child of such and such

69
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:19,199
parents or I'm I'm part of this Village or this tribe or something and that's

70
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,960
their identity first comes forward in terms of who they are as part of some other group

71
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,660
and it was fascinating for me to to live for a year in the monastery in Japan and

72
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:37,080
which is uh one of those cultures where they tend to think of themselves as part of a group more than individuals that

73
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:43,919
are separate from all the other individuals who might make up a group and it was fascinating to see how I

74
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:50,400
understood the social dynamics differently than all these you know there were about 30 monks young monks

75
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:56,280
that I was living with and it took a while to see it but by the time I kind of learned enough Japanese to understand

76
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:03,300
I was kind of it was really fascinating to see how my my way of organizing the world was

77
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:08,520
different and their way of organizing the world and I didn't think that one was better than the other

78
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:15,360
but I did think that there's a very important to see that what we're doing is uh we're constructing this thing all

79
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:22,460
the time so this is a central teachings for the Buddha that we are constructing

80
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:28,080
ideas about ourselves ideas about ourselves in relationship to the world we're in

81
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,599
and and some of those constructs are what when we attach to self to who we

82
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:39,300
are that we're attaching to constructs that we make up and we might think that you know we're

83
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:45,600
innocent we're just kind of living our life and we are what we are and you know and all the concepts we're using are

84
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,360
completely self-evident and normal and everything and just uh and they are just

85
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:59,220
as much as October 1st is and um so an example I like to give

86
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,800
is in these days is um is a maybe you're deep in the woods

87
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,440
there's a tree that no one's ever seen before and no one's gone through that part of the woods but some some people

88
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:17,700
go adventurous go go explore and the first person that goes into the wood is a botanist

89
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:24,060
and the botanist sees this kind of tree and the botanist zeros in on the leaves

90
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:29,339
and the shape of the leaves because uh recognizes what genius is but doesn't

91
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:35,519
know what species it is the tree and that's how you identify the trees by the shape this particular genus is the shape

92
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,800
of the of the leaves so once the once the the tree has been

93
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:48,899
identified like this goes home it's happy uh someone who's a sensualist who loves

94
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:54,180
sensual qualities goes and they're like going around looking where is it really

95
00:09:54,180 --> 00:10:01,980
Pleasant in the woods and look at that tree and it's these beautiful flowers and it smells so nice and the color

96
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:07,560
green is and they just oh this is like you know

97
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:14,399
better than perfume and this is you know just and this is I'm going to come back here just to kind of get a whiff of this

98
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,220
beauty this is like looking at art you know wow so they're looking at it for particular

99
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:27,660
qualities that they're selecting out uh someone who is a woodworker

100
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:33,060
will go and I'll be looking for the wood that could make good furniture or tables

101
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:38,700
or whatever they make and so they're going around and trying to identify the kind of wood trees have

102
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:44,700
and he sees this tree and goes over and knocks on it and pushes on it and is this hard enough for what I want to do

103
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:50,899
and it's trying to identify now recognize in the woods something that

104
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:57,959
the woodworker wants to you know whether it's usable cut down the tree and build something

105
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:03,240
uh hey someone who's a uh you know a

106
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,360
Born Again Born Again devoted romantic

107
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:15,120
you know it comes in trees look at the tree and looks around and looks a nice grass under it and how it's nice and

108
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,959
shady and a warm day oh this is where I should come with my lover you know with picnic and you know and

109
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:28,740
little figs and chocolate and and we'll just lay here under the tree and just kind of looking deep into each other's

110
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:35,459
eyes and it's just like this is like you know love incarnate place and um and uh and that's the orientation

111
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:42,360
about how it's going to fit the story their fantasy of this wonderful outing with our lover

112
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:49,260
uh the tree doesn't matter too much it's what this how it builds up the story and then finally I don't know if this

113
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:54,480
works so well but a painter comes along and decides to paint the tree

114
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,779
and uh and the painter doesn't need to know a lot of it we except for all its physical characteristics with light and

115
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:06,959
shadows and shapes and needs a lot of little details to pick up a lot of little details of all the little

116
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:13,440
features visible features and it turns out the the painter loves

117
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,500
that study loves the activity the energy the interest of the eyes and studying

118
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:24,899
and taking it in and translating it to you know to Canvas and and it's like

119
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:30,480
kind of something comes alive for the artist to kind of you know tracking and absorbed and all

120
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,600
those details the artist just loves not the details but loves the Consciousness

121
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,880
which is engaged in the play that's needed for the art

122
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:47,760
so five different people five different ways of experiencing a tree

123
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:54,959
the tree is is whole the tree does not divide itself up this

124
00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:00,360
way the tree does not divide itself up between its branches and its leaves tree

125
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:06,019
doesn't you look at my trunk it's not it's a little bit too fat

126
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:12,260
I put on some weight in my you know in my in my middle ages

127
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:17,339
the tree doesn't he doesn't think about that it's shape of its leaves means that

128
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:24,300
it's you know now you're this kind of tree the tree is an organic hole

129
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:31,860
that doesn't divide up in its mind or anywhere it's Parts the whole thing as a whole

130
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:40,320
operates as kind of an ecology or as a whole as a process and um and but humans have this ability

131
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:46,920
to select out of the environment and make really hard divisions between what's what

132
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:55,260
so it's you know it's maybe a little bit interesting about a tree it's tragic sometimes about ourselves

133
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:02,220
we do the same thing to ourselves we are an organic coal or so but how often do we allow

134
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:09,000
ourselves to just be an organic coal without living in the divisions in which we live by

135
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,160
and so some of us are obsessed about our physical appearance

136
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:20,100
and our society our culture supports this and in all kinds of ways and uh if

137
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:25,139
how we look is is actually significant in how people treat us so it's very

138
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:30,420
painful at times and um and distressing and worse that uh

139
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:38,279
that how people relate to us if it's all about appearance and all that and um and so that's one way that we

140
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:43,440
make this division for ourselves some people live their life based on

141
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,600
comfort avoiding discomfort and it's really Paramount for some people everything's

142
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,639
navigating and negotiating being comfortable learning comfortable you

143
00:14:53,639 --> 00:15:01,800
know they don't call themselves sensualists but that's the base of their life the Buddha in his ancient world when he

144
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:07,199
thought when he considered human beings he considered that what defines human

145
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:12,540
beings is uh their concern for pleasure

146
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:19,320
and avoiding pain that's such a Central Drive for human beings a preoccupation for them

147
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:25,680
and then we have thing we have concepts by which we recognize the world and the

148
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:31,019
our Concepts we recognize the world with sometimes are inaccurate

149
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:36,240
like when you see a a stick on the trail in the woods so you think it's a snake

150
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:42,899
or something a rope and you think of the snake but some uh sometimes it's inaccurate and sometimes it's tragic

151
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:48,180
because what we re how we recognize the concepts Concepts we use to see other

152
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:55,399
people um demeans people and worse

153
00:15:55,399 --> 00:16:01,920
sometimes we take advantage of people or somebody see someone as a you know primarily we recognize them as objects

154
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,260
for our sexual interest and that's pretty uncomfortable for people who are on the receiving end

155
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:12,959
more than uncomfortable and um so so we have these Concepts we

156
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:19,740
carry around with us and some of them are inherited from our family our society our experiences in life and we

157
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:24,779
don't see that we're seeing through the lens of these Concepts we have

158
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:32,220
and we do that to ourselves when I was in seventh grade a teacher came over and watched me make

159
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:39,000
a drawing on my little desk and just said in the most matter-of-fact word where a matter of fact away said again

160
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:46,440
you have no artistic talent you know just like you know and I didn't

161
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:52,920
care you know I didn't have any concept of myself it didn't actually affect me in terms of my mood or I didn't feel bad

162
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:58,500
about myself but she was the authority so I went for the next years thinking

163
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:05,819
you know Mom I have no artistic ability and I'm just one of those people you know it didn't bother me but I

164
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:11,699
carried that idea with me and that's how I understood myself until I had uh my

165
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:17,339
first college roommate was an artist and he kind of kind of tricked me into doing

166
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:22,400
art and and then I took art classes and it was nice

167
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,540
and um so uh so these so we we lit we

168
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:34,620
live under the burden of a lot of Concepts uh you know that I'm guilty that I'm I have shame I did something

169
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:41,340
terrible and a lot of people live with shame a lot of people live with uh with the

170
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:46,559
conceit of different types I'm special or or in Buddhism saying you're special

171
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:53,700
or saying you're terrible is kind of the same game and both of them have the same Source within us that is it partly is by

172
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:59,039
this division that we're dividing up things that were that are organic whole

173
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,860
and so we want to kind of you know free ourselves from these Concepts we're stuck in

174
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:10,559
and so maybe that's enough to kind of describe this the way the Buddha sees that we construct and there we have

175
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:18,840
stories right that we live in too and the stories tend to also separate out and divide up and and construct during

176
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,940
that sometimes stories are complete fantasies and sometimes we have fantasies and then

177
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:30,900
we expect other people to share in our fantasies and sometimes they do and then it gets you know kind of out of

178
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:36,419
control sometimes and so uh what this meditation practice

179
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:43,140
that we do is meant to relax quiet down

180
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:50,340
all these constructions we live by and um and so that when we're here on a

181
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:55,380
sunny day with a blue sky we're not you know sitting quietly

182
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:01,520
minding our own business and meditation and thinking October 1st October 1st October 1st

183
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:07,200
this is October 1st you know I mean that's you know I hope I don't think

184
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,900
anyone you did that did you maybe now you're doing it in a minute but you probably had other things you were

185
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:20,280
thinking about and uh and so the idea is to to quiet this down

186
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:26,840
and um and as we quieted down and these the divisions the constructs we live by

187
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:32,700
the the conceits we live by that the ways we get caught by desires and

188
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:39,179
aversions fears these quiet down and one of the things that we begin

189
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:46,140
experiencing is ourselves as an organic whole and which kind of doesn't it's not so

190
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:51,780
easy just to Define it like this is what it is because uh it's so easy then to

191
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:58,919
choose some part of us over the others part and um and so in meditation we learn to

192
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:05,520
leave ourselves alone so that we can just be let this organic whole just operate

193
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:11,520
without a construct it's not let it operate whatever way it wants with the constructs

194
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:17,940
with hate with fear but there is a quieting down partly it quiets down

195
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:23,700
because we start seeing we're doing this so it's not a it's not ignoring or or

196
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:29,340
Blinder to what we do with all this but these quiet down

197
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:35,419
and then we start seeing the difference between living and constructs

198
00:20:35,419 --> 00:20:41,700
projecting our constructs onto the world and not doing it living living with all

199
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:49,559
kinds of thoughts of self-criticism self you know we can be pretty hard on ourselves and not doing that

200
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:56,780
and we start seeing there's a difference between that we have some choice about whether we create inside of ourselves

201
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:03,360
constructs that lead to harm harming others harming ourselves and there's it comes a time where you

202
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,760
start being able to choose between them not that I don't need to I don't need to think

203
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:14,580
about that anymore I don't need to get involved with that I don't need to to divide up the world

204
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:20,039
this way I can just sit here and breathe breathe nicely and easily

205
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:25,500
one of the things that can happen eventually an amazing moment will arise in

206
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:31,140
meditation practice I hope it's soap sooner than later but sometimes it takes a long time

207
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:37,980
that you're sitting there kind of minding your own business in the present moment being present for yourself

208
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:45,659
and you discover your breathing in an easy way wow it's so useful the breath is just

209
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:51,539
coming and going it's it's an embodiment of ease I didn't realize how much I controlled

210
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:57,480
my breath how much it's held in check wow just there's ease and now I breathe

211
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:03,240
and um and you know what is that ease doesn't you

212
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:10,820
don't need to know what it is you don't have to put a label on it it's just it just it just kind of knees there

213
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:19,980
and then with that easeful breath that becomes a reference point to begin

214
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:27,299
understanding how you lose it and and you can see if you get involved

215
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:32,700
in certain thoughts the breaths tightens up and it's not so easy

216
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:39,059
and you can see it all kinds of ways internally certain emotions arise and affects the breathing

217
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:46,620
so then you start seeing kind of a little bit how it works and maybe you have some ability to adjust things accordingly do not go along with those

218
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:53,280
thoughts maybe that way of thinking but also what happens

219
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,380
we start seeing that what happened in the outer World affects our breathing

220
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:04,260
too and

221
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:10,080
the way that that eat our inner ease is not only dependent on what's going on

222
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,179
inside of us it also depends on the world around us

223
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:20,580
uh you know last week there was smoke here in the Bay Area from fires

224
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:25,620
and that affected our breathing to some degree and I know my breathing was

225
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:31,940
slightly more labored at times with the smoke here especially if I try to go for a walk outside

226
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:38,220
and sometimes it's been a few years ago it was really bad and uh and I could feel the extra work it took to be

227
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:44,340
breathing it didn't feel like it was that useful to breathe that that represents the how you know

228
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:51,360
there's something so profound and important for us as our sense of inner ease has some effect is affected by what goes

229
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:59,280
on around us in the environment and uh and we are not independent of the

230
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:06,600
environment we we wanted many of us want to be independent people

231
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:13,380
but maybe we can be somewhat independent in certain kinds of ways but that's just one of the divisions we make one of the

232
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:19,980
constructs we make constructs of Independence some people really want to be independent with the kind of conceit

233
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:26,520
their kind of specialness or or to be not or so we don't have to be responsible for anybody else

234
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:32,820
but uh you know we live I think so I think we're all only about our

235
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:39,960
independence overlooks the fact that we are amazingly dependent on other people

236
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:46,500
and on the natural world not many of us grow our own food 100 in

237
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:52,320
our society here not most of us in the society here don't

238
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:58,919
make our own clothes from our own sheep that we share and you know we you know

239
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:05,940
the things that support our life come through the the vehicle of other people's efforts and labor and work and

240
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:11,100
and it just you know it's an amazing network of people and things and

241
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:16,260
processes that make it possible for us to live and and to live our life we kind

242
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:23,280
of in some ways depend on it probably not many of you remember how to knit if you had to

243
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:31,200
and and so the um but also the natural world here we

244
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:38,600
completely depended on it and you know most of us know that we have to breathe regularly otherwise we wouldn't be here

245
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:44,899
so our life depends on having oxygen to breathe in

246
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,460
um but uh so we you know we have every few seconds we live in this dependent

247
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:56,760
relationship to the air and um does that make us separate from the air

248
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:02,340
are we like an independent thing or is the air out there and independent of us

249
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:08,100
or is there some way that who we are is inseparable from the air Inseparable

250
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:13,500
from the Sun Inseparable from the ground that we walk on how do we want it how do we do this

251
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:19,860
divisions how do we where do we see where we begin and where we end

252
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:28,679
is that arbitrary or is it really clear lines between where I End and You Begin where I and

253
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:35,159
and the air is and lately I gotten fascinated by the

254
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:45,960
air that we're breathing all the time and it was pointed out to me this Summer that trees plants but trees are solid

255
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:52,919
air isn't that amazing mostly what trees are made from is the

256
00:26:52,919 --> 00:27:01,080
carbon that they get from the carbon dioxide in the air and so imagine you know how much carbon

257
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:07,740
does it from the air carbon dioxide does a tree have to take in to get enough carbon

258
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:13,919
molecules to be a redwood tree and you look at these big redwood trees

259
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:20,700
you know I think in my mind I used to without I never thought about this but I think it was just kind of I kind

260
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:26,760
of assumed that plants and trees most of what we have the solidity there came out of the

261
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:32,580
ground but actually most of the solidity comes most of what we see there the carbon

262
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:37,640
comes out of the atmosphere and and because they take the carbon out

263
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:43,020
of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere they release

264
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:48,539
uh oxygen and guess who needs the oxygen

265
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:55,200
we do and so uh and so there's this wonderful process so now the question is

266
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,779
this tree in the forest in the woods right that I talked about earlier

267
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:06,480
you know is it that tree over there and I'm here

268
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:13,860
or are we part of an organic whole is the organic coal more than just the

269
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:20,880
tree more than just me all these processes that are working together

270
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:27,659
and is it a little bit arbitrary how we make these divisions but some of these divisions that are

271
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:34,520
constructed of the human mind cause a lot of suffering

272
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:40,200
there's a lot of selfishness a lot of self-focus

273
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:46,200
or there can be care there can be opening the heart and the mind to look

274
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:52,799
around and see that we not Just Me Myself and mine

275
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:58,559
but maybe what's more realistic it's we ours and ourselves we're all in it

276
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:05,640
together and that we we us ourselves is much bigger

277
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:12,000
than uh our human Community it's how we how we're in a certain kind of community

278
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,960
with the natural world with this Earth is there an organic hole of the whole

279
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,179
Earth and does that organic coal

280
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:29,220
have some bearing on how easy it is for us to breathe

281
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:34,740
our inner sense of peace and well-being where is that found and where does that

282
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:41,039
come from and and and uh when there's you know when there's forest fires

283
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:48,539
nearby how easy do you breathe when there's you know the air is full of

284
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:55,200
smog how easy how easy how much ease do you have do you have more ease when this air

285
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:01,740
is clean and you can see across the bay or is there something maybe almost subconsciously where it's a little bit

286
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:07,759
oppressive a little bit you know tight and constricted

287
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:14,159
to live in the smog to hear about people around the world

288
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:21,860
who are living under environmental challenges and

289
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:29,100
does that have anything to do with you are we independent from that do we share this planet with others and everything

290
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:34,980
or not and that's a division that we we can make we can construct

291
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:43,080
but when our consumption of goods is gathered from all over the planet how

292
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:49,500
independent are we I don't know if it goes on on anymore because China stopped but China used to

293
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:55,580
take a lot of our garbage until they decided we our garbage was too dirty

294
00:30:55,580 --> 00:31:03,740
our recycling was too dirty we don't clean our recycling so it's much harder to recycle if we don't clean it

295
00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:11,898
so um so this Earth care idea

296
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:20,220
is in our practice we first what we're

297
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:25,559
learning is to care for the Earth in Us in ourselves

298
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:34,500
to care for the natural world that we are and in the deepest way we are not the

299
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:40,500
the mental constructs that we create we manufacture all kinds of ideas that

300
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:47,700
separate us and divide us and can cause a lot of suffering but that's not Who We Are

301
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:54,240
and but if we can drop down and quiet those constructs then we start becoming aware of organic

302
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:00,960
processes within that are not constructs that are not mental creations and this

303
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:07,380
is part of the Buddha's emphasis over and over and over again he used similes from nature

304
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:14,220
to describe how it's possible to live a life where our breathing is easy an

305
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:22,140
easeful breath that easeful inner life a peaceful inner life and um and uh and it's Awakening this

306
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:28,320
natural process inside but that natural process inside

307
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,600
is not apart from the natural process of this Earth outside of us

308
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:40,380
they're intimately connected they're kind of part of the same whole same kind of evolutionary things or all these

309
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:48,179
processes are coming together and moving back and forth and so to care for ourselves

310
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:55,260
you can't really do it unless you fully unless you care for the world around you if you care for only yourself

311
00:32:55,260 --> 00:33:01,340
then you're living in a divided World more constructs if you care only for the world outside

312
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:06,360
same thing you're living in a divided world and it constructs it

313
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:13,019
but I would like to propose that when we can settle enough the constructs the

314
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:18,980
preoccupations of the Mind that then the opportunities here that

315
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:25,200
the care that we have is part of the natural working of life the organic

316
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:31,620
functioning of human life has within it the capacity to care to be concerned to

317
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:38,399
love to be generous to to be attuned to the welfare of self and

318
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:46,320
others into the interested in in supporting others and caring for others or being kind and being supportive and

319
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:51,539
sharing this planet together not because we should not because

320
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:57,960
there's an obligation but because that's what lives in us if we fight if we drop into this place

321
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:04,320
where the natural world has a chance to flow through us and why it works that way why this

322
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:12,540
natural world has created us in this kind of way that it's natural for us to want to care for our babies

323
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:18,118
you know some of you have had kids it's you know it's pretty

324
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:25,500
deeply ingrained to have this kind of Parental Instinct that of course we care and that that care doesn't have to stop

325
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:31,618
with our babies or our children or our parents or neighbors it can that

326
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:36,658
movement of care is completely natural phenomena part of the natural world

327
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:42,300
we have and to allow that to be

328
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:50,398
used to grow and expand and spread so that the care is in all directions and

329
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:55,919
whatever we touch whatever we see we see it with care we see it with

330
00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:00,980
kindness we see it with appreciation we see it

331
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:07,800
as part of the organic home as opposed to seeing it through our

332
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:13,440
greed or hate or or conceit and so

333
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:20,460
for there to be Earth care is I think a profound thing

334
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:27,480
I think it's a profound natural thing that human beings given a chance to

335
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:33,180
tap into their depth inside

336
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:38,640
will care for themselves will care for the people around them

337
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:46,200
will care for this world at the same time as we feel know that we

338
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:52,800
are being cared for maybe not to the degree to which we would like

339
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:59,300
you know the stock market was incorporating today and caring for me

340
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:05,579
you know I don't know if that's a good way of thinking that's more

341
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:12,119
divisions but this world is caring for us in profound ways otherwise we wouldn't be

342
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:19,320
alive and to drop the concern with the stock market or whatever

343
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:28,460
and to appreciate that we can breathe and that there's water to drink and there are people around us who smile

344
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:34,200
and this and it may be people who appreciate that we smiled back

345
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:39,800
that's a beautiful thing so Earth care

346
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:48,540
this is not something you have to do but it is something which I hope will

347
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:56,339
come from your inner Freedom as you discover Your Capacity to really drop below all

348
00:36:56,339 --> 00:37:02,040
the divisions and constructs that the Mind tends to make and feel like you're part of an organic

349
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:09,240
goal of this planet and I hope we can take care of this planet well

350
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:14,579
because it's a way of taking care of our family our communities

351
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:19,940
what we love and it's a way of taking care of ourselves

352
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:28,859
so thank you Earth care this week so maybe this week can be a week that you consider this

353
