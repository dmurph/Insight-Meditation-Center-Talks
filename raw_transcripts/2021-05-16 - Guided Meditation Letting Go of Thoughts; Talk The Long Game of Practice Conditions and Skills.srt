1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:09,120
so hello from redwood city in

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:17,920
california and welcome to our meditation session together

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:27,199
one of the important supports for meditation

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:36,800
is no longer being fascinated by our own

5
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:43,360
thinking or no longer so actively involved in our

6
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,440
thinking no longer simply allowing thinking to go

7
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:58,239
along go go on and on and on without being clearly mindful of that and so

8
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:04,320
there is a kind of little little heightened attention to thinking that's useful for meditation

9
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:12,240
um so to protect us from being swept away in our thoughts

10
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,600
so one way to do this and and at the same time it's very important not to be

11
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,560
in conflict with thinking or struggling against it

12
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:29,840
it's better just to lend if i think it's almost better just to keep thinking and struggle but a few things that you

13
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,840
might try doing today one is every exhale

14
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,399
let go of what you're thinking thinking might begin again very quickly

15
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:50,320
that's okay but every exhale let go of your thinking and be there for the inhale

16
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,600
and then let go again and be there for the inhale kind of get into the rhythm of that

17
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,880
and so that whatever thought arises you're not swept away in it you're not caught in

18
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:08,479
it you're not fueling it or involved in it if letting go of it seems a bit too much

19
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,520
an alternative is to every exhale

20
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:20,319
if you're thinking recognize your thinking acknowledge that's the case and it can

21
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,520
be with a simple word thinking that you say to yourself

22
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:32,000
and saying the word thinking for many people help them step away from their involvement with

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,800
thinking and uh and then that's stepping away we're not fueling it and feeding it anymore the stories and

24
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,160
whatever we're involved in so both letting go of your thinking and

25
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,080
in just just recognizing that you are thinking

26
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,959
not have to be done with any opposition to thinking

27
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,840
but there are better things to do than to think and if what you want to do is to

28
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,400
meditate uh and so this kind of beginning to kind of create a little bit of freedom from

29
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,519
thinking then make space and room for a greater

30
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:21,920
settling a greater calm or clarity of mindfulness so

31
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,440
assuming a meditation posture

32
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:36,400
taking some time to move around twist and sway the body a

33
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,560
bit both to kind of wake up the body and connect to your body

34
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:49,920
but also to help the body kind of come into an aligned posture or just kind of

35
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,120
adjust to the best posture that's suitable for you

36
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,840
and then gently closing the eyes

37
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:11,439
and taking a few long deep slow breaths

38
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:17,199
three quarters full some people find it helpful to open the

39
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:23,120
mouth a little bit and breathe in through the mouth the steep inhales

40
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,840
so they'll look more conscious and engaged

41
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:45,919
breathing in deeply and then long slow relaxing exhale

42
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:11,840
perhaps as you exhale settling in to this body posture

43
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,840
and then to let your breathing return to normal

44
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,840
and continue the process of relaxing the body softening

45
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:38,080
some people like to do it systematically some people like to just do it randomly wherever the tension is in the body if

46
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:44,639
you do it systematically you can start at the forehead and the eyes

47
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:52,320
relaxing with the exhale

48
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,479
softening the cheeks in the jaws

49
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:08,560
there might be some relaxing of the neck softening of the neck

50
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:21,840
release the holding in the neck

51
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,160
on the exhale releasing the shoulders

52
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:49,840
or softening we're easing up with the shoulders

53
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,840
softening in the chest

54
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:17,840
softening the belly

55
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,960
perhaps there can be a softening relaxing of the hands the fingers

56
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:45,840
and relaxing of the legs

57
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:54,560
and if uh you have a location in your body in your head where thinking is most predominant

58
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:03,280
there's a physical engagement of energy or agitation contraction pressure associated with

59
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:12,080
thinking as you exhale

60
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,560
can you relax that thinking muscle that thinking the

61
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:27,840
the tightness associated with thinking

62
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:56,160
and then to settle into your breathing the rhythm of breathing in and breathing

63
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:12,640
out maybe with your central vision in a

64
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:19,600
sense central attention going on breathing in your peripheral attention as you

65
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:27,200
exhale let go of your thinking every exhale

66
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:38,480
lighten up quiet you're thinking

67
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:52,560
or if that is difficult every exhale acknowledge

68
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,480
that you're thinking stepping back stepping away and seeing

69
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,320
thinking for what it is this is thinking this

70
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:10,480
is the mind thinking and that stepping away and seeing it

71
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:17,600
this way begins a process of not being so

72
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:33,839
identified or involved with thinking

73
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,839
uh

74
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,120
recognizing that you're thinking

75
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:20,400
and keep recognizing it letting go of your thinking

76
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:28,480
letting go into your breathing and keep letting go of thinking gently

77
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:34,799
kindly without struggle or aversion

78
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:47,840
just letting go

79
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,840
foreign

80
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:04,640
letting go of thoughts perhaps there can be a fresh

81
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,840
awareness of the inhale

82
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:16,640
a fresh involvement settling in to the experience of breathing in and

83
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:23,840
breathing out

84
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,960
and then as we come to the end of the

85
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:50,080
sitting to again take a few long slow deep

86
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:57,120
breaths and this time perhaps breathing in

87
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:03,279
deeply into your heart almost as if you can expand your good

88
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:06,559
heart as you inhale

89
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:16,240
and spread that goodness out with the

90
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:32,080
exhale if we value

91
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,760
goodness kindness friendliness

92
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:47,679
generosity love if we value some of these heart

93
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:55,919
qualities the end of a meditation is a time to

94
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:00,799
remember them to touch into them

95
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:11,440
and on whatever benefit that's come from the meditation practice

96
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,440
let these good qualities of the heart

97
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:26,559
float on the benefits of meditation and the ways you're calm more settled

98
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:39,840
more open

99
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:50,840
and consider how whatever benefit known or unknown that comes from the

100
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:57,279
practice consider bringing those benefits into the world

101
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:03,039
that you yourself are an agent of make doing good in the

102
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:07,840
world benefiting others

103
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:25,040
may all beings be happy

104
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:34,320
may all beings be peaceful

105
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:41,919
may all beings be safe

106
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:48,000
may all beings be free

107
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,000
and may each of us contribute to that

108
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:10,889
possibility [Music]

109
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:13,839
okay uh

110
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:32,160
so i have a little bit of a tickle in my throat today so we'll see how this goes

111
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:41,839
so

112
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:57,280
so one of the things well known about mindfulness practice buddhist

113
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:04,079
meditation practice in general is that it's very much based on being

114
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:11,839
present in the present moment it's a practice that aims to bring us

115
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:17,839
into the present moment more fully and then to

116
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:24,480
uh but not just to be present for its own sake which sometimes is quite lovely and

117
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:30,079
profound but to begin

118
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:37,760
utilizing or engaging some of the potential that comes when we

119
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:44,880
can be present for our experience and some of the potential of mindfulness

120
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,720
practice that can be actualized when we're present

121
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:58,160
when they're in when when we're in the now is really something that is

122
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:05,839
belongs to the world of time that the benefits come in the future

123
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:12,320
that the benefits we're putting in place we're doing activities we're doing the

124
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:18,400
meditation practice in such a way that benefits will come

125
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:24,480
sometimes in in you know well into the future

126
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:30,960
and um so what are those benefits what is what is

127
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,560
it what's the what's what's part of the long game of meditation that um

128
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:43,280
that we're engaged in here now so i'll start with an analogy of

129
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:50,720
raising children and so i had the experience so i think probably plenty of parents have of

130
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:57,280
uh when the kids are quite young two three sometimes even four five

131
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:05,359
maybe even older sometimes that we might do

132
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:14,000
a lot of effort to do something wonderful with the children and take them to some wonderful place

133
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,280
do some kind of wonderful activity at home spend a lot of time to really do

134
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,359
something quite marvelous

135
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:30,960
and as the kids grow older they don't remember

136
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:38,320
so many of the things and what parents can remember were special moments the kids weren't particularly special

137
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,920
for the kids they don't remember and um and

138
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,960
uh but what so the event the activity that uh

139
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:55,359
the experience the conscious experience of something doesn't remain for the children and the

140
00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:02,880
way sometimes for parents they do but what remains is the

141
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:08,880
is a few things one is early childhood things that the kids don't remember

142
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:14,960
is that they're receiving the conditions they're being conditioned they're being

143
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:20,079
influenced or nourished supported impacted by the environment that they're

144
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:25,680
in so if the parents are or the family

145
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:34,720
or the environment is creating an environment where the kids feel safe nurtured loved cared for

146
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:40,560
that creates a very different conditioning for the child then if the child grows up with violence

147
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:48,800
and anger and being ignored and being dismissed and all kinds of things and very different

148
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,920
conditioning if they feel safe and cared for

149
00:40:53,920 --> 00:41:01,040
something has to relax and they feel at home in the world they feel comfortable but if there's

150
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:08,640
war and violence and anger and and um drunkenness and

151
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:14,400
you know chaos and dismissing and ignoring then they don't feel like they belong

152
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:22,319
they feel like something's wrong they feel they have to protect themselves they feel tense they feel afraid and that each of those

153
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:30,240
two scenarios creates a very different different conditioning and that conditioning can last

154
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:39,200
well into a person's whole life they don't remember all the details but the conditioning has

155
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:44,319
remained and some people feel like even before kids learn language and have the words

156
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:52,640
to remember what happened they're already being conditioned by the environment in that first year of their life in a very deep way

157
00:41:52,880 --> 00:42:00,480
so one of the ways that meditation or buddhist practice works a very important part of it

158
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:07,599
is that we are putting in place uh conditions that um

159
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:13,280
that condition us in a good way that influence us on this maybe even the

160
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:19,359
subliminal or a deeper kind of physical heartfelt emotional level

161
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:24,799
that that words and understanding don't do

162
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:32,079
and so we are beginning to um understand what are the conditions

163
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:37,838
that are supportive um now being

164
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,119
so that's one thing this can the conditioning the second thing i want to talk about and then i'll bring these two

165
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:51,119
together is that you also see in young children that a lot of what

166
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:58,640
childhood is about is learning new skills that they don't know how to crawl and

167
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:04,319
then they develop the skills for crawling they don't know how to walk then they develop the skills for walking

168
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:10,960
maybe with a lot of falling as part of it they don't know how the skills of eating and then they develop the skills for how

169
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:17,839
to eat and those skills sometimes develop you know greater greater detail as they get older and

170
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:24,319
people who grow up when with spoons eventually get forks eventually gets forks and knives

171
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:31,119
maybe even they're introduced to chopsticks and they develop all this physical dexterity of how to eat

172
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:37,119
and it's a skill that gets developed and by time we're an adult we're not thinking about that as a skill

173
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:43,760
it's just kind of an obvious thing that we'd know how to do but you watch the little kids and you see they're learning how to do this

174
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:49,599
we learn language we learn to ride a bicycle we learn oh learn to put on our clothes for

175
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:56,000
ourselves and we learn all these different things we're learning these skills and these um

176
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:02,800
and these skills that we learn uh we continue right up until we die we're still learning skills and how to be in

177
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:09,680
in this world it's a very ordinary human thing to through repetition through engagement

178
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:15,040
that we learn mental skills physical skills maybe

179
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:20,480
emotional skills of how to do things and so part of buddhist meditation

180
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:28,560
practice that has to do with time is that we are developing skills and

181
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:36,079
we get developing the skills of concentration the skills of mindfulness developing a whole a whole bunch of

182
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:42,799
skills about knowing what to bring mindfulness to and what to include

183
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:48,960
we'll learn after a while that we should be mindful of the fact that we're drifting off in thought a lot

184
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:56,160
or we need to be mindful of our attitude as we meditate i know people can meditate without

185
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:02,800
realizing that there's a anger or a

186
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:09,760
best part of their mindfulness they're upset with something and or there's a a expectation

187
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:16,880
that you know that some wonderful things going to happen or there's some subtle thought that uh you know this i

188
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:23,200
can't really do this this is too difficult or there's a greed or a desire that's pushing

189
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:29,920
wanting some wonderful experience so all these attitudes there to learning the skill of recognizing

190
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:35,119
those subtle attitudes that are somehow sometimes even tripping us up as we meditate or

191
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:40,000
which are having an undue influence on how we meditate

192
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:47,520
and and part of the skill is then to learn about conditions to

193
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:53,359
learn that we we it's our job to put in place the proper conditions

194
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:59,760
that nourish us that support us that allow for the growth and well-being of who we are

195
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:06,319
meditation is one of those if you spent your time just watching movies on netflix or

196
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:11,599
something or and if you only spent your time

197
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:18,640
chasing after making lots of money or only spend time

198
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:24,640
chasing after anything at all you can name it and you're preoccupied busy involved

199
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:29,760
then that's a conditioning factor but if you spend time

200
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:36,319
having a sabbath having time just to be quiet and still and and content with your life as it is

201
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:42,160
creates a very different conditioning if you feel like you always want more

202
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:47,760
then you're conditioning you're influencing the predisposing yourself that you're always not enough

203
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:52,800
there's always more to be had and no matter then what you get there's always more

204
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:59,359
if you're conditioning yourself to be content then you're more likely to be content

205
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:06,240
you know or to recognize that things are content you don't need more and more and more and this

206
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:12,560
conditioning is not brainwashing it's just taking the good qualities

207
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:19,599
that we have and and developing this skill to connect with them more often

208
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:26,480
and remind ourselves more often and to cultivate the things that um bring those about and bring them

209
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:31,680
forth because we have we have the potential

210
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:37,920
of feeding ourselves good influences so classically the buddha said it's

211
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:44,160
useful to spend time with good spiritual friends to spend time with people that

212
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:49,760
represent values or present qualities of being that you want to be influenced by that

213
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:55,440
you want to you want those to be conditioning factors for yourself

214
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:02,079
if you spend time only with angry people only with hostile people then maybe

215
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:08,160
that's what gets kind of encouraged and returned back so

216
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:13,599
so to take care of what comes in

217
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:20,319
it influences us and the more we're in the present moment the more we can be custodian the

218
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:25,839
caretaker of that and we can make the choices both the choices about

219
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:31,119
you know uh to do something that's as simple as you know there's two freeways here

220
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:36,640
on the peninsula there's 101 and there's 280 and sometimes it's been more or less the

221
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:42,880
same which one i take maybe a little bit longer on 280. and i see that driving down 280 which goes

222
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:49,760
through sometimes beautiful hillsides and sometime a year these you know forests

223
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:55,760
and the mountains on the side and 101 goes through down through the airport and

224
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:02,559
city urban areas in a way that's not so inspiring parts of it and so just to go down 280 i just feel

225
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:11,280
better i just feel more refreshed and relaxed at the end um um but even if i go down 101 where

226
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:18,000
it's maybe a lot of more traffic and business and smog and and stuff then what conditions do i want

227
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,760
to support to develop inside of me it isn't just a moral obligation to be patient or

228
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:31,119
be a driver that's generous to the other drivers um but what do i want to

229
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:36,960
develop in myself maybe i want to develop i don't want to develop being in a hurry

230
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:42,000
and being impatient and zigzagging out of the traffic to get

231
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,200
someplace where i need to go as quickly as i can maybe one of what i develop is driving

232
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:54,880
in a way where i'm driving safe and content as if i have lots of time and this idea that

233
00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:01,040
giving ourselves time and driving in a content way rather than a discontented way or

234
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:06,800
and pressure in the long game of life

235
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:12,000
those who begin creating conditions that allow something deeper to unfold and develop within

236
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,200
us so these two things are a very important

237
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:22,880
part of buddhist practice in general that buddhist practice has a lot to do

238
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:29,520
with putting conditions in place and there's a lot to do developing the skills to do so

239
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:34,640
um some of this these uh skills

240
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:40,319
some of these conditioning factors are things like kindness so we develop we develop the

241
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:47,280
skill of being kind some of it has to do with letting go we developed a skill of letting go

242
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:52,400
some of it has to do with you know being generous and so we cultivate the

243
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:59,440
capacity for generous become skillful at learning the art of generosity and how to give wisely

244
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:04,559
there's all these this variety of different things we're kind of developing

245
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:10,160
the skill that being ethical conduct the skill of wise speech

246
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:16,000
speech which we feel nourished by it when we finish speaking it we feel like we've benefited from it

247
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:22,160
rather than later we feel i'm so sorry i spoke that way i was so just mostly complaining the whole time

248
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:30,160
we were together and i feel a bit drained and maybe you do too or and so these are all called skills that

249
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:36,480
we develop we develop beneficial skills so it's not only a matter of showing up and being

250
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:42,319
mindful in the present moment and developing present moment awareness and then trusting

251
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:49,200
that all the goodness we have will come and take care of things it's a little bit magical thinking

252
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:55,920
we develop mindfulness of the present moment and then we see more choice we live in more considered

253
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:02,880
life we're more wise wise about things some people put a tremendous emphasis on

254
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:09,359
religious experiences they're looking to have a great aha moment they've heard in buddhism

255
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:15,599
there's enlightenment and i want to get that experience of enlightenment and then everything will be okay forever

256
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:20,880
after or you know i want to have this wonderful religious experience

257
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:26,480
that then i can go around and tell my friends you know aha you know it's so great what happened to me and

258
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:32,079
when it wasn't retreat and this great experience happened and it was so profound and

259
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:39,520
so glad i had this profound experience it's a wonderful experiences that can

260
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:46,400
have and can can arise in practice and i don't want to diminish their importance but to

261
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:54,960
over emphasize them at the expense of the ordinary day-to-day cultivating

262
00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:00,960
skills cultivating the right conditions the long game and some of this

263
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:06,960
conditioning bears fruit in far into the future

264
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:12,240
it's possible that as we develop generosity or contentment or

265
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:20,000
capacity to be equanimous a capacity to be with pain and not to be reactive and afraid or

266
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:28,400
or hostile or contracted it's a skill when a skillfulness of being with pain

267
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:33,440
it's one of the things i started learning in my early years of buddhist practice when i was living at zen center

268
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:41,280
in a variety of different ways i got the message you know gil it'd be good if i understood how to

269
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:47,520
be present for pain without the self-pity the activity reactivity the anger

270
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:52,559
and i would look for situations where uh i was feeling a lot of pain

271
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:59,280
but it was safe to do so and then i would explore it and be with it and develop and develop a

272
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:06,800
skill of being present in an equanimous way open way without being troubled by the pain but

273
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:14,160
being wise by it i mean with simple things like sometimes we were carrying really heavy objects i was working on

274
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:20,800
the zen center farm and we had to carry farm implements and so uh you know allowing myself to

275
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:25,839
feel feel the pain and doing the work without up to a limit

276
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:32,319
hopefully the healthy limit but working with that edge learning about myself developing that skill and then later in

277
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:37,920
life i had accidents or had things happen to me where i was in a lot of pain not because

278
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:43,119
i wanted to be because it was an accident and then i had the skill of knowing how

279
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:49,280
to practice with pain and that was really useful to learn how to let go

280
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:55,599
and not because letting go is you know you know moral obligation it just you

281
00:54:55,599 --> 00:55:01,119
can live a much better happier life when you let go that becomes obvious as

282
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:07,040
people get older i've now come seems like i've come into that stage of

283
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:14,960
age maybe old age maybe where um with my friends sometimes we

284
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:22,240
we go through we have a litany and i think of a litany as uh you know kind of a sacred

285
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:29,359
repetition of a chant or something or a piece of of um something anyway the um

286
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:36,160
the litany of different different physical ailments how our bodies are changing and shifting as we get older

287
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:42,319
and um and uh and to learn how to let go of all the physical changes that you

288
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:47,520
know let go of how things were and then embrace what's happening now uh

289
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:53,599
and finding some joy in it okay well that goes now too this that this too this too that's a

290
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:58,960
skill we develop if you've never never let go of anything your whole life

291
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:05,599
and then something happens in the old age where you can no longer have an ability you can get bitter

292
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:10,720
at the absence of that ability but if you learn to let go and learn that not only letting go but

293
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:17,119
letting go into something great you develop you develop can you've conditioned yourself you've

294
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:22,720
cultivated and developed a sense of peace and tranquility and

295
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:28,000
love and goodness here that letting go is not just letting go into

296
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:34,160
absence or deprived state but letting go is letting go into

297
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:41,119
this goodness that's been developed this goodness that's been allowed to grow and and and all that

298
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:47,280
so then um so we the skill of letting go comes together with how we've been

299
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:54,559
conditioned how we've allowed ourselves to be conditioned and uh and grow is um

300
00:56:54,559 --> 00:57:02,558
is um you know is part of part of the long game of meditation practice

301
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:07,839
so the long game um and

302
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:15,119
so conditioning what are the conditions you want to have

303
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:20,319
in place one of the interesting things about buddhist practice and

304
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:27,760
the teachings of the buddha he didn't put a lot of emphasis on causality like we are we

305
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:34,400
are responsible to cause things cause our meditation practice to develop a certain way but rather we're

306
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:41,280
responsible putting the conditions in that allows these uh for growth

307
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:46,720
so there's kind of both a a removal responsibility and an addition of

308
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:53,280
responsibility we're not responsible for what actually happens but we are responsible for putting the

309
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:59,839
conditions the best conditions in place so that something good can happen

310
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:05,920
so there's a kind of releasing of obligation or releasing of a certain

311
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:11,119
kind of self-centered effort to make something happen it's more like grace it's more

312
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:16,640
like we receive all this goodness we make room for it and allow it to grow and

313
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:25,599
happen and that's one part of the conditions we offer is getting out of the way and allow

314
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:31,440
the goodness to evolve and develop but we put in the conditions that allow

315
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:41,119
the best conditions for that to to sow that the best can grow out of us

316
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:46,319
and so what are those conditions so part of a buddhist spiritual life

317
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:51,599
is reflecting and thinking about what conditions can you put

318
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:57,680
realistically put into place that supports that long game that supports that influence you want to have

319
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:04,240
and the conditioning you want to develop and what skills do you want to develop

320
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:10,319
meditation is a skill and it's done by repetition over and over and over again

321
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:15,520
um the other you know when i went her first raider who taught her recently

322
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:22,400
taught recently listened to her recently when she was abbess of the san francisco zen center she

323
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:27,440
sometimes would watch new students come in to meditate to be new students there

324
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:34,319
and how awkward they were in their physical body sitting in meditation posture and how they had to move and fidget

325
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:40,000
throughout the meditation session and then she'd watch slowly over the weeks and the months

326
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,520
their bodies would adjust and they would find a way to sit and and eventually they would sit in a

327
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:51,680
very good balanced settled zen posture

328
00:59:51,680 --> 01:00:00,240
they develop a skill slowly over time to cultivate that you know subtle place

329
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:08,079
so there's so many ways some of these skills we developed are done by repetition over and over and over again

330
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:15,040
so i'll give you an analogy i've done before i love it has to do with the old-fashioned

331
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:20,480
people don't have them anymore i think telephone books that some of them are really fat

332
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:25,680
and they have very very thin paper and you take a bunch of them and stack

333
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:34,559
them up on the floor and then if you use them as a prop for a yoga posture yoga asana

334
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:40,079
and and one was at the triangle post and if you give you a triangle pose and

335
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:45,920
one arm is supposed to reach all the way down to the floor but it can't get there you have your heart your arm reached

336
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:51,520
down to the top of the telephone books and then every day

337
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:57,520
you tear off one page of the book of the books so each day it's almost inconsequential

338
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:05,200
the difference but slowly in a way it's imperceptible to you slowly slowly you're able to bring your

339
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:12,240
hand closer and closer and closer to the floor until finally you can do the triangle pose touching the floor

340
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:18,400
so um so the gradual growth the patient growth the patient

341
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:24,000
developing of skills the cra patient development of these inner qualities

342
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:31,680
and that support us and influence us that are mutually supportive for us and the world around us kindness love

343
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:37,838
generosity truthfulness wise speech

344
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:46,400
equanimity compassion letting go relinquishment

345
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:55,280
seeing clearly stopping and looking mindfulness itself um

346
01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:00,880
so um so all this can get lend itself

347
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:07,760
to the idea that you have to be busy there's a lot of doing but the idea of being busy and a lot of

348
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:14,960
and doing doing doing that is not really a good condition to have that's not a really good influence in this process

349
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:21,520
and it's not necessarily one of the better skills we want to develop skills of being busy so there's a as we

350
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:27,920
pay attention to all this there's a self-correcting movement we start recognizing

351
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:34,240
uh what is it how do we do things how do we engage in buddhist practice and all the elements of it

352
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:40,720
so that it has a good influence on us so that we're developing good skills in

353
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:46,559
the process and so this is where we come closer and closer to the present moment also

354
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:52,000
rather than thinking of the long game that we want to discover the goodness of what

355
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:58,480
we do in the moment that we do it as well there has to be a good feeling

356
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:05,520
that oh this is this is nourishing this is supportive this is not stressful and so being

357
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:13,520
really busy doing too much if you really feel and are present for that experience you can feel oh this doesn't work

358
01:03:14,839 --> 01:03:22,079
so so developing skills

359
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:28,480
and putting together conditions and to doing those things skillfully

360
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:34,559
and in a way that uh it provides conditions of ease and relaxation and

361
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:44,000
and um enjoyment of this life that we're we here this precious life that we have

362
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:50,400
appreciating this of these your our our role in putting the conditions in

363
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:56,559
place and developing skills uh it can give a life a tremendous sense of purpose

364
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:04,079
and value and and um and then it's not such a mystery how spiritual change happens

365
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:12,079
in fact one of the signs of maturity in buddhist practice is um is a real understanding of how to

366
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:18,640
work with the world of conditioning and the world of skill building and to have engaged in that for

367
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:24,160
you know for a long time and slowly slowly something develops and

368
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:31,440
evolves over time so the benefits that are immediate

369
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:37,680
and the benefits that come through time and i encourage you from time to time to

370
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:43,039
really consider the long game and if you do so

371
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:49,280
then you'll be ready for old age sickness and death and these won't be so frightening or

372
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:54,319
difficult because you've put the conditions in place and you develop

373
01:04:54,319 --> 01:05:04,000
skills that will support you even through sickness old age and death itself so um

374
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:11,839
thank you and um so one announcement or uh

375
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:18,079
so i'm starting a retreat this afternoon a two-week retreat so the next two sundays i won't be here

376
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:24,559
but i've invited two wonderful uh teachers to come teach and these are both teachers who

377
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:30,079
have just graduated from their teacher training so they're relatively new teachers

378
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:35,280
though they've had a fair amount of experience already teaching and they're quite marvelous i just delight

379
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:42,640
in both of them and and so next week it's devon berry and the week after that is tara molay

380
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:47,760
who's been here for us teaching before and so i think you'll enjoy them quite a

381
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:54,799
bit and hearing a different voice and a different little slightly different mindfulness teaching will be i think

382
01:05:54,799 --> 01:06:01,359
will be um you know you'll you'll you'll appreciate it a lot

383
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:08,079
and then i'll be back in a few weeks and and or i'll see some of you

384
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:18,318
in the weekday morning meditations we do thank you
