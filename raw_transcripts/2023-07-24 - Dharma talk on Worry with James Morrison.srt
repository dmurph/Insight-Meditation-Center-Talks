00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,299
Welcome to our teacher James Morrison James Morrison was ordained as a

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:14,580
Buddhist monk in the Thai Forest tradition and live with meditation Masters in Thailand for 15 years

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:22,680
for the last 12 years he has also practiced at his property in the Santa Cruz mountains the Redwood Hermitage

4
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,960
James has now retired from his life as a monk but is continuing to teach the

5
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,000
dhamma he has inherited from his teachers currently he is staying at his

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,780
peaceful Hermitage surrounded by redwood trees others are welcome to join him

7
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,239
spending time on individual Retreat experiencing the Tranquility Beauty and

8
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,539
simplicity of nature welcome James

9
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,760
good all right

10
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,580
foreign

11
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:34,619
so this morning I'm coming on the way to give a talk on overcoming worry and as I

12
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:40,380
say a funny thing happened to me on the way to the meditation center so the car

13
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,900
the vehicle I'm driving in uh suddenly has a rear tire blowout

14
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,240
and uh and made it here just in time so

15
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:57,180
another good dhamma lesson in being able to be prepared for overcoming worry

16
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,520
about anything that might go wrong in the future and uh fortunately uh Nancy

17
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:10,140
responded with uh calm collected and she saved the day by

18
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,220
getting me here in time

19
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:21,720
so today I want to talk a bit about worry as a mental state and how it you

20
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,760
know what it is how it affects our life and more specifically what are some

21
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,280
strategies that we can use to to overcome that I lived in New Zealand for a long time

22
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:38,459
and the classic saying there is hey no worries mate

23
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:44,280
you know it's their way of saying everything's fine you know it's no problem no worries mate

24
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,860
but it's a lot easier to say than than actually have a mind that's free of

25
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:57,840
worry and just understanding what worry is and why it's uh such a stubborn uh unhelpful

26
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:05,280
mental state yeah it's basically fear basically fear that something is going

27
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,620
to go wrong in the future now the thing about worry is that even if everything's

28
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:18,500
perfect right now everything could be perfect right now like every need and desire met

29
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:24,540
still we can ruin it by worrying about the future worrying about now

30
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:31,560
everything's great I might lose it then we start to worry and so if

31
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,019
worrying becomes a habit then will never really be able to enjoy

32
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:42,060
our life even if everything is wonderful because

33
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:49,980
worrying doesn't allow us to to be joyfully present we'll be thinking about the future and all the things that

34
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:55,500
possibly could go wrong and one of the things about worry is

35
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,900
that because it is concerned with the future

36
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:06,900
and the future is unknown it's basically infinite you could worry

37
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,939
about anything and it's really only limited by the the

38
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:20,100
scope of our imagination so if you have a good imagination and a tendency towards sometimes worry

39
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:26,880
it's just you can imagine kind of any scenario and think yeah you know whether

40
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:33,660
it's realistic or completely unrealistic you could think yeah yeah that could happen what about that what if that

41
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:41,040
happens so that's that's a terrible way to live

42
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:48,120
right and it really does make it very difficult just to enjoy life you know

43
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:56,100
even when everything is actually pretty good now as we know there are realistic

44
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:01,199
dangers or things that could go wrong in life absolutely and I always sometimes

45
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:07,919
going to have things happen in the future that we don't want or that are unpleasant absolutely

46
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:14,820
but there's no there's no reason why we can't live

47
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:21,000
in peace and relative contentment in the present knowing that will happen in the

48
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,580
future a wise monk once said

49
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:36,419
if there's a problem and there's a solution then you just apply the solution and no

50
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:42,600
need to worry and if there's a problem and there's no solution then

51
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,440
why worry

52
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:55,560
so you realize yeah why is it that with all of the drawbacks of worrying you

53
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:03,120
know it's exhausting it can be mentally exhausting it can be physically exhausting it really doesn't allow us to

54
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:10,259
to be present doesn't certainly doesn't allow us to fully enjoy what we have

55
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:15,740
then why is it that it's so difficult to let go of

56
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:24,539
it's because like unlike many other mental States or negative mental States worry is often conflated with wholesome

57
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:31,919
qualities such as care love or maybe even just being a responsible person

58
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:37,139
as if we're not worrying about something if we're not worrying about a person if

59
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:42,720
we're not worrying about our children or our parents or partner then it's as if

60
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,419
we don't care it's like it's it's almost saying you're a bad parent if you're not worrying

61
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:53,699
about your child uh or if you're not worried about your

62
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:59,460
future people think something wrong with you you're not being responsible you know

63
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:06,120
learn how to grow up and be dour and worrying about about the future like

64
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:14,160
everybody else so to be able to to to separate

65
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:22,259
the wholesome qualities from the unwholesome qualities you know it's not always easy but it's essential say yes we want to be loving

66
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:30,780
and caring how do we do that without falling into the the darker side of of

67
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:35,940
worrying yeah a worrying as an expression we think somehow is

68
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:42,180
expression of Love Actually no it will be able to love and care much more fully

69
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:48,539
if we're not worrying right so being able to begin to see how

70
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:55,380
these are not the same thing and separate them out and the same thing with taking responsibility there are so many ways

71
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:02,520
that obviously we we do need to take responsibility for many things in our life things that are

72
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:08,400
maybe conducive to worry Financial worries Health worries they go together

73
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:15,660
Health Care finances just all manner of of things that we may

74
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:21,139
need to to look into and take care of in our life

75
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:27,780
but applying the solution or taking responsibility for something

76
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:33,899
doesn't mean that we have to worry about it especially uh if wording just becomes a

77
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:40,020
habit then maybe the same repeating thought can just be cycling around over and over again and it

78
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:47,880
becomes very counterproductive so then how do you actually

79
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,920
stop worrying it's not like we can just say you know worrying is is

80
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:59,600
counterproductive I'm just going to stop because if it's an entrenched habit

81
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:06,660
and if we're not fully aware of what's going on it has a lot of momentum and it will

82
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:13,200
just keep going and going and going so it's not just a matter of yeah I'm

83
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,420
going to stop worrying but then before we know it you know it starts cycling through our

84
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:23,820
mind again so I can give you uh some good

85
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:29,880
strategies to work with that and then that will that will be a start to put it into

86
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:37,980
practice and then you can apply these I'll call them four very helpful strategies to any situation where we

87
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:45,839
might be worrying whether it's worrying about a loved one uh worrying about situation at work

88
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:52,740
worrying about the future of our finances we're you know it's just endless amounts of things that we

89
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:59,880
possibly could worry about so any subject you can apply these four

90
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:06,300
basic principles so the first we should be fairly familiar with is

91
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:11,459
clear awareness right you just have to start by knowing

92
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:19,260
when worry is present it's so Insidious if it becomes like a like a default

93
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:28,279
position of our minds that uh there's an underlying uh anxiety about the future

94
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:33,959
underlying feeling of insecurity you know like something's not right

95
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:40,560
things could fall apart at any second which is kind of realistic too but

96
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,459
the the fear is the problem right if that becomes

97
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:51,959
a basic underlying default position of our minds

98
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:57,899
then we need to see that clearly

99
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:04,860
right and and not just accept that as a reality or as what's normal

100
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:10,140
so clearly seeing worry when it's present

101
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:15,420
right just watching and noticing as soon as it arises

102
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:20,700
now in order to understand worry you don't have to bring it up

103
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:26,100
if your mind if you're looking at your mind and you're free of worry

104
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:32,760
fantastic enjoy that and really pay attention like

105
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,860
close attention to a mind that is free of worry

106
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:43,920
because it's intrinsically Pleasant it feels peaceful it feels content even if

107
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,440
it's just for a few seconds right just clearly notice the mind that's free of

108
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:57,120
worry because our minds will naturally incline towards

109
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,700
that which is Pleasant if we just give it the right information

110
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:08,820
now if we're not paying attention to our mind when it's free of worry we're only paying attention to the thoughts that

111
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:14,100
are conducive to worry are giving fuel to it then those thoughts

112
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:19,880
worry fueling thoughts become our entire reality

113
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:26,220
so if we pay attention to also that when our mind is calm or

114
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:33,360
quiet or at least free of worry then what we pay attention to will

115
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:41,839
become stronger and our minds will incline towards that because it's intrinsically Pleasant it's peaceful

116
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:52,980
so you don't have to bring up worry there's plenty of times that worry will

117
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:59,100
arise by itself you don't have to bring it up in order to understand it

118
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:04,740
but when it does arise notice his presence but then also notice

119
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:13,380
what preceded that if you can without getting caught up in the the story within the thoughts just

120
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:18,839
notice what preceded that and then notice its presence

121
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:26,760
and then notice if you're just watching it eventually it will stop so notice the cessation

122
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:34,620
and then when it ceases pay close attention to that that mind which is is free at least temporarily

123
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,940
not worrying

124
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:49,740
so the second of these four strategies is developing a

125
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:57,720
a wisdom in action a reflection trying to understand the nature of what

126
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:04,620
worry is the nature of fear how it how it arises how it affects our

127
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:09,959
life and essentially the subjects about which we might be

128
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:16,139
worrying about if we truly understand the nature of

129
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:21,480
things we're not going to worry it's only because we have

130
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,940
unreal unrealistic expectations

131
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,920
because we identify with certain things

132
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:39,720
if we don't understand the the true nature of something then

133
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:44,940
of course it leads to a certain delusion around it and that is conducive to all

134
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:50,600
sorts of unwholesome mental States but particularly worry

135
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:56,639
so if you understand things if you understood reality

136
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,699
very clearly you would not worry and it's not a question of everything going

137
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:09,959
right in your life to be free of worry right after the Buddha was enlightened

138
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:17,300
he had so many difficult uh things happen in his life

139
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:24,240
managing the Sangha his cousin tried to kill them numerous times things that probably most of us

140
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:30,060
don't even have to deal with and yet as far as we know the Buddha never worried about it he never worried

141
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:36,959
his mind would not go to worry so it's not a question of getting everything externally perfect

142
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:46,620
it's not like it's not like you know if you're sitting on a a beach at a at an exotic Resort

143
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:52,620
surrounded by the perfect family the drink in your hand they think oh that's definition of freedom of worry

144
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:57,800
but freedom from worry but the reality is

145
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,940
unfortunately a lot of people at places like that are worrying about their

146
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:09,540
business so worrying about their family they're just unable to fully enjoy even when everything is externally

147
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:14,480
perfect it's really a matter of internal work

148
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:21,240
so understanding the nature of whatever it is that we're worrying about

149
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:28,380
right you can use kind of active reflection if it's uh a personal relationship for example

150
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:34,699
we're worried about another person or a relationship with another person

151
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:43,019
understanding that yes every relationship is is uh temporary subject to cessation

152
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:48,839
constantly changing it's going to end someday most

153
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:54,180
things in life are out of our control right

154
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:59,339
if we can be at peace with those things then that alleviates a lot of sources of

155
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:04,980
worry about understanding things correctly so I mean that's a big subject in and of

156
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:10,140
itself or how we identify with with people

157
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:15,418
we can identify with other people's bodies and Minds

158
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:21,120
as if somehow they belong to us right even just the the phrasing that we use

159
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:27,178
you know my partner my children my parents my my dog whatever

160
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:33,960
right if we identify with something then there's a certain amount of possessiveness wish to control it or

161
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,299
almost like we think we have the right to control it if it's ours

162
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:46,620
and so challenging that that's unrealistic I mean other people and things don't

163
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:52,080
actually belong to us in the big picture and even this body in this mind is

164
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:59,120
mainly out of our control to say nothing of other people's bodies and Minds

165
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,799
so using wisdom to be able to reflect and understand the nature of of people

166
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:10,919
and relationships and and how we relate and essentially how we perceive others

167
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:18,000
you know the reality we create through perceptions that are projected out

168
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:27,419
if we understand that more clearly then we realize it's really nothing to worry about right

169
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:32,240
things may happen in the future that are unpleasant

170
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,400
so so what right things have happened our whole life sometimes that are

171
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:44,940
unpleasant have we made it through have we survived is it sometimes difficult sure but we make it through

172
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:51,059
the future will probably be the same this is how you take the the energy or

173
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:56,640
the strength of any kind of fear and and uh

174
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:06,000
just look at the fear and challenge it and say if that actually happens

175
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,400
would I still be able to survive continue uh

176
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,980
uh grow sometimes even its most difficult situations which where we grow

177
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:25,020
the most and if we can be at peace with the the

178
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:31,919
the subject of what we're worrying about the scenario the realistic or unrealistic

179
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:37,380
then it takes all of the energy away from that that fear

180
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:41,720
it's like it doesn't have the power to control us anymore

181
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:51,480
but it's it's difficult to develop wisdom if our minds are very scattered and

182
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:58,559
agitated so leads to the next the third recommended strategy which is meditative

183
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:04,740
calm it is uh

184
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:11,220
it's so helpful to be able to develop this skill

185
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:17,520
right even if you're sitting meditation today and it feels like most of the time you

186
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:23,580
weren't Mindful and most of the time you were thinking still even if you have

187
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:29,220
a short amount of time during meditation or throughout the day where you feel

188
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:35,340
mindful present centered grounded even if you can just

189
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:41,640
take a few deep breaths before your mind starts to spin out

190
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,740
again that's good that's a start that's the it's a skill that we all have the

191
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:53,100
ability to develop and generally wisdom will go as deep as

192
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:57,679
our level of meditative calm

193
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:05,280
and it's also a way just to to overcome worry at any given moment because

194
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:11,220
a mind of worry connect simultaneously coexist with the mind of

195
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:18,320
calm contentment so if you just take a few deep breaths

196
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:24,059
feel a moment of contentment and calm then at least that breaks the cycle it

197
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:31,640
starts to break the habit and then of course you know the more we do that the better

198
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:40,740
now the fourth fourth strategy is look at our lifestyle

199
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:46,380
sometimes there are things we can actually do to uh live a lifestyle which

200
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:51,900
is going to be less conducive to worry right um

201
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:57,360
if if we're regularly doing things that are for example illegal we might worry

202
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,400
more or if if there's certain ways that we

203
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:10,260
relate to other people that is conducive to worry you might think maybe it's not it's not only

204
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:15,840
changing our attitude towards worry but also maybe we could make some Lifestyle

205
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:21,299
Changes is there a different way of relating to people or a situation taking

206
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:28,700
responsibility for things which would then allow create a life which is

207
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:34,679
less conducive to worry and there are there are usually is you

208
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:42,200
know certain changes that we could make and even if

209
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,880
even if the changes that we make don't seem to make a difference just

210
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:54,659
knowing that we've made an effort and we've really tried our best that in and of itself

211
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:59,820
makes it easier to accept whatever happens in the future and once we have

212
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:05,000
that acceptance then we just don't tend to worry anymore

213
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:12,480
so these are for uh things that can be applied to pretty much any situation

214
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:18,000
whatever you might be worried or feeling insecure about or whatever fears might

215
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,480
arise it may take a while it's not like you

216
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:31,500
can just you know say oh now I've got the answer and suddenly your mind is calm and free

217
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:38,000
of worry but they have to be applied again and again and again

218
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:46,679
and one of the things that that helped me a lot overcome worry I I find I don't worry

219
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:54,000
that much uh and there's a lot I could worry about

220
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,080
there's there's a lot in my life I could worry about if I was prone to worry

221
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,580
but one of the the things that I had done

222
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:13,260
previously when I was a monk I would do what's called tudong right

223
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:19,440
but which comes from the Pali word tudanga which means anesthetic practice

224
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:27,260
and real tudon means you basically I would just go out

225
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:35,460
typically I would take say a month and go to a distant location and give

226
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:42,780
myself a month to get back to the monastery somehow but I would have no money we're not

227
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:48,000
allowed to have money we're not allowed to store food so I didn't have any food

228
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,340
uh uh didn't know where I didn't have any fixed plans

229
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:58,919
that's very important no fixed plans it's not like I had a bunch of places

230
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:06,120
lined up where I was going to go because that that gives the illusion of security and

231
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:11,580
you have fixed plans in your head makes you gives you a delusion that you think

232
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:19,220
you know what's going to happen in the future but if you just determine no plans

233
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:26,600
so no money no food don't know where I'm going to stay no vehicle of course

234
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:35,039
now if my mind was conducive to worry that going on tudong would not be any

235
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:40,860
fun at all it would just be like oh my God where am I going to sleep

236
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:45,960
am I going to have food tomorrow how am I going to get back how am I

237
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:51,960
going to get anywhere right so if I was prone to worry I realized

238
00:25:51,960 --> 00:26:00,419
pretty quickly this was not going to be any fun so I had I had just to learn how to trust

239
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:07,340
trust that if my intentions we're good

240
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,840
then I would trust in the results that came from that that's basic law of comma

241
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:19,140
you can phrase it in different ways you say if if you if you do the right thing the universe will look after you or if

242
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:23,480
you look after the dhamma the dhamma will look after you

243
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:34,020
but I realize that almost everything was out of my control in that situation

244
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:40,980
but one thing I did have at least an illusion of control over was my intentions

245
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:48,600
I could keep generating wholesome intentions what is my purpose why am I here what am I doing this for clarifying

246
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:55,380
that purifying that and then and then

247
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:02,460
and then whatever results came from that just learn how to accept it some would be pleasant some would be unpleasant

248
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:08,039
but what I found was that I never went hungry I had some strange

249
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:13,679
combinations of meals sometimes but I never went hungry I always had a

250
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:20,880
I always had a place to stay somewhere um even if it was outside yeah most of

251
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,980
the time it was outside somewhere and I always

252
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:34,980
I always got back to the monastery I always survived and I had the greatest experiences that no

253
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:41,940
amount of trip planning you know prior to going could have imagined

254
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:49,159
so if I had tried to control everything by planning everything out it would have been much

255
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:55,380
much less enjoyable it was not doing that I had the most amazing

256
00:27:55,380 --> 00:28:01,320
synchronicities happening because every day I would just wake up

257
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:06,419
and say okay which direction do I go today I'm going to wait for a sign or

258
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:11,820
something to happen and and sometimes it would just be meeting someone and say oh

259
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:17,760
well you know I live over you can come this way if you want and come with me or you can stay at my place or I'll give

260
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:25,679
you a ride here and then okay and just wait for uh wait for a sign to see which

261
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:31,980
way I'm going to be going that day and then yeah what I found is that when

262
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:39,000
I wasn't trying to control the future and I wasn't worrying about it

263
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,620
I was just very very open to whatever would happen that

264
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:53,340
it was life was the best there was better than it was it was so

265
00:28:53,340 --> 00:29:00,679
much better than than normal and of course once I got back to the monastery I have many

266
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:06,659
responsibilities and schedules and you know you have to have

267
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:12,440
a schedule so I couldn't live like that always but

268
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:17,640
this lesson of how to trust that seemed to carry on

269
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:24,419
just really trusting that if my intentions are good I'll Trust in the results

270
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:30,960
right and that carried on and so I would try to to do that for many years

271
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:37,260
I did that practice every year now

272
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:44,460
so give it a try sometime but the basic idea that comes from it is

273
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:54,120
that you know it is possible to overcome worry and and really trust put your trust into

274
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:59,159
something larger and then good things come from that and then

275
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:04,919
things work out okay so I offer this for your reflection

276
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:07,580
this morning

277
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:18,679
and then if anyone has any questions

278
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:23,720
feel free to ask if anything you're curious about

279
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,700
yes

280
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:36,779
thank you for your talk do you have a any books that you've written

281
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:43,020
or that you would maybe even recommend regarding what you've been talking about this morning

282
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:48,779
not specifically on the subject um I have written some books and

283
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:54,679
articles but mostly on samata and vipassana

284
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:02,179
but not specifically on on overcoming worry if you're

285
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,679
thank you very much

286
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:23,460
I too I don't believe in worry um I've practiced not worry for many many

287
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:28,620
years and one of the things you said about intentions I think I have

288
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:34,559
confidence in my intentions and that really helps me to not worry

289
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:41,399
um and your month-long trip the question I had was if someone offered you a ride

290
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:46,799
and I'm in a vehicle were you allowed to take it and I think you said yes oh yeah

291
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:52,740
I could accept yeah okay okay I didn't have to walk the whole way so it might take longer than a month

292
00:31:52,740 --> 00:32:00,600
okay good yeah well my when I was married and in my 20s my husband and I

293
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:06,000
just took off to Europe and hitchhiked through Europe and we didn't know where we were going

294
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:13,340
exactly we just went from day to day and place to place and it was really lovely

295
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:19,980
I don't know if I could do it today but it was lovely and so yeah I agree with

296
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:25,260
you worrying is useless not that I don't do it

297
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:29,179
it's yeah it's counterpredictive

298
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:41,279
hello it was really relevant to me thank you

299
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:48,840
so much for the talk but I think in general the women us

300
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:54,080
tend to worry more than men is that that's what I think

301
00:32:54,080 --> 00:33:01,340
especially I think it's in a nature as a mother to

302
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,760
make sure that the safety or things are taken care of right

303
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:13,980
so my question is how do you

304
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:20,039
get that balance it's it's really tough to be

305
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:26,279
prepared for a certain because it's like we can't always

306
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:33,539
say okay if I'm in my intentions are okay if the universe is going to take care of me it might happen but it might

307
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:40,399
not so how do you strike that balance between being prepared

308
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:47,220
and not worry I think being prepared in some ways is also a little bit because

309
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:55,140
you're worried and you're being prepared right right well first of all I'll say

310
00:33:55,140 --> 00:34:02,399
um I know my my mother used to say yeah I would I'd be off traveling around Asia

311
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:09,540
or something and she was like oh I'm really worried I said don't worry she said I'm a mother I have to worry

312
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:16,320
which is not true but I can't really stop her from worrying because that's tied up

313
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:22,560
with caring and love right so this is how do you separate

314
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:28,260
the the destructive aspect of fear and worry which is unhelpful

315
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:36,118
from act from care and love and being responsible and preparing right

316
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:42,960
of course we need to make plans and and contingencies to do our best you know to

317
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:49,260
be responsible so things work out in the future right yes definitely but

318
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:55,919
if we're always let's say there's a big difference between being responsible and then constantly

319
00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:02,640
worrying about the future and what could go wrong it's a very it's like our minds get in a habit of

320
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,680
seeing the negative all the time the potential problems and

321
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:15,060
and then that becomes sort of uh just how we see the world it

322
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:20,460
just feels like there's always a big problem right around the corner there's

323
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:25,859
always things that could go wrong at any moment there's things that could go wrong because we're always

324
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:32,520
our minds going to worry all the time as a habit or fear

325
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:41,220
and then that becomes you know I mean so many people just base their lives and actions and a whole

326
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:47,060
sometimes their whole life is based on fear fear of what other people think fear of

327
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:53,040
not you know fear of not pleasing our parents or you know it's just so many

328
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,680
types of fear that may control our life how do we how do we start to separate

329
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:05,460
that out clearly I mean I don't know what it's like to be a mother but

330
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:11,119
we you can develop the nurturing caring

331
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:16,800
loving side of things without the

332
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:24,380
without the worry is that possible give it a try

333
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,440
thank you

334
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:40,920
thank you so I'm a mama too and I really hear you on this and what was coming to

335
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:47,820
me is that art and that dance of mothering

336
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:53,700
with good in I know I don't like these things with good I feel like I want to sing

337
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:58,740
um good intentions and

338
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:05,220
the trust that you spoke of because setting it up the planning I mean I I

339
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:11,760
agree with you because I think as mamas we manage a lot right we're managing us and then all our little ones sometimes

340
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:19,859
the spouse so there's a lot of control going out my twins just turned 16. I'm sharing

341
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:28,800
this with you because I'm still standing and I had the gift of being reminded that

342
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:34,020
it's putting it my journey has been my journey putting it out there arranging

343
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:42,359
offering and then releasing and then and in that making the choice

344
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:48,960
to not fall into worry but to to instead embody

345
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:57,240
trust and give the energy to my faith right to all that you spoke of

346
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:03,960
the intention the knowingness the knowing that at every turn the wave is going to be exactly as it

347
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:11,640
needs to be so I practice that every day and I go tumbling constantly

348
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:16,920
but it certainly helps to abort the worry

349
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:23,400
the the laying it out the writing of it and the knowingness that will land where

350
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:28,440
we need to land I guess I hope that's helpful in some way

351
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:35,180
can't stop the worry but but can ride a little better right

352
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:46,859
I guess I try to look at it a little bit more logically one of my one of my biggest fears has

353
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:53,460
been ending up a bag lady on Market Street so Financial Security especially as I

354
00:38:53,460 --> 00:39:00,060
get closer to retirement has always been a big concern so I break it down into you can't

355
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:08,760
control the market right so uh you know I break it down into goals

356
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:15,420
concrete steps that I can take and things that I can do you know like

357
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:20,760
using certain index funds for my investments steps that I can take having

358
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:28,020
more Roth Investments you know just logical things that I can do and then after that you just have to

359
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:35,880
give it up you know you can't control certain things you just can't control them so you take action on the things

360
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:41,940
that you can control and then you just acknowledge that there's things that you can't control

361
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:49,140
or politics you know God help us in 2024.

362
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:54,420
um but you know there are things that you can do you can get involved in campaigns

363
00:39:54,420 --> 00:40:01,079
you can contribute to certain campaign funds you can write Congress people so

364
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:07,619
there are certain actionable things that you can do you can talk to people about issues

365
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:13,740
but you know you can't you cannot control what other people do how they

366
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:20,520
vote things like that and of course the meditation and just learning that you can't control everything in

367
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:26,339
life so you know there are certain aspects you have to know what you can control

368
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:32,760
and what you can't control and I think giving up that control is important and it's important to accept

369
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:38,000
and realize yeah

370
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:43,560
as a the longer I practice the more I realize the the things that I can't

371
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:50,160
control get bigger and bigger and bigger I realize well what actually can I

372
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:56,700
control and even my intention is like it's sort of an illusion of free will

373
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:01,820
and control rather than actual control

374
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:08,460
uh thank you so much I just had an observation that

375
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:15,119
um being older and practicing for a while I worry much less and it's wonderful and

376
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:20,520
what worry will do we'll just kind of cancel out any sense of adventure

377
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:27,240
toward life so when I don't worry about a situation I have a sense of adventure

378
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:34,680
that replaces it it's like well this is going to be interesting to see what happens instead of worrying which doesn't do anything except take the joy

379
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:40,320
away right for anything you know you're like clinging on to see what's going to happen and then there's

380
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:46,320
the next thing and it's not even that thing that's so important to me it's just the fact that you know

381
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:51,420
I have a need to kind of be on the lookout all the time you know

382
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:58,920
for any potential you know and I have to have them all lined up but definitely for me when I do

383
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:06,200
have periods of time where I didn't worry first of all it's so relaxing and then there's a sense of adventure

384
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:10,400
instead of a sense of fear so

385
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:17,940
yes I mean Life Fitness Adventure that we don't really know what's going to

386
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:23,040
happen even if we are very responsible and competent we don't know what's going

387
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:31,700
to happen we could go all sorts of different directions so just treat it like a a big two-done

388
00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:52,260
it just had a quick question on worry of course so uh do you think

389
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:59,880
you know it's it's kind of human nature to worry um so instead of not worrying is it like

390
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:05,400
blood pressure you know goes up but then you calm down pretty quickly so the idea

391
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:13,020
is to really come to that Baseline fairly quickly rather than say don't worry

392
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:20,040
well worry can be completely eradicated through just through wisdom yeah

393
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:26,280
it you can say that worry is human nature but you can also say that anger is human nature a delusion is human

394
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:34,020
nature and all of that is true greed is human nature but we that doesn't mean we have to live by those principles or or

395
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:40,740
just um be complacent about it no we can overcome those things we can focus on on

396
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:45,780
the Opposites um self-nesses and and uh and non-anger

397
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:52,859
and wisdom that's also Human Nature so yes I mean if if we're humans and we

398
00:43:52,859 --> 00:44:00,359
sometimes worry yeah that by definition is human nature but we can see is this a is this

399
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:06,720
conducive to happiness or not and if it's not conducive to happiness we don't have to follow it and then the

400
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:12,119
Habit will get weaker and weaker and especially when we start to see the

401
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:18,359
see some of the positive feedback you know oh and I don't worry I'm actually even more at ease

402
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:25,319
I can feel I can recognize the blessings in my life I feel more content

403
00:44:25,319 --> 00:44:31,200
all right there's a lot of you know and then it becomes easier and easier to to break

404
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:37,680
that habit yeah but certainly whenever worry arises

405
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:44,819
if you can recognize it quickly right that's like first strategy mindfulness clear

406
00:44:44,819 --> 00:44:50,819
awareness as soon as it arises catch it quickly before your blood pressure gets too high

407
00:44:50,819 --> 00:44:56,160
take a few deep breaths or maybe a quick reflection say ah you know it's not

408
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:02,760
really my it's not mine it's out of my control or it's whatever and then kind of come back to being

409
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:09,140
centered and balanced the more quickly we can do that the better

410
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:17,040
I I have one other question so I was at a event with the Dalai Lama and you know

411
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:25,140
he was talking about this uh monk uh Ani monk women monk in Tibet

412
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:30,359
that got burned and had a lot of um you know torture and stuff like that

413
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:37,020
and he just burst out crying and then but so I was very surprised you know

414
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:42,359
like you would cry at you know like show his emotions but then he kind of calmed

415
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:50,220
down so how do you explain that I know you're not you can't represent Dalai Lama but

416
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:57,920
is that kind of normal or he should have not cried

417
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:03,859
uh Dollywood Dalai llamas can do whatever he wants

418
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:11,819
well no I mean there's nothing wrong with uh showing emotions but it

419
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:17,160
you know love is an emotion loving kindness uh compassion these are all

420
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:23,160
emotions too right and so we're just trying to emphasize the wholesome

421
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:30,240
emotions that lead to happiness and peace benefit for ourselves and benefit for everybody else

422
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:36,660
so I mean a situation like that you know that Dalai Lama was a case

423
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:43,940
where there's somebody who has potentially a lot to worry about right representing his whole country

424
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:52,440
culture threats against his life uh his uh Sangha members being tortured

425
00:46:52,440 --> 00:47:00,180
yeah it's it's very touching so it's not surprising that it was very you know it was very painful

426
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:05,420
very very painful to to reflect on that

427
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:11,460
I have a question um it's about the travel experience and

428
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:20,880
like you know going without money and I'll they think he said it's the term for it uh too long okay

429
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:26,460
so do you think like you know when you went for the travel you I'm assuming you

430
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:34,339
were in Asia and like do you think the amount of worry changes based on the society you are in because like you know

431
00:47:34,339 --> 00:47:39,420
certain societies are more trusting and if you you know the condition that you

432
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:44,520
gave like it basically defines a homeless person like in in America I

433
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:50,640
feel like they have more struggle than if you are in Asia right like you know people are I think

434
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:55,800
have that sense of like you know I want to help my Society move this is my

435
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:02,700
observation could be wrong that's how I felt so do you think our worry I mean levels of you know worry changes based

436
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:09,660
on where you are or has it been true for you so what's the difference between the noble practice of tudong and being

437
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:16,140
homeless well first of all yes I went too long sometimes in Asia

438
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:22,140
and that has certain benefits and drawbacks but most of my two dong was in

439
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:27,500
uh New Zealand right uh Western Country

440
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:32,640
non-budhist and I would go to remote places where they had never seen a real

441
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:38,760
Buddhist monk before and it's like people think they're not going to feed

442
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:44,640
you why would they feed you they don't have no idea even what you're doing

443
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:51,240
and say yeah I'll find out then we had to adjust it a little bit

444
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:59,420
according to culture but we're not allowed to ask for anything so I would just stand silently in front of the grocery store

445
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:06,540
yeah yeah I mean it helps if you have a Buddhist

446
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:12,599
robe okay a shaved head Monk's robe it's like okay

447
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:19,740
that's an archetype that people can tune into and even if they've never seen a a

448
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:27,180
live Buddhist monk they've probably seen it on TV somewhere and it's like okay so a spiritual person of some

449
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:34,500
type and often they would want to give me money right and I was then I can say oh we're

450
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:40,380
not allowed thank you very much but we're not allowed to accept money we can only accept offerings of food and then

451
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:46,020
more often than not they would say oh okay well just wait I'll get something inside you know they're going shopping

452
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:55,220
anyways so on the way out you know they pop a sandwich or or apple or something into my ball

453
00:49:55,380 --> 00:50:01,920
um so there was a slight adjustment for culture which we would not do in

454
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:07,140
Thailand for example Thailand if you're walking uh in the early morning with

455
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:12,180
your ball people know what you're doing but they wouldn't know that in New

456
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:18,540
Zealand so but I think that's a good example of

457
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:24,359
if you just listen to your fears you're not you wouldn't do it

458
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:30,300
all right you miss out on some of the best experiences if you just listen to your fears about

459
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:36,119
the worries about what could go wrong how people won't recognize what you are

460
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:42,480
people might you're not going to get food you're going to go hungry it will be terrible

461
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:48,480
people might harass you well none of that happened

462
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:54,599
right it was just like 99 positive experiences I met

463
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:59,819
people that would never ever come to Buddhist Meditation Retreats and uh or

464
00:50:59,819 --> 00:51:05,940
or monasteries we had some fantastic conversations and

465
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:13,380
and feel like I was really retouching people you know so it was very gratifying and it was just wonderful in

466
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:18,960
every way but so no even in

467
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:24,300
even in uh any I think any society you know

468
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:29,240
if you can really put yourself out there with the right intention

469
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:34,700
it's going to be a learning experience one way or another

470
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:49,200
uh-huh with the four strategies just to repeat yeah sure so the first is is clear

471
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:57,839
awareness recognizing when where is present uh second is active wisdom using

472
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:04,619
our reflection to understand the subject that we're worrying about if we truly

473
00:52:04,619 --> 00:52:10,200
understand the nature of that subject then that will that will the worry will

474
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:15,960
dissipate and but it's difficult to have clear

475
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:22,619
reflection if our mind's not at least somewhat calm if it's very scattered

476
00:52:22,619 --> 00:52:30,000
right because otherwise it's just like scratching the surface so if our mind is calm then our reflection has an

477
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,460
opportunity to sink in more deeply and be more transformative and the fourth

478
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:42,780
one is making actual Lifestyle Changes you know practical changes in our in how

479
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:49,579
we live that would be less conducive to worrying or Rising

480
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:08,780
Mr okay I have a really Petty question why was the cousin trying to kill the Buddha

481
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:18,119
Sangha politics office politics

482
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:24,240
um his cousin was a talented meditator but

483
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:31,200
was unenlightened and he he got the idea that he should be the one to be the

484
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:38,180
leader of the entire monastic Sangha and he had he had a certain following

485
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:44,460
which kind of bolstered his delusion around that and so he thought

486
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:50,760
if he just killed the Buddha then he would be able to to be the one to to take his place and Lead this whole

487
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,059
community

488
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:04,279
so be grateful for your all your cousins who aren't trying to kill you

489
00:54:13,619 --> 00:54:19,680
okay all right maybe we can bring it to a conclusion then all right thank you for

490
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:24,020
inviting me nice to see you today

491
00:54:28,819 --> 00:54:32,000
