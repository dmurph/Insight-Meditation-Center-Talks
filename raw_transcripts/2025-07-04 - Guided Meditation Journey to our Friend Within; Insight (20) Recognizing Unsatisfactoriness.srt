1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:07,359
So hello and welcome welcome to this uh

2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:13,120
meditation on freedom on the American

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:19,439
the freedom day here in the United States. And may it be that we understand

4
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:27,119
the full depth of inner freedom that uh can be the great foundation for

5
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:34,480
an outer freedom for a whole country. And so we are here to

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,600
uh learn about samadei and insight

7
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,640
as a foundation for a phenomenal capacity for an inner well-being and

8
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:53,360
inner freedom. Uh and the simplest way of understanding it is freedom from

9
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,840
suffering. And uh the more a little bit more

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,400
developed understanding of it is that um it's the freedom that will allow the

11
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,320
most beautiful and wholesome parts of our heart to take the lead for how we

12
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,159
live in this world. So

13
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:26,880
um so if you are going to

14
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,680
if there's a very dear wonderful friend old friend that you

15
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,360
haven't seen maybe for a very long time maybe decades even because of whatever

16
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,960
circumstance but it turns out that they're going to be in town and there's a 1-hour period

17
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:54,640
that uh they're available to have lunch with you and uh and you're looking forward to

18
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:01,920
that. that's important for you and and so maybe you have things you have to do that morning and so you're

19
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,879
involved with your responsibilities and and you've set it set enough time aside to get to the place for lunch and to

20
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:15,599
meet with your friend and uh and then you heading there. You're walking to it or driving there,

21
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:22,160
whatever you're doing and um and then you start uh

22
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,239
getting notifications about emails. You get notifications about wonderful opportunities.

23
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:36,000
You get uh see billboards. You go past stores with interesting displays of

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,440
things for sale in the window. Uh you go by

25
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,560
a uh important demonstration that's happening for some kind of social

26
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,239
justice issue that you're it's dear to you, important for you. you go by

27
00:02:52,239 --> 00:03:01,120
um uh you know so all kinds of things all kinds of things happen on the way and uh

28
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:10,640
you understand very well that you only have an hour with your wonderful old friend and so you just hold the course

29
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:17,599
you stay you have important thing to do you don't get distracted you don't get pulled into these things and in a

30
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:24,480
certain way some of them are clearly distractions. Some of them are clearly

31
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:31,280
uh unsatisfactory in general to could be involved in

32
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:39,280
window shopping for things you can't even buy and getting upset about why you can't buy them. Uh some of them are

33
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,120
valuable to do, but given how wonderful it would be to see your friend,

34
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,519
uh it's unsatisfactory or it's it's less satisfactory. It's like what's really important now is here to see this

35
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,879
wonderful friend. And so you hold the course. You're so steady and you're not

36
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:02,560
a aver aversion towards anything. Isn't just like now this is what's the task at

37
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:11,120
hand is. So when we meditate we are here to see uh in a sense a long

38
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:18,320
lost friend. We become our own best friend. We become invaluable to just to

39
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,000
connect to ourselves to see parts of ourselves that easily gets lost in the

40
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,680
busyiness of daily life in the preoccupations of the mind in the

41
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,360
obsessions of the mind and uh the advertisements the notifications of the

42
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,120
mind provides us the images that become window shopping in

43
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:49,440
the mind that there's so many ways the mind can go. But we have this very important task

44
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,600
and in relationship to this important task of really connecting deeply here

45
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,880
to the best friend within that uh all these other things are less

46
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,080
satisfying, less important, not important enough to get sidetracked

47
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,520
with. So part of the function of samadei, part of the function of

48
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:18,800
insights, part of the for for samadei is to hold the course to to stay here in a

49
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:28,560
nice supportive peaceful way, not straining, not pushing but steady here.

50
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,240
And the function of uh insight, one of them is to understand that anything else

51
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:41,280
that pulls us away takes us away from this really important task at hand. That

52
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:48,639
these other things, as important as they might be to think about, to be involved in, to react to, they're less

53
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:55,759
satisfying. the less meaningful with in in this wonderful hour we have wonderful

54
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:03,680
few minutes we have to deeply connect to something profound here within us and

55
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:10,240
for today I'd like to say that uh the capacity to discover uh the uh the best

56
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,479
friend that you will ever have can be discovered deep inside of your own self

57
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:23,639
and um so to assume a meditation posture.

58
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:37,039
And I suspect that for many of you that if you sit down at lunch with this old

59
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:45,199
good dear friend, you you sit down, you don't automatically slump into the chair.

60
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:52,160
probably there's a certain kind of alertness in the posture, delight in the posture,

61
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,720
like oh here we are and there's a certain kind of wonderful energy arising

62
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:06,240
from deep inside that animates your posture about the goodness

63
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:15,319
of this moment and to offer this to yourself

64
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:23,840
to meet yourself. Sit down with yourself with a posture that you're going to meet

65
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,759
a dear respectful friend

66
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,560
and to gently close your eyes.

67
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:43,520
And just maybe you can bring a smile to your face, a

68
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,840
half smile, at the delight

69
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:56,240
of meeting this old friend that's been with you your whole life,

70
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:05,440
but maybe, just maybe, hasn't really been seen or contacted that often.

71
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:11,960
But how fortunate it is to sit down here and now

72
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,759
and then to begin the process of settling and stabilizing

73
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:33,919
so that there's a kind of a direct

74
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:40,279
undistracted journey

75
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,919
to be with a friend.

76
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:55,720
Taking a few long, slow, full breaths.

77
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,760
Settling in on the exhale.

78
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:27,000
Taking a deep breath. Relaxing the body.

79
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:43,959
Inhaling and feeling a broad sense of the body.

80
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,760
Exhaling a broad release of the body.

81
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,760
Letting

82
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,959
the breath return to normal

83
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:22,200
and continuing a process of settling

84
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:32,480
In every relaxing of the body, let it be a relaxing into

85
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:39,440
the grounding spot of breathing.

86
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:47,839
The place where breathing begins or ends in the depth of your torso.

87
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,720
Settle into there.

88
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:02,000
Feeling on the inhale. Feeling muscles of your face.

89
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:10,839
Exhaling. Relaxing the face. And relaxing. Settling into

90
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,880
the breathing. Feeling

91
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:36,519
the shoulders. And on the exhale, softening the shoulders

92
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,720
while at the same time is settling into the grounding place.

93
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,720
Feeling

94
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:05,240
the belly and settling into the belly.

95
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,200
Quietly breathing

96
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,160
but connecting

97
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:11,720
to the grounding place. The deepest place where you can feel and sense breathing in your body

98
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:23,120
and to let go of all things, all thoughts, distractions,

99
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:30,000
concerns because breathing

100
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,680
being absorbed in breathing

101
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:41,160
is the direct journey to see

102
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:50,519
your best friend within, to meet the best friend.

103
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,279
And nothing at this moment

104
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:06,040
has any any more importance than visiting your friend.

105
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:16,120
Everything else is not as satisfying, not as important,

106
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:22,519
takes you away from something invaluable.

107
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:32,440
And for these minutes here with the support of your breathing,

108
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,680
stay on track.

109
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,440
Stay with this gentle journey

110
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,800
that will take you closer and closer.

111
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:57,959
to meeting a best friend within.

112
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,559
Having

113
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:49,039
the wisdom to see

114
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:57,760
that you're involved in distractions, anything that distracts you

115
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:03,200
from being on this very valuable journey. me

116
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:11,159
to sit down here with something invaluable.

117
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,480
The deepest friend within.

118
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:32,159
Stay on the journey. Stay present.

119
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,960
with what's valuable here and now deep inside.

120
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:47,880
Either because you feel it, know it,

121
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,240
or you feel and know the journey there.

122
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:10,360
And then as we come to the end of this sitting

123
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:19,400
to take a moment some moments to

124
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,640
feel recognize eyes.

125
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:33,360
Whatever is really good about being present here

126
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:38,679
in the meditation in yourself.

127
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,559
Is there some way of being present here and now?

128
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:58,520
That's satisfying for you

129
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:06,880
or at least more satisfying than how how you usually go about your

130
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:12,840
day and go about your thinking and preoccupations.

131
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:20,679
Is there some way of being alive right now?

132
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:28,880
that you'll miss once you get up from meditation and get

133
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:35,000
involved in the activities of your day.

134
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:47,440
And if there is some way of be being right now that's

135
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,440
valuable for you or you appreciate,

136
00:28:52,960 --> 00:29:01,039
why give it up? Why sacrifice it

137
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:06,279
for a way of being that's less satisfying?

138
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:23,080
Maybe what you're discovering here in meditation

139
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:36,080
can be a way in which you can meet anyone

140
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:41,240
as if they're a good friend.

141
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:47,559
A simplicity of being, a simplicity of presence,

142
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:55,279
a clear attention to others in an undistracted way

143
00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:02,399
can be the vehicle for kindness, for friendliness,

144
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:07,799
for respect, care.

145
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,720
May it be that this meditation that we do

146
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:21,200
is here for the benefit and well-being of this world.

147
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:30,679
May what we learn here in meditation help us to enter the world

148
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:40,320
with a gift of well-wishing. May all beings be happy.

149
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,440
May all beings be safe.

150
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:51,880
May all beings be peaceful.

151
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,080
May all beings be free.

152
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:12,759
[Music]

153
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,720
Thank you.

154
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:36,559
So hello and welcome to this uh next talk on series on insight

155
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:41,919
uh the deeper insights into what's usually called the three

156
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:47,519
characteristics. But in the early uh teachings of the

157
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:54,640
Buddha, these are called the three perceptions or the three recognitions

158
00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:01,600
that as practice deepens, we begin recognizing something that's invaluable

159
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:08,159
in helping us on the path to freedom, to liberation, helping us on the path to connect to the

160
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:13,919
deepest parts of uh well-being that we can have.

161
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:23,440
And the first of these recognitions is a deeper and deeper recognition, perception, a wisdom around inconstancy,

162
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,720
impermanence, change, things becoming different.

163
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:34,399
The second one which is a topic right now is a deep recognition, a deep

164
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:39,720
wisdom, understanding about

165
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:45,440
duka. And the word duka is usually translated as suffering when it's

166
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:52,960
translated into English. And as such is maybe a neverending process of becoming wiser and wiser

167
00:33:52,960 --> 00:34:00,559
about how we suffer, how we have stress, destress, how we have

168
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:06,880
uh make things worse for ourselves. uh and in doing so to understand

169
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:14,638
something more and more about the opposite of uh suffering maybe in shorthand we call it happiness

170
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:20,878
and uh sometimes maybe peace because the primary way the Buddha talked about uh

171
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:26,158
positive emotions that come into play with the deeping deepening practice with

172
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:35,919
the freedom is happiness and peace or maybe the opposite of uh is um some

173
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:43,520
deep feeling of uh contentment or satisfaction or being at home in our in ourselves in

174
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:49,599
this world in this body. And so to begin appreciating

175
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:55,520
that we can have wisdom, a deep understandings can arise from how from

176
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:01,839
suffering itself. Rather than seeing suffering as only a problem, only

177
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:08,320
something unwelcome, only something overwhelming, only something that we should get rid of and fix and take care

178
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,760
of, only something that tells us that we've do we've done something wrong or

179
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,800
something like that. The approach here in the dharma is to be

180
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:26,480
able to be willing to see uh suffering as a vehicle to freedom as

181
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:33,280
something not to shy away from but something to see directly and honestly so we can come to a deep understanding a

182
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:40,240
deep recognition of what's happening here and the nature of suffering itself.

183
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:45,839
And um and in this regard different people will have different translations and each different translation of

184
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:51,119
suffering of duka is valuable perspective window to see it in a

185
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:58,560
different way. And uh one of the translation translations that people like to prefer

186
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:06,640
is uh unsatisfactoriness that um uh so the simple way of saying

187
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:12,960
it is that everything is always changing and there's something very deeply

188
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:21,440
unsatisfactory about trying to stop the change, trying to hold on to things as they are.

189
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,880
uh and um and it's unsatisfactory because it doesn't work. If uh you're

190
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:34,400
trying to stop yourself from aging, um people spend a lot of money to

191
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:43,119
somehow stop the the signs of aging. Um faceelifts and makeup and exercising and

192
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:52,000
all kinds of ways we're trying to stay young in some way. some of them it's valuable to do and uh and have you I'm

193
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:59,119
not not saying we shouldn't do some of it but if we're attached to it holding on expecting to be successful for our

194
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:07,760
whole lifetime uh that's going to cause a lot of suffering and um we will age and we will

195
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:14,800
our bodies will change our capacities will change and if we're holding on to how things were

196
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:22,880
um that's un an unsatisfactory effort. Uh it's much more satisfying to

197
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:28,880
find our freedom with change, to find our capacity to open up and be expansive

198
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,560
and to be delighted and happy and peaceful with all the inevitable changes

199
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:39,839
that will happen in this life. This is a tall order in all the complexities of

200
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:45,359
life. But uh don't don't choose one really

201
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:53,760
complicated deep way and say that that this is not right. I have to feel like it's unsatisfactory or not right.

202
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:59,839
But we can become wiser and wiser in recognizing that the activities of our

203
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:05,520
mind, what we're preoccupied with, what we do with our mind is uh that the

204
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:11,760
craving, the holding on, the tightening of the mind that is unsatisfactory.

205
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:17,920
Maybe in some ways we can recognize it's very unsatisfactory to continue with this example

206
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:23,760
uh to lose our capacities as we got older to have all kinds of things change

207
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:29,839
as we get older. It's it's not very satisfying, of course.

208
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:35,040
But what the dharma is looking at is how it's unsatisfactory

209
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:41,680
to cling to it or resist it that what we're adding on top of it we can feel uh

210
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:47,520
is not the best for us. It's making things worse. And um and so as we

211
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:52,880
practice more and more uh the sensitivity, the insight that can come

212
00:38:52,880 --> 00:39:00,960
uh the recognition, the understanding, the perception that becomes clearer and clearer is what activities in our minds

213
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:07,920
that we do, what sources of motivation, impulses to how to live, how to speak,

214
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:14,000
how to act in the world, how to think, how to understand the attitudes we have.

215
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:22,800
What where there does it start feeling unsatisfactory and the beauty of this dharma practice

216
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,240
is that it is not a matter of analysis. It's not a matter of you know

217
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:33,599
calculating how unsatisfactory it is or having some policy that it's

218
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:41,440
unsatisfactory but rather we're settling ourselves. We're quieting ourselves. We're touching

219
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:47,440
into something that's here inside of us that's deeply satisfying.

220
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:54,400
That it's satisfying to feel peace. It's satisfying to feel at ease with oneself.

221
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,440
It's satisfying to be calm. It's satisfying to have some deep wellspring

222
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:05,839
of happiness and well-being. That there is something satisfying way of being.

223
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:11,119
Just enough. It doesn't have to be dramatic. Just enough to see

224
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:17,599
that the activities or what we do with our mind those are and where we lose the

225
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:23,359
satisfactory feeling that those feelings are unsatisfactory

226
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:28,800
and this is what many people are blind to. There's a compulsivity. There's an

227
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:34,400
authority to our preoccupations, our concerns, our

228
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:40,560
attachments. The ways we get stressed, the ways we get tight, the ways we feel like things have to be different, the

229
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:45,920
ways that we resist, the ways that we hold on to me, myself, and mine. The

230
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:51,440
ways that we we think that uh we have to save the world. There's so many

231
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,920
different ways that uh we're convinced

232
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:05,280
to give up our deeply satisfying inner peace for agitation, for stress, for

233
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:10,640
suffering. And that we're so convinced in it that

234
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,839
uh or sometimes obsessed about it, so attached to it that we don't even know

235
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:21,440
we're distracted. We don't even know the sacrifice we're making. We're so

236
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:29,359
distracted by distractions, we don't even know we're distracted. We're so involved in our stress that we

237
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:36,400
don't think it it need can be any other way. We give so much authority to our

238
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:42,480
self-t talk, our ruminations, our self-criticism, self-p preoccupations,

239
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:48,800
those thoughts that we believe it can't be any other way. This is the truth.

240
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,960
And the way it makes it um undermines us, the way that the way we think

241
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:01,200
depresses us or alarms us or or distresses us or makes us feel guilty or

242
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:07,680
inadequate. Uh it just feels like it's just part and parcel of the truth.

243
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:14,400
And uh we're so involved in it, we don't think there's any other option. This is the how things are.

244
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,839
And uh so this way in which we lose ourselves in unsatisfactory states of

245
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:26,720
mind that seem so real and so convincing and so absolute.

246
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:34,319
We need powerful medicine to break through that and learn another way.

247
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:39,920
and samadei settling meditation insight

248
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:45,359
deeper understanding can be a powerful support and one of the

249
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:52,800
ways is to begin appreciating that that we the whatever way we are now

250
00:42:52,800 --> 00:43:01,200
there's some connection some deeper way fuller way happier way of being just enough that we recognize that the

251
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:08,400
different way is unsatisfactory Maybe we're already stressed,

252
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:15,119
but then something else happens and now we're even more stressed. And the and

253
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:20,880
what the understanding is, you know, the previous stress was was better. Now I'm

254
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:27,599
involved in some higher stress. So it might may just to be silly example, maybe you're late for an

255
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:33,280
appointment and so it's stressful and you're kind of involved in trying to get to the place on time and you're worried

256
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:41,359
about the consequences of being late and then um you see a window display in

257
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:47,680
a store and it isn't just simply you're attracted to it, but now you're stressed

258
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:53,680
because you you you know you want to have it and you want to get it a good

259
00:43:53,680 --> 00:44:00,160
price and should you go to some other stores to check it out and now you can feel your stress level go even higher

260
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:06,319
than it was before. Wisdom tells us oh to add this level of

261
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:13,200
stress is unsatisfying. This is unsatisfactory and we have a clear insight clear

262
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:19,680
recognition understanding of something that's now it's unsatisfactory. I don't have to do this.

263
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:26,960
As the stress levels go down more and more, we get a better better reference point for how this works. If we're

264
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:32,480
already really stressed out, one more aspect of stress is we don't see the

265
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:37,920
difference. It's all just a pile of stress. As we get calmer and calmer,

266
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:44,079
settled in better, that insight into unsatisfactoriness

267
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:50,319
becomes more and more uh clear. And then if we get below the stress

268
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:56,720
level and start feeling a sense of well-being that gives another different kind of

269
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:02,800
vantage point for how we sacrifice well-being for something which is activity of the mind which is

270
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:10,319
unsatisfactory. And over time we get more and more wisdom about not only about what is

271
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:15,599
unsatisfactory unsatisfying but what the mind can do.

272
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:22,240
But even more important, we see we have the the opportunity. We see we can

273
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:27,599
not take that road, not get involved. We can let go of that, not do it. We have a

274
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:36,319
much better thing to do. We have something much more valuable to do. And that is to come back here in a

275
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:43,520
deep way because it's in here in ourselves we discover our best friend.

276
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:48,800
We discover the deepest levels of care, love, peace,

277
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:54,480
happiness, well-being. Here is where we discover an inner beauty

278
00:45:54,480 --> 00:46:00,480
where we can really value ourselves in a deeper deeper way as our best friend.

279
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:07,599
And that in turns this deeper insight into unsatisfactoriness

280
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:13,680
also allows us to see other people in better ways because we begin recognizing

281
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:19,760
the unsatisfactory ways which we add projections, judgments, interpretations

282
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:26,560
on them. That diminishes our own happiness but also does very unfortunate things

283
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:33,119
for the people that we're with. And to see the unsatisfactoriness

284
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:38,480
of bringing stress to other people, the unsatisfactoriness to see them in a bad

285
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:45,040
light. And the deep satisfaction of seeing people in their goodness, and

286
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:52,800
their kindness, and their potential, in what's possible in them, and to bring

287
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:58,880
love and care, respect to everyone.

288
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:05,119
May insight into suffering, insight into unsatisfactoriness,

289
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:12,160
support you in a wonderful process of choosing the

290
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:18,240
satisfactory way of living your life moment by moment.

291
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:25,359
So, thank you on this Independence Day in the United States and um where we're

292
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:30,880
learning how to find independence and freedom in

293
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:38,240
our own hearts and may the freedom and independence of our own hearts be the foundation for

294
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:43,839
what we offer the world. So, thank you.

295
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:51,599
And uh one announcement that maybe interests a few of you. I was just reminded and kind of delightfully that

296
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:59,920
on Tuesday evenings on the east coast it's at 700 p.m. the insight meditation society has

297
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:07,520
a online offerings. long time ago they invited me to come to their book club uh

298
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:15,760
to talk about my translation of the Dhamapada ancient uh very important ancient canonical text poetry

299
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:22,720
and uh so I'll be doing that on Tuesday and it's free as part of the book club

300
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:29,040
and partly I'm kind of delighted and inspired somehow that um almost 700

301
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:35,920
people have signed up for it so it's not like a small intimate book club which maybe I thought it was going to be but

302
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:42,079
it had maybe with that number of people I thought wow this this is a different kind of experience so I thought maybe I

303
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:47,760
would offer you a chance to come as well.

304
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:55,000
So thank you very much and I look forward to coming back here on Monday.
