1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:08,639
so good morning everyone and welcome to IMC I'm delighted that you're here and we get to

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:18,199
be together and um one of the purposes of Dharma talks

3
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:23,560
is to teach about the practice of mindfulness practice of the Dharma

4
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:29,080
practice and so we might talk about meditation we might talk about mindfulness in daily life we might talk

5
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:35,360
about the practices of Ethics all kinds of things and and one of the principles of

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:42,879
mindfulness is everything is practice so one of the very important practices in Buddhism that is the

7
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:50,680
practice of listening to a Dharma talk which is what we'll talk about

8
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:56,079
today and uh and so one of the interesting things about talking about

9
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,359
Dharma talks the practice of listening to a talk is that all of you for the

10
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:08,640
most part are going to be listening to this Dharma talk and so it's about you and you're

11
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,720
listening so I want to um uh read this little story from this book The

12
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:22,560
Monastery within a monastery within a young woman from another

13
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,840
country moved with her family to live for one year in a town near the

14
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,520
monastery when in the course of the year she discovered the monastery she would

15
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:40,840
periodically visit to have discussions with the abis the abis introduced her to

16
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:47,799
meditation which became very meaningful for the young woman when the family's one yearlong

17
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:53,240
stay was drawing to an end the young woman said ask the

18
00:01:53,240 --> 00:02:01,360
abis in my country there is no Buddhism and no one has even heard about about

19
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,799
meditation how can I continue to learn and deepen the practice you have started me

20
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:13,680
on the abis said when you return home ask far and

21
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,760
wide for who among the wise people is

22
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:26,319
recognized as having the greatest ability to listen ask that person to instruct you

23
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:33,160
in the art of listening what your learn about listening from such a person will teach

24
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:39,280
you how to further your meditation practice the art of listening those

25
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,120
people who were the direct Disciples of the Buddha were called in the ancient

26
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,959
language the listeners the Savas those who listened and in the ancient world

27
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:57,480
listening was a primary way of getting information from others there was no

28
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:03,720
nothing written really at back then and there was no you know Twitter

29
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:10,400
or to get all kinds of things uh it was all through the voice and people if they

30
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,799
wanted there's no libraries so if you wanted to uh remember what was being taught you

31
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:24,640
you really had to pay attention closely so it went in and stayed there so you can remember it afterwards it's a very

32
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,560
different way to listen if you're taking something in in order to retain it for the future

33
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,159
requires a higher attentiveness a higher receptivity a higher sense of presence

34
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:43,799
less distraction less scattered of the mind and um it turns out that those

35
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:49,040
qualities are really important for the Dharma

36
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,599
practice and in fact when the Buddha when he gave Dharma talks uh he gave

37
00:03:54,599 --> 00:04:00,360
particularly profound teachings when he understood that the

38
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:06,920
audience the mind of the audience people in the audience was ready

39
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:14,120
receptive free from hindrances um uh uh

40
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:21,440
elated and bright the word bright sometimes translated as confident

41
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:27,880
trusting so there was a a recognition that a certain State of Mind can receive

42
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,919
teachings in a very different way then uh if you're scattered and spinning

43
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:38,919
and preoccupied with all kinds of things if you're if you have an attitude of resistance and you you know you don't

44
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:46,199
like this you don't want to be part of this or something um how we are how we show up is actually very important part

45
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:54,680
of the listen the practice of listening to a Dharma talk and it's so so significant that

46
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,919
um um there's if you're listening Ling to a

47
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:10,919
Dharma talk for the Dharma you'll find it the Dharma in the

48
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,520
listening so it's not in the words necessarily it's not out there in the

49
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:25,520
speaker but you turn the attention backward on itself what you're looking for is in the

50
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,400
attention what you're looking for is in the looking what you're hearing for is in

51
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:38,160
the hearing it's a quality of attention that we're really focusing on here and then

52
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,560
with a a certain quality of attention we have then we are can listen and be

53
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:50,720
receptive in a way that's uh touches something really deep inside so there's many ways of

54
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,520
practicing with the Dharma talk and uh when you listen to them and and what

55
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:04,120
strikes me as I give this talk is how how much listening to Dharma talks is going on in this world in a way that I

56
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:11,160
don't think has ever gone on the history of humanity I mean among some people I mean there's still a majority of people

57
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,840
in the planet don't listen to Dhat talks but uh but those in people in our

58
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:23,120
scene it's phenomenal how much people listen I mean when I was uh growing up

59
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,599
in the Dharma I was lucky if I had listen to One Dharma talk a week sometimes might

60
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:36,560
be a month before there was an opportunity to be with the teacher like it was in the monastery we didn't have D Dharma talks that often and the Abbot

61
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:44,080
didn't come through that often and sometimes we'd have two or three in a row two days and three days in a row but then he wasn't around and and so to this

62
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:52,960
idea of listening to a Dharma talk was kind of unusual and uh in um in the you know in

63
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:59,919
histo in historical times not so many decades ago in Thailand there are stories of uh people who are really

64
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:05,440
serious about the practice who would walk for weeks because you know you couldn't get

65
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:12,039
in a plane you couldn't go in a train they'd walk for weeks searching from for a teacher who was going to give them

66
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:17,199
teaching so imagine you know the preparation that takes and imagine

67
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:23,280
showing up to hear those teachings after all that searching for that person walking through the jungles of Thailand

68
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:30,160
and you know and contending with tigers and wild elephants and finally you find that person and said well I don't really

69
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:38,599
feel like it today and um so uh so you know it

70
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:44,639
brought a certain kind of seriousness attentiveness and there is a lot of seriousness about listening to Dharma

71
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,840
talks but they're so readily available uh through technology now and there are people now who listen to

72
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:56,280
Dharma talks every day and some people I know who do more and sometimes you know

73
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:01,720
it's been a tremendous support and help for people uh listening to talks and

74
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:09,280
sometimes it's a lot better than the alternative that's available to them with their own mind and activity and whatever's going on and this regular

75
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:15,960
listening to it and people listen have discovered all kinds of ways to listen that didn't exist in the old world I

76
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:23,080
know people told me they listen together with friends it used to be when they I guess before Bluetooth they would have a

77
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:29,080
wireless you know wired mic with two you know for one for each year but the friends would walk along with one in

78
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:34,120
each other their ears walks they go for walks and just listen together that way

79
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:40,039
or people go for runs people listen to Dharma talks going to work and

80
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:46,959
um and so there's something something that about Dharma talks and now now it's just not budism even it's podcast people

81
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:52,279
listen to there's something about the oral word that people aren't reading as

82
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:59,279
much as they used to dharm used to be that Dharma books was the thing to do and uh and kind I grew up in Buddhism

83
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:05,320
was mostly in the books and I had whole art to how to read Dharma books that really when I was in

84
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:12,600
the monastery to really to the reading itself the way I read was the

85
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,040
Dharma and um and but now we're going to the oral which is historically what

86
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:23,640
always happened and there's kind of different richness in the oral uh spoken

87
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,959
word it conveys much more than just sometimes the words do you get some kind

88
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:34,040
of the tone the speed the Cadence uh sometimes you're lucky or the teacher's

89
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:42,279
lucky uh something of the teacher's practice comes at through and how they speak and and so it um you know that it

90
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:48,120
conveys more than just the content in the words and so how to listen one of

91
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:55,120
the things is to listen to more than just the words to listen to what else is being

92
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:01,560
conveyed there's a some people talk about there's a transmission sometimes in a Dharma talk I've listened to talks

93
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:07,839
from teachers who just transmitted kindness and it just it was so wonderful just to feel the kindness they didn't

94
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,920
understand their talks but the kindness really touched me or the

95
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:20,959
compassion sometimes it was Clarity and sometimes some people were so clear on how they spoke the Dharma that I could

96
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:27,399
have certainly understand them but there was something really brilliant that it did to me to hear the clarity in which

97
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:32,560
it was presented like wow made my mind somehow clear and

98
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:39,800
listening there's uh some people um when they give talks uh uh their confidence

99
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:45,760
in the Dharma is what's contagious and the words are fine but what really changes the people who

100
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:52,279
listen is the wow this person feels has a lot of confidence inspiration around it I'm inspired Now by this person's

101
00:10:52,279 --> 00:11:01,000
confidence I bu you know something so there's all kinds of other things that we can take in besides the word

102
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,040
there's also um what we're listening for and I think that over time listening

103
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:13,360
to Dharma talks changes what people listen for uh I think when people are new it's

104
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,200
pretty common to listen for the content the words the meaning some people are and it's really meaningful and really

105
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,279
powerful sometimes to hear some of these teachings for the first time and

106
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:30,720
um and I've been told by people like the first talk they ever heard just blew them away or the first talk they heard

107
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,800
something shifted inside of them and um and for most of it's later

108
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:43,120
but you still it can happen but we're listening for information we're listening for practice we're listening for something that makes sense out of

109
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:50,600
life and often it's a content of the words that were what's being said as people start doing the practice

110
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:56,680
and maybe they've listened to a lot of talks the content is still important at times but there might be other things

111
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,800
that are going on that are important and um when I was in the

112
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:08,240
monastery um um I I listen we always would sit in

113
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,360
meditation during the talks so meaning even our eyes would be you know either

114
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,160
closed or in Zen you look your eyes down in the in Zen there was a very formal

115
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:25,720
meditation posture to be in so we would be in the meditation posture listening to talk with the eyes down there was no

116
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:32,320
nodding you know oh that's good which is nice because then this then the Dharma teachers gets feeds back

117
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,600
and you know and you know sees what's going on the energetically and stuff but we were just there sometimes and I I had

118
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:44,120
this wonderful wonderful uh there's a Zen upside down smile which I'm I'm very

119
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:50,600
capable of sitting there it probably looked a little intense but you know came from some some

120
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:56,120
things do with concentration or the ier and um but I would sit there and

121
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:03,760
listening to the abbit very attentively but what I what my mind I was in my meditation State and what my mind was

122
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:09,440
drawn into was the The Voice what's being

123
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,079
spoken and I would get more concentrated listening to the talk than I did in my own

124
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:21,639
meditation and that's not uncommon for some people to have something about a certain kinds of Dharma talk people get

125
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:29,040
absorbed into the words so they don't necess the words become more less and less important as they just kind of

126
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,720
right there not mind is unwavering not moving at all just absorbed in it and I

127
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,800
would leave The Talk completely still completely open relaxed I'd walk outside

128
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,880
and just be in awe of the sparkle of everything and the peace that I

129
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,399
felt other times I would be meditating with the talk and you know kind of

130
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:57,839
didn't hear much it kind of went washed right through me and that's a whole other art to do is to allow the talk to

131
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,519
wash through to stay present for it but don't hang on to the words don't repeat

132
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,720
them don't question them and don't apply them oh you know this is interesting and

133
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:14,279
you know and you know and now think about other ways I can I can listen to the Dharma I'm sure I now I have this

134
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:21,000
device in my kitchen that talks to me and I can talk to it and I can just call up all kinds of Dharma and you've lost

135
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,279
touch of my talk because you're already applying it and um the other thing is just is

136
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:35,279
just let it stay in it but let it wash over you wash through you with a principle that if what's

137
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,519
important for you to hear if there's something important for you to hear um

138
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:46,639
it'll stick it'll touch something so you don't have to be looking and trying and

139
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:52,440
straining to kind of find something and get something as if you know you're trying to grab hold on tight for

140
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:57,519
something important you want to just be very receptive and see what Finds Its

141
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:04,440
way to your heart or find ous way to some depth inside of you and I've had that happen to me where I was just

142
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:11,199
following along following along just letting it wash through and then I was but in this receptive state that I'm

143
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:17,759
in I hear a sentence hear a word boom you know something happens and I've

144
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,959
known people who it was just a word someone said and boom that just kind of

145
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:30,160
made shift at things or organized their mind their thinking or the puzzle of their life kind of came together and fit

146
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:37,480
together wow okay and um and uh a common thing that people

147
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:43,560
will say uh to Dharma teachers is you know I've listened to a lot of your talks and I think you've said this a lot

148
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:51,440
of lot of times before but I could never understand it when you said it today it just changed me oh boy it really made a

149
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:58,079
difference today because we weren't receptive the Mind wasn't prepared the life conditions hadn't come together so

150
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:04,920
that it made sense or could land in some deep way so uh one of the things that we want

151
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:10,120
to be careful for in listening to the Dharma talk is not to be listening in a

152
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:15,880
way that hinders benefiting from the talk and one of the ways that hinders it

153
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:22,040
is to begin doubting it begin Su

154
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:29,199
suspicious you know you know you know you know and I've seen people kind of come to IMC here and like

155
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:35,720
they're like looking out of the dark glasses and you know it's like you can feel like

156
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:42,959
they're like not having buying any of this and you know you know and um and um

157
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:48,880
leally looks that way and um the um but I know I know some

158
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:55,199
people many of us maybe I've certainly have this tendency to sometimes um uh

159
00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:02,600
have a bias towards what we don't believe or we don't like or what doesn't sound right to us not my preference and

160
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:08,438
there's some wisdom to that I mean you're not supposed to just agree to a Dhat because it's being taught being

161
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:13,520
taught um you shouldn't have blind you know trust in a Dharma teacher just

162
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:19,438
because they're Dharma teacher but um but there is something about the art of

163
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,918
taking in something that's challenging to uh and so one of the

164
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:31,679
things I've learned is um it's easy not to like something it's easy to see that

165
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:38,520
something is maybe wrong that's relatively easy and if that's the

166
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:45,919
case for you then it's wrong for you you're not getting any benefit of except maybe more

167
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:52,320
confidence in your opinionated mind you know that you're or your sense of I'm right and that you're wrong or

168
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:58,200
something so I don't want to dismiss people's your wisdom that you actually

169
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:06,280
just discern what's useful and not useful what's right what's wrong maybe that's a important thing to do however

170
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:15,480
even if someone says something which you don't like even you say something which you think is wrong it's probably not

171
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:22,679
100% wrong and so the the interesting question is to say to yourself well I

172
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:29,320
don't quite agree with that but let me see is there some pointer of

173
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:36,799
in some situation in my life where this thing will be useful so for example if they it's been

174
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:42,399
said that an unpopular Dharma uh theme for talks is

175
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:50,120
renunciation and so you know so as soon as the renunciation Dharma talk comes out sit back with the sunglasses on and

176
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:55,520
hat down and you know okay I'm not going to listen to this renunciation these

177
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:04,120
Buddhists they're just Party Poopers and um and so uh but instead if the

178
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:11,600
person asks themselves well I mostly disagree with this this renunciation is overdone the way Buddhists talk about it

179
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,840
which could be that's a fine opinion to have but let me think is there any you

180
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:25,080
think in this you know in this life of mine that I've lived or that I'm going to live is there any place maybe where

181
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:31,280
it'd be useful to learn a little bit more about renunciation so that's the right thing to

182
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:40,280
do and this person says sure enough uh there comes a time that pronunciation is

183
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:46,919
helpful the thing you've been looking forward to for months is watching the Super

184
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:53,320
Bowl and you just hardly listen to the drama talk because you're already you know thinking ahead to this afternoon

185
00:19:53,320 --> 00:20:00,240
you know and where you going to be and what you're going to do and how great it's going to be with the chips or something

186
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,720
and uh and so you know and and so you don't even listen to talk on

187
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:11,919
pronunciation but you know that was a topic and then you come home and it's about time for

188
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:20,480
the Super Bowl it's so exciting your neighbor calls and

189
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:26,880
says I have appendicitis can you take me to the

190
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,159
hospital no

191
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:40,200
and your neighbor says but aren't you Buddhist into pronunciation

192
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:47,159
no I have my priorities and I I want something I want

193
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:54,720
it and I don't want to have to do you know not want you know tough luck on you or in that

194
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:01,039
circumstance I think maybe you'd understand renunciation might be a good thing

195
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:06,200
renouncing the Super Bowl to get your friend to the hospital before the pentis

196
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:12,039
gets to a massive system you know infection throughout their body and they

197
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:17,640
die I hope that that would be warrant some

198
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:23,080
renunciation so so but the principle here I'm saying is rather than

199
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:29,320
disagreeing you if you disagree you might not benefit at all if you do the

200
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:36,799
exercise in what circumstance is this teaching useful is it beneficial then you find

201
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:43,279
some benefit and this uh this is part of the principle here also is you have to do

202
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:48,320
some work with the Dharma there is certainly a time to

203
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:54,320
listen to the Dharma just the words going through and wash through and not engage with thinking about it and

204
00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:00,679
there's a time to reflect and to think and and um and consider some people do

205
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:06,679
it during the Dharma talk some people do it after and uh and to never spend time

206
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:12,440
reflecting on it and questioning it both questioning it in you know how it works

207
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:18,000
what doesn't work all these things and try to get to try to get from it whatever is

208
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,880
beneficial then you won't benefit as much so which is okay but if you want to

209
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:31,159
benefit from the Dharma then do some work have friends you talk to some people

210
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:37,120
listen to Dharma talks and afterwards they talk with to friends about it to maybe listen to it as well and they kind

211
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:42,159
of go back and forth and find out you know what what struck them and what

212
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,240
questions they have and and it's a way of kind of finding more value from the Dharma

213
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:54,240
talk some people like I see someone right now maybe are are are

214
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:01,640
writing uh down some of the things being said in the Dharma talk some people find that very beneficial to listen and to

215
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:08,279
write and there are times I do that uh because uh I listen

216
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:15,159
better and I sometimes like I'm some the most common place I do it is when I teach with someone else and I feel like

217
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:22,080
I really need to stay on top of what they're teaching so that I can be in harmony with them or understand it so

218
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,159
then I I'll be kind of writing down what they say and I find I'm much more bright my mind is more attentive and more

219
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:34,200
present and I need sometimes I need that extra help because my mind might drift

220
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:40,279
off partly because I've heard so many Dharma talks and you so oh you know here we go

221
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:46,200
you know my mind yourself so so so but having the practice of writing I'm more

222
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,640
deeply engaged and I it isn't just that I'm more present and actually processing

223
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:58,880
the material better by that so that's a nice thing to do some people will Journal after the DH talk and write down

224
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:06,720
what came up for them or how it was um so the principle here one of the

225
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,919
principles I'm trying to convey to you is to be a active

226
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:18,480
listener in the same way that meditation is an activity that you give yourself

227
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:24,240
over to even though a lot of it's receptive a lot of it's It's like a not

228
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,480
doing it's also don't be a passive recipient of

229
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:35,520
Dhat that doesn't mean that you're straining or trying hard or you know uh

230
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:42,960
it means that you're maybe balanced upright receptive ready

231
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,799
available you're really here to be present for it maybe present in your

232
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:55,840
posture take a posture that really Expresses in people look at you oh that person's ready that person is really

233
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:03,279
here they're present here and now in their posture you can feel it in some people and you can feel when they're not

234
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:09,240
they're here yes but you know they're I know i' I've been some

235
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:14,559
sometimes in my life such a couch potato slouch that my shoulders were basically

236
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:22,080
in the bottom you know kind of where the bottom of the sofa and the side back

237
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:29,679
went up just like so you so um you know that's not ready

238
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:37,200
receptive so um and then and then I'll kind of bring it back to important point

239
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,840
I made at the beginning is that

240
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:50,120
um in in a very important way what you're listening

241
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:55,919
for is found in the listening the quality of the listening

242
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:01,480
the some characteristic of listening what we're trying to be mindful

243
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:07,520
of what we're trying to have mindfulness do for us is found in the quality of the

244
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:13,840
mindfulness itself what we're being aware of what we're trying to what awareness practice

245
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:20,679
is trying to do for us is found in the qualities of awareness itself so if

246
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:25,840
we're too focused on what's outside of us the object of attention what we're

247
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:31,440
listening to the what's then we're not paying attention enough to how we are

248
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:37,799
how we listen how we are aware how we speak how we

249
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:46,480
are the Dharma is found in the how not in the what so to sit in such a way that your

250
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:55,880
how you are is ready receptive free from hindrances free from

251
00:26:56,279 --> 00:27:02,399
distractions um this is the maybe the harder one

252
00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:08,440
elated inspired and then bright a bright mind a

253
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:14,600
bright attention and uh sometimes Dharma talks

254
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:21,919
can help that at least the Buddha did that it said it said in the ancient text that he would give talks that would

255
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:29,240
Inspire encourage brighten and Delight the people who listen

256
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:34,639
and then he would give his deepest teachings isn't that

257
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:42,960
nice so the practice of Dharma talks It's a Wonderful practice and um

258
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:49,559
I'm sure many of you who listened to talks have benefited from it otherwise you wouldn't keep coming back and maybe

259
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:57,240
this talk will just kind of give you a little bit more inspiration to notice how how you show

260
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:03,799
up to be listening to Dharma talk and I hope that over time you develop a

261
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:08,840
repertoire a range of ways to be with Dhat talk that depending on the

262
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:14,760
circumstance what's going on and how you are and you understand the different ways so you can choose the different

263
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:22,720
ones at different times as it serves you so those are my thoughts and uh

264
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,600
maybe some of you even practice this today as as I was giving the talk or that's for later

265
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:34,480
maybe today you just got the ideas so we have about 15 minutes and so

266
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:42,840
I thought maybe we can take about five minutes uh to um if you have any questions or comments about this and uh

267
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:49,559
or so and then few minutes where you can talk with each other about this little bit if you'd like and then uh we'll get

268
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:57,880
ready for the tea and and today I have to leave relatively or quick uh to go down and do more teaching um in s Cruz

269
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:05,080
so I won't be staying around so any questions any comments anyone like to

270
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:15,240
make it's lovely if you would say your name when you hi I'm Alex um I have a little

271
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:21,000
embarrassing question about listening actually so um I've been doing this

272
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,080
thing that uh you have taught called U on breathing in you connect on breathing

273
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:34,320
out you relax and it works for me phenomenally but then I was telling somebody about it and they asked me

274
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:41,399
connect to what and I realized I don't know actually that was a little embarrassing

275
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:47,120
and so the question actually is not whether what is it connected to the

276
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:54,000
question is should I find out from you what it is connecting to because it's working for me already right it's

277
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,559
actually not a joke yeah yeah so should I or should I just leave it as it is

278
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:06,640
well you just said that it it's working for you already so if something is working you want to be careful and maybe

279
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:13,640
not mess with it too much exactly yeah but at some point maybe whatever you're

280
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:19,880
doing when you connect you'll understand and when it's when the time comes you'll understand what you're doing what's

281
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:26,360
happening there but maybe you're not ready even to understand that you're just just go for the benefits and not

282
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:33,640
not now but it might be interesting to hear from you how you're benefiting because if you come back to

283
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:40,039
me and oh yeah that's really been helpful because it's been giving me really good lottery tickets I I connect

284
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:46,679
to Lottery T ticket numbers and then I'll say well that's not what I had in

285
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:53,679
mind but so it might you might have something you know better than lottery ticket numbers but you might um you know

286
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:59,440
hear from you that might be interesting and then maybe we can adjust something if it's

287
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:05,880
useful um so I think I I'd prefer to leave it like that uh some I mean in a

288
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:11,519
if you asked the question differently I would have been happy to have explained what I mean by that but right now I

289
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,039
don't want to mess with you

290
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:27,600
thank excuse me hi I'm Betsy and I was just just

291
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:33,039
reflecting that is this a way of of um

292
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:38,720
really practicing living and being in the present

293
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:45,919
and kind of getting an experience of being in the present I'm I'm kind of I I don't

294
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:51,840
totally have that Concept in my head but that it's a great it's a great question I think it's a reasonable question

295
00:31:51,840 --> 00:32:00,000
because we focus so much on meditation in our in our tradition here but um medit ation is just the the training

296
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,480
ground where we're like going to the gym so that we learn how to develop uh

297
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:13,679
mindfulness attention how we learn to develop certain degree of able to focus being non-distracted certain degree of

298
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:20,440
wisdom certain degree of compassion and care so that we learn it here in the gym

299
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:25,559
so that we that we that can become strong so then we bring it into our life

300
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:30,840
and in some ways that's you know uh at least as important as what happens

301
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:35,880
in meditation and the go the goal in a sense for our practice is not to have a

302
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:40,960
sharp line between the mind and the Heart in meditation and the mind and

303
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:48,639
heart in regular life and so that you have bring bringing some of these qualities of mindfulness attention into our life is definitely what we try to do

304
00:32:48,639 --> 00:32:56,679
and then what's wonderful is that these are uh reciprocal beneficial for each other what we learn in meditation we can

305
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:03,360
then apply apply it to Life as we apply it to life we learn things about ourselves that then we helps our

306
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,518
meditation deepen and so they two go back and forth and our

307
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:22,960
partners uh hi I'm Bruno and K quickly today you mentioned

308
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:28,360
something uh about a time when you were reading books about the Dharma and you

309
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:34,960
said that the Dharma is in the reading and today you're talking about how the Dharma is in the

310
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:41,120
listening uh is this is this related to the

311
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:46,840
concept of zazen and Zen or can you just

312
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:52,480
tell a little bit more about it I feel like the word Dharma is used in so many

313
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,519
different ways and I think today is the first time I I heard of this

314
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:03,519
great great very nice yeah so the Dharma is used many ways sometimes it means the teachings of the Buddha and then you can

315
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:08,560
go to a book for that maybe but uh uh

316
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:15,040
the book and uh the writing that way and just the words the concepts being given

317
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:22,079
in a talk that like today um uh if you spend too much time with that that's like spending all your

318
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:28,040
time in the restaurant trying to eat the menu as some point you have to order the

319
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:34,720
food and eat the food so uh the Dharma is not found in the menu the meal is not

320
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:39,960
found in the menu the the Dharma is only found in

321
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:47,280
you other it just otherwise it's just a uh and a uh you know Concepts and

322
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:54,520
ideas sometimes we can feel or sense the Dharma in other people their maturity how they've changed their freedom their

323
00:34:54,520 --> 00:35:00,760
their compassion we can feel it so so you can get a sense oh that person's really matured in the Dharma you feel

324
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:06,640
this maturity or development that they've had and that could be inspiring

325
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,839
but um it's still don't get too mesmerized by other

326
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:18,240
people be inspired by them but for you it'll only the Dharma will only be found

327
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:24,920
in you thank you right behind you there you have hi

328
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:33,119
uh I'm Jake um I was kind of curious like the other side of this of maybe the art of preparing a talk or

329
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:38,440
like you know giving a talk yeah and you've given thousands by now um do you

330
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:43,560
have any sort of rubric or like checklist or did maybe did you have it

331
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:52,880
in the past where you're like I need to try and capture these things in this talk or is it you know more free form

332
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:59,640
than that or do you start with think it's a good idea then you you get stuck on it and abandon things or I'm just

333
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:06,440
curious great great question my relationship to giving talks has changed over the

334
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:13,720
years and um and uh you know so partly because I've given so many and

335
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:19,440
and it's become a lot of what I do is become second nature and sometimes when I try to sometimes when I'm in when I'm

336
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:27,280
teaching people to become teachers or teacher training I'll explain to people what I do in a Dharma talk I I don't I I

337
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:33,119
think it's useful to teach them that but I feel very uncomfortable it because it sounds like

338
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:39,000
I'm being so self-conscious and so like you know fabricated something but but

339
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:45,880
it's all second nature and there's all these elements that go on things I'm paying attention to that's kind of in the background that's going on but from

340
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:53,319
having done it now for you know over 30 years and U I'm a slow learner that's maybe why I keep giving a lot of

341
00:36:53,319 --> 00:36:58,400
talks uh but when I was a new teacher the first 10 years years I often wrote

342
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:04,359
uh uh wrote out talks very begin First Years the the first two talks I gave U

343
00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:10,440
is in Zen and in Zen you're not supposed to have notes so I wrote everything out

344
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:16,520
and then I spent uh hours memorizing it and so I didn't use the notes

345
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:23,240
but you know it was all there memorized and uh and so then uh I had

346
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:29,040
notes and part of uh sometimes it was really great to prepare a Dharma talk by

347
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:34,200
um taking notes and outline or different things if I was in the flow sometimes

348
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:41,240
I'd settle into the topic or into the Dharma I would sit first meditate and then it felt like was continuation of my

349
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:47,319
meditation practice you know and I love the creativity that came out that way

350
00:37:47,319 --> 00:37:52,359
and uh so that wasn't a good good day and sometimes I would go sometimes

351
00:37:52,359 --> 00:37:59,960
go and read a few little different books and uh pick up a paragraph here or there and see and in a good day I would feel

352
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:06,160
like it would Savor that those teachings and take them in and contribute to the not just the ideas of what I was going

353
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:12,319
to teach but also the atmosphere of the teaching the sense or the quality of it

354
00:38:12,319 --> 00:38:18,280
and then at some point after about 10 years uh two things happened um I didn't

355
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:25,680
have I still had kids young kids at home I didn't have time to prepare anymore uh so that and then I thought my

356
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:30,799
talks got worse but people like them

357
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:38,560
more and then uh but the other thing that happened soon thereafter was that uh uh my relationship to Preparing

358
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:46,720
changed and I would sit down with a piece of paper to write notes and I'd literally feel a repulsive

359
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:53,880
force from that it was like I can't do that it's just like you know I mean was like quite something to feel this no way

360
00:38:53,880 --> 00:39:01,240
that was going the wrong direction and so go for a walk instead or go sit meditate instead and uh and then there a

361
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:07,599
whole different process um and uh sometimes now these days when

362
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:15,240
I give her T dma talk I have some basic idea in my mind I've kind of formed an outline just on my own thinking you know

363
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:24,040
or maybe three points or what direction I'm going to start with and then as I give the talk um the the uh the the path

364
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:30,319
opens up in front of me and I just follow follow the trail you know I'm following something and sometimes it

365
00:39:30,319 --> 00:39:36,200
takes me away from where I thought I was going to go and um and if

366
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:42,359
um and then also uh when I give a talk these days I'm also I'm still trying to

367
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:48,760
understand what I'm teaching that's my preferred stance to be in and so may maybe people who listen

368
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:55,800
to me think like I know a lot you know well get knows a lot or something I don't I don't have that internal sense I

369
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:03,040
mean I know I know a lot about Buddhism mean so that's true but my my inner feeling for myself is that I'm actually

370
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:10,240
on the edge of what I don't understand and I that's where I like to be so I don't know if that comes across

371
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:16,280
when I teach but I kind of that's I you know I'm exploring it with you kind of to some degree or trying

372
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:22,520
to and the other thing I've learned in these years of teaching and that's very important and

373
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:30,720
I'm and also trying I'm also trying to stay uh in touch with the feeling inside of whatever I'm

374
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:36,720
teaching there's a feeling tone there's a quality sentiment Sensations inside

375
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:45,720
that go along with it so I'm trying to feel my way into something too not just talk about it and uh so much so that uh

376
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:50,920
occasionally uh it was much more before but uh just occasionally happens

377
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:56,880
nowadays too I get into what I call for myself my explanatory mode

378
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:02,160
my wife will ask how' it go today and I said oh I fell into my explanatory

379
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:07,240
mode and when it's explanatory I'm just explaining something and my heart is not

380
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:12,440
in it it just ideas it's very dry it's like it feels like cardboard for me like

381
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:18,920
and sometimes there have been there's times where I I don't know I recognize it and I don't know how to get out of it

382
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:26,520
and okay I just have to put up with this today and this is how it is and U and um

383
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:31,599
so yeah I should apologize for those days because I don't like explaining

384
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:36,760
things even though I do explain things but there's much something much more important going on does that get kind

385
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:42,839
does that answer your question well enough satisfy your question but why did you

386
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:48,319
ask oh I like I've done a few myself over the years I'm sure people have like

387
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:54,040
probably in this room have thought about have done it or have thought about it so I was just curious to hear like your

388
00:41:54,040 --> 00:42:00,280
process or your approach to it great yeah great thank you okay so uh thank

389
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,640
you all
