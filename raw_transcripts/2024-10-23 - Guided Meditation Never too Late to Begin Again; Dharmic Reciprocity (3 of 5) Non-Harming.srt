relationship to the

36
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:16,960
practice so allowing the breathing to be natural normal

gently in a little still moment between the out breath and the in breath

45

allowing each breath to be just as it is

46
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:39,240

e e

97
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,559
in the last few minutes of this

98
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:30,960
meditation the invitation is to turn your attention [Music]

99
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:36,960
ention towards the quality the internal posture

100
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:45,240
stance of how you are in this moment about the

101
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,799
meditation what's the quality of the

102
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:57,159
awareness the attitude or mood in the heart

103
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:07,159
and whatever that is to include that too with an attitude of

104
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:17,279
care respect kindness

105
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:37,360
and then considering these moments of

106
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:47,640
meditation through that lens of appreciative

107
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:55,039
care any moments of

108
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:01,840
peacefulness calm a finger snap of

109
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,600
mindfulness stretches of unbroken attention

110
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,360
everything small or

111
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:27,840
large and drink it [Music] in so in the goodness of it

112
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:45,760
and then turning your attention outwards to the

113
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:52,240
others practicing in this moment together here or at other times

114
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,200
even in Wishing them well

115
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:08,320

117
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:19,320
ease and

118
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,360
free and extending these wishes outwards further towards everyone your life

119
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,519
touches directly and

120
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:43,639
indirectly may all beings be safe

121
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:47,960
peaceful and free

122
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,240
thank you for your

123
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,880
practice e

124
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,960
oh welcome welcome dear sa especially those of you

125
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:36,200
who tiptoed in a few minutes late into our virtual

126
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:44,559
space today is like to offer some Reflections it's

127
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:53,360
the third of a series of five on dharmic reciprocity what we offer our practice

128
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:59,360
our lives and the resonance what we receive

129
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:07,240
which can be direct or indirect and today as I've mentioned to many of you

130
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:15,079
those of you who've been here this teaching is Loosely based on a little obscure sutta um discourse on the

131
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:22,240
qualities of Integrity in giving and um today I'll start by just

132
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:29,919
saying what the Buddha said about this he said a person of Integrity gives in such a way as not to

133
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:38,158
harm themselves or others even slightly and implicit in the language

134
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:43,679
this is written in poly is a resonance in the non-harming

135
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:50,800
term of kind and [Music] caring kind and caring

136
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:57,920
attitude so in giving of ourselves our time material Goods excuse me this means

137
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,119
self-care is key

138
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:08,720
self-care the Buddha describes a wise person of great wisdom as someone who

139
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:16,480
does not wish for affliction suffering harm for themselves others

140
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:22,079
themselves or others or the world but

141
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:28,320
rather a person of Integrity a wise person

142
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,839
offers wishes for benefit of self other

143
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:41,320
and both as well as all concerned so don't leave yourself out

144
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:46,599
don't leave yourself out from a Buddhist perspective this

145
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:52,079
means practitioners that's us were encouraged to cultivate a baseline

146
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:59,119
approach of nonharming that's based on care not just for our common Humanity ity but our

147
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:06,160
common sensient with all creatures each being's wish no matter

148
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:12,599
how buried or thwarted is to live to not be

149
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:19,920
harmed this wish weaves through nearly all sensient life most of the

150
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:26,400
time the impulse the commitment to care and non-harming appears over and over

151
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:32,359
again in the Buddhist teaching often it's the first step of

152
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:38,000
practice and there's this little phrase that appears over and

153
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:44,800
over again setting aside rod and weapon a practitioner dwells compassionate with

154
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:52,079
care for the welfare of all living things all living beings isn't that

155
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:59,440
beautiful that's often used at the very first very first first step of engaging

156
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,480
in serious meditation practice when a person would go to become a follower of

157
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:12,119
the Buddha and so it's not so surprising that this um emphasis on non-harming

158
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:17,839
ripples through all different dimensions of Buddhist

159
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:24,760
practice it's core to the compass of Buddhist ethics to not kill not steal to

160
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:29,800
not engage in sexual misconduct lie or

161
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:36,920
intoxicate in ways that lead to heedlessness those are kind of the guard

162
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:44,000
rails nonharming can include preventing harm through

163
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,400
giving and this impulse is not limited to humans I love this anecdote so in a

164
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:56,960
2017 study scientists finally looked into documented and confirmed anecdotal

165
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,319
stories this these marine biologists have been hearing for years and the

166
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:09,640
stories have been that um ship after ship had noticed this mobbing behavior

167
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:15,760
in humpback whales and what happened was you know humpbacks and other whales hear

168
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:23,440
through the you know communicate through Quicks and other sounds that transmit through the water and they would hear

169
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:29,319
another whale in distress or even another mammal in distress from being

170
00:38:29,319 --> 00:38:35,000
attacked by killer whales orcas and they would come and encircle

171
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,520
the threatened animal and protect it from being

172
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:46,160
attacked and they would beat off these orcas with their Mighty fins and the

173
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:51,839
scientists even found scarring on these huge fins from

174
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:56,040
protecting the innocent

175
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:03,920
this non-harming impulse can also take the form of practical care I ordained

176
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:11,520
for a time at a monastery in Yan mymar Burma and very early on I was inspired

177
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:17,079
inspired to learn that the teacher there established the first free clinic in the

178
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:22,880
city quite a large city donated the monastery donated the land they donated

179
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:30,400
the material Goods the medicines and the doctors and nurses would come andol unteer and offer their time to the

180
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:38,280
poorest of the poor people who could not afford any other medical care that same place donated land to

181
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:46,400
Buddhist nuns running an orphanage and all of this it was kind of just unspoken very humbly done because

182
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:53,880
it was natural it was an outgrowth this offering out of a deep commitment to

183
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:58,240
care to kindness

184
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:05,160
and ripple effects through the local area as you can imagine were

185
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:10,240
significant and the people who lived in the monastery were loved cared for by

186
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,880
the community in turn this

187
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:22,480
reciprocity inal practice non-harming this internal attitude the

188
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:28,920
inner voice of kindness in the mind and heart is a huge

189
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,240
gift to yourself and your

190
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:39,000
practice again the means Echo the

191
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:47,160
ends the best we can do to bring an attitude of gentleness care when encountering not so

192
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:52,520
helpful internal habits some of us have learned it's so common in our culture to

193
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:59,680
internalize judgment blame self-criticism so to notice them while

194
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:05,480
all not believing them just

195
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:10,520
like I remember when one of my nieces was quite young we were at some big

196
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:15,880
holiday gathering everyone was gathered around the table eating and she told

197
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:22,119
this very very queer story that she completely bought into in the moment of

198
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:27,960
a cat driving across the Golden Gate Bridge in a convertible and she had all of us just

199
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:33,599
riveted because she was so clear about it and so convinced that it happened but

200
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:40,480
of course didn't believe it this was confabulation

201
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:47,680
story we could still love the Storyteller even when the stories aren't so nice they're developed through

202
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:54,319
familial conditioning societal conditioning noticing and kindly

203
00:41:54,319 --> 00:42:00,560
disengaging with a nonharming attitude from any inner

204
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:10,720
harshness stories even a pushy approach to mindfulness begins to reconfigure

205
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:17,720
unhelpful mental patterning non-harming includes no

206
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:23,040
longer feeding no longer fueling unhelpful habits no longer getting

207
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:30,599
behind them from a Buddhist perspective this friendly positive

208
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:37,040
regard towards inner experience is

209
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:43,839
ideal can increase together with

210
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:51,240
wholeheartedness with a caring attention respect deep listening to

211
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:59,119
oneself all of that can transmute into gratitude Joy Wonder

212
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:07,800
another way of inviting these beautiful qualities the Gratitude Joy

213
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:13,440
wonder even concentration is to reflect on your own

214
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:19,079
past acts of care and kindness or restraint not doing

215
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:29,558
harm this can create such joy and resonance in the

216
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:36,640
practice and if regrets arrive instead it's an invitation to clean up

217
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:42,839
your own act a commitment to cleaning up one's own act can actually really help

218
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:50,319
in meditation itself it's a helpful Act of

219
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:57,119
generosity for your own practice formal practice of meditation

220
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:04,280
mindful I'm sorry not mindfulness meta loving kindness meditation is also really

221
00:44:04,839 --> 00:44:10,240
helpful there's many many resources on audiio Dharma and here on this um

222
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:15,880
homepage YouTube channel for that also at sa.org I have a half day on it Kevin

Griffin has um resources on practicing loving kindness and difficult

224
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:29,680
times and just as non-harming is

225
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:37,040
fundamental to the Buddhist path this kindness care toward self and others

226
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:43,559
along the way is also a traditional way to reduce anxiety and fear increased

227
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:48,760
confidence courage concentration and all of

228
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:54,240
this has a reciprocal effect on ourselves and others there are in

229
00:44:54,240 --> 00:45:00,599
addition to Millennia of Buddhist teachings about this anecdotal kinds of

230
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:07,400
teachings there's recent Decades of scientific literature randomized control child

231
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:16,079
studies about this so today to consider the resonance

232
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:21,680
the reciprocity of any bit of nonharming

233
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:27,160
care kindness in your own practice

234
