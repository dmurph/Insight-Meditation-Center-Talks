1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:07,200
so a warm hello and

2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:13,679
and a delight for me to be here be here with you and in this way

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:20,400
and and to begin the day here in california with

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,560
meditating together in community thank you for being here

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,279
and

6
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:47,600
as i mentioned yesterday one of the qualities of mature vipassana practice

7
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:55,360
is the ability well let me say a little differently that mature buddhist practice

8
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:03,600
is sometimes described as understanding that nothing whatsoever

9
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:12,240
is worth clinging to nothing whatsoever is worth grasping

10
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,479
and uh so it's a universal statement about all things you it's an omniscience of

11
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,240
sorts you know something one thing at least about all things all experiences are not

12
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,960
worthy of grasping and so this kind of broad

13
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,840
universal kind of understanding

14
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:44,079
what allows that kind of statement and what supports it and what it comes

15
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,200
out of is a capacity to

16
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,240
have a that where your conscious awareness is 360 degrees

17
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,880
meaning that your conscious awareness is ready to practice with to bring

18
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:10,879
mindfulness to whatever is happening in your experience

19
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:16,239
that there's not a division between that which is sacred and profane

20
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:22,879
uh that which is even in a certain kind of way that the division between what is shallow and

21
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,160
profound it's all equally

22
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:36,640
the worthy of awareness of mindfulness and

23
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:44,000
and this kind of all this kind of mindfulness is able to kind of touch and connect to the full range of

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,599
our human life as we begin appreciating that it becomes a center

25
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:57,519
it becomes kind of a home and a kind of place of freedom

26
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:06,000
but to really make it that way and to make it all encompassing or 360 degrees

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,120
there is one area of mindfulness that is often overlooked

28
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:21,440
so in a conventional way mindfulness is is kind of like a

29
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,720
could be seen a little bit like a flashlight or even a lighthouse shining

30
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:33,280
a light a flashlight that is flashing its light on different objects of things that we then really

31
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,200
look at carefully really there to take in and so we we turn the light

32
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,440
onto our breathing our embodied experiences our

33
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:52,560
emotions our thinking like we did yesterday and with that we also open up to sounds

34
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,159
and sights around us and all things that can be experienced

35
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:05,280
and in a sense it's kind of like a maybe like a flashlight shining light on it in a sense especially when we begin the

36
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,720
practice but at some point the light gets

37
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,720
turned around 180 degrees that we're actually looking at the

38
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,639
quality of the light we're actually noticing not

39
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,560
what we're aware of but how we are aware

40
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:36,160
not what we're mindful of but the characteristics the felt sense of

41
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:43,199
the the quality of the mindfulness itself

42
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:49,360
and generally that takes a while and the awareness the mindfulness kind

43
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,800
of it helps if it's really stable meaning we have an ability to rest and

44
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,960
and abide in the present moment with some continuity over time so we're not just flitting

45
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:09,360
around from one thing to the other or getting distracted all the time and situations where awareness keeps getting

46
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:16,880
hijacked by our desires and aversions and fears and fantasies

47
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,880
uh and and awareness really gets lost we get a lot you know it's not not that much awareness we get pulled

48
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,240
into this world of thoughts and things like that but when awareness

49
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:35,759
doesn't get lost and doesn't get swept away by thoughts and stable and here then at some point

50
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:42,800
the awareness how we're being aware becomes the salient thing and this is

51
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,919
closely related to how we are there's what's happening

52
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:54,800
and how we are in relationship to what's happening there's the experience of breathing and

53
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:02,319
our how we're relating to that experience there is the experiences of the body and

54
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,919
how we're relating to that experience the experience of emotions and how we

55
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,960
relate to those and the experience of the mind of thinking and

56
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,759
how we relate to that and it's in that how where the dharma really opens up because

57
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,880
it's in that relationship where suffering the suffering and buddhism addressing is

58
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:32,240
in that relationship and so even if they're suffering

59
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,960
how are we in relationship to suffering if we're happy how are we in relationship to it and

60
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:45,840
that relationship can get clarified and part of that is how we're mindful

61
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,280
mindfulness attention sometimes carries that relationship sometimes it gets entangled and

62
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:57,919
sometimes it it um you know it comes along side by side

63
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:03,840
so this meditation i'll point you to some aspect of this

64
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:17,840
so to enter into a meditative posture

65
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,800
and to soften your eyes some of you might prefer to close your

66
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:35,039
eyes some of you keep them open but soften your eyes let the eyeballs

67
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:42,160
rest in their sockets some people find it helpful

68
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:52,240
to if there is an inner gaze for the eyes gaze backwards and down

69
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:59,840
so we're not reaching out with the eyes

70
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:09,120
and to take a few long slow deep breaths the deep in breath is to connect to this

71
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,840
time and place with this body

72
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:27,360
and the long exhale a time to relax and settle into here and now in this body

73
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:41,839
maybe on the long exhale you can even wiggle your body a little bit help it relax a little bit more release

74
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,160
and allowing your breathing return to normal

75
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:01,920
and with this normal enough breathing on the exhale relaxing the muscles of

76
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:09,839
the face

77
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,160
on the exhale relaxing the shoulders

78
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:26,639
maybe adjusting your position of your hands a little bit if that supports more relaxation in the

79
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:51,839
shoulders and on the exhale softening the belly

80
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:06,079
and then maybe bringing your attention to your head space between your ears behind your

81
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:12,399
forehead and if there's any tension or pressure

82
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,839
or tightness or energy or agitation

83
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:25,600
associated with thinking i call that the thinking muscle

84
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,839
and on the exhale to relax the thinking muscle

85
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:43,040
relax the effort to be thinking an effort that sometimes

86
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:49,120
is quite wary exhausted from a lifetime of

87
00:10:49,120 --> 00:11:01,839
thinking preoccupation and allow your thinking to relax as well

88
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:10,000
as you exhale as if the thinking mind can ride the exhale

89
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,839
all the way to a quiet place at the end of the exhale

90
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,399
and then

91
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:47,040
from the inside of your body become aware of the body's experience of

92
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:54,839
breathing in that location where breathing is

93
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:01,519
most pronounced or most comfortable

94
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:11,839
where you have the custom of practicing mindfulness or breathing

95
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:07,839
as you inhale receive the inhalation

96
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,639
as you exhale

97
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:23,279
allow it to go allow the exhale to release

98
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:35,839
receiving and allowing

99
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:03,839
and as you're gently with your breathing

100
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:12,399
how would you characterize your awareness of breathing

101
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,839
your mindfulness of breathing

102
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:45,839
is there any strain to be aware

103
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:59,839
are you bearing down or pushing to be aware

104
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:13,839
or are you holding back hesitant unsure of yourself

105
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,079
is there a subtle confidence in your awareness

106
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:41,839
or is there a subtle doubt or hesitancy

107
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:54,639
with the awareness are you going out to know the breathing

108
00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:09,839
or you or is awareness receiving the experience of breathing

109
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:51,839
is there any anxiety that goes along with being aware

110
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,839
a sense of caution

111
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:19,438
is there any subtle feeling associated to being mindful of i can't

112
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:33,840
do this this is hard

113
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,520
and if you notice anything that is extra

114
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,799
anything that's more than simply being aware

115
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:56,799
see if you can let go of it or if you can't let go of it

116
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,840
let it fall to the side

117
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:10,640
and highlight for yourself the radical simplicity

118
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:19,519
of awareness that simply knows

119
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:28,720
simply is aware somewhat like a mirror a mirror that

120
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:34,480
just is aware of what is in front of it without distortion

121
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:42,480
or comment or preferences

122
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,280
just aware

123
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:57,840
breathing in and breathing out

124
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,840
hey

125
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,840
so

126
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,840
uh

127
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,159
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

128
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:36,080
if we can appreciate that there's always two things happening

129
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:43,519
there's a what is happening and there's our relationship to it

130
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:53,919
and this ability we have to recognize the relationship the attitude the

131
00:27:53,919 --> 00:28:01,120
desires intentions the preferences that come along with

132
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:08,158
what's happening then we can

133
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:17,520
avoid acting on those attitudes and intentions

134
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:24,799
that are harmful and we can choose those that are to act

135
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:32,080
on those which are beneficial because it's a sacred realm this realm

136
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:37,440
of our how we relate the relationships between

137
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:44,480
ourselves and our experience ourselves and other people ourselves and ourselves that

138
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,240
relationship is so important

139
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,600
and may it be that this practice of mindfulness

140
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:01,360
supports us to avoid

141
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:09,919
causing harm in the ways that we're connected to others and to this world

142
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:18,640
may we not hurt anyone oppress anyone

143
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:30,240
diminish the value of anyone and instead may we benefit

144
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:36,158
may that relationship we have bring benefit bring joy

145
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:43,440
bring freedom and happiness ease

146
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:50,480
may we care not only for others and ourselves but may we care about the

147
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:56,640
care for the relationship between how we relate

148
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,000
and in how we relate

149
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,039
may it be for the welfare and happiness of all beings

150
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:13,278
may all beings be happy

151
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:22,480
may all beings be peaceful

152
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,720
may all beings be safe

153
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:37,840
and may all beings everywhere be free

154
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:51,700
[Music]

155
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:04,720
so my friends we come to the end of this week and

156
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,080
for these days i've been

157
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,799
somewhat presenting the

158
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:23,120
basic simplest way of teaching mindfulness that

159
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:32,080
we do here at insight meditation center and parts of the western vipassana world

160
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:39,440
and and uh and i want to say now as we come to

161
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:45,039
the last day that the in so-called instructions and

162
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:50,159
mindfulness practice so i have instructions to be mindful of

163
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:56,960
breathing body emotions thoughts instructions to be aware of the four foundations of mindfulness

164
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:04,480
body feelings mind states and what's called dharmas the inner

165
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:11,039
processes that either lead to suffering or to freedom

166
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:17,039
and there's other other kind of instructions this is what you do and focus here and focus your attention this

167
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:22,159
way and and a little bit it gets it's it's

168
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:29,039
uh can give the idea that we're doing there's a doing practice

169
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:36,000
we're doing something with awareness and attention directing it someplace and uh it's a

170
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,080
fine instruction to do that it's wonderful to do it's wonderful to be engaged and fully involved

171
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:47,919
in whatever the task is at hand and it could be meditation as well

172
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:53,279
and but the doing sometimes comes with all these extra

173
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:58,559
baggage there can be a lot of self involved in any kind of doing even as simple as just

174
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:05,360
bringing awareness to something we're uh we're checking ourselves out as we do it am i doing it the right way am

175
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:11,519
i doing it well enough and i can't do this and the person next to me meditating is probably doing it

176
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,720
better and or i'm the best one or something all these you know can be very very subtle

177
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:23,600
almost be subconscious some of these little attitudes of um this is too difficult for me and

178
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:31,519
and uh and when i was a young student i had this idea that if it was happening

179
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,720
to me it was not the right experience and so i could never get it right because i had a

180
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:43,919
subtle almost unconscious idea that it wasn't it was never right because it was my you know whatever what i was so it

181
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:51,039
was kind of painful painful even to say it that i used to be that way or the subtle idea that there was always

182
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:56,399
somewhere else to be somewhere else that i had to kind of that was the it was the experience to

183
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:03,039
have and so it's always kind of again this kind of dissatisfaction with what was happening

184
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:08,079
and um and that came along with that doing and then other times i discovered that

185
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:15,040
there was such pristine purity or simplicity in the doing

186
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:20,960
it just like i would i would kind of forget myself in the doing of all kinds of things and

187
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:26,720
where there was gardening or cooking or or different activities but also the same

188
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:32,560
thing with this simple mindfulness of breathing just kind of give myself over completely to it and

189
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:39,919
any sense of me being the doer drops away because i'm so completely in it and it's so simple so

190
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:47,040
and there's so little attitude but there's still a kind of a you know instructions of where to

191
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:53,118
bring your attention what to do so in a sense mindfulness instructions

192
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:58,240
can be seen as prescriptive this is what you do another way of

193
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:07,119
understanding these mindfulness instructions is that they're not prescriptive but rather the descriptive

194
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:15,280
that it's uh describing

195
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:21,280
what awareness is noticing so there's no actively you know searching for

196
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,320
something or trying to do something or trying to get something or make

197
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:32,960
something happen but it's kind of settling back in a nice easy chair

198
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:40,720
and just noticing being aware of what comes into awareness

199
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:48,079
so we're sitting quietly and as loud sound happens outside and that just has arisen in awareness

200
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:55,040
and that and so the mindfulness describes what we're aware of oh that's what it is

201
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:01,040
uh not that we're actively describing but it's more like the the instructions are describing it's

202
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:09,040
like oh okay so if the inhale arises

203
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:14,640
you know then we know the inhale but not because we're

204
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:22,560
practicing mindfulness of breathing per se as an intentional act but more that we just know

205
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:29,839
that this is what's being known we know that this is what has arisen and

206
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:35,200
and so the description of mindfulness being all-encompassing

207
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:42,240
means that there's an openness to awareness openness to our sense of presence

208
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:48,480
that is you could say receptive that just receives whatever is coming

209
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:54,560
and going whatever is arising and happening but we to say receptive is already maybe

210
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:01,359
a little bit too much of the prescriptive thing it's like okay now i have to be receptive

211
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:06,960
the um it's more like uh the

212
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:13,520
the windows have been opened and what happens maybe we hear the sounds of

213
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:20,560
the birds or we the breeze comes into the house and it isn't that we're intending for the

214
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:26,640
breeze or wanting to hear the birds it's just that this is what arises

215
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:32,640
and so we have eyes and ears and nose and tongue and sensations of

216
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:39,040
our body and uh as we sit

217
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:44,079
what is known what is known here what is what are we

218
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:50,320
aware of what comes into awareness so this kind of way of practicing where

219
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:57,760
mindfulness is more a description of what we know than in an in a prescription of what to

220
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:03,520
do is how things begin to shift in practice

221
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:09,599
when there's enough stability when there's enough ability to not wander off in thought and mind being

222
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:16,400
scattered and so sometimes there's a you know takes a long time to really

223
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:23,119
settle down and learn to recognize our just the forces of distraction the hindrances

224
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:28,240
and the power of the of the desiring mind and

225
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:34,640
and let all that come to rest and to soften and let go and quiet and so

226
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:40,560
to be able to just kind of be here fully in the present moment in a simple

227
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:46,640
very ordinary way nothing special not trying to do anything except just

228
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:52,079
allowing ourselves to be here and

229
00:38:52,079 --> 00:39:01,200
being open and so then um

230
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:07,280
then at some point the practice has this more descriptive quality than

231
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:14,640
in prescriptive quality what helps to get there is that we have

232
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:20,640
to really know ourselves well and one of the strengths i think of mindfulness practice

233
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:27,359
is uh is that we are learning to pay careful attention

234
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:33,760
to recognize many different dimensions of what's happening in the present moment

235
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:40,800
it's uh you know if the buddha came you know showed up popped up popped out popped into the

236
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:46,160
modern society just somehow he teleported from ancient india

237
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:52,880
to the you know modern metropolitan city right in the middle of some big city

238
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:59,599
say new york city or something and he wasn't prepared for the experience

239
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,160
you know he would be very you know he knows how to be present he's really there for the experience he really

240
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,760
is you know feels experienced knows the experience knows himself well

241
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:17,280
and he was a walker he walked all over india so he starts walking through new york city but he doesn't know the difference

242
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:24,319
between a curb and a road or what the lines on the road mean or what traffic lights are and what's uh

243
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:29,440
he can't read english and so he doesn't know what one-way street is

244
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:37,520
from you know from anything so

245
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:46,160
you know he's a lot of stuff he doesn't know and so he's going to get into trouble pretty quickly walking the streets of of of new york

246
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:52,720
so it's a silly example same way with our minds if we don't know aspects of our minds we

247
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:59,200
don't even know what we don't know so you know when i was a new

248
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:05,280
practitioner i didn't i didn't have a self-image of myself as being an angry person

249
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:12,240
and so there's a way in which i didn't recognize when i was angry it was kind of like outside of my you

250
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:17,680
know my blinders that i had on or my what i what i would notice

251
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:25,040
and a whole range of emotions i kind of didn't really recognize as or recognize how to bring them into

252
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:30,800
awareness and as i got the mindfulness instructions and mindfulness of emotions

253
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:38,480
i started oh look at that i didn't know that all these things and so my ability to be aware

254
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,839
in a descriptive way in this kind of choiceless awareness way just aware of

255
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:49,359
what's there expanded now into a new realm

256
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:55,359
it wasn't so narrow the world of what i became aware of when i used to focus only on my

257
00:41:55,359 --> 00:42:01,599
breathing a lot in meditation sometimes i felt quite present and wonderful and

258
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:09,920
and sometimes free and in good ways but it was all within a narrow domain

259
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:17,599
and that as it through my life i've learned to open up and see more and more that um

260
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:24,480
that it isn't that i now actively intentionally practice with all these realms but they're just there as part of

261
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:31,280
the territory just like for you if you're a driver and you're driving through new york city

262
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:36,960
you don't you're not consciously you know actively studying the lines on the road to

263
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:44,640
interpret what they are and uh or you know or looking at a red octagonal

264
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:50,480
or maybe it's a six-sided stop sign and kind of what is that it's just like second nature to see that

265
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:56,319
as you're driving along and um and uh

266
00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:02,560
and so the same thing as we kind of learn the territory learn the vocabulary learn learn the

267
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:10,160
letters learn the kind of map of our own experience and then the freedom we receive the freedom that

268
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:17,520
we have in the awareness of all things it starts becoming more and more inclusive

269
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:25,119
and and so there's a balance between practicing to discover what's

270
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:30,800
here and practicing just to allow what's here

271
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:36,400
and those two practices go together really well stays mutually supportive

272
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:43,680
and sometimes uh it seems like i'm ending up doing one more one sometimes i'm doing more the other

273
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:49,760
the discovery plot part sometimes is a little more um prescriptive like this is what i'm

274
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:55,200
doing uh the and sometimes the

275
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:02,480
um the allowing part the just being free in the middle of stuff um is more descriptive it's just oh this

276
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:09,280
is what's happening to my experience so

277
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:20,319
i hope this gives you something what i say gives you something to think about explore and to add some kind

278
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:28,400
of little more richness to the practice of meditation and the practice of awareness

279
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:34,560
i hope it doesn't make you busy hopefully you have a sense of the

280
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:40,400
metaphor of the mind awake aware clear resting and easy in an

281
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:45,119
easy chair aware of what's happening

282
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:53,920
so thank you so i have a couple of announcements one is that these 7 a.m sittings will

283
00:44:53,920 --> 00:45:00,640
continue now for the next two weeks in a wonderfully different way in that

284
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:06,079
this week that i taught was part of a three-week series i'm part of called the harmony of

285
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:11,359
zen and vipassana and little bit these weeks of teaching to this week i was trying to

286
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:18,720
teach vipassana in a way that harmonized a little bit of with zen and uh

287
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:26,560
the um so the next two weeks my dear friends um paul heller and phu schroeder will

294
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:06,720
days and because uh this is the last time i'm going to be here

295
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:12,000
for these next two weeks i wanted to say that um

296
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:19,760

called mindfulness meditation and mindfulness circle for black identified practitioners

300
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:43,839
and and so if you're black identified african-american and

301
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:49,599
you'd like to come together with other black and african-american folks

302
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:57,119
with a wonderful teacher named anne royce who i met this year she's

303
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:04,800
studying chaplaincy with me and a wonderfully profound and long time practitioner and

304
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:11,359
she'll teach mindfulness one of the wonderful qualities of one of the aspects of her in terms of the zen and vipassana thing

305
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:17,760
that we're doing this week is she was a student of suzuki roshi some you know

306
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:25,200
50 years ago i guess and so long time practitioner and wise woman person

307
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:30,880
so there's information about this on the imc website and different places the imc calendar

308
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:36,559
