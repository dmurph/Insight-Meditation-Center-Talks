1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,240
hello everyone and

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:16,119
welcome and as an introduction to this meditation I would like to

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,880
evoke the emotion the attitude of

4
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:27,000
love as a part of meditation in integral part of

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,520
it and I'll use a metaphor now that it's getting cold sometimes

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:41,680
the windshield on my car is frosted over and there have been times uh when

7
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:49,239
it was so frosted over it took some time to be able to clear the ice to drive

8
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:58,680
away and um so there's different options of how to bring back the clarity in the

9
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,239
windshield one one is to Simply wait for the sun to come up and the sun will

10
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,479
slowly warm it up another way is to turn

11
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:17,600
on the car and the defroster and let the coils that are in the windshield slowly

12
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,880
warm up or let the heater in the car slowly blow warm air on the

13
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:32,000
glass and then uh with time the glass will be warm enough that the ice

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,479
melts the other option is to go out and get a ice

15
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,680
scraper and to uh scrape away the ice

16
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,520
and sometimes that's easy if it's just a little light frost and sometimes it takes a lot of work to get a thick layer

17
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,200
of crusty ice off the windshield and uh especially when it's

18
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:03,439
really cold then it kind of frosts up right away as even even as I scrape it

19
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,759
away so when we sit to meditate The Liberation that we're

20
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:16,800
looking for is could be understood to be Clarity to be clear of the obstructions

21
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,200
to our seeing to be clear of the frost that

22
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:29,720
covers our perception so that's uh our

23
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:37,360
our fears all of them which agitate all of them which OB obstruct in some

24
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:45,239
way and we could try to let go we can try to scrape it away and if it's a light

25
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:51,599
frost maybe that works fine but or we could let the

26
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,959
warmth melt it all and that could be the inner warmth

27
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:05,959
that we the defroster in our ourselves that we bring along so that when we are

28
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:14,159
mindful of our experience we are mindful of it with some modum of Love

29
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:20,560
warmth care Good Will

30
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:27,760
appreciation respect valuing that awareness is not

31
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,760
neutral but awareness is infused with

32
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:40,599
love or we can use the sun something outside of

33
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:46,200
ourselves that might also help something warm up something which is frozen or

34
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:54,799
caught or stuck inside of us so it begins to thaw and it could

35
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:01,480
be the love that we feel from other people it could be a sense of universal

36
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:09,360
love that it just exists in the fabric of the universe it could be being in nature and

37
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,519
feeling somehow some warmth some nurturing that

38
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:21,919
comes from the natural world and so to sit and

39
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:27,240
meditate and to call upon our capacity for

40
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,199
love and to do so you

41
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:40,440
are kind of speeding up a natural process that as we deepen our meditation

42
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:46,160
and relax and open up we will slowly

43
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,360
defrost we slowly develop the clarity that allows the heart's

44
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:58,560
tenderness and care and warmth to flow from

45
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,880
us so whether we call upon that warmth to whatever degree we

46
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:12,240
have or we clear the window so the clarity is there to see

47
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:19,199
and feel that warmth it's all part of the meditative

48
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:24,160
process so to assume

49
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:31,440
a meditation posture

50
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:40,240
and what posture would you take if it is a posture that

51
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,240
expresses alertness

52
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,599
relaxation and love

53
00:05:52,520 --> 00:06:01,120
warmth some people are very fond of putting their hands on their hearts as a way of kind

54
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:09,120
of more directly feeling the warmth the tenderness

55
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,240
the The Good Will of a warm

56
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:30,919
heart and if you find no warmth inside of you that you can

57
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:37,039
call upon to support this meditation maybe you

58
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:44,160
can call upon what's outside of you and for this

59
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:52,039
meditation I will spend my time meditating with

60
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:59,080
um uh actively having Goodwill meta for all

61
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:07,680
of you you some 400 people here all of you I will just sit here and wish you

62
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,599
well so then gently closing your

63
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:30,240
eyes and to whatever degree feels loving for you let yourself take

64
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,080
some deeper breaths gently

65
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:43,479
lovingly as if you're caring for your body and taking in the

66
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:54,759
oxygen and relaxing as you exhale where relaxation also is a

67
00:07:54,759 --> 00:08:01,319
expression of self-care

68
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
for

69
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,959
and letting your breathing return to

70
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,519
normal and gently feeling whatever

71
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:52,360
tenderness or warmth there might be

72
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:58,200
within maybe in the area of your heart maybe somewhere

73
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:05,360
else some people can feel something like that in their

74
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,680
hands for some people it's in the

75
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,720
face for some it might be in the

76
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:34,480
belly and putting aside

77
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:41,720
any expectations or Ambitions or older ideas you have about what it

78
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:47,160
means to be mindful see if you can become aware of

79
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:54,440
your breathing with an awareness with an

80
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:01,120
attention with attention that is

81
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:06,160
loving carries with it warmth and

82
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,920
tenderness maybe a

83
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:22,120
gentleness for different people different manifestations of

84
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:30,519
Love are most available kindness

85
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:36,360
Good Will

86
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,440
compassion deep

87
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,800
appreciation a deep sense of

88
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
care

89
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:23,920
sympathy where every moment of knowing

90
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:30,959
awareness touches with love

91
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:39,600
with warmth no matter how difficult the experience

92
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,760
is touching it with a warmth warm

93
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:52,439
awareness as if the warmth is going to melt it not fix

94
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
it

95
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
for

96
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
for

97
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
for

98
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
for

99
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
for

100
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
for

101
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
for

102
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,519
for

103
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:59,160
there are parts of ourselves

104
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,759
which benefit immensely from being

105
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,319
seen seeing In Love sometimes are

106
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:14,680
synonymous and there are parts of ourselves that really need to be benefit from being

107
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:20,558
[Music] heard at times being heard

108
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:25,279
well is just almost the same as

109
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:33,360
love to perceive to be aware of yourself as you sit

110
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:39,799
meditating as an act of Love Of

111
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:46,600
Care compassion with each

112
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
breath

113
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
for

114
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
for

115
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
for

116
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
for

117
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
for

118
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
for

119
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
for

120
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
for

121
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
for

122
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
for

123
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
for

124
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
for

125
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679
for

126
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,679
for

127
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,799
and as we come to the end of this

128
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:38,039
sitting to imagine or let it

129
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,679
be that your capacity to be

130
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:52,760
aware comes along with a warmth a

131
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:59,600
tenderness a love

132
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:10,880
and then as you gaze upon the world around you that that warmth and

133
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:19,159
tenderness spreads through your body like a little radiator that fills a

134
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:25,279
room with warmth and that it spreads beyond your

135
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:29,520
body out into the world

136
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:41,039
with the imagination or the hope that your love your

137
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:47,919
warmth care can radiate out across the

138
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:56,519
globe beyond the building you're in the county Province you're

139
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:00,519
in out across the

140
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,840
lenss and imagining that there's a kind of a Midas

141
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:17,600
touch that whatever your awareness lands on touches it with

142
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:25,919
love may all beings be

143
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:33,158
happy may all beings be

144
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:39,360
safe may all beings be

145
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:45,600
peaceful may all beings be

146
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:59,799
free and may we be the recipient of the kindness and Good Will

147
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:09,080
of others and if we don't feel it from

148
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,799
others then they're definitely those people are definitely in

149
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:25,760
need of warmth to melt the frost on their

150
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:35,640
windshield let us melt each other's Frost so we see each other with

151
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:43,000
Clarity and in that Clarity we care for each

152
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:56,320

e

157
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:21,799
so hello and as I begin this fourth talk about my

158
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:29,158
own story my own life story with Buddhism with Buddhist practice

159
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:35,799
and so when I was about 22

160
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:41,279
then is that right no I was

161
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:46,799
24 I came to live um first near the San Francisco Zen

162
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:53,559
Center and then um after some months I moved to the green g a farm to live in

163
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:59,559
Zen Center and and

164
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:07,440
um and it might be interesting for some of you to hear my experience of the first uh 7-Day silent Retreat I signed

165
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:13,039
up for it was when I was still uh at the University of of

166
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:18,279
Davis uh studying and between my Junior and

167
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:23,440
Senior year I signed up for a 7-Day sashen at the Zen

168
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,600
Center and um a week or two before the

169
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:34,039
the retreat was supposed to start I called up the S Center and explained to

170
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:41,760
them that something important that come up and I wouldn't be able to attend the retreat and they said okay and that was

171
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:50,080
it what I didn't tell them that the important thing that had come up Was Fear so

172
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:56,240
I chickened out of going to my first silent Retreat so some of you maybe have

173
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:03,559
had been nervous coming to your first Retreat some of you haven't been on a retreat and feel nervous about doing it

174
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:09,279
if that's the case you're in good company and that uh I did not only was

175
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:17,000
nervous going I didn't go but then I did sit uh in a um a 7-Day

176
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,480
retreat at um green Gulch in the spring of

177
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:28,600
89 and that's when I decided to go live at the the green Gulch

178
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:36,000
Farm I was still thinking about uh going to graduate school and in fact I had been accepted to a soil science program

179
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,639
at UC Berkeley after studying Agronomy I was aware of the tremendous um challenge

180
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:47,880
of soil erosion around the world and I wanted to be someone who addressed those

181
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:55,960
issues and um but then as I was um getting time to go to green to UC

182
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:02,240
Berkeley in the fall of ' 89 um somehow in the middle of August I

183
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:08,240
realized it dawned on me that school was starting in a couple of weeks and I better figure out what to do where to

184
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:13,800
live to make arrangements and um and I went to the

185
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:19,839
new enchanting of the heart Sutra they do at uh at uh at

186
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:25,638
greenl and um it was a a noon that mostly people didn't go so I was just

187
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:32,440
there with a few people and it was optional and and we were chanting this this chant that had chant

188
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:39,280
many times by then and that wasn't particularly thinking about anything uh but the chant and suddenly there was

189
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:45,480
this inner explosion inside and I knew that um instead of going to graduate

190
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:51,118
school I should go to tasahara the Zen Center Monastery so I called up or maybe

191
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:57,040
I wrote a letter to UC Berkeley and said something has come up something important has come up and could I I

192
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:03,560
postpone my um uh beginning of graduate school for the for one year so then in

193
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:08,680
January of um 1990 I went to the middle of the winter

194
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:16,320
I went to this cold place in this um in the Santa Cruz in that in the Big Sur

195
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:23,800
mountains and uh called tahara it's down it's deep in the canyon uh about 14

196
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:30,760
miles on a dirt road deep in the natur National wilderness in a small private property small maybe maybe it's 100

197
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:37,880
acres 140 acres and um and so I started my monastic life

198
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:44,680
there and um I loved it for the most part and I was really happy that

199
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:49,880
lifestyle sometimes I thought this was a perfect lifestyle I just loved the whole

200
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:55,599
the whole thing about it except for um the times off about every five days we

201
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:00,640
had a day off and then I would often go hiking in the mountains there and that's

202
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:06,839
when I started thinking about my life what do I want to do with my life and should I go back to graduate school and

203
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:14,160
address the soil erosion problems of this world and um and uh I wanted to be of help to the

204
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:20,200
world but I had a deep suspicion of or mistrust of the desire to help I I kind

205
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:27,280
of had the suspicion that that can be more often than not uh self-serving and selfish to do that and so I had this

206
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:33,200
doubt about myself and what I should do and and um I spent a and that made me

207
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:38,760
kind of miserable during those days off thinking about that there was no solution and and then next day I was get

208
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:45,200
into the monastic routine and that was great meditating a lot and I continued

209
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:50,359
like this for probably um quite a while and

210
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:56,880
um and then um at some point I was walking in the mountains and I said this

211
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:03,560
is ridiculous uh I'm living in a world of imagination imaginary Futures imaginary

212
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:10,680
things I could do imaginary possibilities things that I can't really imagine properly and know anything about

213
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:17,079
and um and uh it's not really taking me anywhere I feel stuck and so I kind of

214
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:24,000
spontaneously made a decision uh to start my life over again and just take the next step whatever the

215
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,440
next step was I was going to that was going to build my life from there and and start over in a certain kind of

216
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:36,960
way and it might seem even to me that was somewhat naive to do that or maybe

217
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:43,680
simplistic but in fact that's was a decision I made and uh I felt now in retrospect I'm

218
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:49,280
so lucky that I decided to do that at a Buddhist Monastery because the next step

219
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:55,079
meant they rang a bell and it was time to go meditate they rang a bell it was time to go do the monastic work and go

220
00:37:55,079 --> 00:38:01,160
to a Dharma talk and so I had all this wholesome kind of Dharma practice that

221
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:06,960
was the next step and um but it allowed me to kind of just settle in and then I decided not to

222
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:12,160
go back to graduate school but just stayed there keep practicing at the

223
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:17,960
monastery and um and at some point um I

224
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:24,319
uh I began wondering about you know what I should do with my life again or what's

225
00:38:24,319 --> 00:38:31,800
next I wasn't thinking about it too much but I started to recognize that um I I

226
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:39,800
stared to be changed by the years of doing Zen practice and it was a very slow change and one of the primary

227
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:44,880
changes that happened was that I didn't get the enlightened but I became

228
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:52,880
compassion that I was sitting for those years with a lot of suffering inner suffering of myself and um but in Zen

229
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:59,440
practice I wasn't given any tools any mindfulness practices to do with with it the only practice we had was to sit

230
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,880
upright and accept the moment as it is and turned out that worked out really

231
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,760
well for me and so I would just sit there and have this accepting practice

232
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:17,040
of my suffering and slowly slowly that was that practice tenderized me it

233
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:24,760
softened me and uh I started kind of um I had a great need for compassion and I

234
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:33,400
started seeing and feeling was compassionate all around me and I was clearly projecting on my need onto the

235
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:39,960
world but uh I think it was very effective to receive from externally the

236
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:48,040
kind of warmth and love compassion that my suffering needed so sorely and slowly uh something began to

237
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:54,319
uh soften and dissolve and as it did so uh there awakened a sense of

238
00:39:54,319 --> 00:39:59,760
compassion and uh that com sense of compassion became very important for me

239
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,359
simultaneous to that was also a softening of conceit a softening of any

240
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:13,240
kind of strong sense of a boundary between myself and others and I felt like uh in some I think healthy way that

241
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:19,920
I was continuous with the people around me and the people of the world that in some ways their suffering was my

242
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:25,760
suffering but as I continue this process I was not oppressed by the suffering of

243
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:32,880
others I wasn't uh uh dismayed by it but rather it was met with more and more of

244
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:38,880
this kind of warmth this compassion and um and I started to feel

245
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:45,160
that uh uh kind in some ways that as my strong sense of self dissolved more and

246
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:50,359
more that there was something inside of me that was responding to the world that

247
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:55,920
was not exactly the classic or conventional idea of Me Myself and mine

248
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:02,960
that there was a um that uh uh I was becoming

249
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:11,000
responsive can't even sa me I was becoming there was started to be a response a compassionate response to the

250
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:18,040
circumstance I was in and living in that response just felt so right so

251
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:24,359
appropriate and um and so uh you know it was very it wasn't like a sudden

252
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:32,440
realization understanding this is what was happening it was a slow process of of something dissolving and warming

253
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:39,560
up and then one day the uh the Abbot who was seldom at the monastery uh we could

254
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:45,160
seldom have a chance to meet with him came and um for a few days and I had a

255
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:52,280
chance to have a one-on-one meeting with him and so I went and sat by the the creek that's there the tasahara river

256
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:58,160
and just overlooking at the creek kind of reflecting what should I talk to him about and what should I do and what

257
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:05,480
should I do with my life and all that and and I think I was doing it in a very uh relaxed way and maybe there was a

258
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:11,160
certain kind of creativity or receptivity or openness to this and a

259
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:17,000
little bit like it had been in that chanting the heart Sutro at Green Gulch suddenly there was a I just something

260
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,800
just shifted inside of me and I knew exactly what I should do and there was

261
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,839
no question about it and that was I should be ordained as a Zen

262
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:35,520
Monk and um and because I'm a rational person I thought well I have to have a reason for that so then I I spent some

263
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:42,520
time thinking why do why do I want to do that and in some sense it was maybe a little bit it was the reasons I came

264
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:49,319
with were honest enough but they didn't really represent the fact that there was this it actually there was there kind of

265
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:55,920
was no reason it was just a knowing I had that this is what I should do but the reason I came up with was

266
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:01,000
that um I really wanted to respond to the suffering of the world and I wanted to

267
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,640
respond to it from the deepest place of of freedom from suffering that I had I

268
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:11,800
knew about and if I'd gone and done soil erosion work it would have been very

269
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:18,079
important work but it would have I would have always been felt a little dissatisfied because it's one thing to

270
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:24,480
help farmers and communities um but their suffering their depth of their suffering are still going to be there

271
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:30,160
it's very important to do solar work I don't um but I want I didn't feel like I

272
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:35,760
I was always going to have that dissatisfaction that I wasn't really addressing suffering at its roots and

273
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:42,800
that being ordained as a Zen priest was how I was going to or how I was going to do that at the roots of

274
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:48,599
um of uh of it and I I didn't think I would be effective or I didn't have high

275
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:58,078
ambition of what I could do my image of myself as a Zen monk or priest was to um

276
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:04,280
um have like a storefront meditation uh Center that was just

277
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:10,079
really open room in a storefront small place in the city and I had the key and

278
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:17,319
I would keep the place clean and I would open and close it for people to come and meditate with me we meditate together I

279
00:44:17,319 --> 00:44:24,160
had no thought about being a teacher or or um you know I was just the the caretaker of a place for people to come

280
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:30,280
to meditate so that was my and uh and the route to becoming a Buddhist teacher

281
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:35,440
back at Zen Center in those days was a very slow route I think I because there

282
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:42,040
were so many other priests there at that time and the training was very slow through each of them that I I kind of

283
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:47,160
thought well I have to be here 25 years before I even begin uh entering into a

284
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:55,040
teaching role and I was fine with that I wasn't thinking about becoming a teacher and so I asked the Abbott to be

285
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:02,559
ordained and he said yes and within nine months I was ordained and um and I was

286
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:07,720
surprised uh how much that ordination ceremony changed me i' hadn't I didn't

287
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:12,839
have much feeling or appreciation for rituals but there was something very

288
00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:20,599
deep that changed in me and in different ways but I'll say now to end that

289
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:26,400
um uh I became a public figure I had a shaved head I had robes and uh I stood

290
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:32,319
out now and people would strangers would come and talk to me in the ways before when I was more or less like a hippie

291
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:39,280
and scrawny and maybe dirty and um and people would you know more likely avoid

292
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:47,280
me than to approach me and so being a public figure this way as a representative of the Dharma um my own

293
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:54,240
foibles my own shortcomings became much more obvious and uh and at the same time as

294
00:45:54,240 --> 00:46:00,040
my own shortcomings became more clear to me uh it was more okay to have them

295
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:06,920
because now I'd become a child of the Buddha and it's a kind of metaphor for what was what happened to me and this

296
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:11,960
combination of being able to see my shortcomings better and feel more okay

297
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:20,920
about having them because I was somehow sitting in the lap of the Buddha um I thought it was a a wonderful

298
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:27,000
and significant combination I could this is a wonderful balance

299
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,760
so those years of Zen practice uh compassion me and a warmth and a

300
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:39,760
tenderness and a gentleness uh with which then I would sit my zen meditation and which then

301
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:45,400
motivated my life and that then set the course for the rest of my life that

302
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:51,559
somehow my dedication then was to um alleviate or help alleviate the

303
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:56,920
suffering of the world and that was the response of this life it wasn't even

304
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:03,839
personal or something but it became the center of the life that was coming out of this body was that's what it was

305
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:10,680
going about and and that's what it's been ever since I feel like this that's the center and um my practice is

306
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:17,520
important and but the one expression of it is uh wanting to meet suffering and

307
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:23,400
and help uh bring about the end of

308
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:31,640
suffering so um and then at some point uh in the Zen practice um I encountered

309
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:40,079
vasana inside meditation and um maybe to leave you with a cliffhanger uh that'll be the

310
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:47,680
story for tomorrow thank you
