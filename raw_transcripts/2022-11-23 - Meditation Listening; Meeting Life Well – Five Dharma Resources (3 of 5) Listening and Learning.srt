1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:07,140
Okay so good day to all

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:13,920
let's go ahead and get started with our meditation together this morning

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,939
so settling in for a period of sitting

4
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:28,880
allowing your body to come into its usual meditation posture

5
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,840
however it's disposed this morning

6
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:44,100
and just sensing in to a spot where you're sitting your seat against the chair or

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,860
the cushion or perhaps you're lying down

8
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:56,000
and just feeling the support under your body

9
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,520
and allowing yourself to relax into that

10
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:16,939
perhaps allowing the body itself to find a place of balance

11
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:26,180
so just gently inviting how can the body shift slightly to

12
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:34,100
feel like there's almost no effort to be upright

13
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:46,939
and then softening the face the jaw

14
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:56,180
the throat down through the shoulders

15
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,140
softening the arms and the hands

16
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,180
down into the chest area

17
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:28,319
feeling how when the spine is straight and alert

18
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,420
the chest actually relaxes

19
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,520
down into the Valley area

20
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:52,800
releasing any tension in the low back trusting that the

21
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:59,060
spine bones themselves will hold us up without the muscles

22
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,560
sinking a little farther into the seat

23
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:15,200
and releasing any bracing in the legs all the way down to the feet

24
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:30,060
so we just invite ease through the body and it's okay if

25
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:35,159
the body isn't relaxed in certain places or

26
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:40,560
they aren't making contact very well with part of it that's all fine

27
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:48,140
let me just have sense also that the body is okay as it is today

28
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:04,739
and we can invite a sense of simplicity

29
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:08,959
in the body and in the mind

30
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:18,620
or sometimes the mind is complicated a lot of thoughts or emotions

31
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:28,220
but the awareness of that can be simple The Knowing of it can be very simple

32
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,880
connecting in with perhaps the sensations of breathing

33
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:17,180
in order to join the body and mind in a simple direct way

34
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:54,300
I would invite now tuning into sound as a meditation object

35
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:59,580
so there's the sound of my voice and there's likely also some kind of sounds

36
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:05,699
in your environment maybe other people

37
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:13,280
or cars outside or wind

38
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,360
behaving system

39
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:26,220
and just allowing the arrival of sounds at the ear

40
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:31,460
to be a way of connecting to the present moment

41
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:05,460
there can be a sense of ease from not knowing what is next but just

42
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:10,039
knowing that we'll meet it with our listening

43
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:19,759
just relaxing into the flow of the sounds

44
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,920
now we can shift slightly to

45
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:07,640
applying this faculty of listening to the body

46
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:13,320
there's a bodily sense faculty that kind

47
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:19,579
of runs throughout the body it's not just the touch sensors on the skin

48
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:28,819
we can tune into that the inner sense of the breath is part of it but there's a lot more also

49
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:39,660
so we can incline the Mind toward listening to this bodily scent store not

50
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:45,120
knowing what body Sensation will come next or how they'll shift

51
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,120
I'm just resting in listening to the body

52
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,279
foreign

53
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,639
foreign

54
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:43,680
to the mind

55
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:50,420
here we're using our awareness faculty in a very open way

56
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:57,660
is possible for example to hear thought

57
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:03,740
as if a speaker we're playing in the room

58
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,860
thoughts just inner sound

59
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:21,260
seeing if we can simply listen to the mind

60
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:30,600
finding that same sense of rest that we can find when listening to sound

61
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,319
externally

62
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:48,740
and we're not listening for anything or we're not listening because we need to do anything

63
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:56,360
we're listening because these parts of us want to be listened to

64
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:03,500
yeah yeah simple way very simple

65
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,180
and we'll just rest with that for a while

66
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:40,380
in the last few minutes of sitting and listening to experience in the body and

67
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:48,559
mind you might reflect did I learn anything

68
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:56,720
to the listening bring about

69
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:04,260
some learning and even if it doesn't feel explicit

70
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:12,059
this kind of practice is kind of like deep data Gathering

71
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:15,799
something was going in

72
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:29,419
and it's worth feeling happy about that

73
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:38,279
content with having rested in our experience

74
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:43,559
for some undivided time that we know will bring benefit in some

75
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:45,799
way

76
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:10,020
from this meditation we can also get the sense that

77
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:17,960
this practice of listening and learning is actually a heart practice

78
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:24,419
we can feel that it's not just coming from the mind but it's a full being full

79
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:30,139
body hard experience

80
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,000
and that it may relate to what the Buddha simply called the Dharma

81
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:49,559
how things are practicing in line with the Dharma being

82
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:55,080
connected with the Dharma all those phrases that we hear

83
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:00,240
have something to do with this experience we've had in meditation

84
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,720
today

85
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:14,720
this is it our experience is it

86
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:24,659
and so we can hope that as we go forward today

87
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:31,980
will be a bit more connected to all of what's going on

88
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:37,940
through our capacity to listen and to learn

89
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:47,299
that will help all the others around us not just us

90
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:54,559
sometimes in ways we can't even know right away

91
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:17,160
[Music]

92
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,278
foreign

93
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:31,539
[Music]

94
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:58,980
so this week we are talking about five Dharma resources that help us to meet

95
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:06,120
experience well and when we have these five readily at hand and we're also mindful

96
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:12,360
then we will find that appropriate responses are much more likely to come

97
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:19,020
forth so we've talked already about confidence and virtue

98
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:26,399
and how these are not automatically Dharma resources but they become so when we take them into the heart and let them

99
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:32,220
be nourished their so the third item in the list

100
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:37,500
is called asuta in Pali it's not suta

101
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:45,120
with two T's like the discourses of the Buddha it's uh suta s-u-t-a

102
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:52,380
and this one is interesting because we really need to bear in mind the idea

103
00:31:52,380 --> 00:32:01,860
that it becomes a resource when it's linked to the heart so suta is a past participle of the verb

104
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:08,820
sunity which means to hear so suto means heard you know something

105
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:15,840
that has been heard and in the Buddhist texts it's often translated as learning

106
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:23,039
so we can consider that in the Buddha's time the teachings had not yet been written down and most people were

107
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:30,059
illiterate anyway so the only way to learn spiritual teachings directly was

108
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:36,240
to listen in person to a teacher and be able to remember what was heard

109
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:43,440
so suta doesn't just mean literal hearing but some something more like learning what has been learned what has

110
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:52,500
been comprehended what has been taken in intentionally so how can we understand its presence in

111
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:59,700
a list that is connected to things like inner wealth fortitude aspiration and

112
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:06,539
modes of spiritual growth as I mentioned on Monday those are some of the ways that this list of five is

113
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:14,120
named in the sutas so how does learning help us to meet life well

114
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:22,260
so for this series this week I'm translating suta s-u-t-a as listening

115
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:29,100
and learning so that we get a richer picture of it so we could say that we will meet

116
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:36,059
situations while by really listening and also by drawing on our inner wealth of

117
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:43,740
knowing Dharma teachings and that's not mental it's not the learning that's just in our mind but

118
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:49,380
it's more the learning that's happened through listening to them with our heart

119
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:54,200
how can we listen in a dharmic way

120
00:33:54,840 --> 00:34:02,100
one time in a class of about 45 people where I was a student we were asked how

121
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:07,460
many of you feel that you are really listened to every day

122
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:13,440
and maybe two people raised their hands and this is you know this is significant

123
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:20,520
and maybe also a little bit heartbreaking there's so much talking and so much hearing but so little real

124
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:27,300
listening and this is actually something that we learned to do for ourselves in

125
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:32,820
meditation so if you meditate every day you can experience the feeling that you

126
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:38,460
are deeply listened to every day in meditation listening is related to

127
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:45,858
this quality that we call investigation which is one of the factors of Awakening

128
00:34:45,859 --> 00:34:52,500
so we don't mean literal listening to the words of our thoughts although that

129
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:58,619
can be part of it if we happen to have that going but it's kind of deeper listening to the

130
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:05,280
sensations and energetic flows of experience it helps to listen with the

131
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:12,060
whole body of course the attention and the interest are coming from the mind to the mind and

132
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:17,579
the body are not separate but there is a way to bring in the body

133
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:25,560
such that we're connecting more intuitively and we can even take in the Dharma in

134
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:33,480
this way I was living at the Insight Retreat Center IRC when we held the very first

135
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:38,520
retreat in Spanish there and I went to the morning instructions

136
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:46,980
and the Dharma talks even though my Spanish is rather minimal but it didn't matter I could feel the

137
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:52,500
good energy from the Dharma in going into my system through some other channel

138
00:35:52,500 --> 00:36:00,300
you know my linguistic mind was not getting much satisfaction but my heart could still feel it

139
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:09,359
and that uh that prepared me well for attending a couple of retreats in Sri Lanka that were given in sinhala

140
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:17,040
as an aside some people say senegalese for that language but it's properly called sinhala I don't speak a word of

141
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:23,420
it but still there was this sense of receiving Dharma

142
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:30,000
actually sinhala is quite an ancient language and it's it's related to Paulie

143
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,960
and when the teacher would quote the Paulie Canon during these Dharma talks he would read the quotes in Paulie

144
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:43,920
because you know the Sri Lankan people didn't need a translation and interestingly I found that I could

145
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:51,480
halfways understand the poly quotes even though I couldn't understand the sinhala at all it was a great experience

146
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:56,520
so all of this is to say that that we can listen to the Dharma in a language

147
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:02,040
that we don't understand literally and that means that we can also listen

148
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:08,520
for the Dharma in everyday situations you know is there Dharma in a trip to

149
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:14,720
the grocery store or out hiking or picking up your children at preschool

150
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:21,119
I would say yes it's just a kind of a matter of tuning in

151
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:28,140
and you know sometimes people ask where is the Dharma in My Crazy Life or often

152
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:33,300
how can I take my practice out of the meditation Hall into the world

153
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:41,119
and one possibility is to listen for it there's so much Dharma happening all the time if we listen for it

154
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:47,400
so here's where we can shift to the this other aspect of the word suta which is

155
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:52,500
learning or what has been learned we're talking about listening and learning

156
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:59,540
together today and so if we're going to be able to detect the Dharma in everyday situations

157
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:06,000
it helps to have some integrated knowledge of what the Dharma teachings say

158
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,540
not all teachers focus on this but I do encourage people to study and learn

159
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:19,200
something of the language of the Buddhist teachings and I don't mean Paulie I don't mean the poly language

160
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:24,960
but rather the the terminology and also the major lists and how the path Works

161
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,599
to lead us from a place of suffering to less suffering or even no suffering

162
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:38,579
not because you need to get a good grade in a class or that you need to memorize things or think about them a lot

163
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:44,220
but more like because we're always operating from some model or view of the

164
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:50,160
world and ourself and our life we're not neutral entities in our interaction with

165
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:57,420
the world and so if we want to support the Dharma path unfolding it really helps to see

166
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:04,859
things in a way that aligns with the Dharma so for instance seeing our challenging mind States in

167
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:11,640
terms of the five hindrances or seeing a difficulty that we're in through the lens of the Four Noble

168
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:17,339
Truths oh this is suffering that's what's going on I wonder if there's some

169
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:21,440
craving or clinging going on here

170
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:30,300
so maybe an analogy is um imagine if you're studying to be a

171
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:36,540
chemist in a modern Western setting but you grew up with a model of the physical

172
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:42,300
world that was based on the four elements of earth water fire and Air

173
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:47,880
and suppose though that you then insist in your Chemistry classes that you have

174
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:55,619
to use that model and you refuse to learn the periodic table of the elements that is the current standard way to do

175
00:39:55,619 --> 00:40:03,599
modern chemistry I suspect it will be very difficult for you but it would instantly be easier and

176
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:08,640
more effective to just think in terms of the of the periodic table

177
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:15,900
so I don't know if that's a perfect example but there is some similarity between that and the situation of

178
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:21,480
learning the Dharma teachings in order to be able to walk the April path if that's what you're doing in your

179
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:28,560
practice but probably it's even more important in the case of the Dharma because the Dharma is not just a cognitive model

180
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:34,980
like we have in chemistry it's a whole body issue a whole being issue

181
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:41,160
and I've seen this in my own practice I started studying the Buddhist texts

182
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:47,520
maybe one year into my practice and I've devoted quite a lot of energy to learning the teachings listening to

183
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,680
talks and trying to understand some of the more difficult ideas that the Buddha

184
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:58,220
taught and in in ways that I can't quite explain logically

185
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:04,619
phrases and ideas that are rooted in the teachings sometimes come forth spontaneously in

186
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:10,380
everyday life and also on cushioning I remember one time I was doing a search

187
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:16,380
on the internet about a specific some kind of a scientific explanation for something and I found all kinds of

188
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:23,520
fascinating articles and videos which got me kind of excited and joyful because it was something really cool and

189
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:29,099
my mind can do that kind of thing and for some reason my mind noticed that

190
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:35,940
my mind state was similar to the first half of the Awakening factors which are the energizing factors of Investigation

191
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:41,520
energy and joy and because there was mindfulness I felt

192
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:46,740
like I sort of felt my mind naturally step back and expand to take in the

193
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:54,060
bigger picture of what I was doing and as that happened there was this natural calming of the energy and a release from

194
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:59,280
being wrapped up in the energy and joy and excitement um but there was you know there was

195
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:06,480
still joy and interest there but I felt the balance coming in of including the more calming factors of tranquility and

196
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,820
composure and equanimity so these were kind of everyday versions

197
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:17,940
of the factors of Awakening but still I I marveled at how my mind drew on its

198
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:24,359
knowledge of the Awakening factors to recognize some of those factors in my present moment experience

199
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:32,339
and then it drew on its knowledge of how the Awakening factors operate in the mind to bring them into balance

200
00:42:32,339 --> 00:42:39,720
they operate by having the energizing factors and the calming factors present at the same time and in balance

201
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:47,520
so you know that can happen just in our everyday life and it happens on the cushion too sometimes I get Snippets of

202
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:52,680
teachings coming into my mind key phrases or verses they come in kind of

203
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:59,640
like a Dharma coach during meditation sometimes and I would guess that you might have some examples like this from your life

204
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:06,119
and practice also in the foundational text on mindfulness

205
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:11,760
practice the fourth establishment of mindfulness

206
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,859
is about seeing in terms of the Dharma so this is recognized and it's a

207
00:43:16,859 --> 00:43:22,319
fundamental practice the fourth Foundation is mindfulness in terms of

208
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:28,140
dalmas which are then expounded as being the five hindrances the five Aggregates

209
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:33,240
The Sixth Sense bases seven factors of Awakening and four noble truths but

210
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:41,480
those are just representative what we're what we're generally doing is learning to see in terms of the karma teachings

211
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:48,420
through this quality of listening and learning or suta we gradually cultivate

212
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:56,880
what I like to call the mind of Dharma where we could say the heart of Dharma and in terms of the Dharma resources for

213
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:03,839
this week we're training our heart to bring forth the qualities that are named in the teachings which include also

214
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:11,640
things like the Brahma viharas the heart qualities generosity patients as well as the various lists that I mentioned

215
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:17,280
so this this heart of Dharma is a heart that knows the teachings that can stay

216
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:23,400
mindful in a range of experiences and that responds in line with ethics and

217
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:29,160
heart qualities and sees in terms of wisdom you might notice how that brings in a

218
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:35,880
number of other qualities that are on this week's list like ethics and wisdom and generosity

219
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:42,720
so as we listen internally and externally learning to recognize the Dharma

220
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:47,940
qualities that are all around us we will more and more be able to respond in line

221
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:53,460
with the Dharma which will be in a non-harming and Wise Way

222
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:59,339
so I wish you very well with your connection to the to the Dharma today

223
00:44:59,339 --> 00:45:02,060
thank you
