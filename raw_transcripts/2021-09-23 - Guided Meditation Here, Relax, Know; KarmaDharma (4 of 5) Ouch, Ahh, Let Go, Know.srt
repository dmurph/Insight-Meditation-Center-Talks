1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:09,519
welcome and uh warm welcome to all of you and to being here together for our

2
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:15,320
meditation and um

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:26,160
the general idea of mindfulness meditation is or the underlying kind of

4
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,398
kind of a practice or direction or attitude is

5
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,800
that of being simple uh being simple with the instructions being simple with the practice moment by

6
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,640
moment and in the simplest way of describing that

7
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:51,520
is just to know what's happening as it's happening but the buddhist path

8
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:58,640
has two primary components of this kind of using our

9
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,559
mental attention and our minds and practice

10
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,600
one is to relax

11
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,760
or as it gets more deeper in practice to let go

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,880
to let go and then to know

13
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,439
but because it's uh difficult to just sit down and let go

14
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:33,360
um the uh first uh

15
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:40,000
is to be here here be really really be here in the

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,840
simplicity of this moment

17
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:52,119
relax let go and know

18
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:06,240
so and then you do it again here

19
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,480
relax and know know what's happening very simply

20
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:19,840
know it without any reactivity without any interpretations without any story

21
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:27,360
just know the simplicity of this moment to relax is to relax

22
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,040
in the simplest way that's available to not have ambitions not strained to

23
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,720
relax to relax what we can to let go

24
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:46,000
to let go of what's appropriate the meaning of letting go in the teachings of the buddha

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,200
is the primary orientation around it is to not let go of things

26
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:58,319
but let go of our clinging to things or grasping to things ideas identities

27
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:05,840
desires and here

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,800
just here nowhere else so maybe that can be the

29
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:20,720
rhythm or the practice if you'd like for these this meditation and you can say to yourself this this

30
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:27,280
the sequence here here to what's this here what's here for

31
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:34,640
you the simplest possible way of recognizing that just here

32
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,239
letting go relaxing maybe relaxing first later letting go

33
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:48,400
maybe letting go first then relaxing and then recognizing what's here

34
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:55,200
recognizing that we're in our bodies

35
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,840
here in our bodies recognizing the breathing in the body

36
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:10,799
here with the breathing relaxing with the breathing recognizing there's inhales and exhales

37
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:18,479
here with the inhales and exhales recognizing some of the sensations and

38
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:24,560
that come in with the inhale some sensations that come with the exhale

39
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,639
letting go of stories around breathing what's supposed to happen around breathing

40
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,160
and then recognize just recognize what's here maybe recognizing the breathing more

41
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,080
fully or recognizing the pleasure of having let go of stories

42
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,000
and expectations agendas and then here

43
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:55,040
and whatever is here it's easy and obvious that's here and now

44
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:01,199
in the simplicity of this moment and as we to go through these cycles

45
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:07,440
of hear relax know perhaps it hit them it's a movement of

46
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,520
becoming simpler and simpler with what's here less story

47
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:20,960
less future less past less interpretations less reactivity

48
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,400
a contentment to just be here with this experience

49
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,120
so um taking a posture

50
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,800
that you think is suitable for you

51
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,360
to be both alert and maintaining some physical

52
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:50,320
presence alertness stability to let go deeply

53
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:56,160
while the body is aligned if you're sitting upright

54
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,479
aligned in an upright posture it doesn't collapse

55
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:14,240
and then to let your gaze

56
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:22,479
be relaxed maybe gazing down at about 45 degrees

57
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:30,479
relaxing around the eyes not looking at anything in particular

58
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,720
soft gaze

59
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,080
and then gently closing your eyes

60
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:50,800
taking a few long slow deep breaths to become established here

61
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,120
just here

62
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:09,840
and then to let your breathing return to normal

63
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,840
and i'll go through this these three part sequence for a little bit and you can follow

64
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,240
along

65
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:32,720
so very simply recognize what's here

66
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,360
experientially in the present moment for you

67
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:53,759
it's more like just be here with it here you are

68
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,840
and then as you exhale perhaps you can relax

69
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,479
let go

70
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:13,280
and then know what's here very simple

71
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:19,680
maybe one word recognition it's

72
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:30,400
and then again here may be given what you have known

73
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:38,919
be here with this be here with your experience

74
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:48,760
as you exhale relax let go

75
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:00,640
and then know recognize what is here

76
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:07,839
recognize what is obvious that's simple and obvious to know

77
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,680
here in your experience not elsewhere

78
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:20,160
not other places and times not about anything different than what's

79
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,839
experienced here

80
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:37,839
and then here be here with whatever is close in

81
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,760
whatever the experience is that centered here

82
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:57,680
relax let go of any holding tightening

83
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,320
and having let go and relaxed know

84
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,759
something about this present experience that stands out

85
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,200
no need to search just what comes

86
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,360
and then here

87
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,120
relax

88
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,040
and no

89
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:15,920
and then as you do this relaxing and knowing perhaps you're settling in more

90
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,920
and more into your experience here in your body

91
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,480
your breathing

92
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,680
here relax

93
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:45,440
and know it whatever whatever rhythm you want

94
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,440
whatever pace and as you get settled

95
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:58,560
if you want to drop one of the three and then two of the three

96
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:07,279
and then all three drop them in order drop here

97
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,600
drop relaxing

98
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,560
and only if you're very very still relax

99
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,560
knowing

100
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:42,200
remembering to be here in your experience

101
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:55,720
remembering to let go relax even if it's micro relaxations

102
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:10,320
and to know to recognize what is obvious

103
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,799
in this immediacy of direct experience

104
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,600
okay

105
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,360
so

106
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:23,360
and as we come to the end of the sitting perhaps to consider

107
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,480
that doing this practice of hear

108
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,640
relax recognize

109
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,760
how that benefits the people we interact with through the

110
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:46,640
day how is it to be really here with

111
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:52,240
someone how is it to be at ease

112
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,440
while we're with them and what is it to

113
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:04,240
really know what's happening with the person with yourself

114
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,760
between the two of you what benefits comes

115
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:16,679
how are these relationships enhanced and developed this way

116
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:26,399
the practice we do on the cushion can serve us so well

117
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:34,000
in in our world in our being with others and relating to others

118
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:46,320
and to offer the benefits of this practice to be shared with others

119
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:52,880
and to feel how the practice benefits us in social situations

120
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:58,600
can deepen how we practice when we're sitting alone

121
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:07,760
may we share this practice with the world in how we

122
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,960
are present how we are at ease

123
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,559
and how we see clearly

124
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:25,120
may we bring the benefits of this practice into the world to contribute to the welfare and

125
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:32,480
happiness of all beings may all beings be happy

126
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:41,279
may all beings be safe may all beings be peaceful

127
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:46,039
and may all beings be free

128
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:17,360
so continuing on this theme of the karmic stream and the dharmic stream

129
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:24,960
and the karmic stream the karmic momentum of our lives and how

130
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,320
karma is shaped how action shapes our ongoing

131
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:36,480
experience i keep wanting to refer you back to

132
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:44,240
how you can know this for yourself directly so it's not a metaphysical idea or abstract idea about

133
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:50,480
imaginary futures or pasts that you can actually watch it work

134
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,799
in your mind in your body here and now if we pay careful attention

135
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:04,880
and it's one of the primary principles of that dolphin comes along with this

136
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,559
karma teachings teachings about action actions that have ongoing repercussions

137
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:16,480
in our lives that actions which condition us or influence us

138
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:25,279
ongoingly in a way sometimes that we don't understand why we're so compelled to act and be certain ways

139
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:33,120
um is so the the the way that our actions condition us influence us or has lays traces within

140
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:40,000
us imprints things within us is based on a very simple principle

141
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,240
that in order to make this very simple

142
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:52,159
i'll do it in two steps the first step is it's based on the notion

143
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:58,480
that we can know what brings with it an ouch

144
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:05,760
and what brings with it an ah and i use those little expressions so

145
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:13,360
that we don't get and narrowed down by the words that might express that

146
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:19,760
so for example we have the idea of good karma and bad karma and as soon as we say it that way which

147
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:27,360
is a common enough expression it narrows it it's confusing it can be confusing it can be

148
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:33,600
imply morality all kinds of things are kind of come along with that but maybe it's very simple just to

149
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:41,200
recognize experientially that does some things we do as we do them as part

150
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:47,518
of it is ouch and some things we do has an ah

151
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:53,760
and uh and so that's the first principle the second one is that um

152
00:32:53,760 --> 00:33:00,320
those things which are are propelled by or or conditioned by or come along with an

153
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:06,559
ouch they tend to produce more ouches those things which are compelled by are

154
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:12,559
pushed along by an ah they are um

155
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:17,760
they produce more of the same ah and um

156
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:24,399
this is not the same thing as comfort and discomfort but uh something deeper a sense of

157
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:29,519
the buddhists like to call suffering or happiness but

158
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:37,360
that principle the key thing is here is that what propels it what is the motivating force what's the

159
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:43,600
the um atmosphere or the the condition which we something is done if we say

160
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:49,760
something do something or even think something and what's propelling it

161
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:56,640
is some feeling inside some motivation inside some uh something inside

162
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,840
which uh in and of itself just feels like if you're really careful and

163
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:09,200
pay attention to it we feel oh that hurts that's ouch um and uh or we can feel it that's what's

164
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:16,000
good it's ah that's good ah that feels right and um

165
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,280
and so uh karma is uh when when things are acted

166
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:27,599
on from that kind of compulsion or propulsion um then uh they tend to produce more and

167
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,800
you can watch that in your mind with your thoughts if there are thoughts that are

168
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:39,118
being propelled by our our anger and our hostility or our attachment or our

169
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:45,200
um um greed that uh if that's kind of the

170
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:51,919
propulsion of it then it a thought of greed a thought of anger

171
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:58,560
tends to produce more of the same not necessarily more anger or more greed but it kind of that

172
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:03,760
the very movement of anger and greed is another ouch

173
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,800
so if what propels it is an ouch then the thing itself is an ouch and it

174
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,920
creates kind of more propulsions more influence more conditionality

175
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,839
for further thinking that way and

176
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:27,839
so if for example there is greed for something because there is a feeling of

177
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:34,960
of a feeling somehow very critical of oneself and we want

178
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,160
someone wants relief well the movement for relief through through greed

179
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:47,680
is being propelled by an ouch that criticism for oneself the greed itself is an ouch and that

180
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:53,680
whole movement then brings along more um criticism of self like now i'm greedy

181
00:35:53,680 --> 00:36:00,000
and bad or uh creates more conditions to be more greedy or think that's the answer or if there is a little bit

182
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,800
relief from the greed because it's fulfilled we get what we want then that reinforces that this is the

183
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,320
way out to get more relief and so we end up in a cycle

184
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:20,320
and uh classically they say that the what creates the momentum of karma the

185
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:26,880
karmic repercussions is the intention uh for uh what we do

186
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,240
um but i think that it's not just intention it's uh it's what propels it what uh

187
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:38,640
it's more than that then tension seems kind of narrow and almost philosophical or or like an agenda or a

188
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:44,720
very clear idea it's more like the mood behind it or they

189
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:50,880
that's there and so in mindfulness practice one of the things we do with our thoughts for

190
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:56,160
example when there's a lot of intense thoughts is um they were caught in them

191
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:02,720
is to uh notice them the emotionality the mood

192
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:09,680
uh the conditions that out of which the thoughts are being coming and we're getting uh more and

193
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:16,960
more as we develop mindfulness we start seeing that underlying the surface expressions of our thoughts

194
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,960
the thoughts we can see or the actions we can see there's layers and layers of of um

195
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:30,320
conditioning of of um attachments of clinging of motivations

196
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:36,560
that um uh are really the real issue the real thing that that shapes and influences

197
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:44,160
karma extreme now some of this karmic stream can be positive it can have ah in it

198
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:51,440
and but it still involves a kind of a propulsion a kind of movement that

199
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,640
is keeps us active it kind of promotes a kind of agitation even though it can do

200
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:03,520
a lot of good for ourselves and the world uh when there's a propulsion a compulsion to do these things there's

201
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:09,359
this uh it might feel pleasant but there's a kind of agitation there

202
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:16,400
it is not ultimately uh the best for us and so there's a whole other line we can

203
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:23,839
take which is a dharmic stream and uh the positive the ah

204
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:29,280
karmic stream supports the dharma extreme it creates the conditions that leads us to

205
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:35,760
uh being a good place to enter this dharm extreme the dharma extreme

206
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:44,240
is is found through two primary ways that we enter into it

207
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:49,760
one is to let go and the other is to know

208
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,880
so to let go and to know and these are the kind of the core practices of the

209
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:01,920
buddha can be put in these two two categories some of them are more focused on deep

210
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:07,839
letting go and relaxation and some of them focus more on knowing

211
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:13,280
the ones that have to do with letting go are the ones that tend to produce the most happiness

212
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:20,160
the ones that have to do with knowing produces the most clarity and but this this happiness and this

213
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:25,359
clarity is not something we're willing intending it's not something that we're

214
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:32,240
creating it's not coming from a constructed action that what we're doing it's not part of the karmic stream

215
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:38,960
um it's almost like uh we're getting out of the way we're not interfering we're not pushing

216
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:44,000
we're not there's no compulsion to act and to do and

217
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,200
and so letting go is a lot to do about letting out getting out of the way and allowing

218
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:55,520
something to move through us not a compulsion but an inspiration

219
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,880
um we're not pushing something but something is

220
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:06,000
is is flowing

221
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,280
rather than pushing and then uh we're not um

222
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,480
uh caught up in our agendas and reactivities and what we

223
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:23,440
want to have and looking for and trying to understand the way forward to fix things we're just knowing in a very

224
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:30,960
simple way and that's that produces clarity and clarity also has space for things

225
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:38,640
and so the the dharm extreme involves a kind of a whole paradigm shift to change about

226
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:45,280
how we live our lives what motivates our lives or where the center of our lives is

227
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:51,200
it is not a life that's based on the on the wanting that

228
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:57,280
characterizes somehow one way the other the karma extreme including wanting what's good wanting

229
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:02,319
the ah and it might seem like why not want

230
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:09,200
what's good and healthy sure it's fine to do it and it can be a lot of very beneficial

231
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:16,240
but it's only half the half the picture it's only half the story of what's possible for us

232
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:23,839
and most people only live in the karmic world and that's what they're navigating and negotiating and always moving around

233
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:29,040
and it's a little bit like rearranging the deck chairs in the titanic

234
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:36,560
the the dharma stream is involves a whole different paradigm

235
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:42,319
and it's like learning to how to float to swim so we don't have to move all the deck

236
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:47,920
chairs around as the ship goes down and uh and they said and how we float

237
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:53,200
how we swim is we learn how to uh let go

238
00:41:53,200 --> 00:42:00,160
of reactivity let go of clinging and wanting and this compulsion of the karmic stream

239
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:06,640
and we learn a kind of very clear and simple knowing that brings clarity

240
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:12,160
uh a clarity it is not agitated by by the wanting mind

241
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:17,920
and um and in that letting go and clarity and getting out of the way

242
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:23,680
something supports us something begins moving through us something gets awakened

243
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:28,800
that uh there is wisdom clarity and letting go

244
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:34,720
makes available a lot of wisdom and clarity but what's happening here with ourselves and the world around us

245
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:40,960
it gives room in the heart for love and care and and compassion in a way it's very

246
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:48,000
different feeling for it than any kind of compassion that's maybe genuine enough but has um wanting as

247
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,480
part of it or has self and self-concern as part of it clarity and letting go

248
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:01,599
is radically selfless and because of that it's not exhausting it's not tiring

249
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:09,520
in the way that the karmic stream is when some of it much of is motivated by me myself and mine

250
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:15,440
so um so you might you know see today as you go about the

251
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:21,359
day what's going on with your thought stream and

252
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:26,400
is there an ouch or an awe in how you think

253
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:33,119
and if you notice an ouch look more deeply and see if there's a deeper mood or place that those thoughts

254
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:38,640
are coming out of and see if that also has an ouch probably it will

255
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:44,000
and if there's an ah in those thought streams then look below that and see if there's

256
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,760
some deeper mood or way of being that also feels like comes from an ah

257
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:56,240
stay close to the ah and see if that's staying close to it supports you

258
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,760
to let go relax

259
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:10,160
and to know clearly what's here so thank you and

260
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:17,560
i hope this little exercise today is nice for you to do
