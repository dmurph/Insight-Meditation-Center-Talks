00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:15,160
good morning from Redwood City and welcome to this meditation

2
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:21,359
session meditation is often associated with calm

3
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:29,960
tranquility and in the ancient instructions the Buddha gave for meditation he emphasized this and he EMP

4
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:38,000
ized it by uh saying that it's uh okay or encourage people to instructed people

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,480
to calm uh the body whatever ways the body

6
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,840
is agitated let it be calm

7
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,760
it bring a gentling force to the body so that it

8
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:02,239
can settle he emphasized calming the mind the agitated

9
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:09,600
mind again bringing to the mind the kind of reassurance that kind of

10
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:16,159
settling that calms the mind we can apply his teachings

11
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:25,159
instructions to one more area of calming and that is to calm how we

12
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:31,119
know mindfulness is a lot to do with knowing recog recognizing what's

13
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:36,799
happening as it's happening so in the present moment and

14
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:43,520
it also has to do with feeling or sensing what is happening as it's

15
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,920
happening and the Art of mindfulness is to somehow move

16
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:55,600
between knowing and sensing and

17
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,399
um and some people would prefer one over the other as a calming

18
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:06,479
force and sometimes it's invaluable to go back and forth and to have for a

19
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:14,640
while one for a while the other and um but either way we can what

20
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,840
we can try to practice is to know

21
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:27,879
calmly to sense our experience calmly and that helps when we're body is

22
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:34,080
agitated the mind is agitated I and there doesn't seem to be much room to change

23
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:42,640
that but we can step back metaphorically to observe to

24
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:49,360
know in a calm way and for people who use Mental noting uh this can really

25
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,560
help us find the calm way of knowing so if you breathing in to say

26
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,599
in but to find a way in the mind as

27
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:09,080
you have the thought in to do it in a calm way maybe even a calming

28
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:15,200
way and now when you are breathing out say the word

29
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:22,360
out or some people count the breath and to count in a calm way and a calming

30
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:28,280
way and um if we are agitated no we're

31
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:36,239
agitated but to know it in a calm way and if it's a more useful and more subtl

32
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:44,280
to sense and feel the agitation in the body or in the mind to sense it

33
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:50,640
calmly and um in the way that maybe you would um

34
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:57,640
calmly p a cat or calmly if you're a woodworker feel the

35
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:03,360
surface of wood to feel smooth it is or how rough it Still

36
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,480
Remains so to know calmly to sense

37
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:18,600
calmly and if you can to allow yourself to calm relax the

38
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:26,120
body so to assume a meditation posture and

39
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:35,680
to adjust the posture sure in a way that you think will allow the greatest

40
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:42,000
settling and for some of us it might seem paradoxical that the greatest settling

41
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,440
happens when the body is placed upright and um of course that's not

42
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:56,720
possible always but um there's a way in which the shoulders

43
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,240
can soften and relax if they're

44
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:09,160
hanging from the from you know from the

45
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,720
Torso and the pull of gravity supports their

46
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:28,160
relaxing gently closing the eyes and gently maybe in a gentling way

47
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:34,639
calming way take some deeper

48
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,560
longer inhales and

49
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,560
exhales on the inhale feeling the

50
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:54,400
body on the exhale relaxing the

51
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,479
body maybe a exhaling an extra second or two so there's a little bit more

52
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,680
opportunity to let go in the

53
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:22,560
body and then letting the breathing return to

54
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:30,039
normal and with a whatever seems like an ordinary breath

55
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:32,440
close

56
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,360
enough on the exhales continue to relax the

57
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,758
body or

58
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,440
soften sometimes it's nice to take the inhale as a time to feel some part of

59
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:03,039
the body and the exhale to relax

60
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:08,800
it so breathing in and feeling the

61
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,720
face breathing out softening the face

62
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:40,400
breathing in and feeling the shoulders breathing out relaxing the

63
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:51,599
shoulders noticing if a small shift in how the arms

64
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:59,758
are positioned can let the shoulders relax a little bit more

65
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,840
on the inhale to feel the area of your chest the heart

66
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:24,039
area and then to relax on the exhale

67
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:45,120
on the inhale feeling the belly and softening the belly as you

68
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,120
exhale

69
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,680
on the inhale feeling a broad awareness of your

70
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:21,160
body and on the exhale calming the whole body

71
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,399
and on the inhale feeling your mind your thinking

72
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:48,839
mind feeling whatever way it's activated

73
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,959
energized whatever way it

74
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:01,320
is agitated or not

75
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:11,079
and on the exhale calming the

76
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,240
mind maybe with the image of letting the

77
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:27,360
Mind spread out and settle down like the surface of a

78
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,279
lake that has waves Wes that

79
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:57,360
settle and then calmly settling yourself on the

80
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,240
experience of breathing in your body

81
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:12,440
body centering yourself on the rhythm of breathing in

82
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,040
and breathing

83
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:36,200
out and as you breathe in clearly know you're breathing

84
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:41,560
in and clearly know as you're breathing

85
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:50,360
out or allow yourself to

86
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:57,480
ride the inhales and exhales as you feel or

87
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,120
sense the rhythm of breathing in and

88
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:15,399
out and experiment with knowing breathing

89
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:23,720
calmly sensing and feeling breathing calmly

90
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:39,079

91

calmness can your mindfulness become cm

thank

00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:30,919
you e

159
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:26,639
so hello everyone and welcome to this second talk on the hindrances where the focus is uh

160
00:32:26,639 --> 00:32:34,360
to understand understand how the hindrances are UNH wholesome and how to bring in the

161
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:41,200
wholesome that the hindrances hinder our wisdom for how to act in this world how

162
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:48,000
to be in this world and but when we understand the difference between UNH wholesome ways of

163
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,360
being and wholesome then it's easier to choose the Wholesome Way the healthy way

164
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:00,039
the wise way and in the modern world it might be

165
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:08,559
shorthand to say this that's more accessible for many people is to see the difference between a stressful way of

166
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:16,000
responding to a calm way of responding and uh no matter how

167
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,880
difficult the situation is uh it can make it more difficult if we get agitated if we get more and more

168
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:28,639
stressed in the situation and um and we might have more wisdom

169
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:33,840
more wiser wiser ways of responding uh better able to understand

170
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:41,240
the situation if we can stay calm if we can somehow not allow the stress to take

171
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:47,159
over um and so um one of the so today

172
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:55,279
the hindrance to look at this uh going backwards through the list is uh uh

173
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:01,399
agitation and regrets agitation and uh

174
00:34:01,399 --> 00:34:08,560
remorse I like the word remorse because uh in Latin it uh literally means um

175
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:14,398
kind of to chew again to you're chewing something over and over again in an agitated stressful

176
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:21,480
way it's possible that uh it's helpful to understand this agitation as a

177
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:27,800
stressful stressful excitation and uh it can come from

178
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:35,679
anything that's UNH wholesome um there's a way in which greed uh can be um especially frustrated

179
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:43,638
greed or certain kind of excitement or ground greed can really agitate the system and in that agitation that

180
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:52,480
excitement uh we kind of lose ourselves and um anger hostility can be

181
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:59,119
um also excited and and uh if it's frustrated if ation if aversion comes

182
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:05,359
from a lot of frustration frustration makes kind of build can build up the tension in the body the agitation in the

183
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:13,880
body or pursuing uh uh or kind of engaging and fueling uh feeding anger

184
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:21,200
and hostility can come with a lot of agitation in the body and this agitation we're looking at

185
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:27,119
here uh it's possible to feel to recognize that it doesn't feel healthy

186
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:32,400
to have it that uh it uh puts on a lot of stress it

187
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,839
we kind of lose ourselves in it it's kind of like takes over and there's a kind of a maybe I don't know if it's a

188
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:45,280
surrender to it but it has such a kind of a uh convincing force that we almost

189
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:51,800
believe that whatever we're agitated about that you know we get involved in

190
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:57,119
agitation and um and we can so we can be agitated by

191
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:02,800
many things things that bother us many things that we want different we can

192
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:08,040
also be agitated by uh uh our regrets

193
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:14,839
our remorse for what we have done in the past and uh ideally uh the regrets are

194
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:21,480
genu involve things we genuinely we deserve to have some kind of um regret

195
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:29,200
for but to spend our time chewing over it oh ruminating over and over and over again uh about the things we done in the

196
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:34,680
past um is debilitating and keep the mind kind of on a Surface

197
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:40,640
agitation uh in the Buddhist approach to uh having done something

198
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:47,040
which causes harm or something which has some kind of fault to it um is uh not to

199
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:53,200
be stuck in a backward-looking mind reviewing the past over and over again

200
00:36:53,200 --> 00:37:00,160
but to uh look at the past just enough to learn how to do better and then to be

201
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:06,640
forward-looking even inspired to try to to live now uh Having learned from that

202
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:13,640
and let's do better in the future so we don't want to ignore what we've done that we need to learn from but we also

203
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:18,920
don't want to be weighed down by it uh the idea in Buddhism is to always look

204
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:24,040
how can I respond uh how can I live in an onward

205
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:30,839
leading way to A Life That's calm that's peaceful ful that's liberating that's um

206
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:37,440
loving even and um and so to be inspired by that possibility of an onward looking

207
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:44,240
way to go and agitation doesn't do that agitation is stuck in an UNH wholesome

208
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:50,040
um the kind of agitation we're talking about here as a hindrance covers over

209
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:56,920
wisdom covers over our ability to see what is actually a healthy Wholesome Way

210
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:04,000
of engaging in an issue a problem uh taking care of something and um and so

211
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:12,240
it's very important to uh see and feel the limitations that come with being

212
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:19,240
agitated limitations that um come with ruminating over and over over again with

213
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:26,000
regrets and remorse that we might have and part of a wise life in Buddhism

214
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:33,400
is actually to recognize how C the the what the Buddhism calls the dangers but the limitations the

215
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:39,640
downside of uh of things which are unhealthy for us and the reference point

216
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:44,880
for that unhealthy is somatic is really to feel in our body that something is

217
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:53,240
off something is grading something feels um uh deflating something feels uh makes

218
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:59,040
us feel tense and or empty or AF afraid

219
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:05,040
or uh kind of uneasy in some way and uh

220
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,960
and knowing that that is not really how we want to live what can we do to bring

221
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,800
in what's wholesome healthy that has a sense of ease to it and can we

222
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,160
understand the value of doing that can we understand the the downside of the

223
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:27,960
UNH wholesome and the upside of the wholesome and then choose the wholesome

224
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:35,960
and the simplest wholesome thing for a mindfulness practitioner is to be mindful uh to be mindful calmly and

225
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:42,839
clearly so that the mindfulness is not uh entangled caught up in aversion greed

226
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:48,839
and conceit uh another thing that's wholesome to do when there's a lot of

227
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:55,319
agitation uh the body stressed out in some way the Mind stressed is to

228
00:39:55,319 --> 00:40:00,440
calm um uh the the Buddha put a lot of emphasis

229
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:07,040
when he taught mindfulness to begin mindfulness by calming the body in mind

230
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:14,240
um the uh to um relax and it's interesting the Buddha

231
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:22,160
called um the food for calm the what feeds calm is calm itself so whatever

232
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:28,119
degree of calm that we experience uh let that register don't uh

233
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:35,359
because maybe it's not so exciting calm uh the mind orients us to what's exciting or Orient towards what's big

234
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:43,040
and kind of doesn't understand the value of calm that that's really a good place to be and so to recognize when we're

235
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:50,079
settled Rec recognize when there's a Tranquility or a peace and that recognition supports it to continue so

236
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:56,760
we don't lose track with it track of it don't forget wholesomeness don't forget

237
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:02,680
uh don't lose track of it maintain it don't sacrifice it too easily because we

238
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:09,240
see something that excites us and in the excitement we become agitated we become

239
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:16,680
caught and we're no longer really present for ourselves so um

240
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:24,079
so if we live our life and that's the theme for this week uh attentive and and

241
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:29,880
uh knowledgeable and and uh uh to be able to feel and

242
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:37,240
sense when what's going on feels unhealthy when what goes on feels

243
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:43,680
healthy physically mentally spiritually that's the guide for

244
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:49,599
ourselves and um and this is the way that I've been talking about lately that

245
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:56,680
you become a self whisper that you want to really um be ATT tuned have a report

246
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:04,880
with yourself have a sensitivity to yourself that you can read yourself well you know yourself well you you can

247
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:12,359
approach yourself uh in a way that uh the inner life feels safe feels calm

248
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:18,480
feel held feels respected if we're caught in agitation

249
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:24,040
caught with regrets from all kinds caught with resentments of any kind that

250
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:29,079
um and the way that we are aware of ourselves the way that we know ourselves

251
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:34,720
is through the filter of the agitated stress the agitated excitement if it's

252
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:41,319
through the filter of regrets and maybe even criticisms of ourselves that then

253
00:42:41,319 --> 00:42:47,000
the inner life just feels more of the same it feeds the wholesome feeds the

254
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,400
wholesome the UNH wholesome feeds the UNH wholesome and so we don't want to keep

255
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:58,520
doing it that way and it can be a phenomenal exercise phenomenally

256
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:07,280
freeing to at least kind of take a deep breath and

257
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:14,400
know how you are in a calm way almost as if you're saying to yourself

258
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:22,040
oh I'm quite agitated right now to take that long to say it you know two seconds

259
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:28,559
or whatever um can change the whole dynamic it's like stepping out of the

260
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:34,160
feeding mechanism that keeps feeding and fueling

261
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:40,720
agitation and then to feel to recognize that that calm way of knowing is

262
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:49,240
wholesome and to begin finding ways to support the growth of a healthy

263
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:57,160
positive uh supportive way of being in this world by being able to read and

264
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:03,240
feel and sense um deeply uh what's happening in here in

265
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:09,400
for ourselves what the need is um how to approach in a way that's supportive and

266
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:16,800
helps create safety and kindness and to learn for mindfulness to be that approach to mindfulness be the

267
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:22,880
sensitivity the care the Rapport that helps the inner life settle helps the

268
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:29,440
inner life feel safe and cared for and respected and generally when there's a lot of

269
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:39,200
agitation and regrets remorse uh the inner life um uh feels uh you know

270
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:45,319
doesn't feel supported it feels like it's being somehow

271
00:44:45,319 --> 00:44:51,800
um made more and more uneasy so don't please don't

272
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:58,079
underestimate the tremendous value of being calm it can certainly be over done

273
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:03,400
certainly be attached to cob and try to hold on to it there's a time for healthy

274
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:09,640
excitement and hopefully uh by being cognizant of the impact our Behavior has

275
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:16,319
on ourselves we'll recognize when healthy excitement is um is healthy and

276
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:24,040
when excitement is not so um may you have a calm day and

277
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:31,839
may you bring quality of Tranquility uh to help everyone feel safer and more

278
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:36,599
at ease thank you
