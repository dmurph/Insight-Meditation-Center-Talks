1
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:10,000
so in doing breath meditation and doing the sana panasati

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,320
over these weeks from one perspective we're going through it slowly from another perspective we're going

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,600
through it uh quickly and i'm sure there's people

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,720
who feel it both way one way or the other and uh from the slow perspective

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:35,040
we're putting together slowly piece by piece the el the alphabet for breath

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:42,079
meditation all the little basic elements and um and uh

7
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:48,640
learning you know once you learn the alphabet that gives you access to

8
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:56,320
a tremendous wealth of knowledge potential for communication writing

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:05,760
reading uh understanding all kinds of things that come alive with reading and writing

10
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,799
and so in the same way we're learning kind of the basic elements the alphabet in the sense of

11
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:18,159
all the little things to notice and be aware of as we're breathing and um and then slowly over time these

12
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,439
begin to be put together and after a while it's you know you can read

13
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:28,880
the book pretty quickly or easily maybe and so after a while we get a sense of

14
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:35,360
the all the little elements how they come together and create the grammar of meditation and

15
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:43,360
create the sentences of spirituality and freedom so um we're going to continue and uh

16
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:49,680
with this um with this uh

17
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:57,200
our education and elements of breathing

18
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:04,320
in meditation so to assume a meditation posture

19
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,840
and taking a few moments to settle into your posture

20
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:17,280
to maybe sway a little bit front and back

21
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,720
forward sideways

22
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,560
maybe twisting a little bit maybe making small adjustments

23
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:36,959
so that the the weight and the way your body is organized

24
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,480
can be one that is settling for you

25
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,920
that allows certain things to settle and so that taking your meditation

26
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,040
posture is a little bit of a homecoming or a little

27
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,360
coming to a place where you have some modicum of contentment

28
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,640
and so taking the time to feel that not to be in a hurry in meditation

29
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:16,879
and overlook the basic establishing your posture and in doing so

30
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:26,959
establish a mindfulness of the body establish a degree of embodiment in this

31
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,840
posture

32
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:45,920
and then to close your eyes and take a few moments to feel this body

33
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:52,480
okay sense how the what's happening in the body

34
00:03:52,480 --> 00:04:00,480
all the different kinds of sensations that come alive in the body

35
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:08,319
and don't don't focus on any particular one just let your attention roam around

36
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,280
taking it all in

37
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:29,840
and if in doing so there are still some small adjustments in the posture it can still be a good thing to do

38
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:56,400
and then ever so gently ever so lightly

39
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,280
bring your awareness close to your breathing

40
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,639
not head long into it just kind of on the edges of it maybe and begin

41
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,120
feeling the experience of the body breathing

42
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:30,400
maybe coming to the breathing through your back and from there towards

43
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:39,840
the front lightly slowly

44
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,840
and taking a few moments to familiarize yourself

45
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:07,840
with how the body's breathing

46
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:22,720
and letting your attention quietly roam around the various places in the

47
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,720
body where the movements and the pressures and the

48
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:49,840
release of pressures appear that are associated with breathing

49
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,680
and perhaps as you exhale there's some places in your body that

50
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,520
the breathing can relax more

51
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:17,840
release as you exhale

52
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,240
perhaps as you exhale there can be a softening

53
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,840
in the breathing body

54
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:59,840
and feeling more fully the experience of inhaling

55
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:11,599
and ever so gently as you inhale inhale

56
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,639
more fully longer inhale

57
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:33,680
so in the as you inhale the chest expands or fully

58
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:41,839
maybe there's a lifting of the shoulders

59
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,760
and not breathing in so fully or deeply that you get winded

60
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:55,839
in a relaxed way

61
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:22,320
and as you inhale see if you can notice if there's any

62
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:30,959
upwelling feelings the way in which energy in your body or a lightning feel

63
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:38,320
feeling it of lightness a feeling of movement that's lifts

64
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,839
upward through your torso and up towards the head

65
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,399
a little movement that is energizing

66
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:08,880
perhaps as you breathe in a little deeper than usual

67
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:19,760
there's a movement towards greater clarity

68
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:33,839
especially if you let the thinking mind get quiet as you feel it more fully

69
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:44,399
and energetics that is that moves in the direction of waking you up

70
00:10:44,839 --> 00:11:01,360
awakening a clarity and a lightness

71
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,760
and if you do this breathe deeper breathing just very slightly

72
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:15,120
is there anything that feels pleasant in doing so in the is there an upwelling that brings

73
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:22,720
pleasure or pleasantness maybe even delight

74
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,200
some people might feel there's things get brighter a little bit more

75
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:43,839
light in the mind

76
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:52,160
and letting your breathing return to normal but still on the inhale

77
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:59,519
is there any upwelling feelings that occur in your body

78
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:15,040
ever so ever so slightly a movement which lifts and straightens

79
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:25,839
the spine

80
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:35,360
and then as you exhale ride the exhale

81
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,000
with a very simple quiet ah

82
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:53,839
to feel the releasing the relaxing

83
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:05,040
and then on the inhale to receive and allow the upwelling

84
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,079
of energy of brightness

85
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:21,839
lightness receive it with the receiving of the in-breath

86
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:42,160
a releasing as you exhale that releases the edges of your body

87
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:49,839
releases tension in your body

88
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:58,240
will you release into a tingling vibration

89
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:17,839
warmth softness in the body perhaps

90
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:31,839
and then receiving allowing the upwelling of in-breath of the inhale

91
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,600
the exhale tends to be more for relaxation

92
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:59,839
the inhale more for energizing or brightening

93
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:40,320
and as you're breathing is there any feelings of pleasure

94
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:47,759
pleasantness the joy

95
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:58,320
that comes along with the body breathing in

96
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:08,639
the body exhaling

97
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,839
allow that pleasure

98
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:23,839
to flow through your body as you inhale

99
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:37,839
maybe flowing in an upward direction or outwards

100
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,839
maybe it flows downwards as you exhale

101
00:16:53,600 --> 00:17:02,079
receive and let it spread through the inhale and ride on it as it in the exhale

102
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:08,640
let it flow it could be very subtle tingling and

103
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,640
warmth feeling of goodness

104
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:25,918
pleasure and as you breathe with a quiet mind

105
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,280
letting your thinking become very quiet and sensitive

106
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:39,840
so you're sensitive to feeling the pleasure that might be here

107
00:17:39,840 --> 00:18:01,840
with your in-breaths and out-breaths breathing in and breathing out

108
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:07,840
there may also be unpleasant sensations as you're sitting here

109
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:20,960
don't don't don't ignore that they're there but don't give them any real attention

110
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,880
let your attention go with the pleasant sensations of breathing the

111
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:34,080
pleasant sensations of just sitting here in your body

112
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:40,000
as if they are big enough to hold what's unpleasant

113
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:49,840
as if they are a tender caring for what's difficult

114
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:05,600
and if the mind wanders off in thought okay let yourself have a homecoming

115
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:14,159
into what's pleasant enjoyable contentful

116
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,840
in your body as you breathe

117
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,519
and as we come to the end of the sitting

118
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:05,279
perhaps with this light touch a light touch with the breathing

119
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:13,360
and the breathing as it moves through your body letting it have a light touch

120
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:20,799
on whatever is tender or difficult in your body

121
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,840
very tenderly touch it with your

122
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:32,880
breathing touch it with your light awareness

123
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:43,840
just a light touch of recognition of accompaniment

124
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:50,880
so that whatever pleasantness and joy there is contentment

125
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:59,278
it shares itself tenderly with what is difficult

126
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:11,840
what is not so pleasant

127
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,400
and in our capacity to sit here

128
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:39,840
quietly contentedly openly

129
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:50,320
maybe softly many different ways of

130
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:59,600
you might feel at the end of a meditation can you now lightly tenderly

131
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:07,840
just lightly touching opening to the suffering of the world

132
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,360
just touch the edge of the edges of it

133
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:25,279
no need to go into the middle of it challenges of our people you know and

134
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:33,520
don't know around the world a gentle soft

135
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:41,440
touch on the edges of their suffering arising out of your soft

136
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,840
light awareness soft light

137
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:55,120
breathing so their suffering doesn't disturb you

138
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,640
and you don't disturb them but you're there to accompany to

139
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:17,840
recognize to clearly see ah the world suffers

140
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,279
and then perhaps from whatever tenderness you have

141
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:30,320
towards a suffering world a tenderness that maybe comes from

142
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:36,240
it's seated in a place of meditative contentment

143
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:44,960
meditative ease or subtleness

144
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:51,039
and allow your compassion and care and good will

145
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:59,840
maybe to take the form of wishing well for others

146
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,158
wishing them happiness freedom from suffering

147
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:13,840
wishing them hell then well-being

148
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:27,840
may all beings be happy

149
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:33,600
may all beings be safe

150
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,840
may all beings be healthy

151
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,200
may all beings be free

152
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,799
and may all beings live together

153
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:09,840
in goodwill

154
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:46,158
so a couple of words kind of to end this meditation before switching to the talk

155
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:51,840
because of the nature of these 16 steps of anapanasati

156
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:58,080
you know there's more to teach as we go along and so maybe i'll be talking more guiding

157
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:04,000
more in meditation than maybe than usual and um

158
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:13,120
and what you might want to do and consider is to um if it works for your life

159
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:19,679
is to meditate a second time during the day even if it's just 10 minutes 15 minutes

160
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:25,519
or another half an hour and perhaps having a little more

161
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:30,559
practice with what we're doing in this guided meditation

162
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:37,279
and or build with it or allow for more of it to kind of percolate and develop and and then it might uh you might find

163
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:42,720
that it supports you more when you come so you have back to the guided meditation and also

164
00:31:42,720 --> 00:32:01,840
you might appreciate the time to have more silence to explore this on your own

165
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,720
so continuing on the 16 steps of breathing meditation that the buddha

166
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:16,559
taught that does come from a variety of places in the discourses of the buddha the most common

167
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:23,399
one place is a text called discourse on mindfulness of breathing

168
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:31,519
anapanasati suta and it's in the what's a collection called the middle length discourses

169
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:38,320
and there's been a variety of books that are you know ex explaining this or describing this the

170
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:43,919
descriptions are 16 steps are really just like cliff notes there's like brief sentences

171
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:50,158
and different meditation teachers will have a little different take or

172
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:56,480
explanation of how these work or what they are and which is appropriate there's many techniques and they're like

173
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:03,840
you know these are just kind of little placeholders for a whole universe of experience

174
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:09,120
so we're coming into the fifth and sixth step of anapanasati

175
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:16,960
and um it's um the fifth one says uh one trains in other words one

176
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:24,000
practices one like one practices the alphabet to really learn it one does it over and over again

177
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:33,440
one trains to trains that as one is breathing in

178
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:41,279
one experiences joy as one breathes one trains that as

179
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:49,519
one breathes out one experiences joy and then this the sixth the sixth one is as breathing in

180
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:57,360
one experiences happiness breathing out one experiences happiness

181
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:05,679
and the so these words for joy and happiness

182
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:11,839
some people will translate uh like the famous translator bhi kabody which has translated as a rapture

183
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:18,000
for joy and what i translate as happiness he translates as pleasure

184
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,240
and and the difference between these two is that uh whatever this uh the joy

185
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:30,158
factor is or um is it's a it's something that's a little bit energizing it's a little bit

186
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:36,960
it can be quite strong but it's something that's a little bit more like a thrill in the body

187
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:44,398
a delight it's a flow of energy or flow of pleasure in the body that is kind of uplifting

188
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:49,679
and delightful and and just has a lightning feeling

189
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:57,920
and and then the the next one that what i call happiness he calls pleasure is uh when the

190
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:05,040
energy energetics of joy quiet down that that the pleasure of the joy the

191
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,480
happiness of the joy remains something more subtle than something has more

192
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:17,040
sense of contentment some people get quite attached to the energetics of

193
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:23,599
joy and sometimes this feeling of ecstasy and rapture and very strong can course through our body the wave

194
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:29,200
cascading waves of joy and it's quite and can be quite intense

195
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:34,800
and but sooner or later people get a little tired of the energetics of it

196
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:42,400
and then the energy the energetics the upwelling energy of it begins to settle and quiet

197
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:49,760
and now there's kind of a state shift and and that uh and uh and in retrospect we see that the

198
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:56,000
joy has a kind of mental quality mental energetics of it that that settles and then we're more

199
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,520
subtle in the body and then a more feeling of contentment in the body

200
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:06,640
of well-being in the body tranquility in the body

201
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,760
that for me feels like a very sublime kind of

202
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:17,280
happiness but because it's more physical some translators like to translate it as

203
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:25,280
pleasure and because it doesn't have the mental energy of it of it as well

204
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:31,920
and um and so uh um and the operating word

205
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:37,760
verb is is one experiences uh you could just as well translate the

206
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,960
pali language word here as one feels when it allows when someone

207
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,800
really feels what it's there elsewhere the buddha says when this kind of pleasure or joy

208
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:55,280
begins to surface when it's allowed to feel it in such a way that it allows it to spread through the

209
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:01,520
body and as i said yesterday the buddha said this kind of pleasure or joy

210
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:09,119
is is not to be feared and as not to be kind of dismissed or

211
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:14,720
belittled it's actually quite a healthy thing to experience it some

212
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:21,200
people when they feel it finds very healing and it creates a context in the body and

213
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:26,320
the heart in order to better kind of be present for what is difficult

214
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:32,160
it's not a denial of what's difficult and painful in our lives or difficult

215
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:37,359
emotions and what's happening in the world around us but it's easier to

216
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:43,839
be present for it with uh without uh falling victim of it or being

217
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:52,160
oppressed by it or being you know suffering ourselves even more by it or feeling self-pity

218
00:37:52,160 --> 00:38:00,400
but because we have this goodness we have this joy happiness well-being in which to hold um the challenges of

219
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:06,400
our lives so um so uh

220
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:11,599
there's something about so this joy this well-being that comes in this step

221
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:19,520
comes a lot from really being starting to be absorbed or really intimate and continuous with

222
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:25,440
the experience of breathing it also comes when there's more sense of

223
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:32,480
a wholeness everything is included nothing's being held at bay and so the earlier steps the steps of

224
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:39,760
the body has to do with um really feeling the body and relaxing the body when the body is

225
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:45,760
tense the body is in a certain way not whole so we're kind of cut off from parts of it in this kind of way

226
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:52,079
but as we feel the body and relax the body there's feeling of wholeness of gathering together

227
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:59,359
and that gathering together and becoming whole is what contributes to the joy arising it's kind of like

228
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:05,119
we're creating the channels we're creating the the openings for this well-being to be

229
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:10,799
there that can come when we start becoming really

230
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:18,079
intimate or connected or continuous in the attention and so the awareness

231
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:24,000
itself gets gathered together to really be in the present moment

232
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,480
with the breathing as opposed to the thoughts jumping around here and there and about what's for dinner and what i'm doing

233
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:36,480
tomorrow and what i did yesterday or something the the mind begins to the wholeness the

234
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:42,640
mind also begins to gather around just this experience here the mind itself now

235
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:50,240
centers itself on the experience of the body just breathing and this i this centering itself in the

236
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:57,160
body breathing has the joy or the delight of you know the the problems of our life the

237
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:04,000
preoccupations the agitations the anxieties that are um that are fed by thoughts and

238
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,119
perpetuate by thoughts begin to quiet down and so just that is

239
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:17,040
a relief to have and then we uh and then this the combination of the

240
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:22,079
the mind's intimacy the awareness is intimacy with the whole experience of breathing in

241
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:29,760
and the wholeness of the body then it tends to um start producing from the inside out a

242
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:36,400
sense of goodness which is my kind of generic name for a whole whole class of things family of things

243
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:43,040
we might feel joy delight satisfaction contentment

244
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:49,359
pleasure that thrill wonderful feelings that come

245
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:55,440
and and they don't they come back for no good reason for what's outside in the world nothing

246
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,560
has to be better in the world in our you know it just comes because of this

247
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:07,280
really this intimacy and gathering together this harmony harmonizing of our whole being that

248
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:14,000
can come when we're really present here so the first uh four steps of panasonic

249
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,359
which can take a long time to kind of really do and have a lot to do with really finding

250
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:25,359
ourselves really present here in a whole way in an embodied way in an

251
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:30,720
inclusive way so it's not a narrow tight little concentration

252
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:38,319
but rather a centering on everything's included and everything is centered so the image i have for it

253
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:45,760
is a big bowl that if you take a a a marble and drop

254
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:50,800
it into this big bowl it'll go up and down and around and if you

255
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,920
dip lean into the bowl and push the marble you can just keep it going it just keeps

256
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:02,079
spinning forever if you keep pushing it but if we stop pushing it slowly slowly

257
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:09,760
it'll come to center at the bottom of the bowl with um the whole bowl is there but

258
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:16,000
it's center it's resting at the center so the same thing with our attention our thoughts our

259
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,520
awareness that we keep spinning it pushing the marbles in our mind with our

260
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:27,280
thoughts with our involvement with our interest with our reactivity to things and the mind just the thinking mind just

261
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:34,880
spins and goes and gets distracted but as we leave it alone then

262
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:40,880
everything begins to settle gather together and we support it with our practice of intimacy and getting close

263
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:46,000
to breathing and and uh and then with time we find we get

264
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:52,640
centered at the bottom of the bowl centered on the breathing and this can starts becoming a very

265
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:58,880
pleasant experience and uh very enjoyable and if

266
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:07,119
this uh the the joy factors begin bubbling up within and the buddha's description of this is

267
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:13,359
i think i said it recently is that of an uh water spring

268
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:19,359
flowing up into a lake and it just flows up from the inside and

269
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:26,000
spreads out and so with a for example sometimes you can feel that with the inhale

270
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:32,480
it's almost like there's an underwater spring under deep in her torso

271
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:39,599
right down near the base of our body or base of our chest or something and as we

272
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:46,319
breathe in there's an upwelling feeling of this and then as we exhale perhaps there's a

273
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:51,760
feeling of it flowing all back down again and flowing out because flow and flow

274
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,880
happening of this pleasure this energetics this lightness

275
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:02,400
they can be quite subtle when it begins happening and it's good to recognize it and

276
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:08,400
realize oh this is actually a good thing to pay attention to don't look for it when it's not there

277
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:14,880
don't try to manufacture it and don't feel like you have to have it this fifth step and sixth step of

278
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:20,800
anapanasati um it's you know only only sometimes it begins to cut happening

279
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:27,520
the core practices the first four and this is so beneficial just to stay in the first four for a long time

280
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:36,640
in a sense the longer we stay with the four the stronger foundation we allow ourselves to have for what follows

281
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:41,760
but unless you learn about this potential for joy and pleasure as part of the

282
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:48,480
meditation practice then you might not appreciate it when it happens you might not recognize it when

283
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:54,000
it happens and then you won't kind of include that or become whole with that

284
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:01,280
let that spread and open and receive it through your body and all this requires some modicum of a

285
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:07,280
quiet mind it doesn't have to be completely quiet there can be some thoughts in the background or

286
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:15,280
light thoughts so don't be at war with your thoughts and think you have to not think at all that just produces tension but

287
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:22,160
there is a quieting that happens as we practice so

288
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:28,560
mindfulness of breathing and i hope that you'll have some

289
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:35,680
opportunities through the day and through meditation to appreciate and value and enjoy

290
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:43,520
yourself breathing thank you very much
