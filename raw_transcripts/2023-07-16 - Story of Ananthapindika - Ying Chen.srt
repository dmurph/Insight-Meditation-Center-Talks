1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:07,140
yeah so good to be with you all again how's the sound sound works okay yeah

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:12,179
okay and welcome to those who are on YouTube

3
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,000
joining us as well from afar

4
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,260
um

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:32,940
so today I brought a story um and those of us who I like to read the

6
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:39,000
ancient Pali Canon sutas they're often the kind of names and

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,860
locations are showing up when we read the the sutas and and if you're like me

8
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:52,379
I get curious you know who are these people what do they live what their

9
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:59,940
lives are like you know and how did they practice and and um

10
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,978
so today I like to share a story of

11
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:10,200
um this person whose name is ananta pindica

12
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:18,360
some of you may know this and um the story and and I brought in was

13
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:26,400
based on a compilation um that helmuth hacker did collecting various

14
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:33,299
pieces of information from suitors and commentaries and jatica tales and kind

15
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:40,740
of put it together to give us a little picture of what this person's life is like

16
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:46,619
um this you know usually when you read sutas you have a little glimpse of what

17
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:53,579
this person is but you don't get quite a story so I'm grateful that uh hacker had

18
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:59,479
brought this together and um in the Suites

19
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:05,040
often and The Suitor has the opening line that sounds like this

20
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:12,540
have I heard one time the blessed one and the Buddha was staying at the sabati

21
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:18,860
in the jatas Grove in ananta pentecas monastery

22
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:31,739
and that shows up a lot in the Suites so who is this guy another pindica and

23
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:39,540
so another Pinnacle was a wealthy family Merchant or born out of a very

24
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:46,200
wealthy family and um we don't know exactly what his

25
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:52,140
profession was but um sometimes it's a set of wealthy Merchant

26
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:58,140
or wealthy Banker that's what they do back then being born

27
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:06,780
in a wealthy family and he was he lives in sabati and so this place that the

28
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:14,480
opening line stays states often and this person is known for his

29
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:21,300
boundless generosity so this name ananta pindica actually

30
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:30,560
means one who gives to the poor or one who gives to those who are unprotected

31
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:37,260
that's what the name amings that was not his birth name his birth

32
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:44,819
name is a sudata um but even before he met the Buddha

33
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:52,319
before he was a Buddhist disciple he was already known as anantapindica kind of

34
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,900
people had forgotten his birth name and they just call him another pindica

35
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:04,019
and so I wanted to maybe start um by telling the story of how he

36
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:12,959
encountered the Buddha and so this is the first year after the Buddhist Awakening Buddha had a very

37
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:20,239
small monastic order you know maybe just handful of people who joined him and

38
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:27,780
practiced and became awakened individuals as well and they don't have a place and to live

39
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,880
and this is this is around a place called rajagaha

40
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,120
and often this monastic order would live

41
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,419
in the forest near nearby they would stay in the mountain tops or by the

42
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:51,360
river or on the metal Open Fields and so that's kind of how they wandered around

43
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,580
they wandered about another Pinnacle I had a brother-in-law

44
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:04,139
who lives in rajakahan is from that household he is also quite wealthy

45
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:12,419
and uh being close by to the Buddha he also became a faithful disciple of the Buddha

46
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:19,139
and so he saw how the monastic lived and so he

47
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:26,699
went and asked the Buddha is it okay if I'm gonna build some Dwelling Places for

48
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:33,660
your order I write around rajagaha and the Buddha said yes

49
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:38,820
I loved it this you know kind of I'm going to

50
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:46,139
recognized that was kind of challenging living conditions um and when when the condition came and

51
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:51,900
arose that this was offered and he agreed yeah so it'll be it would be nice

52
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:57,840
to have a more permanent space too to stay and so

53
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:04,979
and this brother-in-law began to build a monastery and Dwelling Places for the

54
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:13,080
monastic order now one day another pentica as a businessman who traveled to rajagaha he

55
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:20,280
came to see his brother-in-law apparently they too have a really a cordial relationship they're very warm

56
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:27,479
and caring for each other they love each other very much and but when the non-bindica showed up at

57
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:33,720
his door he was so busy making preparations for

58
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:40,259
some big event very elaborate thing and that I he almost like didn't pay

59
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:46,979
attention to another Pentagon so that was very unlike of him so he said

60
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:52,680
what are you really busy doing here you know are you preparing for a wedding or

61
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,139
you're gonna see a king or what are you busy doing

62
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:05,060
um and the brother-in-law said um

63
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:12,840
I'm inviting the enlightened one the Buddha and his order to come for the alms

64
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:20,940
tomorrow had the thought what the enlightened one

65
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:26,340
the Buddha coming to your door tomorrow just have arms it's not like it

66
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:32,639
happening every other week right and so I think in the culture they know this

67
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:39,479
notion of enlightened being the Buddha but somehow it's just gonna show up next

68
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:44,940
door at his brother-in-law's house you know that's like unheard

69
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:52,680
and that's not common back then that's not common right now so imagine you know somebody tell you I mean I'm gonna offer

70
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,199
obviously with it tomorrow for a monastic order or enlightened individual

71
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:05,340
you'd be like what so he asked him three times he's really enlightened one and

72
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:11,580
the brother-in-law said yes yeah the Buddha is coming tomorrow morning

73
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:17,180
so that God another Pentacles attention so that night

74
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:25,379
he couldn't sleep he was tossing back and forth and this idea that he's gonna see a enlightened

75
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:31,919
enlightened individual was so intriguing he just at some point he decided okay

76
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:38,159
I'm not gonna sleep so he got up the middle of the night and he decided that

77
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:44,279
he's gonna walk out of the city and walk towards where the monastico

78
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:50,399
order stayed right kind of in the countryside so that was in the dark

79
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:58,200
so he walked out and to the countryside I imagine you know being a born out of a

80
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,839
wealthy family has a lot of supports and he probably never had to go walk out of

81
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,120
the city in the dark you know in the countryside all by himself so he got

82
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:16,440
scared walking walking but he got scared but then this idea of a sea in the

83
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,779
Buddha was like so strong so so somehow he managed to

84
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:26,940
calm his mind they said I'm gonna go anyhow so he kept on walking

85
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:34,740
and at some point um in the midst day down he saw a person walking back and forth

86
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:40,200
back and forth so he stopped

87
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:49,620
and and that he heard this person calling in this indescribably harmonious voice

88
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:57,000
come sudata what no one knew him by the name of a

89
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:05,220
sudeta at that time right like what so he thought that must be the Buddha

90
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,980
so who else would know right and so he bowed down immediately at the Buddhist

91
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:16,320
feet and I used this shaky boy since how are

92
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,800
you the Buddha and that was a conventional greeting right how are you

93
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,899
and then Buddha answered in a very unconventional way

94
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:34,860
and so he said and the Buddha said well the arahans the awakened

95
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:40,519
individuals are always well and they are beyond the possibilities

96
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:47,519
for suffering he can just feel the another draw a job

97
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,740
properly dropped it was beyond the possibility of

98
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:59,220
suffering is that even possible yeah and so

99
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:04,260
and so the Buddha in that first encounter offered a step-by-step

100
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:11,820
teaching and ghosts from generosity but she is all very very steeped in

101
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:17,579
Sila which is ethical Behavior I imagine he is very ethical in his behavior

102
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:25,079
already and then the heavens the perios the harmful nature of essential Pursuits

103
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:31,320
benefits of a renunciation and this is known as a gradual training

104
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,360
of the Buddha at some point and the Buddha sense that

105
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:42,839
Ananda Pentacles are hard to mind maybe ready and quite receptive quite open

106
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:50,839
available and he offered him the liberative teachings of the vulnerable truth

107
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:57,540
upon receiving this teaching Ananda pindica and the Dharma eye opened for

108
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:02,760
him he knew the truth of what the Buddha said

109
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:08,160
right there and I received it and he felt it in his being

110
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:15,240
so he has no doubt anymore that this is the way this is the way

111
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:21,959
and so it is said that he entered the stream that to take him onwardly towards

112
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:28,440
Awakening in the future times Nancy can imagine this is touched him

113
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:35,760
quite deeply so add to the end of that encounter he invited the Buddha and his monastic

114
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,279
orders for alms food after his brother-in-law had done so

115
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:48,060
and then at the end of that meal offering Ananda pindica went up and

116
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:55,320
asked the Buddha if he could build a monastery in his hometown savati

117
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:01,920
and the Buddha said the enlightened ones love peaceful places

118
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:08,459
take that yes so I'm so happy because he's okay that was the conception of the

119
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:15,839
ananta pentecas monastery in savati so once he went back to savati his

120
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:22,560
hometown he immediately began to search up and down for this peaceful place where the

121
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,320
monastics might be able to stay and he founded this place and that

122
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:36,120
belonged to Prince Jetta jetta's glove this is jet of jetta's

123
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:41,579
place and so he's the son of the king passanadi

124
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:50,100
so he asked a prince Jackie if the place is on sale and and Jetta said nope this

125
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:55,320
place is not on sale and he says so firmly he said even if you're giving me

126
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,720
18 million dollars and this is not on sale

127
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:07,500
and anything Milling sounds a lot right but he's a businessman so another guy

128
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:14,540
not budging on this that I'm going to give you 18 million dollars right now

129
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:21,540
but Prince Jetta also didn't barge and he said no this is place is not on sale

130
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:28,200
so they but another bindica didn't give up so they eventually

131
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:36,420
two of them went to the an arbitrator who kind of managed to get them to agree on

132
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:42,540
something and so what was agreed upon was another pentica is going to get to the

133
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:50,339
land and that is coverable by 18 about whatever number of coins that aim 18

134
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:55,920
million dollar a month to again that if you lay the coins one by one on the land

135
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,660
that would be the space you get so

136
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:06,480
so another thing to get to pull the cards and cards of the coins start to

137
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,579
lay it on the ground and and it just happens so that there's only

138
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:19,079
a little corner that isn't um covered but in this whole process Prince

139
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:26,279
Jetta got so inspired by this being wow this is unheard of

140
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:33,120
and so he came and he said well uh okay even though there's not enough coins to

141
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,579
cover this corner I'm gonna build the gateway gateway for this Monastery for

142
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:44,639
free and apparently and Jetta spent the 18 million dollars to build this gateways

143
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:51,000
and offered it as part of the monastery and so that's how the monastery got

144
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,100
built and then after that another petica also

145
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:04,579
spent a lot more to furnish it and put buildings on and put a huge

146
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:11,459
celebratory event invited all the monastics and everyone to come to kind

147
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:18,779
of um take the joy of this and even after all of this and he

148
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:25,680
continued to support the a monastic order and the broader field

149
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:33,959
that he's in and so in this way he is known to be the foremost in his generosity

150
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:41,420
kind of a the as one of the great Disciples of the Buddha

151
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:50,699
um so I would also wanted to mention that this

152
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:57,480
Monastery another pentecas Monastery is a place that the Buddha spent a lot of

153
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:04,260
his time in out of the 40 45 or so years of a teaching career

154
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:11,160
he had to spend about 19 somewhere between 19 and 25 of them the ring

155
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:18,058
retreat in another Pentecost Park and so a lot of teachings flow out of this

156
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:27,500
place out of the generosity of this being I feel this deep gratitude for this

157
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:34,320
and I want to say a little bit about another Pentecost relational world and

158
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:42,059
so he has a family he has a friends was a happily married and his wife is

159
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:49,380
also a devoted a disciple of the Buddha and she's very kind and to

160
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:55,740
um you know maybe the big household as well as all the people who work in the

161
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:01,440
family business and then he has four children three

162
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,559
daughters and one son and two daughters were

163
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:14,220
steeped in the Dharma and also happily married the youngest daughter

164
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:21,120
is very sharp and wise also has a deep understanding of the Dharma but also

165
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,600
struggled in uh maybe we feel not phenomenal ways

166
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:32,600
she I saw that her two two sisters got married happily

167
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:39,059
for whatever reason she couldn't get married she got really sad and lonely and

168
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:44,840
depressed and eventually starved to death

169
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:52,440
I was very touching to kind of hear the stories of this and another Pentecostal family had to deal with

170
00:18:52,440 --> 00:19:01,020
the loss like this just like many of us all kinds of ups and downs even was

171
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:07,740
you know immense conditions wealthy and uh good conditions he live in

172
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:17,580
he had to endure the loss um he has a son where he has kind of a

173
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:23,100
um I guess ups and downs or down UPS you know

174
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:28,440
and um his son for a long while

175
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:35,400
didn't want to have anything to do with the Dharma so he's busy you know he's a busy business businessman I guess he

176
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:40,700
inherited the big business of the family and he's always busy

177
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:48,299
and um ananta printica it took a while you know the story was that at some point he

178
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:55,280
had to bribe his song with thousand dollars for him to comfort

179
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:02,520
which is a practice day basically and uh and I thought wow poor parents

180
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:08,820
that's kind of what do we do sometimes there was a little happy ending in that

181
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:14,400
somehow the bribe worked I guess he's a businessman so the father promised a

182
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:23,039
thousand a thousand dollar that may be a lot in the first time it worked because he was so busy and just having a upper

183
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:28,140
Sasha Day means he actually stopped working for a day that was good and it

184
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:35,760
finally took a break so that wasn't so bad and the second time so he bribed with another thousand

185
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:41,760
dollars to say oh you know anyone to come with me to uh the

186
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:48,000
spend an afternoon at the monastery and that's where he met the Buddha and

187
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,940
he didn't receive the teaching and they connected with the teaching

188
00:20:53,940 --> 00:21:01,320
and so over time he also became a devoted Buddhist disciple and he's

189
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:07,260
known as the little Ananda pindica so maybe we're benefiting from there as

190
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:12,780
well I also wanted to say that and

191
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:19,620
I wasn't so straightforward for another Pinnacle right you can imagine the many years that

192
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:26,400
son just had no connection it was so busy with his business and I imagined

193
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,980
another pentica at times might be pretty frustrated about oh you wouldn't listen

194
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:38,460
to me so and

195
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:44,659
um Ananda pentecas broader Social Circle

196
00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:54,080
consists of a lot of different kind of individuals as a businessman he has people who maybe

197
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:59,880
like-minded but he also has a lot of people who drinks

198
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:06,059
I don't know maybe business people drink together when they're on business trip or something

199
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:13,200
and it was said that another pinkica never diminished them or try to fix them

200
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,240
he just modeled um what he could model and he maintained

201
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:24,659
the relationship with them friendship with them he never forced of his way unto this

202
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:30,960
individuals I was very touched by this that Ananda

203
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:37,159
pindica wasn't just generous in the material holistic way

204
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:43,860
but also it was he has a Generous Heart he wasn't trying to go around kind of

205
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:50,280
fix everybody I mean let people be and at the same time he's doing the best

206
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:58,080
that he can to model what could be modeled so very a kind of moderate way living in

207
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:05,340
the world that way also there is this story about he had a

208
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:10,559
friend who he befriended from a very young age

209
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:16,980
and and there's a friend had a very unfortunate name unlucky bird

210
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:22,980
I suspect that this may be from a different cast maybe a lower caste this

211
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:29,700
is a you know the uh Indian history of the caste system that was very prominent

212
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:36,240
back then even now it's still there and uh

213
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,460
when he this friend needed money he helped him out and offered a job even

214
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:48,020
offered a job that takes care of the family and his friends were all criticizing him

215
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:54,000
like oh you know this is very unfortunate and very unuspicious

216
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,780
but he didn't I wasn't concerned about it and so he just gave him a job and one

217
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:06,960
time apparently he was on a business trip and there was a lot of theft who

218
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:13,740
heard that he's out and so they kind of schemed a robbery

219
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:20,880
and this Vigilant unlucky bird heard about this and he started drumming you

220
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:27,140
know in the middle of the night or when the robbers were all kind of circling in on the house

221
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:32,340
and the big loud drum sounds scared

222
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:39,780
everybody away and so he came back I heard about this he said oh look you tell me this is

223
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:46,799
unlucky you know I'm very fortunate that he's helping us out in this way so I'm very fortunate

224
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:52,080
as it has this heart that is you know it's kind of wide open receiving all of

225
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:58,100
this different forms of beings around him

226
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:06,780
and then in terms of his relationship with the Buddha and so

227
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:15,120
after the monastery was built the Buddha came to a savati yetas Grove and under

228
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:22,760
pentecas a park very Monastery very often and it's said that as a great disciple

229
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:28,580
Ananda pindica would often visit the Buddha he would go to see the Buddha

230
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:36,120
twice a day and interestingly he would just sit right by

231
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:41,580
on one side of the Buddha and it's said that he usually does not ask about

232
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:47,159
Buddha questions because he didn't want to create

233
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:53,220
impression that he get a special treatment because he contributed to the

234
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:59,460
community so much it's really humble being

235
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:06,059
and he would come to see the Buddha and he would sit by one side and he would

236
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:14,039
wait to see the Buddha would say something either give a Dharma talk or ask him a

237
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:20,340
question and then he'll respond and if the Buddha also didn't say anything

238
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:27,960
then he would say something about maybe a situation he is in or how he had done

239
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:34,559
his things outside and then he'll wait to see what the Buddha respond

240
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:42,779
that the Buddha respond was approval or offer something and then use

241
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:48,919
that way as a way that he's engaging with the with the teachings

242
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:55,679
so um and the times when another pentica and

243
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:03,240
the Buddha spent time together apparently the Buddha had given a wide range of teachings ranging from how to

244
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:10,380
behave in very mundane situations all the way to liberative teachings

245
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:16,020
and so in this way um if the teachings are flowing down

246
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,880
towards all of us as well

247
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:28,500
maybe the most profound teaching that Ananda pentica received

248
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:34,380
I was on his Deathbed and there is a suta in Machu manikaya

249
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:39,840
143 that spoke about the time when he was

250
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:45,539
really sick he was probably very old also and it's just not getting any

251
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:50,600
better and there's this kind of

252
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:57,799
horrific description of how much pain he had endure

253
00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:04,919
unbearable pain like you know like cards pulling the limbs all apart or

254
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:10,020
something physically and and he was not getting any better

255
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:18,480
and so he asked and to get Ananda and asare puta to come

256
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:24,600
and see him help him out so Ananda and Sarah puta are two of the

257
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:31,140
great Disciples of the Buddha and sariputa was an arahunt and Ananda at

258
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:38,279
that time was not quite yet so they came they came to see another

259
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:43,799
pentica knew that oh you know this man is not

260
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:48,679
getting any better he's near his death

261
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:55,080
so sariputa offered a whole set of a profound instruction

262
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:02,820
that is probably very appropriate for what another pentica was experiencing

263
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:10,260
and this set of instructions invited Ananda to pintika to not cling

264
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:18,919
to the six senses and the eye ear smell time taste

265
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:26,340
body touch Sensations in the mind and he went through this instruction one

266
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:31,919
by one through each of the senses and then he also went through the five

267
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:39,600
Aggregates for those who knew this is a teaching um uh the

268
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:45,120
Corrections of a body and mind and said not cling to each of this

269
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:50,760
and not cling to the four elements and I just gave a talk a while ago about the

270
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:57,899
four grade elements earth water fire and air that made up our bodies and not to

271
00:29:57,899 --> 00:30:05,700
depend on them and then not just that it went through all the immaterial ram Realms and said

272
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:11,700
not to cling to any of those either and he ended by saying

273
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:18,360
not to claim this world or the the other world or anything in

274
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:24,919
between and not to depend on any of those

275
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:33,240
and half a sense reading the suta that ananta pentica was already ready

276
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:40,520
for this he knew you know he started he's dying

277
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:49,020
and having any form of a cleaning on this fading body makes no sense

278
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:54,500
so as sorry puta was offering this

279
00:30:54,779 --> 00:30:59,880
I have a sense that he's offering almost a guided meditation

280
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:06,899
there went through each of the senses the repeating of this race you know not

281
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:15,980
clinging to the eye to the ear and and all the way to anything in this world

282
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:21,620
and another penteca was ready

283
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:26,700
and this guided meditation he probably rode in with cesari puta

284
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:32,159
he felt the truth of that and so at the end

285
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:40,740
another Pinnacle bursted into tears and not that I didn't quite know that oh

286
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:47,100
you know something bad happened as he said a householder are you failing are you

287
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:56,760
failing and another pinky guy responded no venerable Ananda I wasn't fading or

288
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:03,539
failing or or failing it's just that for a long time I've paid

289
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:09,240
the whole match to the Buddha the estate is deemed mandikins

290
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:16,519
yet I have never before heard such a Dharma talk

291
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:24,120
is being around the Buddha a lot I mean he's never heard this

292
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:30,840
and Ananda explained well this instructions usually weren't given to

293
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:38,640
the laypeople another pintika asked

294
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:44,340
um sorry puta and Ananda please let those teachings be offered to

295
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:51,299
the lay practitioners as well because there are people with little

296
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:57,419
dusts in their eyes there will be those who can't understand

297
00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:06,899
this for this I am forever grateful for what

298
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:13,559
he did as teachings who weren't as kept to the

299
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:18,600
monastics anymore they were offered to those who were

300
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:23,600
ready lay or monastic

301
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:34,500
yeah I remember at one time when I heard this suta

302
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:40,518
I said I'd like someone to read this to me on my deathbed

303
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:47,220
