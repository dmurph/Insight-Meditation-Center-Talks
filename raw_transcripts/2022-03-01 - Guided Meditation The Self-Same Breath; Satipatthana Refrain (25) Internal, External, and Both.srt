time but spread in space so today uh day two of our exploration

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,120
of the refrain of sati patana which you've been studying thoroughly

7
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,840
and systematically with gil so

8
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:52,399
what i'd like to offer today and invite us to explore is the uh so yesterday i

9
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:59,440
tried to set the frame a little bit i set the frame a little more today but the importance and the significance

10
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,518
of the um the refrain and then we'll explore the

11
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,040
first sentence of it and i'd like to invite us to explore this first

12
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:19,600
statement this significant first statement in our practice together also

13
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,360
so [Music] so the first

14
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,040
sentence in the frame is in this regard in this way

15
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,600
in regard to the body one abides contemplating the body internally

16
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:45,040
or one abides contemplating the body externally or one abides contemplating

17
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,960
the body both internally and externally

18
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,560
so i will decode that i'll talk more about that in

19
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,960
the dharmad but in the guided meditation i'd like to bring in some invitations

20
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,080
for us to explore this invitation of internal external

21
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,920
together uh in in one aspect not not every

22
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:20,560
teaching of the sati patana there are so many of them but one of them or maybe a couple of them to have a taste of what

23
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,319
this might this might feel like and what might mean so

24
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:33,360
so without further ado let's let's sit let's practice together

25

when the body is relaxed the mind

42
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,720
can relax more easily so relax the body

43

the entirety of the in-breath the palms

61
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:05,079
the entirety of the out breath the pause

62
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:21,200
the entirety of the breath felt sensed clearly known

63
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:30,680
clearly known clear comprehension

64
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,720
in this body without making it effortful

65
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:52,079
let it be known let it be known

66
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,639
the breath

67
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,839
this breath internally

68
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:22,760
the breath internally this life-giving breath

69
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:36,120
throughout the body nourishing

70
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:47,480
bringing life the breath being sensed unknown

71
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,720
taking one more moment to really grok to really

72
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:20,120
know let it be known capture the sensation of the breath in this body internally

73
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,279
as if it were your first breath

74
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,720
or your last breath

75
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,399
the breath known internally

76
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,240
now relax release

77
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,680
and bring to mind let's first bring to mind someone maybe who's near and dear

78
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,839
to you you have an easy relationship with

79
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,920
and let their breath be known this external breath be

80
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,279
known to you they breathe just like you

81
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,000
as human beings

82
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,680
as you know your breath internally

83
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:45,839
knowing this breath externally by this other human being

84
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,440
life-giving breath

85
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:59,199
how it might feel for them you can even perhaps in your mind's eye

86
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:06,160
imagine them breathing seeing them breathing deeply shallow

87
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,760
shallowly

88
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,079
and now expanding this external knowing

89
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:10,639
of the breath to as many beings as you wish in your mind's eye

90
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:18,680
many humans all breathing

91
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,120
the breath known externally

92
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,678
and if it feels overwhelming then just stay with one other being another human

93
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,520
or animal breathing

94
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,120
externally

95
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:57,650
and now exploring the instruction [Music]

96
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:04,840
of knowing in the body internally and externally

97
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,240
as you know your own breath this breath being known

98
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,320
the body the mind be relaxed

99
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,600
and knowing also externally

100
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,559
this other being in your mind's eye

101
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:38,200
the breath known internally and externally

102
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:52,600
known thinking analyzing just simply let it be known

103
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,399
as if perhaps you and your friend

104
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:27,240
were breathing together both breaths known internally and externally

105
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,840
continuing to know the breath and internally and externally

106
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,480
maybe at some point the personality of the breath drops out

107
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:06,960
and is just a breath not me not mine not

108
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:13,440
internal external it's just breath breathing happening

109
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:19,799
internal external just breathe

110
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:50,159
don't try too hard just

111
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:56,799
let it be known first internal external the insight might reveal itself on its

112
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:02,840
own when the time is right

113
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,158
my breath breath

114
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,559
their breath their breathing

115
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,559
may just become breathing

116
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,720
breathing internally breathing externally

117
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,480
internally and externally

118
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:13,960
as we bring the sitting to a close

119
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:23,520
may the goodness of our practice together all of us

120
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,398
in this moment in time

121
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:36,080
it's coming together different places

122
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:42,159
and all the breaths all the moments of awareness

123
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:48,559
all the dedication to goodness cultivating goodness

124
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:59,080
gifting dedicating offering this goodness

125
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,640
generously to all beings everywhere

126
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,760
who just like me just like us breathe

127
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,240
depend on this breath to keep them alive

128
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:22,240
especially those who live right now in areas

129
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,840
that are not safe in war zones

130
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:38,640
wishing them safety ease and breathing in peace

131
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:47,480
may all beings be well may all beings be free

132
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,309
[Music]

133
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:17,080
thanks everyone thanks for your practice

134
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:25,519
so today day two of exploring the refrain of the

135
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:30,840
satipatana which in some way

136
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:37,679
is i don't want to say more important as important is very important

137
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,960
so just to remind us

138
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:49,919
of the refrain i will put up the uh diagram from yesterday again this is

139
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:56,720
from piccolo nalio's book page 17. um the name of the book is sati patana

140
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,919
direct the direct path to realization and it's also i put this up

141
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:08,720
on audiodharma associated with this week's teachings actually with yesterday's teaching so you can look it

142
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:14,559
up so the refrain shows up this refrain

143
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:20,960
this important refrain shows up after every teaching after every teaching

144
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:27,120
shows up 13 times and just to say a little more about the

145
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:34,559
significance and then focusing on the internal external that we've done today is um

146
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:40,640
so this refrain as i mentioned yesterday it both

147
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:46,000
talks it expands each teaching it does three things after each teaching say

148
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,480
after breathing after um postures after activities anatomical

149
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,919
parts elements etc it it both

150
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:04,799
adds a spatial aspect which is internal external and it also adds a temporal

151
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:10,320
aspect which we'll discuss tomorrow when because the the refrain talks about

152
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:15,600
arising and passing and arising and passing so it brings a temporal time

153
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,240
aspect to the study of the phenomena

154
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:30,399
and and also what another thing that's significant about this and i'd like to point point out about the refrain

155
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:35,760
is that it is worded um not with respect to the individual

156
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:41,039
content so after the section about say breathing or actually let me put up this

157
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:46,480
again so you can get a sense of it here we go okay so like

158
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:53,840
in the there are six sections in for the body breathing postures activities etc

159
00:33:53,919 --> 00:34:00,159
after the teaching especially on breathing the refrain

160
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:05,760
goes back to the body says the body it talks about the body after postures it

161
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:12,560
doesn't say postures it's the wording refers to the body

162
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,919
so so as i read in this way in regard to the

163
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:24,638
body one abides contemplating the body it doesn't say you know one abides like

164
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:30,000
so there's something about oh the bigger picture the bigger picture it invites us

165
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:37,280
to to to and um contemplate the bigger picture so the idea here is

166
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:42,480
and let me stop the share here some commentators say that what is

167
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:48,398
significant here about this going back and forth is that in each teaching we

168
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:56,398
focus on the content but coming out the practitioner is invited

169
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:02,960
to to study to be aware to be mindful

170
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:09,440
of the general characteristics of the experience and when we become aware of the general

171
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:15,040
characteristics not the detailed not the not the thing itself

172
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:20,800
but the fact that it's internal external it's everywhere and it arises and past

173
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:28,800
it we shift from a content studying the content to studying the general process

174
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:35,520
and when we study the general process that's when insights about anitcha

175
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,800
du ka ananatta impermanence unsatisfactoriness

176
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:47,520
and impersonality not self pop out and that's something i was

177
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:54,800
gently inviting you to explore this morning if it perhaps maybe for a split second popped out for you

178
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:00,240
and if not no worries when the mind is ready the heart is ready it will be seen

179
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:07,839
the insight will will reveal itself so so i quote john engler in this regard

180
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:14,560
who says his opinion not mine but i think it's interesting to see it this way the

181
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:20,960
reason he says the reason western meditators tend to progress more slowly than their

182
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,160
eastern counterparts is the tendency to become absorbed in

183
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:33,440
the content of awareness rather than continuing to attend to its process

184
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:39,520
becoming preoccupied with individual thoughts images memories

185
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:47,440
sensations etc rather than keeping their attention focused on the essential characteristics

186
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:55,280
of all psychophysical events whatever the content a tendency to

187
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:02,000
confuse meditation with psychotherapy and to analyze mental content

188
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,359
instead of simply observing it and you know this many of you know this

189
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:14,000
already it's not so much about the content is it the process it's the arising and passing

190
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,040
and also this internal external which is often not taught

191
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:24,960
or emphasized so i want to focus now after taking more time to set the frame the

192
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,240
importance of of the refrain

193
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:36,400
um left over from yesterday what i wanted to say today i want to now

194
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:42,560
speak more about this first line about this practice of internal external which again

195
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:50,320
comes in after every teaching in the satipatana pretty wild right

196
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:55,839
so so the the internal external

197
00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:02,800
can be applied to every aspect and in fact in the commentaries in um

198
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:08,640
in the vesude maga in the path of purification commentary especially um

199
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:15,839
the the it is taught in the um uh internal external

200
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:22,320
for every aspect of the satipatana so it could be applied to the breath to

201
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:28,000
the postures internally and and oh just to say internal here of

202
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,880
course means our bodies external in this case means other human beings or other beings other beings

203
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:41,119
so observing our own breath their breath our posture their posture our bodily

204
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:47,920
activities body theirs body parts elements the cemetery

205
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:53,839
contemplation internally externally um [Music]

206
00:38:53,839 --> 00:39:00,480
vedana mind states as well as the aggregates and i'll share you a share with you a

207
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:06,560
personal story here since we're talking about this um the first time i practiced this

208
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:12,400
internal external i didn't even know this was part of the teachings years ago when i practiced with

209
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:19,359
with my um teacher park sayada who teaches very very detailed vipassana

210
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:25,040
from the abi dhamma and the visudi maga and my instructions for days

211
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:31,440
was to to contemplate the body part the the

212
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,640
32 body parts internally first internally first you do it internally

213
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:43,838
until it becomes really really really clear

214
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:50,079
and then and then really clear until actually one feels that wow this body is

215
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:55,200
just body parts it's like sack of grain it's just sacko grain

216
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:01,280
rice and this and that it's just body parts and then the instructions were to okay now

217
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:08,839
externally externally all other beings not just humans but where i was practicing their

218
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:14,960
their uh chipmunks and things like that oh externally the instruction was

219
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:22,800
oh all beings internally externally all beings too body parts just like me just like me

220
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:29,760
then start to see all beings walk actually body parts starting to walk around which is very interesting way of

221
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,880
seeing the world we we usually don't see that way but it is

222
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:42,480
just as valid to see any other way just as valid to see in the other way there are all these body parts moving around

223
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:48,720
and then internally externally something pops out wow the impersonality

224
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:54,560
the impersonality of the this body these body parts

225
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:01,359
so so when we start satipatana as i read

226
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:06,400
this line starts with contemplating the body internally so first we do it

227
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:13,359
internally to establish to really get a sense to establish also um

228
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:21,920
some mighty concentration the body the mind settles and then it has the ability to go externally and and investigate

229
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:28,000
uh or see the same phenomena externally

230
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:34,400
and and it's also said that external also could

231
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:40,400
for these various aspects see observing other people's postures their

232
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:48,480
facial expressions their tone of voice when you get to feelings and state of mind for example uh the

233
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:54,079
the next few weeks uh you'll be studying say state of mind and

234
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:59,599
and uh and the dhammas the aggregates internally externally

235
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:05,440
is a suitable practice for daily life is a suitable practice because one

236
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:12,319
perhaps one issue that some people point out or maybe they feel when they they do a lot

237
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:17,599
of internal practice is they become too internalized like oh i'm just interning

238
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:23,200
like don't bother me i'm just practicing internal whereas the instruction

239
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:31,200
is internal external internal external internal external so so that we don't risk becoming

240
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:37,680
self-centered uh and only aware of our own self

241
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:43,680
and what's happening internally but also open aware of other people's

242
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:51,200
feelings of body behavior and and how our actions how our

243
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:56,319
words actions our internal state affect other people's

244
00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:02,960
state of to become more aware of our impact on the world through this internal

245
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:10,640
external practice internal external so the external practice is so important

246
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:18,079
as here laid out as the second step first internal then external observing

247
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:25,280
the world others other beings their state their state of mind their state of

248
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:30,640
breathing etc and then the third step and um this is so

249
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:37,359
important i want to say it again the the third part uh the third phrase when we're

250
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:44,400
invited to to um uh the the wording is uh let me get the

251
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:51,520
exact wording one abides contemplating the body both internally and externally one

252
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:57,760
abides contemplating the body both internally and externally

253
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:03,359
and some commenter commentaries say since we can't do it at

254
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:10,800
the same time you go back and forth okay that's one way but another way what happens actually is you notice yourself

255
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:16,880
when you do internal and external when you try to hold it together and even go back and forth

256
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:22,880
wow a sense of objectivity arises it's just

257
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:30,000
a body is just a breath the sense of objective the sense of subjective stance

258
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,200
drops out and an insight towards not self towards

259
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:40,720
this universality of whatever phenomena we're observing

260
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,920
the universality of the phenomena pops out so it's not just the thing

261
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:52,880
itself anymore it's the universality of it that that arises

262
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:59,280
i cannot emphasize how important these practices are the the refrain

263
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:04,800
the internal external so today my invitation is as you go

264
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:11,440
through your day through your life daily life practice external

265
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:18,960
mindfulness practice external awareness both internal internal what's happening

266
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:25,839
internally externally what's happening externally for other beings internal and external

267
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:33,200
and see what a different shift in stance that can be

268
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:38,400
and tomorrow we continue with the next sentence in the refrain

269
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:43,520
which has to do with impermanence with arising and passing away which is quite

270
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:50,720
profound also so thank you all thank you for your kind attention for your dedication for your

271
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:58,400
practice may you be well and may you practice internally and

272
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:04,160
externally see you or feel you tomorrow

273
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,400
be well
