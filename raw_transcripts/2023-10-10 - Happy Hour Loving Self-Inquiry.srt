close let us meet with kindness whatever arose or did not

182

frustration can there be kindness and interest oh why is this

184
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:05,159
arising it's okay I some the interest instead of

185
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:11,000
taking it on face five trusting that there is co-creative

186
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,919
goodness as we practice together May our practice be in cause

187

189
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:43,539
[Music]

190
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
yourself

191
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:01,320
practice so this was an invitation to

192
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:10,039
bring meta kindness friendliness together one aspect of d one aspect of

193
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:15,519
Interest curiosity inquiring um and there's so many

194
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:21,559
different ways we can do this practice and and today the invitation was turning

195
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:27,559
first towards the phenomena internal phenomena is the breath and C ating this

196
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:34,440
sense of friendliness and then uh curiosity about the breath as a phenomena and then turning towards this

197
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:41,120
being who is me and um perhaps asking the question what do you need sweetheart

198
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:46,919
which both has a sense of kindness support curiosity interest and there's

199
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:53,960
so many different versions of of this question and also to say one more word

200
00:33:53,960 --> 00:34:01,960
um about this yes the there are teachings about um not self or in

201
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:08,720
personality and yet we need to really love and know the self really know and

202
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:13,760
love the self before we can let go of the self we need to come first and then

203
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:20,440
when we know and love the self little by little these these um perhaps

204
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:25,560
unhealthful patterns ET sat they drop away but they need to be seen first we

205
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,879
can't squash them

206
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:35,878
unexamined a few words

207
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:44,118

211
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:20,280

also will be public so

216
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:51,119
Ser oh thank you so I was having a really difficult

217
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:59,200
time hearing you I don't think I was the only one um and uh at a certain point I tried

218
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:06,359
to just tune the volume down totally because I was feeling frustrated because I couldn't hear

219
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:10,400
you and that didn't help

220
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:20,319
either yeah so then you know because I really tuned into a lot of physical

221
00:36:20,319 --> 00:36:25,760
pain and um and you know the question that I Rose

222
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:34,720
while we were sharing was I didn't feel any pain at all yesterday you know I I I was in New York

223
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:42,240
City I hadn't been there for three years visited with my sister we did a lot of walking but I was not experiencing any

224
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:50,480
physical pain at all and I don't get how there could be such a huge shift

225
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:57,200
from one day to another you know and feeling so much physical pain I I it's

226
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:04,319
like it's something that is really is like I have that's a major

227
00:37:04,319 --> 00:37:11,960
question for me actually it's a major question for me how could there be such

228
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:18,079
um shift you know from from one

229
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:24,319
day to the next yeah so but and that is that is the body Serena that is the body

230
00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:31,319
so having humility about the body going through its own um you know its own

231
00:37:31,319 --> 00:37:37,359
process so I'm hearing a sense of almost frustration or or am I hearing that

232
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:42,640
right I well I heard the frustration definitely because you couldn't hear me well and I'm sorry the the audio was

233
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,920
challenging and and yet as as we as I said at the beginning and I really

234
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:54,760
invite you sering up because everything is an opportunity for practice can can you bring kindness to the frustration

235
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:01,440
can you be with can you be comfortable with being uncomfortable this is the marrow of the practice it's not about

236
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:07,000
being everything being easy and comfortable that's not the direction we're

237
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,119
heading okay well obviously I need more training and feeling comfortable with

238
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:18,880
the very uncomfortable because start start right now start my de with with

239
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:24,960
physical pain you're having my dear can you have can you um bring a bit of

240
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:31,680
friendliness just a bit Right In This Moment instead of think I need more training in the future how about right

241
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:38,119
here that's what I'm inviting you to try Serena it's this this practice is not for the future it's for right here right

242
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:45,119
now there's pain in the body there's frustration you didn't hear me can there be some opening to it like okay it's

243
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:52,560
like this right now I don't know is that possible just for for

244
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:00,079
5% not require relaxing into it right

245
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:05,520
exactly exactly that's it thank you so much

246
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:12,040
thank you Serena hi

247
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:21,839
please hi think that was a beautiful meditation thank you and uh as I was

248
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:29,520
meditating today I realized uh one thing that came to mind this whole acceptance and being loving

249
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:35,760
to myself I found myself having a sometimes like when people I'm very

250
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:43,400
close to or I love bring up things that I've done that they were not happy with it makes me so defensive and I imagine

251
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:48,920
myself I feel like this U imagine myself having a conversation where something's

252
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:54,760
being bought up but but it was just so much more accepting of what they're bringing up and me explaining to them

253
00:39:54,760 --> 00:40:01,640
that I'm also human and this was my intention doing it and I feel like when you can love yourself and accept

254
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:09,839
yourself and not expect Perfection you can bring such a loving Dimension to relationship and uh that is

255
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:16,760
just such a gift so hopefully I'll do more of this meditation and implement it

256
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:23,319
more of the time but thank you so much for a beautiful meditation today beautiful thank you so much for the the

257
00:40:23,319 --> 00:40:30,680
um very clear and wise reflections the really the inside aha if there is love

258
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:36,280
and care for this being I can bring it more into the relationships and then also I can bring it more into the

259
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:41,440
relationship towards them because they are doing their best because and so it

260
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,760
it it becomes more generative hold holding all the um yeah the the

261
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:54,359
messiness of Being Human together

262
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:00,920
great Jerry says it was a welcome place of kindness and friendship in the world

263
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:08,560
today of geopolitical events where there seems little kindness so big shout of

264
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:15,929
thanks thank you Jerry [Music]

265
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,839
rich I I found myself over the weekend getting very angry over events the

266
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:32,440
Middle East and I turned to doing compassion stuff

267
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:39,960
meditation which did calm me down and sort of changed my mental emotional

268
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:46,599
state but am I doing anything for anyone else by doing

269
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:52,359
that great question so so here's here's something to reflect upon I think what

270
00:41:52,359 --> 00:41:57,599
you can actually in in the way you're practicing especially with what has been

271
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:05,280
happening geopolitically is is compassion 360 Dees I think that's how

272
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:11,040
you can do something for for everyone because by doing compassion but just for

273
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:18,359
one side then it's it's not very wise our compa compassion practice is 360

274
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:24,839
Degrees um everybody's suffering in in different ways causing suffering causing

275
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:31,800
cing I mean I can say that historically this group has been um has

276
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:37,079
been suffering and this group refers to both size right ouch ouch historically

277
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:42,200
they've been suffering like ouch so that way you can actually reduce this hatred

278
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:49,359
in the world starting with yourself that yeah both sides are suffering are causing suffering to each other it can

279
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:54,680
be it's complicated it's messy and can I have a stance of

280
00:42:54,680 --> 00:43:03,680
compassion 300 60° thank you for bringing that in

281
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:10,680
sound um Megan says I'm grateful for the warmth and kindness the meditation

282
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:17,000
brought to a day in which I thought so much Sor I appreciate the idea of approaching whatever is with kindness

283
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,880
and learning like not trying to control it comes

284
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:31,200
out so it's

285
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:39,200
um what also one thing I wanted to mention um is this this practice this

286
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:45,040
inquiry with curiosity also where there is pain or there is suffering that can

287
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:52,440
be Cur a kindness and a um a gentleness of in quiet because there's so much we

288
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:59,440
don't know there's so much we don't know internally externally and having a stance of humility instead

289
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:04,960
of being a know it all when we know everything um is not really helpful it's

290
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:10,640
not path to to lessening suffering in the world including [Music]

291
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:17,119
one so so before I dedicate the marriage I wanted to also correct something I

292
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:22,960
said earlier uh which was um I mentioned and this is kind of technical but I want

293
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:28,920
to mention it so so D of CH which is one of the factors of Awakening

294
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:35,119
translated as interest curiosity investigation um is is actually not

295
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:42,119
listed as one of the CH in the Abid some of you are like what is she talking about don't worry those who know the

296
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:50,040
Abid dama and the mental factors it's not a mental factor it's is only listed as one of the seven factors of Awakening

297
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:56,720
just wanted to to correct the the the the accuracy pedagogical but again

298
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:04,640
practically makes no difference it's just something I said I want to come there so thank you all thank you for

299
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:11,200
your practice thank you for coming here to cultivate your hearts and Minds for

300
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:18,480
the sake of all things are may all being be happy may all being at the conditions

301
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,599
of freedom and

302
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,960
happiness thanks
