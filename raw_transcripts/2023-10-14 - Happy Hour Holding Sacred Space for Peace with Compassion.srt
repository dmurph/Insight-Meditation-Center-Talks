everyone it's lovely to be with you lovely to see you and um and I really enjoyed our

47
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:44,440
hello saying at the beginning um with the different geographical locations and

48
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:50,440
with relation to one another that was that was fun and and and I truly feel

49
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:56,039
that when we do that when we say hello and just share our voices or Goodwill

50
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:03,639
our meta it it brings me more present a sense of community a sense of shared

51
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:08,800
community that here we are from different places in the world we're

52
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:15,080
coming together to do this cultivation of kindness goodness

53
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:22,199
practice together and it's in this light in this

54
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:29,600
spirit that for today's practice I would like to offer uh

55
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,639
[Music] um really two practices that are related

56
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:42,280
together and the first one is as we come together as all of us come together from

57
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:51,160
different places in the world as you creatively mentioned shared them at the beginning um coming together to hold

58
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:58,000
Sacred Space together to hold Sacred Space together it's quite a doing for

59
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,199
it's um you know it's it's lovely that we especially because we're not in the

60
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:10,720
same room but we can hold Global space Sacred Space together

61
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,720
across the ocean many oceans and to hold

62
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:25,120
this Sacred Space for for both grief for sadness for whatever might be arising

63
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,599
right now for each of us individually and and also for us

64
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:37,400
collectively with what is happening in the world

65
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:45,400
geopolitically and I know that there is for many people there is grief sadness

66
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:54,759
anger arising and um and to hold a space of is it just a

67
00:07:54,759 --> 00:08:01,440
simple Sacred Space to hold it all not turning our Hearts away but when we hold

68
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:09,280
it together it it becomes lighter to hold not that the situation is light at

69
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:16,440
all it's it's egregious it's Grievous and it's getting worse um the

70
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,840
humanitarian crisis worsening and and to

71
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,879
meet it in our hearts with this with stability of care and

72
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:33,039
compassion and I know that for me as I've been listening to the news I've

73
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:39,159
been finding myself crying um there human beings who are suffering

74
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:44,720
regardless of their belief and religions and and

75
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:52,040
background um and maybe also personally I I share with you that you know I've

76
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:59,200
identified myself jokingly with friends as a Muju you might have heard of a juu

77
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:05,600
people who are who've been Jewish and and practiced Buddhism and I've also been raised

78
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:12,839
Muslim I went to a um Jewish grade school for five years in in back in Iran

79
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:18,320
and and um um and now I'm a Buddhist

80
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:26,560
teacher so there is this sense of um really so many people I know and care

81
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,880
about being being affected and so many people I don't know uh being being

82
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:38,600
impacted and maybe I'll share one one other thing which is um today I was

83
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,839
listening to a a rabbi and an Imam on

84
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:51,839
the radio on NPR and they were talking about um how they're supporting how

85
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:59,680
they're supporting uh various you various practitioners and and um

86
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:06,160
the rabbi said something very profound that the Imam loved and and re re-echoed

87
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,200
at the end which was that there is not a dividing line

88
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:20,160
there's not so much of a dividing line between different people of different religion

89
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:28,360
uh in this scenario what's happening in the world but it's really a dividing line between people who believe that

90
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:34,040
violence is the only solution and people who do not believe violence is the only

91
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:42,000
solution and that is so profound so let us count ourselves count ourselves add

92
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,279
our name as signaries to not believing that the violence is the only solution

93
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:54,800
to the world's problems but actually compassion understanding dialogue and

94
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:03,320
care and let us be a part of um at least least as we engage with our own heart

95
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:10,519
and practice and the way that our actions in the world re reverberate um to

96
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:17,720
be voices for for love for care for compassion for

97
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:24,839
dialogue for understanding and not for hatred and violence

98
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:31,320
so so with that I'd like to share practice of

99
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,839
um of both settling into a Sacred Space and

100
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:42,399
then opening our hearts for holding whatever is arising with compassion for

101
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,920
ourselves and and other beings in this world who are just like us they're not

102
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:55,200
different from us at all and just caught in this Tangled mess

103
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:04,079
because of where they're they're born so so let us arrive let us

104
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,600
arrive in our

105
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:15,839
bodies and In This Moment feeling our feet on the

106
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,600

107
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,880

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:52,360
suffering their sorrow and pain or

163
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:59,880
expand externally to those who are suffering In This Moment especially

164
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:09,240
in the Middle East the whole region so much

165
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:15,039
pain so many

166
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:25,799
humans and sorrow and danger and grief right

167
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:33,960
now regardless of the borders rationalities beliefs they're

168
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,440
human beings just like

169
00:24:51,120 --> 00:25:00,398
us just as I wish to be free from sorrow suffering I wish you ease may you have

170
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,960
ease may you be

171
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,880
free from pain from

172
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679
sorrow

173
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:48,799
and if at any point your practice of compassion veers into empathic

174
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:56,600
distress make sure to bring compassion home

175
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:03,799
internally calming soothing your own aching

176
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:10,120
heart so that you can have stability again and be available for others

177
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:18,640
through your through the actions of your mind your speech the actions of your

178
00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:25,080
body thoughts speech and physical

179
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,520
actions

180
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:39,679

peace and wishing Clarity of

188
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:40,840
vision for those who think that hatred violence is the

189

solution to Humanity's problems may all beings everywhere

190
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:56,120

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:33,640
free thanks for your practice

194
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:43,200
everyone I had this sense I have this image of each of us praying or

195
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:50,480
practicing with each breath for for compassion for peace in the

196
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,360
world each of us is holding this

197
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:01,559
candle together and may may there be peace May There Be

198
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:11,440
Peace On Earth war is Hell war is

199
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:17,960
hell and saying this I um I actually

200
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:25,519
when I was growing up in Iran I lived through the bombing of tan

201
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:31,600
in the Iran Iraq war and it was nothing like what we hear

202
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:39,039
on the radio right now and uh just remember how painful and

203
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:46,720
difficult and uncertain it was

204
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:53,480
so may there be ease and peace for those who are in grave danger and suffering in

205
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:58,679
our world extending our hearts to them

206
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:05,200
practicing compassion one breath at a time one breath at a time and of course

207
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,240
it's so important not to lose our own stability with the practice of

208
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:16,440
compassion because the pain of the world sometimes can feel so

209
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:23,279
overwhelming that it can feel easy to Veer into empathic distress and that's

210
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:28,440
not helpful that doesn't help anyone and that not

211
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:35,320
compassion empathic distress is is what when we're falling into the waves of the

212
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:43,760
ocean with the people who are suffering we're bobbing up and down with them without the ability to to extend a

213
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:50,639
holding hand compassion has more stability has care has love and more

214
00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:59,159
stability it's not overwhelmed it feels the pain but but holds the pain with

215
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:04,320
equal amounts of care and love and compassion so that it doesn't become a

216
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:10,279
practice in self flagellation and just feeling pain over and over again so be

217
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:16,639
very careful and and um and

218
00:33:16,639 --> 00:33:22,559
clear when you're practicing compassion if it veers into empathic

219
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:30,080
distress it's it's wise to pull back and turn to compassion for yourself because

220
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:35,679
you're the one in that moment who's suffering and have lost your balance

221
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:44,159
you're more and the balance again really think of it compassion is a

222
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:51,360
balanced an action of a feeling another person suffer another

223
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,960
person's sorrow and pain could be your own as well as care and love to hold

224
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:03,320
hold it then if there's not enough love and it's just pain that's not compassion

225
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:08,358
that's empathic distress so be be clear and wise

226
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:14,079
about um how your practice shows up internally for

227
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:21,919
you and again if it veers into empathic distress it's not a sand don't self

228
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:27,800
flatulate it's just the practice has gotten out of balance it's fine

229
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:37,040
no problem it's time to to bring more balance into it turn turn more into

230
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:42,440
bringing more care more love and turning to yourself so that there is balance

231
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:48,960
till you can turn outside again outward again

232
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:55,599
so so so I'd like to invite us if

233
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:01,280
you would good to uh let this for us to

234
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:07,280
carry this Sacred Space that we're holding together into the small groups

235
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:15,280
holding Sacred Space together small groups of roughly size three and sharing

236
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:22,680
if you wish and you can also just hold space in silence you can just be these candles that show up and hold space

237
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:27,839
together for other human beings in the world maybe that's enough maybe you want

238
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:36,760
to just show up in silence that's perfectly fine and if you want to say a few words the invitation is just a self

239
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:45,040
exploration of how this practice um was for you in this evening and there's no

240
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:52,400
right or wrong answer you can say I fell asleep I was I I don't know what she's talking about

241
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:57,760
it doesn't matter just an exploration if you wish or can say past

242
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:06,960
um and just hold compassionate space so so I will create the small groups

243
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:12,160
with the invitation to take care of yourselves take care of each other each

244

266
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:20,040
you want to share what I'll say about practicing compassion especially when

267
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:27,400
they challenging events in the world feels like the appro apprpriate response

268
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:36,599
instead of getting entangled in in anger and blame and overwhelming grief um

269
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:42,280
practicing compassion practicing compassion which then leads to actually

270
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:49,040
actions of compassion instead of being devastated or angry and inflaming

271
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:55,920
actually it is the appropriate response um both for ourselves and for the world

272
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:03,240
World wholesome actions can come out of this instead of unh wholesome actions

273
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:09,119
not just for our own sake but for the sake of humanity training our hearts

274
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:16,559
training ourselves as we are one drop in this ocean of

275
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:27,000
humanity yeah thanks Neil Neil says I try to remember the environmentalist

276
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:32,079
statement of think globally act locally

277
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:40,079
yeah the same is true for peace and kindness exactly and in this practice tonight we

278
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:45,200
definitely thought globally and acting locally

279
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:51,880
here each one of us Kevin I see your hand

280

286
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:41,838
compassion is so important and to be able to

00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:50,440

for your compassion and wisdom this was a powerful met tonight thank you

295
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:45,799
Jennifer and na says Mr Rogers advise children in times of distress and

296
00:51:45,799 --> 00:51:51,240
troubling news to focus on the helpers he said when I was a boy and I would see

297
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:56,799
scary things in the news my mother would say to me look for the helpers you will

298
00:51:56,799 --> 00:52:03,400
always find people who are helping indeed thank you enough thank you and

299
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:11,480
Ellie I see your hand hi Nikki thank you thank you for

300
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:17,559
the teaching and bringing the the subject in the Forefront ah yeah it's it's h hard

301
00:52:17,559 --> 00:52:23,760
actually I mean I've been getting more of the like the uh as you said the

302
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:29,319
uh empathy uh uh distress more so um so

303
00:52:29,319 --> 00:52:34,559
but takes a while to have the other for me uh you know to have the other part

304
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:42,079
underneath it the other part of the compassion to hold it both and then as we know I mean Buddhism is full of the

305
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:48,160
paradoxes but just being so close uh you know originally from that part it's hard

306
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:54,119
to you know keep both sides hard to not to take sides or or whatnot and

307
00:52:54,119 --> 00:53:01,119
especially when a million people people being you know displaced tomorrow have to move so it's just I know it's having

308
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:08,960
to hold both sides is kind of difficult when when you're uh close and then uh

309
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:16,160
yeah that's what comes to mind yeah thank you Alie thank you yeah it's Paradox of Buddhism I was

310
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:21,799
just going to ask you to maybe just like expand on that portion of it just holding this and that and everything

311
00:53:21,799 --> 00:53:31,640
else yeah yeah Paradox well I mean we live in Paradox this is um and it that's

312
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:38,000
in some ways it's a paradox and in some ways it's it's um the truth of how

313
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:44,400
things are you know many things can be uh many things that seemingly for our

314
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:52,280
limited cognition seem at odds they're actually quite uh consistent with one another

315
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:58,960
grief sadness sorrow coexist consistent with kindness love and care it's it

316
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:08,440
seems like a paradox and yet it isn't at the same time it's it's the natural response of the heart and and

317
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:15,280
um you know it it's maybe what you sh shared um maybe I'll say a word about

318
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:21,480
you know sometimes the Mind wants to have a a binary or or the mind you know

319
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:28,799
kind of sticks to wants to have a binary like it's either this or that and and

320
00:54:28,799 --> 00:54:35,720
like a loving parents say sweetheart it doesn't have to be binary it doesn't have to be so strictly one way or

321
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:44,000
another I you have much more capacity to hold multitudes to hold multitudes to to

322
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:50,200
feel the pain of people who are being displaced and the and feel the pain of

323
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:55,839
the people who were surprised and and hurting in fact you can hold pain

324
00:54:55,839 --> 00:55:02,480
there's just pain there are human beings all around and if you want to take sides

325
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:09,640
Dear Heart advise your heart perhaps take the heart take sides with peace

326
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:16,280
take sides with nonviolence take sides with compassion take sides with humanity

327
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:23,359
take sides with human beings all around in that region that complicated complex

328
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:29,799
region of the world that I'm from as well that has just hurting so much has

329
00:55:29,799 --> 00:55:39,280
been hurting for so long um taking and and also compassion isn't just um tender

330
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:44,520
it's both tender and it's also Fierce it's also protective it's also loving

331
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:50,839
it's also gives it's also shares of itself but it's not it doesn't include

332
00:55:50,839 --> 00:55:58,839
hatred it doesn't have any hatred in it it it loves it it sees the suffering and

333
00:55:58,839 --> 00:56:06,400
it sees the the ignorance of the world it sees the ignorance of of human beings

334
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:13,319
that that keep [Music]

335
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:21,599
perpetrating pain on each other and forgives loves doesn't

336
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:27,039
condone but but but loves as deeply and

337
00:56:27,039 --> 00:56:33,079
as as painful as it might be as it can feel to continue to love and see under

338
00:56:33,079 --> 00:56:41,160
the humanity that everybody's hurting everybody's hurting hurt people hurt

339
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:46,038
people anyway thank

340
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:55,160
you yeah so two one one minute left and I get get

341
00:56:55,160 --> 00:57:00,440
this big question Jerry says are the relationships between compassion and

342
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:07,280
Justice and peace yes absolutely um how can I address this in

343
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:11,079
30 seconds

344
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:19,160
um yeah maybe I'll say this I trust you

345
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:24,920
have heard of restorative justice restorative justice is justice that

346
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:32,720
doesn't blame shame hate restorative justice that has compassion and wish for

347
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:40,240
peace as as an integral part of it and there so that's what I would say in 30

348
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:45,920
seconds that's how compassion and Justice and peace coexist together and

349
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:52,119
there are a lot of resources on on on what I just mentioned so I'll leave it

350
00:57:52,119 --> 00:57:57,480
at that and maybe what I'll do very quickly is I will share I mentioned to
