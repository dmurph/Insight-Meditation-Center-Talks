for e

99
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:25,320
so good morning sa delighted to be with you and

100
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:33,320
um special warm welcome to those of you who slipped in a bit late into the YouTube s the online

101
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:39,559
sa and a warm welcome to those of you listening later as

102
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:47,799
well so happy to be with you really Delight in um reconnecting with this

103
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:53,440
sa so today I would like to

104
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:59,519
offer some Reflections on gifts we receive from this practice

105
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:05,360
and this is based on a few of the Buddha's lesser known teachings discourses on

106
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:11,799
generosity but um in general you may be well aware that the Buddha's teachings

107
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:18,760
place a lot of emphasis on giving on offering as part of the beginning of the

108
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:25,799
path from post practitioners it's less about what is given than

109
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:32,639
how and this week instead of focusing on giving things we're going to focus on

110
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:37,840
the qualities we give the how we give to our

111
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:45,480
practice and the gifts that can be received from it so I'm going to start with a story I

112
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:51,200
love to tell stories some of you know many years ago I had the benefit of

113
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:58,000
staying in a um a wat a temple in Thailand and this Temple was on this

114
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,880
little desert mostly deserti is arid island in the Bay of Thailand kosich

115
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:11,279
Chong and the temple itself had been started by this um very sincere monastic

116
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:18,559
um who grew into a wonderful teacher and it was just him in a cave for a long time and then gradually as these things

117
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:24,679
happen there the um the complex grew up around him as people came to practice

118
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:30,399
with him and I was touched to learn early on that the temple itself the

119
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:38,159
entire place was named after an enlightened woman so this teacher had seen her in a

120
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:45,880
dream and was so inspired by her that he named his life's work after

121
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:51,039
her and it was a very human scale kind of

122
00:32:51,039 --> 00:33:00,039
place it centered around the monastic life the rhythm of the seasons the rhythm of Awakening prce practicing and

123
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:05,639
gardening and the monastics mostly with some help from the villagers built up

124
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:12,840
the temple over time and they lived their life as a

125
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:20,000
Dharma expression dedicating practice to others in fact the one time we would all come

126
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,880
together we actually came together two times a day in the morning and in the evening and in the evening all of us

127
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:34,159
women would sit in a little um open AED beautiful place um at night and dedicate

128
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:41,559
our practice to others and there's this kind of symbolic ritual or practice we did which

129
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:47,279
involved pouring the water from one cup or one vessel to

130
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:53,559
another and then we would pad out in our bare feet out into the darkness of the

131
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:58,600
garden and water the plant and it was such a beautiful

132
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:06,880
practice you know just Starry Night Big Sky but it was also symbolic in another

133
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:13,679
way on this arid Island there were no Lakes no ponds no Rivers all of the

134
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:20,919
water came from these very crafty catchments built right into the temple

135
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:26,800
roofs that caught the water as they sloped and it would um pour the water

136
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:32,919
down into these sisters beneath each structure and because the place was on a

137
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:39,398
hill there were a number of different structures at different levels and the people there gardened

138
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:48,000
with the water they bathed with it we drank it and for many years they gave the excess

139
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,280
water and food to the villagers all around the temple which then they

140
00:34:53,280 --> 00:35:01,680
received back in the form of meals there was such an integrity and open

141
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:07,880
handedness about trust conviction about their

142
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:13,800
generosity and I talk about this because that kind of trust and conviction can be

143
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:22,160
an inherent condition of mature Dharma practice and an expression of the

144
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:28,640
practice itself they related to the life

145
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:35,119
Necessities in this generous way the people there treated what they

146
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:41,960
gave and to whom they gave it with respect attentiveness and this Rhythm was in

147
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:47,000
resonance with the seasons and abundance that was appropriate to the

148
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:54,760
context of this place and you could feel this palpable sense of kindness and Care

149
00:35:54,760 --> 00:36:01,800
between the temple practitioners and the village ERS it was really

150
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:08,000
evident and those sisters those structures were built in a really

151
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:16,400
intentional way as I said there the whole Temple was on a a hill and each

152
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:23,599
sstn flowed into the sistern in the structure beneath it all the way down so

153
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:29,319
whatever water wasn't used for gardening or personal use or given away way flowed

154
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:36,599
back into the ocean and there in this vast cycle of

155
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:45,119
oceanic generosity it eventually perhaps returned as

156
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:52,440
rain so this hints at both a kind of a

157
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:59,119
trust and relating to this offering through a sense of

158
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:06,359
of conditionality the people there had no way of knowing when or if the sharing of

159
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:13,359
their abundance whether it be water with the ocean or food with others would be returned to them but they

160
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:20,680
trusted that what they gave would somehow offer an intrinsic good whether

161
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:28,200
to them directly or outwards in all of these unknowable ways

162
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:37,000
so in the coming days I'll explore a whole range of the way that these gifts

163
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,920
Cascade back to us the Abundant goodness

164
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:49,760
possibility when we approach the Dharma when we approach meditation practice in

165
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:55,119
an open-handed way and this is really because in my

166
00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:00,560
experience offering yourself complete complely offering myself completely to the

167
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:06,160
practice invites receiving even greater gifts from

168
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:13,119
it in this way the means of Dharma practice prees the ends of

169
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:18,640
it and there's a beautiful mystery in just what and how we offer transmutes

170
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:25,000
into this receiving but perhaps as our friends in the Zen tradition say there's

171
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:32,680
not a real separation between Giver receiver and

172
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:41,119
gift so that's the overview kind of impressionistic sense

173
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:46,200
of where we're going and today I just really simply want to underscore the

174
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:54,680
power of conviction of trust in the practice a place like this Thai temple

175
00:38:54,680 --> 00:39:00,560
represents that kind of conviction that kind of trust trust integrity and the

176
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:08,680
reciprocity that can come from the staying power of showing up in these

177
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:16,560
ways there [Music] are three levels of this kind of

178
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:21,960
trust borrowed Bri and

179
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:28,720
verified so borrowed trust or faith is experimental maybe based on what you've

180
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:35,000
heard or seen or read possibly even based on scientific

181
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:42,520
studies right trust right Faith it's sometimes called is when something has

182
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:48,440
clicked there's a sense of possibility there's a Tailwind for the practice and

183
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:55,920
energy wow okay this works I saw it written on a a signboard

184
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:02,880
outside of a yoga studio years ago this kind of trust or confidence isn't trusting that things will turn out okay

185
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:09,440
it's trusting that no matter how things turn out you'll be

186
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:15,280
okay and then there's the third level verified Faith verified trust

187
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,920
confidence which is based on powerful firsthand

188
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:28,000
experience so to the extent that you can offer trust

189
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:35,400
Integrity conviction to the practice offer yourself wholeheartedly to the

190
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:41,240
practice these qualities increase the possibility of ref

191
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:46,040
receiving feelings of Joy

192
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:52,400
lightness openness spaciousness they can become sources of

193
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,760
strength a rootedness this kind of Integrity in the practice and can be

194
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:03,599
very sustaining so that's the

195
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:09,480
quality that between today and tomorrow I want to invite you to

196
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:16,599
consider for yourself how does conviction confidence

197
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:22,319
trust show up in your heart how might it inform you in your life and practice or

198
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:29,240
how might you like it to what can you do to invite more of it

199
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:35,359
I'm not going to offer a full outline of the week because this is a journey we're

200
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:40,800
