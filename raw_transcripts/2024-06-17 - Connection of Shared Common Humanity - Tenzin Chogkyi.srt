in meditation in the early 1970s and in 1991 she began practicing

olani land in what is now known as Santa Cruz California and good morning and

20
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,600
welcome to IMC t Chi thank you Martha how's the sound is

21
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:11,239
working yeah thank you all for coming it's nice to be here again I realized I

22
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:16,680
was just thinking of the last time I taught here I think it was 2018 it's

23
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,440
definitely before the pandemic and I was still a monastic and my friend aan

24
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:29,560
chondo and I taught a day long called the bodh SAA and the arot comparing the

25
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,680
main in Traditions and had a good time I don't know if anybody here was there at

26
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:43,000
that time anybody remember that no okay too long ago so this morning because my

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,400
tradition is a little bit different in the meditations I lead or slightly different we're going to flip the script

28
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,640
a little bit and do most of the Dharma talk before doing the meditation and

29
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:02,560
then have time after the meditation because it might be a different style for for you to have some discussion

30
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,720
question and answer and so forth but before all of that we'll go ahead and settle in we'll just settle in for a

31
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:16,920
couple of minutes with breath awareness and set Our intention for our time together before I introduce the practice

32
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:27,200
so I'll invite you just to get into a comfortable posture relaxed yet alert these two

33
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,400
qualities are complimentary not contradictory we try and get

34
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,159
a alert stance in our meditation mostly

35
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:46,239
through that nice upright spine as if there were a cord pulling up from the crown of your head and then your body

36
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:52,079
relaxed around it so just taking a moment to settle in

37
00:03:52,079 --> 00:04:00,439
and perhaps moving your attention through your body noticing if there's any tightness or tension deliberately

38
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:07,640
relaxing we often hold tension around our eyes so noticing your forehead and

39
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:15,760
the area around your eyes and relaxing and your jaw generally were

40
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:22,600
breathing through our nose when we meditate if we can unless we have some sort of sinus problem or

41
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:30,000
obstruction but even though our mouth is closed our jaw not clenched and your neck and shoulders is

42
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,360
another place we often hold tension so I invite you if you notice any tightness there to just deliberately relax and

43
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:48,840
release perhaps releasing on the exhale your belly relaxed your

44
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:59,840
buttocks and then let's round off this initial settling of the body with three deep breaths deep diaphragmatic

45
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,960
inhalation and

46
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:15,680
exhalation and then just turning our attention to the sensations of the breath wherever we can feel it in the

47
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:22,440
body is a way to arrive in this space in our bodies in the present moment it

48
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:31,600
might be full body awareness of breathing perhaps the abdomen as your diaphragm

49
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,800
Rises and Falls perhaps you can notice the breath more by localizing your attention at the chest with your lungs

50
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,000
expanding and Contracting and perhaps that very subtle

51
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,479
sensation at the nostrils so just spending a few moments with either the

52
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:58,039
localized attention or that wide angle lens of full body awareness of breathing

53
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:34,800
and when you notice your attention wandering or you get distracted by a another sense object like a sound for

54
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:41,199
example just releasing the distraction and returning to the

55
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,560
breath for

56
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,319
and now let's take a moment to reflect on Our intention our motivation for

57
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:55,720
being here this morning in Buddhist practice we say we get the most out of any practice session

58
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:03,680
or even a study session or even a discussion if we're clear about Our intention and

59
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:12,000
set our motivation you thinking of what brought you here this morning perhaps you're a

60
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,280
regular attendee at these Sunday morning

61
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:26,800
sessions maybe you're here for the first time maybe you just heard

62
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,760
about the center and your checking it out curious maybe you're going through a

63
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:40,479
hard time in your life right now and looking for ways to help you

64
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:46,560
manage The Unwanted experiences you're having you heard Buddhism has something

65
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:53,760
to offer just taking a moment to reflect on your intention

66
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:16,760
and we always also try to add a altruistic intention to our

67
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:23,279
motivation thinking May whatever I experience this morning in meditation in

68
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:32,120
discussion and the discourse may it benefit me but may I get some insight some

69
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:39,360
experience that will bring benefit to others as well so trying to generate that

70
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,360
altruistic intention

71
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,259
[Music]

72
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,360
just relaxing your posture and coming out of

73
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:27,399
meditation so some more people arrived while we were doing that settling practice and just to just to say again

74
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:35,040
that we're going to have a slightly different structure this morning I'm going to be introducing a guided meditation and then

75
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,920
leading you through it and then having some time for discussion and question and answer so it's going to be a little

76
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:48,320
bit different and again so nice to be in this space uh I met Gil actually all the

77
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:55,079
way back in 1992 I was the director of vajani Institute at Tibetan Buddhist center in

78
00:10:55,079 --> 00:11:01,000
the mountains in outside of Boulder Creek and he in Mary Grace

79
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,720
ore just rocked up one morning checking out Retreat centers to see if there is a

80
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:13,240
place they could hold their annual Retreat and that became a 33-year

81
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,760
relationship that started with them leading 10day Retreats at that Retreat

82
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:24,120
Center kind of through the Whole Decade of the 90s I think it wasn't until maybe

83
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:30,920
Spirit Rock opened up a residential place that they moved there and even then they didn't want to because you

84
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:36,600
know we had established such a groove of them coming every year for 10 days to do

85
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,959
Retreats so we're old friends so what I want to talk about this morning and this

86
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:48,959
you know sometimes there'll be something in the air that keeps coming up and I've had no less than four conversations this

87
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:56,240
week with people from different organizations about how to bridge the huge divides

88
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:04,480
that are so obvious to all of us in our communities in our nation globally and

89
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,440
so forth through dialogue bridging Community

90
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:16,440
conversations and so I think Buddhism has so much to offer to this endeavor I

91
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:22,399
think we all would agree that you know just even speaking about our own Nation

92
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,320
such big divides politically not only between you know

93
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:34,079
the two main political parties but big divisions about the war in Israel

94
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:42,240
Palestine the war in Ukraine so many issues that are dividing people climate change climate Justice and so forth and

95
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:49,000
so you know what do we do to actually come together and talk and I think it

96
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,480
really goes back to you know using some of the techniques from Buddhism for

97
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:01,720
developing empathy and compassion and we can bring this out of the interpersonal

98
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:07,560
to the community level and even the national level so I wanted to kind of

99
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:14,880
revisit some of those techniques for how do we generate empathy and compassion

100
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:23,279
for people that we think are other right are very different from us and you know

101
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:28,839
that we may not be even very interested in having empathy and compassion for

102
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:35,399
those kind of people and so in Buddhist practice we emphasize what we sometimes

103
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:40,720
call mental cultivation through contemplation and in the four Brahma

104
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:48,440
viharas for example which are found in all Buddhist Traditions there's this idea that we can cultivate qualities

105
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:54,480
Like Loving kindness and compassion not just for our loved

106
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,800
ones easy everybody does that that's no big deal we don't need to work hard at

107
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:08,199
that maybe we need to work a little bit harder to develop compassion for ourselves that can be challenging right

108
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:15,600
and a lot of people find that self-kindness and self-compassion but what about extending

109
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:22,720
compassion to people we see as other in in in some way because of their beliefs

110
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,720
because of maybe their ethnicity because of other differences and one of the things that

111
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,160
we do in Buddhist practice is attuned to what we call the common

112
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:41,120
Humanity my teacher one of my main teachers who ordained me I lived as a monastic for 20 years and I was ordained

113
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,160
by his Holiness the Daly Lama who I think just about everybody in the planet

114
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:52,000
admires I mean there are exceptions but not many very exemplary person and I

115
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,160
remember once listening to one of his main translators who translated for him

116
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:03,680
in the early days especially when when he first started coming to the so-called West and you know needed a translator in

117
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:09,040
maybe the 70s and so forth Jeffrey Hopkins a Buddhist scholar and he says

118
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:15,680
you know every time I translated for his Holiness at Ali Lama didn't matter what

119
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,920
the topic was within the first like couple of sentences he'd always say the

120
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:26,800
same thing all beings are the same in wanting happiness and wanting to avoid

121
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:34,120
suffering and so Jeffrey Hopkins said I could only come to one of two conclusions either he didn't have

122
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:40,000
anything else to talk about or this is really really really important and

123
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,560
that's the common Humanity we're the same in terms of our

124
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:52,720
basic human feelings our basic human needs and this is just talking about humans in Buddhism

125
00:15:52,720 --> 00:16:00,639
of course we expand to the more than human realm but for the purposes of today just talking about The Human

126
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:08,199
Experience you know we all have the same feelings emotions the same basic needs

127
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:14,480
and so even when there are superficial differences even when there're really extreme differences because this doesn't

128
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:20,920
say that all beings have the same lived experience at all so it's not to erase

129
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:26,800
difference in any way to say that people don't have very different experiences on

130
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:32,720
the basis of race and ethnicity and gender and gender

131
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,360
identity sexual orientation all the things that make us different for sure

132
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:44,440
but there's a base that we can drill down to that is the basis of that

133
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:49,600
connection across difference in the way that we can sometimes make the

134
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,040
difference so that we dispose of people or discount their them you know their

135
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:01,720
full Humanity or somehow just refuse to connect to them and I think you know

136
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:08,600
holding this interesting dichotomy of there may be somebody I really disagree

137
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,798
with there may be people that even does something that's really harmful that I'm

138
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:20,600
trying to kind of protest or stop them or whatever but can I still have compassion and empathy for them as a

139
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:29,120
human that's the hard balance right so it's not giving people a pass for harmful Behavior at all or not saying oh

140
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,799
we'll just erase the differences but it's saying can I have that connection

141
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:40,360
nevertheless to their Humanity because that's where real connection and

142
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,840
communication that I think can really help us especially in these divided

143
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:52,160
times now traditional Buddhist practice just kind of focuses on the

144
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,520
interpersonal and so we have practices and we'll do one today of Imagining the

145
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:03,039
friend imagining The Stranger Imagining the enemy right and that's kind of more

146
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:09,559
of the personal person that hurt your feelings or the really annoying co-worker or the relative that you have

147
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:15,720
the dis you know difference of opinion with but I think we can generalize some

148
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:24,200
of those practices for Buddhism to social groups we see as friend enemy stranger also right and try to try to

149
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:31,159
bridge these divides and there are a lot of um organizations now doing this kind of work but I just wanted to bring up

150
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:39,440
this idea of you know kind of connecting to that idea of the common humanity and

151
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,080
it's interesting because people who have studied altruism just

152
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:52,320
psychologists and you know social scientists who've investigated why do

153
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:59,919
people do kind of these altruistic acts even at Great risk to the themselves for

154
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:05,159
others like what's going on there this Common Thread and there's a book that I brought with me and I'll read a quote

155
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:10,320
later on it's called the heart of altruism by a researcher called kren

156
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,640
Monroe and She interviewed people who' done these altruistic acts for total

157
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:21,240
strangers and there's a chapter Where She interviewed um Gentiles non-jewish

158
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:28,159
people in Europe who at Great personal risk to them and their families hid Jews

159
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:33,640
you know we all kind I think a lot of us know the story of Anne Frank who was hidden in the Attic of the family for

160
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:40,360
like two years or some crazy amount of time you know and then they all ended up kind of getting carded away and she was

161
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:46,880
asking these people she did her research in the 90s when a lot of them were still alive like what's up with that how can

162
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:53,120
you risk you know and she said herself as a mother she goes I can see my

163
00:19:53,120 --> 00:20:00,880
husband and myself making a you know taking a risk like that but for my children I would do

164
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:07,200
anything to protect them I would never do it so even these people that did that and they all said the same thing and the

165
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:13,120
Common Thread was how could we not they're human beings just like me right

166
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:19,720
so there was something about these people who were altruists that was a Common Thread that they saw and they

167
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:25,640
didn't see us and them in the same way right and they just were like how could

168
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:32,120
I not so there's this idea in Buddhism of our inner connection and again it

169
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:38,679
doesn't mean we're all the same it doesn't mean we all have the same experience but in Buddhist practice we

170
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:45,440
really tune into you know this fact of our interdependence on each other this

171
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,440
idea that's I mean I've lived and traveled in all of these countries and I'll tell you right now Americans are

172
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:58,720
the worst I'm telling you the worst in this hallucination of Independence

173
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:05,360
like we're just a satellite in floating in space with no gravitational Pole to

174
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:13,000
anything and I'm like are you kidding me right now I just went to the restroom as one does turned on the water I couldn't

175
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,520
even have a drink of water without it I don't even know where the water comes from how does the piping work where does

176
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:26,520
it go no idea someone did that good thing otherwise it'd be carting a bucket

177
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:31,760
to some where's the the closest stre dream no idea right my car don't even

178
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:38,679
get me started all the things that we depend on others for everything we do

179
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:45,200
and often still it's easy for us you know who grow up in a culture that even

180
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:51,360
prizes this Fierce Independence oh I'm all about it you know no I don't need

181
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:58,679
help I can do the thing and I can help everyone else and I don't ever need to ask for help and it's just a hallucinate

182
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:05,559
ation like I said it's just false so connecting in that way and connecting to

183
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:12,400
you know at the very Baseline of our common feelings and needs there's a a

184
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:19,320
clinical social worker who works a lot with people with trauma and I really like her work and her name is Stacy

185
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:25,240
Haynes and anybody who's taken nonviolent communication classes which

186
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:32,440
some of you may have done there's long lists of feeling ings and needs and those can be really helpful she drills

187
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:38,120
it down to three basic needs and I love her list very short list and I think it

188
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:43,480
kind of is an umbrella for a lot of those longer lists she says

189
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:48,679
safety belonging and dignity or respect

190
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:55,600
right and so do what everyone is doing is trying to fulfill a need for either

191
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,799
safety super basic right we all want safety

192
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:07,320
belonging wow that's huge how many times have we done something or not done

193
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:13,440
something that we felt like was right because we wanted to belong and fit in

194
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:19,360
right so belonging so huge very evolutionary basic human need and then

195
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,600
dignity or respect or even to borrow from Dan seagull just being

196
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:31,640
seen right just being seen as somebody with some kind of value and so that's

197
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:39,440
kind of the Baseline that we can drill down to I teach a a training uh in conflict

198
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:45,000
management skills I actually did it for gills teacher training Retreat a couple

199
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:52,559
of months ago he invited me to come do this conflict management skills training and in that we talk about we kind of

200
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:57,600
show a diagram of two icebergs and we say above the waterline are the person's

201
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:04,760
positions like you're in a disagreement with someone and you both have these entrenched positions and then under the

202
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:12,320
waterline is feelings needs values ideals and then we have a the in

203
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:17,799
the diagram the two icebergs overlap and we call that the collaboration sweet

204
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:25,640
spot like you found some shared need or value or interest and then that's where

205
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:31,120
you can come up with a solution into the problem that's not either one of the

206
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,440
first positions but that's where something new can emerge and so I think

207
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:42,399
that's true interpersonally too even when we don't have a conflict with

208
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:47,840
someone so what we're going to do in the meditation practice this is going to be

209
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:54,840
a guided practice probably more guided than maybe you're mostly used to but again I've got my Tibetan Buddhist hat

210
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:00,200
on you can't see it but it's there so we do a lot of guided practice with

211
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:06,640
visualizations and so what we're going to do and this is very traditional practice for

212
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:12,640
cultivating compassion and empathy and this is a technique from Tibetan

213
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,679
Buddhism that was actually also used to develop Stanford's compassion

214
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:25,120
cultivation training this secular program that some of you Robert cusk who's who's a teacher here is one of one

215
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:31,600
of the teachers of that training and I am too so the idea is we start with a

216
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:38,520
priming step of thinking of someone easy to have compassion for so we kind of get

217
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:48,840
the juices flowing and get that felt sense of what it's like and then gradually over time we expand to First

218
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:54,880
the stranger the neutral person who is who we often will just feel indifferent

219
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:01,159
who cares whether they're happy or suffering I don't care I don't even know them they just put my groceries in the

220
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:07,640
bag at Trader Joe's whatever right and then beyond that even the

221
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:13,200
difficult people and for this practice especially if it's new to you don't pick

222
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:21,399
a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 of the most difficult person don't pick it's always the ex's right the exm Mother-in-law the

223
00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:28,480
ex partner the ex whatever it's always the people really close to us that broke our heart and betrayed us it's always

224
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,559
don't do that maybe the annoying irritating coworker we've all got one of

225
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:39,840
those or even if some people say oh I have no one in my life that I dislike

226
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:45,760
and I go okay you can think of a public figure but again maybe not a 10 on the

227
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:52,279
scale of 1 to 10 I'm not sure there is one they're all like zero or 10 there's

228
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:58,240
hardly any but anyway yeah maybe a 12 maybe a 12 but

229
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:03,440
you know maybe of kind of three or four or five on a scale of 1 to 10 cuz I

230
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:10,080
don't want a you know room full of really triggered people and memory is also a trigger of emotion so we don't

231
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:17,200
want that and so I'll guide you through and what we do is if we can get a visual

232
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:23,720
image of the person seated in front of us some people it's hard to have a visual image just in your mind's eye you

233
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:30,559
kind of imagine the person there and get a felt sense of their presence to or

234
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:38,279
instead of the visual image some people are like I just can't visualize it all and that's fine get a felt sense of the

235
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:44,360
person's presence and then kind of tune into What feelings come up and then

236
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:50,480
we'll try and generate this feeling of the common Humanity okay and see how it

237
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,960
goes it might be hard I did this practice once you know I had a nemesis

238
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:01,480
that was also an X and it took me literally years maybe it's too

239
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:08,080
discouraging if I tell you this but it did years to shift but I trusted the

240
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:15,039
practice so don't expect miracles today but over time if you keep doing it these

241
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:20,840
practices really move to shift sometimes our strong reactions towards people of

242
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:28,360
different groups or people that in our own lives so we'll give it a try and then we'll have a chance to discuss and

243
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:33,640
see what questions or Reflections or experiences come up after the practice

244
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:39,799
all right so I'll prompt you with something to think about I'll give you kind of an instruction of how to think

245
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:45,440
or visualize and then pause and then follow the instruction as best you can

246
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:52,399
until I give you the next prompt if you lose track as we do when we're doing breath awareness meditation just

247
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:58,600
reprompt yourself you know you might be like oh my gosh what am I going to have for lunch and I've got 60 emails

248
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:04,440
okay wait no the neutral person I'm supposed to be thinking the neutral person so just kind of bring yourself

249
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:09,799
back to the practice all right so I'll invite you to get in a comfortable

250
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:14,880
posture with your back straight again and if you're sitting down your legs

251
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,960
cross comfortably on the cushion if you're sitting up in a chair just making

252
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:26,120
sure you have a nice stable posture with your shoulders

253
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:33,440
even if you have your tongue resting on the top of your top of on your pallet your upper

254
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:39,360
pallet right behind your teeth that can keep you from having to swallow

255
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:46,200
constantly and your eyes can either be closed or in a slightly open hooded gaze

256
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:53,440
if that helps you to stay awake stay alert but you're

257
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,880
not looking if your eyes are slightly open letting a little light in you're not looking

258
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,360
at whatever is in front of your eyes you're withdrawing your

259
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:10,679
gaze so we won't do a full body scan but I'll just invite you for a moment after

260
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:17,000
settling into your posture to check into your posture in your body see if there's

261
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:25,080
any tightness or tension or constriction and release relax

262
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:39,399
and then just settling with the Breath Again wherever you can follow the

263
00:30:39,399 --> 00:30:45,880
sensations perhaps the full body awareness of breathing or the

264
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:51,279
diaphragm or the lungs or that subtlest place the air

265
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,480
moving in and out of your

266
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:00,960
nostrils for

267
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:44,360
and just release any distracting sounds any distracting thoughts that pull you

268
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:51,480
away from that awareness of the sensations of the breath just release and

269
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,880
return for

270
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:38,960
and so for the first step we're going to practice self-c kindness and

271
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:47,240
self-compassion and so taking a moment to think of a time when you

272
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:54,240
felt great difficulty maybe you were in some kind of emotional or mental

273
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,840
distress or perhaps it was physical pain

274
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:06,799
maybe a breakup of an important relationship or a big

275
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:15,519
disappointment and if you can imagine that self your past

276
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:25,000
self seated in front of you facing you or get a felt sense of yourself in that

277
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:32,600
experience just take a moment to really feel clearly yourself when you're

278
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:39,240
experiencing that unwanted episode whatever it

279
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:52,799
was and as that memory becomes clear notice how you feel how does your heart

280
00:33:55,399 --> 00:34:02,559
feel you have feelings of care and tenderness and kindness

281
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,000
towards

282
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:31,320
yourself and attuning to that natural natural sense of care and kindness and

283
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:37,118
compassion you have towards yourself I invite you to recite the

284
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:45,560
following verses silently may I be

285
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:55,358
happy may I be free from suffering may I find peace and joy

286
00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:00,760
sending those thoughts of care and kindness and compassion out to

287
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:09,720
yourself may I be happy may I be free from

288
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:17,880
suffering may I find peace and joy

289
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:03,119
and I invite you all also as you recite the phrases if it's helpful sending out

290
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:11,040
a bright light from your heart and that light symbolizes that care and compassion you have for yourself just

291
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:18,720
imagine it touching that replica of yourself giving them peace freedom from

292
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:25,359
suffering happiness may I be

293
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:34,400
happy may I be free from suffering may I find peace and joy

294
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:30,440
and then let the visualization of yourself dissolve back into the the space of your

295
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:38,160
mind and now think of a loved one and so this is someone for whom you naturally

296
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:45,160
feel strong feelings of wishing that they have happiness wishing that they're free from

297
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:50,240
suffering that heartfelt care and concern it just comes

298
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:58,079
naturally with this person maybe it's your best friend maybe it's a relative

299
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:06,800
someone who really sees you who really gets you someone whose company you really

300
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:12,599
enjoy so again imagining them seated in front of you or if it's hard to get a

301
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:17,920
clear visual image just get a felt sense of their presence imagine they're here

302
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:25,480
in this room with you meditating with you taking a few moments to really feel

303
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,440
their presence get that image

304
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:47,720
and notice as their visual image and that felt sense of their presence

305
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:54,000
becomes real notice What feelings arise in your

306
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:59,760
heart might be a feeling of warmth and

307
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:09,640
openness you might feel that you have so much in common with this person they're

308
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:14,960
a lot like you so to empathize with their feelings

309
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,520
and their needs come so easily

310
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:43,480
so letting that feeling arise in your heart and become real that natural sense

311
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:49,440
of connection and empathy and care you feel towards your loved

312
00:39:55,079 --> 00:40:02,040
one and again if you'd like to visualize a bright light going out from your heart

313
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:08,800
as you breathe out and recite the following phrases in your mind may you

314
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:14,000
be happy may you be free from

315
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:21,119
suffering may you find peace and joy sending that compassionate wish out

316
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:29,319
to your loved one may you be happy may you be free from s

317
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:35,640
suffering may you find peace and joy

318
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:15,839
may you be happy may you be free from suffering may you find peace and joy

319
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:21,520
with each out breath sending that bright light imagining that

320
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:28,680
that care and love and concern and compassion Act

321
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:34,319
freeze your loved one from any problems they might be

322
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:41,319
experiencing any unwanted experience and gives them

323
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,240
peace

324
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:30,160
for for

325
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:10,440
and now I invite you to bring to mind a stranger so someone you don't know

326
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:17,079
well you have neither any strong feelings of affection for this person or

327
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:25,200
any feelings of aversion but it's somebody specific in your life somebody that you

328
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:30,760
recognize it might be the Barista at the place you get your morning coffee or

329
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:36,319
your regular Uber driver or a cooworker

330
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:43,760
that you don't know very well at all or maybe a neighbor so someone

331
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:50,839
specific but someone for whom you don't give much thought one way or

332
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:56,800
another neither affection nor aversion

333
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:04,880
maybe don't think of them at all unless you happen to see them and then don't even really think much about their life

334
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:11,599
what's going on for them so someone specific and again

335
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:16,800
trying to visualize them seated in front of you or get a felt sense of their

336
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:23,800
presence inviting them into the meditation taking a moment to build up

337
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:28,839
that feeling of their presence

338
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:47,839
and as you get that clear visual image or that felt sense becomes clear just

339
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:55,280
noticing how it feels noticing What feelings come

340
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:03,319
up might be just just indifference not much one way or the other you might even

341
00:45:03,319 --> 00:45:11,119
notice your attention wandering more why am I even thinking about this

342
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:28,040
person and now taking a moment to try to tune into this person's experience you

343
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:33,400
may know nothing about them you may not even know their

344
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:41,720
name but just because they're another human being someone cares for them someone

345
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:47,920
loves them they experience love and care for

346
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,880
others and wish to be

347
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:01,040
loved just like you they felt

348
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:07,880
disappointed sad maybe

349
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:22,200
lonely just like you they felt anger frustration irritation

350
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:35,040
just like you they felt joy laughter

351
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:51,880
connection just like you they need safety

352
00:46:52,880 --> 00:47:00,760
belonging dignity and respect and when they don't get it they

353
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:06,359
struggle so even though you don't know anything about this person you know all

354
00:47:06,359 --> 00:47:12,558
of these things to be true just because they're a human being just like

355
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:21,760
you and their life is just as important to them as your life is to you

356
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:47,160
and so with that feeling now of a more heartfelt level of

357
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:53,800
connection and empathy and compassion sending that bright light out

358
00:47:53,800 --> 00:48:00,440
to that stranger and thinking may you be

359
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:08,559
happy may you be free from suffering may you find peace and joy by

360
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:13,720
knowing that their happiness is just as important to them as your happiness is

361
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:19,240
to you their freedom from suffering just as important to

362
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:28,359
them may you be happy may you be free from suffering

363
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:35,440
may you find peace and joy continuing to send out that compassionate

364
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:42,078
wish from your heart along with that bright light with every out

365
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:49,599
breath and feeling that heartfelt wish that that person who's a stranger find

366
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:53,200
happiness and freedom from

367
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:59,760
suffering for

368
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:38,599
may you be happy may you be free from suffering may you find peace and

369
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:58,640
joy

370
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:29,680
for e

371
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:33,480
may you be happy may you be free from suffering may you find peace and joy

372
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:08,200
and now I invite you to think of a difficult person and again not a 10 on a scale of

373
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:15,160
1 to 10 not the most difficult person in your life but perhaps someone who's just

374
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:20,839
hurt you or someone you find irritating and

375
00:52:20,839 --> 00:52:28,880
annoying or someone who's disappointed you or someone whose views you feel you

376
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:36,839
just don't understand so thinking of such a person

377
00:52:36,839 --> 00:52:42,599
again someone very specific in your life and imagine them seated in front of you

378
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:46,440
or get a felt sense of their

379
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:57,839
presence and noticing even as you begin to bring them to mind you might notice

380
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:03,040
that aversion arising the thought that I don't really even want to think of this

381
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:08,599
person I definitely don't want to visualize them or feel that they're here

382
00:53:08,599 --> 00:53:15,480
in that room just notice whatever resistance might

383
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:29,119
arise take a few moments to really get clear get a sense of this

384
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:35,960
person noticing your response to thinking about

385
00:53:48,799 --> 00:53:54,720
them we so often perceive people through the

386
00:53:54,720 --> 00:54:00,440
lens and the filter of our own relationship with them and what they can

387
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:05,839
do for us perhaps what they have done to us or

388
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:13,960
for us but now try to think for this person

389
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:19,520
too they have a whole life that's just as important to them as your life is to

390
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,520
you

391
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:33,720
they wish to love and be loved they're an object of care and

392
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:37,799
concern and love to

393
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:53,200
someone they care to be happy they try to avoid any physical or

394
00:54:53,200 --> 00:55:00,280
emotional pain or disappointments or stress struggles just like

395
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:13,960
you they feel anger despair

396
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:19,920
disappointment frustration just like you

397
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:32,880
they feel Joy and connection and

398
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:36,838
happiness just like

399
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:58,880
you their basic needs of safety

400
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:04,119
belonging and respect and worthiness are just as

401
00:56:04,119 --> 00:56:08,960
important to them as your needs are to

402
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:17,680
you and just think perhaps if their needs were met perhaps if they received

403
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:25,400
more love they might not be as annoying perhaps if they received all

404
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:31,799
that any human wishes who knows they might

405
00:56:31,799 --> 00:56:38,240
change maybe it's all of their disappointments that has made them so

406
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:41,359
unpleasant to be

407
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:56,319
around and see if by connecting to that level of common Humanity in terms of the

408
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:04,520
the feelings the emotions the needs if with that in mind you can send

409
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:11,318
out a heartfelt wish may you too be

410
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:16,240
happy may you be free from

411
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:25,599
suffering may you experience peace and joy and sending out that bright light

412
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:31,760
from your heart even to the difficult person they too wishing for happiness

413
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:37,640
wishing to be free from suffering just like you may you be

414
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:45,520
happy may you be free from suffering may you experience peace and

415
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,520
joy

416
00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:13,880
and notice it might feel harder than for the other people the loved one and the

417
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:19,160
stranger and that's fine just noticing but your intention to at

418
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:26,160
least try it's aspirational may you be happy may you

419
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:33,720
you be free from suffering may you experience peace and

420
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:57,880
joy imagine that bright light going out and imagine that difficult person

421
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:04,400
actually having peace of mind having happiness that you're able to actually

422
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:10,200
give them happiness and relieve their suffering

423
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:54,759
may you be happy may you be free from suffering may you experience peace and

424
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:59,000
joy for

425
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:44,960
and now think of all three people together the loved one the

426
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:50,960
stranger the difficult person and

427
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:57,920
thinking even though you have a different relationship to all three of these people

428
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:04,880
from their side they all are exactly the same and wanting happiness wanting

429
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:14,000
freedom from suffering and that there's no difference at all the same as you the same as each

430
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:22,280
other so sending that compassionate wish out to all three may you all be

431
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:27,480
happy may you all be free from suffering

432
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:33,520
may you all experience peace and joy breathing out that bright light from

433
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,720
your

434
01:01:39,079 --> 01:01:47,359
heart may you all be happy may you be free from

435
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:54,720
suffering may you experience peace and joy

436
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:31,559
and then expanding that compassionate with with even farther thinking of everyone seated in this room right

437
01:02:31,559 --> 01:02:37,880
now all of us here exactly the same in terms of our

438
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:44,839
basic human feelings our needs our emotions all of us wishing for

439
01:02:44,839 --> 01:02:51,119
happiness wishing for freedom from suffering and so expand imagine that

440
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:57,839
light from your heart expanding going out to everyone in this room May everyone

441
01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:04,520
here be happy May everyone be free from

442
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:09,799
suffering May everyone experience peace and

443
01:03:19,559 --> 01:03:26,960
joy just expanding feeling that warmth from your heart that bright light going

444
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,359
out to everyone in this

445
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:46,720
room then to everyone joining on the live stream

446
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:06,520
and then imagining expanding to all

447
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:12,599
beings imagine that powerful compassionate energy from your heart

448
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:20,160
there's no boundary it just streams forth sending that same compassionate

449
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:29,000
wish to all beings may all beings be happy may all all beings be free from

450
01:04:29,279 --> 01:04:35,720
suffering may all beings experience peace and joy

451
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:19,599
and then releasing the visualization returning to the breath for just a

452
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:27,039
moment and taking a moment to rejoice in your own practice

453
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:32,799
your own cultivation of this openhearted immeasurable

454
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:40,319
compassion just take a moment to feel Joy in your own

455
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:49,200
virtue thinking that even in the level of your imagination you've been able to bring all the suffering in the universe

456
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:52,558
to an end

457
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:09,680
and then dedicating the positive energy from our practice that all beings have

458
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:15,440
happiness all beings have freedom from suffering

459
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:45,359
and taking just a moment to relax your posture very gently come out of meditation

460
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:07,680
well I really feel like that should have singlehandedly brought about world peace feels that way to me

461
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:15,839
anyway so we've got about 11 minutes and if there's any questions or

462
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:24,240
Reflections or experiences or any epiphanies doubts

463
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:29,640
struggles any of the above don't be shy we'll pass the mic

464
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:35,799
around anything come up at all because I know that was maybe a slightly different

465
01:07:35,799 --> 01:07:43,240
type of practice than some of you might be used to so yeah there's a question

466
01:07:46,039 --> 01:07:53,440
here good morning thank you so much um our son is college age son is coming

467
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:58,720
home today who we love dearly and I wouldn't be surprised if that was the

468
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:07,760
loved one that both of us thought of um but as with all young people today and

469
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:14,720
in the past and in the future um he struggles some with who is he

470
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:25,000
going to be what is he going to do um he has ADD and needs to deal with

471
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:31,440
that and um recently I found

472
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:40,880
myself stepping back into kind of the executive function role

473
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:48,080
and I can feel myself getting more rigid dealing with him in terms of have you

474
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:54,560
done this have you done that and we're both good about conversing about that

475
01:08:54,560 --> 01:09:02,600
but I'm wondering if if you have any suggestions about in the moment are there things

476
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:10,838
that I can be thinking of to stop the mind's all fear-based right

477
01:09:10,839 --> 01:09:17,798
I just want the best for you and yeah exactly let me help you out I I do as a

478
01:09:17,799 --> 01:09:25,040
matter of fact unsurprisingly do have a couple of ideas one thing though that your question makes me think of is the

479
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:32,440
when I teach the longer course I teach the 8we Stanford course and we have a lot more unpacking of all the steps

480
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:38,798
including choosing the appropriate loved one and so we often say Teenage children

481
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:45,000
that don't come home by curfew maybe a complicated relationship clearly you

482
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:52,920
love them dearly and they drive you nuts also and the spouse who doesn't wash the dishes and I was teaching in prison I

483
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:59,159
taught in prison for about 15 years before Co and I was doing this in prison and then there was another example that

484
01:09:59,159 --> 01:10:05,159
I hadn't even thought of and I felt this one of my students who's experiencing incarceration and a couple of weeks into

485
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:11,040
the class he goes I'm really struggling with the meditation on the loved one and I was like what's happening and he goes

486
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:16,960
he was thinking of his mother in this little village in Mexico that he's the oldest son and he can't take care of her

487
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:23,960
which he's meant to do in that culture because he's in prison in California so along with the love he has for his

488
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:29,320
mother comes guilt and shame and all these complex emotions so just to say in

489
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:35,480
terms of the meditation we say sometimes just your besy that it's uncomp like all

490
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:43,080
human relationships are complicated admitting that and maybe a less complicated one and I think I don't have

491
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:48,120
children in this life so I just speak from kind of conversations with people

492
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:54,199
and just my own you know but kind of just realizing I mean from a Buddhist

493
01:10:54,199 --> 01:10:59,440
perspective it's really help me and and trying to help other people is go they

494
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:05,280
have their own Karma you can be a condition to maybe help them or not but

495
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:11,480
you cannot live their life for them you can't force them into choices all you

496
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:18,719
can do is try to gently seed kind of the field with some suggestions and so forth

497
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:27,199
and then you really do have to let go and then sometimes even by letting go they'll come to and talk to you more

498
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:34,440
than they would and you can actually be more effective you know they say it's like there's a a sort of like with

499
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:40,080
meditation practice like you hang on too hard and try and control your mind too

500
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:46,800
much you just drive yourself crazy and stir everything up but it shouldn't be too LAX either and I think that metaphor

501
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:53,679
works for almost everything including relationships like you're holding but you're not squeezing and gripping so

502
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:59,560
tightly and it's so hard as a parent I know because you want their happiness more than anything and you just jump in

503
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:06,719
front of the speeding freight train to save them and just realizing the boundary of what you can do and what you

504
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:15,080
can't do and and yeah the just realizing kind of a realistic boundary of what is

505
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:22,480
helping even look like and what's actually the best way to help and often with people just being more of a

506
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:27,840
listener is the best thing we can do like empathic presence and listening is

507
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:33,159
absolutely 100% people are always going what do I do with this person and they're taking drugs and they're doing

508
01:12:33,159 --> 01:12:40,719
this and that just ask them questions and listen and listen and listen and listen and that can be the best way to

509
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:46,360
really be supportive and then maybe regain or establish even deeper trust

510
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:54,080
that then they can will ask for and even take your advice after lots and lots of

511
01:12:54,080 --> 01:13:01,120
empathic presence so that's what's coming up for me I hope thank you I had taken the 8we seare

512
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:08,280
class about 18 months ago oh did you so the one thing when when my son and I

513
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:16,239
realized that we were following back in Old patterns a couple weeks ago I I told him I said I'm sorry that I

514
01:13:16,239 --> 01:13:22,480
haven't been an active listener because if we're if we're going to be support

515
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:29,040
for you if we're if you are going to rely on us to reach out and share your

516
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:34,880
struggles it means I have to sit in the active listen and it's hard it's hard

517
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:42,080
it's a hard the more you care the harder it is weirdly but the more it helps so yeah yeah thank you there's somebody

518
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:48,920
behind you yeah I think for the YouTube people

519
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:56,400
really want to break out and song and dance when I get this um I oh thank you you in front of

520
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:02,880
everybody I'm Ania and um I really resonate I don't know your name whoever

521
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:11,440
just spoke but I really resonate with the space that you're in but I will keep that for um after this I'm a mama too um

522
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:16,800
I wanted to share that first of all thank you it's such a good one it's such

523
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:21,840
a good one if we could just ask that the whole world stop at one moment and do it

524
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:28,639
together yeah um that said I noticed having done this before that when I got

525
01:14:28,639 --> 01:14:37,480
to my person that I felt um a little bit of resistance too

526
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:45,080
um I noticed what was going on in my body that I needed and granted if we had

527
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:52,880
done this for hours it might have dissipated but I noticed my B my body tighten in a way

528
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:58,000
that I was protecting myself m and I noticed immediately that forgiveness

529
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:05,120
floated up and I realized in order for me to be truly

530
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:13,280
connected there there were things that that needed to also be there in addition to compassion yeah and it was much

531
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:19,320
easier to step back and and be in that

532
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:25,120
space with someone I don't know yeah yeah yeah and I and I you know I can

533
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:31,320
probably analyze the heck out of that because I'm a therapist but that said um it was interesting to watch and then

534
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:39,080
just let it be there yeah yeah yeah nice really just keep opening the heart and sending the light versus really thinking

535
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:44,320
of any characteristics yeah right or wishing for them I just wanted to

536
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:51,600
envelop them in light and space nice so they could be who they were and I could be yeah right right right anyway and

537
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:58,840
sometimes even oh this is such a long we've got two minutes what do I even

538
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:05,360
say when I teach the the longer class I show this diagram that originally comes

539
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:12,320
from education and you might have seen it and there's like three concentric circles and there's the comfort zone and

540
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:18,440
the growth Zone and then sometimes called the stress zone or the overwhelm Zone and so in the

541
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:24,360
training you know whether it's 8 weeks or 90 minutes with you guys I'll kind of

542
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:29,600
introduce all the steps but then in our practice we we want to push the edge of

543
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:34,880
the comfort zone obviously if you stay in your comfort zone forever it's just the loved one and it's your bestie and

544
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:40,280
no big deal so we want to stretch into the growth Zone but not so far and

545
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:47,480
sometimes we don't know that until like you you're in the middle of the practice and you're like too much a little too or

546
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:55,080
you need to realize okay I'll just send a bunch of light out but I don't want much of a

547
01:16:55,080 --> 01:17:00,600
connection to you yet it doesn't feel safe and then there's a whole long story

548
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:06,440
about forgiveness that we often mistake forgiveness means reestablishing trust

549
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:11,639
and letting the person back into our life in the same way they were before and there's a beautiful book by Bishop

550
01:17:11,639 --> 01:17:18,960
Desmond Tutu and his daughter mafot tutu and he's like no you can choose to release the relationship create a new

551
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:24,960
boundary if the person is really not trustworthy or you just don't don't want them close but that doesn't need to

552
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:30,040
prevent your forgiveness but you're like you used to be way up here I can forgive

553
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:36,840
you but I want you out here now and I think it's our thinking that forgiveness

554
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:41,920
and reestablishing trust always go together that prevents us from

555
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:49,080
forgiveness so that's a that's an interesting thing yeah real real quick we're at time but yeah real quick to add

556
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:52,080
on

557
01:17:55,760 --> 01:18:01,040
okay YouTubes I got you um you can tell I'm old in low Tech because I don't know

558
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:06,159
how this goes just quickly wanted to say in that in our Humanity in our bodies I

559
01:18:06,159 --> 01:18:14,600
think there's a degree of safety there's an emotional safety piece and it lives in here and so even without the thought

560
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:19,840
that forgiveness means trust and and duplicating what was um there's still a

561
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:26,679
natural physiological reaction and it needs honoring yeah AB here we are thank

562
01:18:26,679 --> 01:18:32,239
you so much yeah yeah and this is yeah this would be a whole another session I

563
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:38,960
yes no doubt I'm at time and I want to finish with a poem because that's like an Insight thing isn't it I've this

564
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:44,880
Tibetan Buddhist has gotten all into poetry since I've been hanging out with you guys but there's a poem that I want

565
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:50,560
to close with and just to thank you all it's great to be here in this space with

566
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:57,320
you and thank you for engaging in that meditation and I'll be around for a while if people want to keep keep

567
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:02,760
talking I was told that's okay for me to lurk around for a while so I I'm happy

568
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:08,040
to do that and then just to close our time this is actually a poem that was

569
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:13,239
sent to me by Bob Stall who some of you may know who's the was the Insight Santa

570
01:19:13,239 --> 01:19:19,000
Cruz guiding teacher by Rosemary Wata traumer and it's called sometimes like

571
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:24,760
today we remember sometimes like today we

572
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:30,760
remember that everyone even the driver in that white Jeep who cut in front of

573
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:37,520
you yes even the elegant woman in the dairy aisle and the man who seems lost

574
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:43,199
on the library steps and the child sitting alone on the

575
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:51,440
bench yes everyone has a story fears and hopes and something to learn and someone

576
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:57,600
they love and someone who's hurt them and someone they long to

577
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:03,360
hold and though their stories are mostly invisible they're always more complex

578
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:08,440
than whatever we project and they're every bit as real as our

579
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:14,320
own the woman in the dairy AIS Smiles at you and though she is wearing diamonds

580
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:21,719
in her ears she looks lonely or is it you who is lonely is it all of

581
01:20:21,719 --> 01:20:29,080
us all of us longing for someone to truly see us and that driver you're

582
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:35,040
cursing don't we all sometimes feel as if we need to move forward any way we

583
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:42,760
can and that boy on the bench notice the empty seat beside him perhaps you could

584
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:50,080
sit there too in the sun who knows what might happen

585
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:58,800
next thank you Oh Happy Father's Day also I just

586
