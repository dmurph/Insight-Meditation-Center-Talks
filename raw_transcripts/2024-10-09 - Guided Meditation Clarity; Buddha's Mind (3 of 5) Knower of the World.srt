1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:07,200
right so this week we are touching into

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,920
various wholesome qualities during the meditations just as a way of flavoring

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:21,960
the sit and allowing these things to register in our system and then we go on

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:28,240
and do our usual meditation but maybe noticing the way evoking that quality

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,440
has some effect on the way to it goes at least that's the hope as we

6
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:42,320
explore this this week and today's quality that we'll be evoking is uh

7
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:50,280
Clarity so with that let's settle in for sitting finding a comfortable and

8
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:57,680
upright or at least straight posture and it's okay if you're sitting

9
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,000
or lying down you could also try standing or walking softly back and

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,080
forth those are all fine postures for meditation and just allowing the

11
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,920
attention to come inward closing the

12
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,159
eyes finding some sense of

13
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:30,159
centeredness in the body in the mind I find it helpful to bring bring

14
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:37,920
attention briefly to the contact points where I'm sitting so my seat against the

15
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:47,200
cushion you may be on something else legs or feet against the

16
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:54,399
floor usually there's at least three contact points and those are that's a very

17
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:02,079
stable setting so to feel that the tripod of stability wherever you're

18
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:09,039
sitting or lying and just having that feeling of

19
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:15,160
groundedness or support and allowing yourself to be

20
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,720
supported and as we have this connection to the body through feeling

21
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:37,160
resting points perhaps also bringing in a sense

22
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:45,280
of bodily presence so your body is in a particular

23
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,159
place you're sitting here in this room or maybe you're

24
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:59,519
outside but you're in this particular spot you're surrounded by some space

25
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:05,080
perhaps perhaps you're in a room or some

26
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,519
location and it's fine to sense that as the specific

27
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,000
conditions of today you're

28
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:26,360
here feeling that presence

29
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,680
and then in the mind bringing up bringing to the four as they say in the

30
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:47,319
sutas the quality of mindfulness so that's not any meant to

31
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:53,519
be anything big that you have to generate effort for it's as simple

32
00:03:53,519 --> 00:04:02,640
as if I tell you to direct your attention to your right hand see how easy it is for it to go

33
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:11,239
there so evoke mindfulness know that you're here very simple very

34
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:22,560
light and then allow that quality to remain in your awareness for for a

35
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:30,960
bit a this is what it's like to have mindfulness at this moment

36
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:40,479
mindfulness is not just one thing it's not always the

37
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:46,160
same so a further question is how is your mindfulness right

38
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,320
now sometimes mindfulness feels

39
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,639
precise sometimes it feels large and spacious

40
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:06,280
sometimes it feels soft and [Music] warm can have different character at

41
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:13,758
different times so how is it for you right

42
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,280
now and now further refining our

43
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:39,280
sense we can notice specifically the quality of clarity that naturally

44
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,400
accompanies mindfulness if we become mindful after

45
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:52,680
some period of not being so mindful it can feel like we're looking

46
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:59,639
outside through an open window pane compared to having a window there it's

47
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:05,720
it's like the window is opened and we see directly through the window

48
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:12,560
space there's a awareness will have that extra vibrancy or sharpness to it when

49
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:19,560
mindfulness is present compared to just ordinary Consciousness and

50
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,880
attention so seeing if you can notice that extra Clarity that comes when we know

51
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:34,840
that we know when we have have this additional quality of mindfulness compared to just the going through the

52
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:40,560
day we are paying attention to something because we're awake and conscious but

53
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,360
mindfulness is a little different isn't

54
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:56,639
it so that isn't meant to Tire a tie us up in anything complex it was just a

55
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,759
pointing now turning to the the breath or the body

56
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:10,199
sensing normal meditation object and allowing yourself to

57
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:15,599
rest the flow of the say the breath

58
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,440
Sensations having the sense that you know that you're meditating

59
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:43,599
time to time register the clarity of the

60
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,240
mind at a given

61
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,159
moment just allowing yourself to appreciate

62
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:02,960
that direct knowing of things as if we were seeing them with no medium

63
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:11,319
not even glass between us and them and continuing on like

64
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
this

65
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
e

66
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
e

67
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
e

68
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

69
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
e

70
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,279
e e

71
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:08,399
sensing in to the quality of clarity that is possible in the

72
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:14,839
mind maybe the act of checking helps bring up a bit more of

73
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:22,120
it without appreciating this potential of the mind to just have a

74
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:27,160
clear recognition in the moment

75
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:46,160
and it might be that experience feels unclear when you

76
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:54,480
check and we might immediately assume that the mind was dull and that

77
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:01,120
may be the case there is that certainly happens during meditation

78
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:07,839
um but there's another possibility which is that sometimes we

79
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:16,120
have a clear knowing in the mind of an object that is somewhat

80
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:21,760
vague and do you know how to distinguish those in your

81
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:30,639
practice so a mirror can have can be clear and

82
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:38,079
direct or it can have fog on it if it's in the shower bathroom and you've had a

83
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:45,440
shower now that foggy mirror does not reflect an object very well looks

84
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,399
blurry that's what we think but it's actually perfectly reflecting the

85
00:13:51,399 --> 00:14:00,120
multitude of water droplets that are stuck on it that's what they look like

86
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:08,279
so it's worth checking if we have a dull mind or if we can have a clear knowing

87
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:13,720
of a vague object because that does happen in

88
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:20,199
sitting that can be something interesting to check out around this quality of

89
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
clarity

90
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
e

91
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

92
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

93
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

94
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

95
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

96
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

97
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

98
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

99
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

100
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

101
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

102
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

103
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

104
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

105
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,520
e e

106
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:27,520
so you're invited to let it register and

107
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:33,880
appreciate that our mind can have this quality of

108
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:41,120
clarity even if it's just from time to time the

109
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:47,080
special heightened noticing that the human mind is capable

110
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,240
of is a true

111
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:59,520
gift something that can be directed in ways that are so beneficial far beyond

112
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,039
what we can

113
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:13,440
know so resting in this quality of

114
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:20,000
clarity of clear seeing that we already have and can

115
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,720
continue to

116
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
develop

117
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

118
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

119
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

120
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,278
e e

121
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:25,620
and as we will soon be going forward from the time of

122
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:30,640
[Music] meditation we can consider that this

123
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:38,039
quality of clarity brings multiple benefits into

124
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:45,240
our life our daily life and also to others one of the biggest ones is that

125
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:51,360
it's a protection so by having a clear sense of

126
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:57,840
what's happening and how we're entering into situations we're much less likely

127
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:04,320
to to say something or do something mindless that we regret

128
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:11,519
later you know there's not a 100% protection from that in the in our mind

129
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:18,960
but this Clarity really helps and I'm sure some of you have already seen that

130
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:25,799
so we can have confidence in just bringing up mindfulness this clear

131
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:32,039
seeing you know that will we remember to be kind and

132
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:38,679
to stay in line with our values for example and that protects others also

133
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:45,200
from our any any slips we might be making and then a little bit more

134
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:51,240
proactively clarity can bring us understandings that are so useful like

135
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:58,360
we could suddenly realize oh I hadn't noticed that this person uh

136
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:05,640
is nervous this person talking to me you know I had thought they were just being kind of irritating but now I can see

137
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:13,480
through that to the fact that they're actually really scared in this moment oh and so that can change how we interact

138
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:20,799
with them for example that we might not have allowed ourselves to see if we hadn't been willing to bring in that

139
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:27,480
extra Clarity so there's a way in which we're protected and also a way in which we can

140
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:34,799
proactive notice things and then act from that new knowledge and it's a refinement we may

141
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:42,799
not have seen everything yet but if we're willing to keep seeing with Clarity more and more will be

142
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:49,720
revealed so having confidence in this mindfulness that we're cultivating as we

143
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:56,360
go forward and wishing that all beings can benefit

144
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:02,240
in some way from our on ongoing awareness and Clarity of

145
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,640
Mind may all beings be happy

146
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:14,640
peaceful and may they come to see more and more in their lives and may we in

147
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,159
some way help that through our practice

148
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:03,960
so we'll continue on this week with our exploration of the attributes or

149
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:09,840
epithets of the Buddha and I've decided to be more precise and say that there are 10 of

150
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:18,720
them to imprint that into your memory there are 10 budha gunas um only nine technically in the

151
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:27,399
formal recollection that's done not to leave you hanging by the way uh the extra one is tagata which um some I'm

152
00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:32,679
sure many of you have heard as a name for the Buddha it's actually traditionally the first one and then

153
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:39,399
there are these other nine for some reason the tataga is not part is not included in the reflection maybe we'll

154
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:44,679
touch on it on Friday seems to fit in there but don't worry about it if you

155
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:52,039
contemplate nine or 10 qualities it's equally good so the 10 the 10 Buddha

156
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:58,360
gunas and today is the day when we'll uh talk about just one of them

157
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:05,519
uh the fifth we've already done the first four and the fifth quality of the

158
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:15,039
Buddha's awakened mind is said to be loca vdu loca vdu uh Loca is the world

159
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:22,279
and Vu is has to do with seeing so it's usually called nowh of the world

160
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:28,159
translated as nowhere of the world or we could even say nowh of the Worlds the

161
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:33,600
word is not plural but um there's a lot of different worlds that we'll talk

162
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:41,840
through that the the Buddha has clear knowledge of clear seeing and this quality I remember I

163
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:49,159
said at the beginning the order of these um traits or epithets is not arbitrary

164
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:55,559
they do have kind of a sequence so we've talked about how the Buddha's mind is

165
00:32:55,559 --> 00:33:04,519
completely wholesome free of grief hatred and delusion and that he's able to manifest that understanding through

166
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:12,200
Clarity and um accomplishment is what it says in knowledge and conduct in how he

167
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:18,600
is in world so he manifests that in his way of being and then also that that the

168
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:23,960
result of that is that he is always happy uh he's never separated from the

169
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:29,039
peace and happiness is almost to light of a

170
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:35,480
word of nibana and but nonetheless nothing can shake his mind things that

171
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:41,320
happen he's able to just flow with those be with them in a Wholesome Way all the

172
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:46,840
craziness of the world that the Buddha emerged back into after his Awakening uh

173
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:52,159
it couldn't throw his mind off so that was sugat the happiness of the

174
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:59,440
Buddha and then what emerges from that is that he can see very clear l so his

175
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:07,679
mind is not thrown off by things it's not colored by carrying a lot of fixed views and it's not reactive about what's

176
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:13,800
going on whenever he turns his mind toward what he's seeing he can know

177
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:20,079
clearly what that's about and this is a beautiful quality so

178
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:25,280
uh his own pure mind excellent conduct and inner peace allow him to look with

179
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:31,720
clear eyes at the world and he decided to do that he decided to under really

180
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:37,800
understand um what's going on here we can consider this for ourselves too is

181
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:44,800
that you know many of us have some interest in understanding the mind the body how psychology works how

182
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:55,320
relationships work how is this world you what's going on in this world that we got born into somehow so the um maybe by

183
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:00,599
understanding this list we can understand that it's a good idea to practice and find

184
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:07,760
some measure of happiness and uh Good Conduct in ourselves and inner peace in

185
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:13,520
order to really know what's going on in the world not to trust our assumptions

186
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:20,960
based on a reactive mind and similarly if we have some idea that we want to help the world we we might want to do

187
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:28,880
some practice first and really get ourselves grounded so that we can see clearly and know how to help so this

188
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:35,480
quality is where the Buddha looks out and gets it so that he knows what to do

189
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:43,480
that'll come later so what are the worlds quote unquote that the Buddha could see could

190
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:51,000
know in the broadest sense what he looked at was natural laws in nature he

191
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,920
saw that the universe is not random in how it is unfolding

192
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:06,160
um there's a a wonderful idea actually from Western philosophy of um Cosmos and

193
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:15,160
Chaos I don't know if you've heard that pair there was a wonderful TV show in the 70s called Cosmos with Carl Sean and

194
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:21,960
um uh essentially chaos we know what that is right Randomness disorder of

195
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:28,640
various kinds and it can feel like that in the mind when things are not organized or clear

196
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:33,960
but Cosmos is kind of the the idea that the Universe has organizing principles

197
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:40,160
behind it there is a wholeness going on here and if we if we're not clear then

198
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:47,480
we see chaos but there is behind it a cosmos A sense of unity of wholeness so

199
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:53,000
the Buddha could see that he could know the dhma the word dhama the biggest sense of

200
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,640
it is the lawfulness of what's going on most comprehensively is teaching that

201
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,960
lawfulness who was the law of dependent arising so understanding the causes and

202
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:10,760
conditions are what bring about basically everything um sometimes they're going in a wholesome Direction

203
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:18,000
and we're building a path sometimes the causes and conditions are creating samsara the wandering on of more and

204
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,200
more suffering because we're not seeing clearly but um you know for us we get

205
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:31,280
little glimpses of how conditions come together and we suddenly have insights into how things work but imagine that a

206
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:40,000
mind that could comprehend all of that to be clear the Buddha wasn't omnicient he didn't see all of that all the time U

207
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,079
he still had a human mind but anytime he directed his mind toward understanding a

208
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:50,520
certain aspect of life he could I think it's important to say that he's not

209
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:58,520
considered omniscient in the early teachings um there's a suta that says um

210
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:04,680
whether or not there is an arising of tagas of Buddhas there is this

211
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:11,560
regularity of the dhama he goes on to say more about that but essentially says that the lawfulness

212
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:18,680
of the universe is independent of whether or not there's a Buddha to know it so that's a pretty profound statement

213
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:24,839
you know there is there is a lawfulness here and luckily for us there are people

214
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:30,920
who arise from time to time who are able to see it and that's the case for a Buddha for

215
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:39,040
example so this is I I find this tremendously um comforting in some way

216
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:46,000
supportive to know that in the background and the degree to which I can just barely Glimpse pieces of it in my

217
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,200
practice I find very nourishing and uh is a form of Refuge for me and I hope

218
00:38:52,200 --> 00:39:00,599
maybe you can touch into that also it's kind of an idea that's evoked from this local of you do knower of the

219
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:08,200
world so other things to say about this knowing is that um the Buddha didn't

220
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:15,400
know only you know when we talk about lawfulness in our Western some of you

221
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:21,079
are Western uh understanding there's a kind of a sense of going to physics or

222
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:27,480
biology you know the physical the understanding of the physical world the law of gravity the law of Electro

223
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:34,839
magnetism the laws of chemistry that are flowing in our bodies and those are all true those are all they're even named in

224
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:42,440
the commentaries as things that the Buddha knows um but in addition the the Buddha knew the how the mind works of

225
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:49,040
course that's really the key for understanding suffering um I started out my own

226
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:55,680
training in physics due to a love of Nature and at some point I realized that

227
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:01,400
as beautiful and wonderful as was and inspiring really uh it didn't address my

228
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:06,560
deepest questions about Dua and uh that was something I had to sort of

229
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:13,680
articulate later and then I could expand into deeper understandings so we have

230
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:20,599
also understandings of the psychological world how the mind functions you the mental world and maybe most importantly

231
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:27,440
the Buddha understands how Karma functions so how intentional actions that are done by beings who can inform

232
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:35,960
form intentions how that unfolds into uh greater suffering or a path toward peace

233
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:44,400
and um this is the understanding again of the lawfulness of the dhamma um in the sutas the world Loca

234
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:50,599
literally says is defined as the six sense spheres and their objects so it

235
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:58,160
says you know the the eye and seeing the eye and forms the ear and sounds no and

236
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:04,400
sense the tongue and tastes the body and tangible things and the mind and mental

237
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,960
objects that is the world that is it for us that's what we can

238
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:16,560
experience and to understand how all of that works how it's interrelated how the

239
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:22,960
mind arises together with an object all of this is um and of what the you know

240
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:28,359
the realm of what the Buddha could understand and you can imagine oh yeah that you would need to know all of that

241
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:33,960
in order to not have any suffering in mind so none of that was outside of what

242
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:39,280
of what you could know and therefore you couldn't be fooled by any of

243
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:46,119
that so then we can say more specifically what the Buddha knew is how suffering works and that was what you

244
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:52,880
know he maybe he knew the whole six sense speres but what he taught was then this handful of leaves here's how this

245
00:41:52,880 --> 00:42:00,200
leads to your entanglement and here's how it it cannot this is is where it starts getting practical into what how

246
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:05,880
we can apply this particular quality of the Buddha

247
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:14,079
so um one thing that we do in our minds you may have noticed is create worlds we

248
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:19,359
create views of things we create our understanding of oh this is what's going

249
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:24,960
on or this is how I am or this is how the world is or should be and then we

250
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:31,240
act from that view from that picture that orientation and one very important thing

251
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:36,640
to start understanding in practice is how those views come together they're

252
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:45,280
not actually absolute truths and they're not um random they're created out of

253
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:51,640
conditions partial understandings that we have conditions of the moment physical and mental feelings that we

254
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:57,760
have are are very important in forming our views so we can observe this

255
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:03,480
one thing that we can do in meditation um is we can sit and watch the mind

256
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:09,760
let's say we're being mindful the flow of experience Sensations in the body and

257
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:15,640
mind are arising we're noticing them I have seen at times the Mind start to

258
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:21,599
move toward having a thought or having a view you know like for example a a pain

259
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:28,400
arises in my back and the thought comes oh maybe maybe that's because of all

260
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:35,040
that hiking I did yesterday and I can feel my mind starting to form a picture

261
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:42,040
like oh maybe the amount of hiking I did should be set in my mind as the limit I

262
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:48,079
shouldn't hike more than that many miles because otherwise my back is going to hurt you know we we're creating suddenly

263
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:54,720
an understanding a world out of what a pain a feeling but just one sensation in

264
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:00,000
the back starts forming this world view and we can see it like a little bubble

265
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:07,319
uh kind of getting coming into creation and usually what we do is we say great I'm going into that and we we jump in

266
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:15,000
and we become the person in that world the person who's going to decide I can't hike more than x miles or kilometers

267
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:21,800
because my back's going to hurt and I don't want to hurt my back and we become that and it's great it feels comfortable

268
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:27,720
we get to be that person but what if we hadn't gone into that bubble we just saw

269
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:34,280
it as oh there's a thought arising tempting to go in and do that but I'm not going to go do that wait for the

270
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:42,160
next moment to arise stay with mindfulness stay with the present moment so the knower of the worlds is someone

271
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:48,680
who knows when a world is coming into being and decides no thank you I'm not

272
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:53,839
going to jump into that world or um you know I'm just going to see it as one

273
00:44:53,839 --> 00:45:00,400
more formation and let that bubble go on in daily life we can observe the same

274
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:06,280
thing it's not as clear as it is during the flow in our meditation or we have a lot of

275
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:11,640
mindfulness but uh we can also observe that we're living in certain stories or

276
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:16,760
we can sometimes observe other people have views about things like our friend

277
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:23,520
comes and talks to us about I have this problem this and that is happening and we can see very clearly oh it's all

278
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:29,880
because they believe such and such and if they didn't believe that they wouldn't be making this into something

279
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:37,119
that they're so anxious about and you know then there's a question about how we say that or don't depending on our

280
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:42,160
relationship with the person and we may not be right in our perception but

281
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:48,040
nonetheless um I want to suggest that this idea of observing the views the

282
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:54,920
worlds that we create with our stories is one very important way to avoid

283
00:45:54,920 --> 00:46:03,559
falling into suffering and avoid falling falling into the enactment of so many of the selves that we think ourselves to be

284
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:08,599
so um this is really worth seeing maybe

285
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:15,119
I'll just give one more little example um which is that I one time went to both

286
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:20,839
a western doctor and an acupuncturist for the same physical issue that I was

287
00:46:20,839 --> 00:46:28,720
having the same problem with my body and it was a totally different World in each

288
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:34,480
case right the tests that they do the questions that they ask the views that

289
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:39,920
they bring in to decide how you might be helped with this particular problem it

290
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:46,040
was like it was two different worlds and they could not they almost didn't overlap and it was great I actually

291
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:53,079
benefited from both of them but I could see so clearly that each person that I

292
00:46:53,079 --> 00:47:00,760
spoke with was acting within a realm of understanding understanding it was limiting and describing defining what

293
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:06,599
they would see and what they would put their attention in and it's so interesting to see that in others and

294
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:15,359
have kind of a sense about it much harder to see it in ourselves but it's operating in the same way so this seeing

295
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:20,880
of the worlds is so important for understanding our suffering and then

296
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:27,880
bringing it back to the Buddha here at the end it's also a big part of the Buddha's ability to teach the ability to

297
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:34,000
guide people out of their suffering so this is a transitional quality the Loca

298
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:41,640
Vu is a transition from qualities of the Buddha's own awakened mind that he experienced internally then he sees the

299
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:47,400
worlds and how they work and then there's a way in which he can act from

300
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:53,319
that uh to help the rest of us and that's what we'll talk about tomorrow so

301
00:47:53,319 --> 00:47:56,720
thank you all
