1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,559
so

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,080
before we move into the talk

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,120
i would like to make a few announcements

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,760
and first

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,720
is that

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,800
that on friday i said i would post we

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,120
would post

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,200
some of the things that i read last week

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,760
the simile for the

10
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,840
jhanas for the states of absorption

11
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,160
samadhi

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,960
and also i posted the little passage

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,559
from the buddha's teachings

14
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,600
with the 16 steps of anapanasati

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,199
and the easy place to find that is at

16
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,160
on imc's homepage on the home page

17
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,719
there's a little

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,600
in the bottom right corner in what's new

19
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,080
section and in there there's a little

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,720
line for reflections from gil

21
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,360
and in there that's where you'll find

22
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,080
those

23
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,720
passages and

24
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,560
and the other is that next week so

25
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,479
starting from next monday

26
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,600
the plan is to have for one week have

27
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,439
these early morning sittings

28
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,240
be 45 minutes meditation be 45 minutes

29
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,079
rather than 30 minutes

30
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,799
and we'll start 15 minutes early so

31
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,240
we'll start at

32
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,159
you know whatever time your time zone is

33
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,960
15 minutes before the hour

34
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,079
in california at 6 45

35
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,640
and um you're welcome to join at 7 if

36
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,040
that early time doesn't work for you

37
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,000
just that you know you should probably

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,200
um

39
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,520
tiptoe into the meditation room when you

40
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,680
when you join us

41
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,719
and um and the reason for this

42
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,240
longer sitting is i think that it would

43
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,320
be after all this time of sitting some

44
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,600
of you've been sitting for months this

45
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,200
way with me in the morning

46
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,520
i feel like we're kind of deepening and

47
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,800
going further

48
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,480
and to be able to sit longer is one of

49
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,400
the ways to

50
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,480
experience more the benefits of this

51
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,080
path to kind of let it unfold more

52
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,040
deeply in the course of of the sitting

53
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,319
so we'll try it next week and maybe in a

54
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,760
few weeks we'll do it again

55
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:37,840
next time i do a retreat

56
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,840
so

57
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,480
so the uh the ana panasati practice

58
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,840
involves 16 steps of mindfulness of

59
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,200
breathing in and mindfulness of

60
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,879
breathing out

61
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,080
and the eighth step between the eighth

62
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,920
and ninth there's kind of a transition

63
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,720
that goes on and the transition is we go

64
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,920
into the ninth

65
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,680
we we're staying in the first eight aid

66
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,080
we're still staying very closely in

67
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,680
intimately involved

68
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,799
with our embodied experience

69
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,239
and and then that's always a foundation

70
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,040
for the

71
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,080
the second eighth but now we're in the

72
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,440
second eighth we're going to open up

73
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,560
more to the

74
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,840
uh realm of experience which maybe is

75
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,280
not so

76
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,599
directly related to the body it's a work

77
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,760
related to the mind

78
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,519
and and so we're still in this

79
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,400
body section um of the first half

80
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,640
and so in the first tetrad

81
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,280
it's about just learning to develop a

82
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,000
continuity

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,760
with the breathing and beginning to

84
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,159
experience and sense the body

85
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,159
and the and especially how the body is

86
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,920
activated by the mind

87
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,319
the tensions of the body and to learn to

88
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,480
relax that

89
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,879
as that relaxes it frees up a good kind

90
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,720
of energy in the body

91
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,440
and as the concentration deepens it also

92
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,800
awakens a kind of um

93
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,560
meditative joy and happiness well-being

94
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,680
that comes with calmness subtleness uh

95
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,600
contentment that comes just sitting here

96
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
and being here

97
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,520
and with that as a foundation certain

98
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,759
kind of meditative well-being

99
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,800
it's only then that this instructions

100
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,360
then

101
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,080
is opens up to becoming aware

102
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,319
of

103
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,280
becoming aware of

104
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,639
aspects of the mind and uh

105
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,080
so in the step seven the instructions

106
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,520
are breathing in

107
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,560
one experiences the

108
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,000
mental formation breathing out

109
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,919
one experiences the mental formation

110
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,160
so a few things about this the word

111
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,280
experience

112
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,080
the poly word for it as maybe the

113
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,919
english does

114
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,720
has a lot to do with the uh the physical

115
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,199
direct experience of the sensation

116
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,199
and it's almost like this word that's

117
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,880
translated as experience

118
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,080
could be translated as one senses

119
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,199
when senses for oneself

120
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,560
the sensations of the mind of the mental

121
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,840
formation

122
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,000
and here it's a singular the mental

123
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,360
formation

124
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,280
so it's not necessarily going and

125
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,520
looking at the detail little detailed

126
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,520
aspects of

127
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,639
the mental formation but the whole

128
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,800
the whole thing somehow how it's

129
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,639
experienced

130
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,680
so the mental formation are

131
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,160
those experiences associated with the

132
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,720
mind mental activity

133
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,440
that we can sense and feel so it's the

134
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,280
mental activity

135
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,479
that has some impact

136
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,520
on the body that senses

137
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,199
i think of sensation as being very much

138
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,800
part of the body

139
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,160
and and so the sensations of the mind

140
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,280
also

141
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,440
so it could be for example something is

142
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,880
clearly physical

143
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,440
that if we're afraid our shoulders might

144
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,000
be up it may be tense and tight

145
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,360
and that's a physical formation but if

146
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,080
our

147
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,039
if we're if we're afraid and our mind

148
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,560
feels contracted

149
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,600
feels small or tight that's the mental

150
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,360
formations the mental

151
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,960
expression of the fear

152
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,080
of that activated state so it's feeling

153
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,560
the mental activity

154
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,360
so if particularly associated with

155
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,319
thinking

156
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,720
if we're thinking very intensely we

157
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,160
might feel it physically as

158
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,160
you know maybe the forehead is all

159
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,360
bunched up and

160
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,680
scrunched together and that would be the

161
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,280
bodily formation

162
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,680
but if you look kind of more deeply into

163
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,400
the area around where we're thinking

164
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,080
if we think in the area of the brain for

165
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,160
example you might feel that kind of

166
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,160
behind the forehead

167
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,160
in this in the area of the brain that's

168
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,400
not particularly associated with muscles

169
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,759
that are

170
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,680
tightened up there's still sensations

171
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,639
there's might be a feeling of

172
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,639
contraction there might be a headache

173
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,199
there might be

174
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,240
agitation there might be a sense of

175
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,720
pressure or pushing they might sometimes

176
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,160
i feel like there's a magnetic

177
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,360
pull gravitational pull

178
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,360
for me towards thinking or thinking

179
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,039
towards me

180
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,800
and there's something that feels like a

181
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,080
pull or

182
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,759
a tug going on that's

183
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,240
in relationship to the thoughts there's

184
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,199
a leaning in

185
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,840
in the mind sometimes the center of

186
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,680
gravity of my thinking

187
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,879
is a little bit ahead of my body

188
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,319
somehow i'm like i'm leaning forward

189
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,960
into the future a little bit

190
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,599
so it's possible to start feeling

191
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:18,639
something that

192
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,479
resembles or is sensation like

193
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,960
associated with the mental activity we

194
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,000
do

195
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,840
and that's those are the called mental

196
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,280
the mental formations

197
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,360
the mental activities that we can feel

198
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,680
and um and so then um

199
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,159
the um so what's interesting here

200
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,800
is a variety of things is certainly we

201
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,320
have a lot of mental activity let's look

202
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,680
at thinking for example

203
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,800
thinking is a mental activity and the

204
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,240
instructions here are to

205
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,880
feel that physical the kind of the

206
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,080
physical experience of thinking

207
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,920
and and it's only feeling the feeling it

208
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,080
it's not thinking better or

209
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,920
understanding what we're thinking or

210
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,240
analyzing what we're thinking

211
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,880
it's not about recognizing even what

212
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,399
we're thinking

213
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,360
it's simply recognizing the physicality

214
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,600
or the sensation level

215
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,640
of the thinking itself so

216
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,720
in the shorthand i like to think of this

217
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,399
as feeling the

218
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,399
the um the thinking muscle

219
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,839
and um and so the ways in which we feel

220
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,959
i'm thinking it feels uh energetic or

221
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,040
tight or constricted

222
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,240
or there's pressure or there's a hurry

223
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,600
or there's a kind of

224
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,640
low energy there's sometimes it feels

225
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,480
swampy in the mind it can't

226
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,560
lack of clarity there's um uh

227
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,760
so so a whole realm of things that are

228
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,640
how it feels for us as opposed to what

229
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,560
it's about

230
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,040
and partly this is a wonderful support

231
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,399
and aid

232
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,200
to not get caught up with permission

233
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,560
during meditation

234
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,800
to not have to fix our thoughts fix the

235
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,079
world

236
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,000
understand what's going on analyze

237
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,279
what's going on

238
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,680
we're here we're only asked to feel it

239
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,760
and feel an aspect of what the mind is

240
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,000
doing the mind is very important

241
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,399
but a particular aspect which is the

242
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,480
sensation level of it

243
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,000
so we're connected to it but we're not

244
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,560
being pulled into the storyline in a

245
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,320
sense

246
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,519
and so and and we're trying to do this

247
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,880
based on the foundation of the of

248
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,000
um step

249
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,040
five and six which is feeling this

250
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,399
sense of well-being so until we have

251
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,480
some feeling of well-being

252
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,880
then we don't really start actively

253
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,160
taking in

254
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,040
what is going on in the mind what the

255
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,200
mental activity is about

256
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,680
perhaps so that there's a container

257
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,160
there's a context of well-being

258
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,079
for looking at an area of our life which

259
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,399
is often quite difficult

260
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,959
and so we're not you know trying to do a

261
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,560
spiritual bypass we're not trying to

262
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,680
avoid

263
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,720
our inner suffering or challenges that

264
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,920
we have

265
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,279
but maybe we're touching it with um

266
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,800
a breath with an awareness with a

267
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,839
with emotions that are supportive

268
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,839
that have a goodness to them that have a

269
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,120
calmness or

270
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,680
kindness in them that have a kind of

271
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,440
generosity to them

272
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,519
some something like that it's on the

273
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,279
building on the foundation of what's

274
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,399
been done earlier

275
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,120
in these these steps of mindfulness of

276
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,959
breathing

277
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,519
and so the context for becoming now

278
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,920
aware of the mental activity

279
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,600
is one of kindness of goodwill

280
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,279
or even joy

281
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,279
it's one of the great maybe peridot

282
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,720
wonderful paradoxes

283
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,519
when i first discovered it that one can

284
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,959
exp one can experience

285
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,040
suffering in oneself and suffering in

286
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,160
the world

287
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,680
and at the same time have a lot of joy

288
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,480
and in fact my ability to go deeply into

289
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,480
the practice of vipassana

290
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,079
where there are times we experience a

291
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,639
lot of our personal suffering

292
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,200
was it was supported by having

293
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,440
cultivated meditative joy

294
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,839
that could hold that suffering so it

295
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,360
isn't one or the other

296
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,120
but it can be both there and all this

297
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,320
involves a disidentification from

298
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,880
being locked in or overly preoccupied

299
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,360
with what we're thinking and what we're

300
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,279
emoting and doing like that

301
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,000
so that we can just hold it and be

302
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,680
present for it in a different way than

303
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,279
we usually are

304
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,760
and that's one of the opportunities here

305
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,959
with uh

306
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,920
with with um

307
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,160
this anapanasati is mindfulness of

308
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,519
breathing

309
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,200
so breathing in one experiences

310
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,160
the mental formation one isn't even

311
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,399
trying to parse out the details of it

312
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,320
just the whole gestalt the global

313
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,000
feeling the sensations of what they're

314
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,839
going on in the mind

315
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,839
breathing out one experience of the

316
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,200
mental formation and and then because

317
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,440
we're breathing in and breathing out

318
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,079
this is again like a support for not

319
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,920
getting wrapped up in not being caught

320
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,800
by

321
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
as long as the breathing stays relaxed

322
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,120
and smooth we tend to have a more

323
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,920
open freer relationship to what we're

324
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,639
including

325
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,839
in that awareness to what we're

326
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,680
accompanying with the breathing

327
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,639
so i hope that makes sense uh and we'll

328
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,959
do more of this over the next few days

329
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,880
so if it didn't make full sense don't

330
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,040
worry about it too much and

331
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,920
and just maybe there's just enough that

332
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,519
when i go on for the next days and

333
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,160
become clearer

334
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,480
so so for now

335
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,360
maybe you can spend the day this next 24

336
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,320
hours

337
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,880
reflecting practicing this idea of

338
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,399
accompaniment

339
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,480
that we're accompanying things we're

340
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,160
accompanying ourselves

341
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,639
we're accompanying our hearts our minds

342
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,720
and we're accompanying other people

343
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,519
what does that mean to be a companion

344
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,199
that way

345
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,440
so thank you and i look forward to

346
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:38,959
tomorrow
