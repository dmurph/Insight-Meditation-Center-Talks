1
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:16,840
good evening everyone as I mentioned at the beginning of the sit um Diana's off teaching a

2
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:22,920
retreat so I'll be filling in for her tonight my name is Jim

3
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:30,039
pulski um if you've been following the talk

4
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:35,480
over the last maybe five or six weeks Diana's been talking about some of the

5
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:42,879
characteristics or um qualities that are required

6
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:48,760
to uh achieve a goal you know what what things you need if you really want to

7
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:56,879
achieve something um I think in particular she's talking about achieving uh freedom from

8
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,359
suffering you know freedom from greed delusion and

9
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:08,400
hatred a sense of Peace sense of

10
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,240
calm and one of the elements one of those five elements she talked about was

11
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:21,439
uh energy or effort that it it takes some uh energy or effort if you want to

12
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:27,119
accomplish something she often reads some poetry I

13
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:34,799
don't have any but when I think about a song that I know from my youth um you

14
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,720
won't get it wishing and a hoping thinking and a praying so just wishing and hoping and

15
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:47,920
thinking and praying won't get you uh to where you want to go it does

16
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:54,560
take effort

17
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,520
um the the Buddha's primary teachings about how to do this are encompassed in

18
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,799
what's known as the eight-fold path and one of them is called right

19
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:13,520
effort or wise effort or skillful effort um and so that's what I want to

20
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:21,440
talk about tonight it just so happens that IMC has a nine-month program about

21
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,280
the eight-fold path and this month actually this coming Sunday there'll be

22
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,000
a a half day uh event here all about uh

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,920
right effort so if you're interested in finding out more about this uh it's

24
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:47,360
available both in person and online um but it's the

25
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,480
first first of the three elements of the path having to do with uh cultivating

26
00:02:53,480 --> 00:03:00,440
heart and mind so one of the books for that class

27
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:08,159
is this one called the eight mindful steps of Happiness by bonti

28
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,560
gunaratna and I've read it uh a couple of times in fact I was just going

29
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,720
through the chapter uh on uh right

30
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:27,159
effort um over the weekend uh in preparation for this

31
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:31,680
Sunday and

32
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:41,439
it's it's part of the practice that isn't well I don't think any of the

33
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:46,480
practice is relegated to just the times when you're doing formal sitting

34
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,560
practice but uh right effort is definitely something that you can do

35
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,680
throughout the day as long as you're awake

36
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,799
conscious um it's a way to

37
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:14,239
cultivate uh states of heart and mind that are skillful for achieving freedom

38
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:25,320
from suffering and for um weeding out those states that

39
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,520
um aren't helpful so uh skillful effort you could

40
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:39,160
think of as a little bit of way of um mental

41
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,880
gardening it's how do you how do you water and nourish

42
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:52,240
and um tend to those things that you want to grow and how do you uh uproot

43
00:04:52,240 --> 00:05:01,560
the weeds the things that um get in way that sap the energy from your garden

44
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,000
so there's four skillful

45
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,080
efforts the first one is um preventing the arising of

46
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:23,560
unisen negative states of mind so if you can catch if you can

47
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:31,120
catch yourself before one of these things arises um

48
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,280
then you don't have to go through and experience

49
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:45,638
that it's easier said than done so the second one is

50
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:53,639
um is abandoning Arisen unskillful states of mind so once

51
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:58,840
they're there what do you do what do you do with

52
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:04,479
them uh the third skillful effort

53
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:10,360
is um

54
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:18,000
is bringing into being unisen skillful States so how do you cultivate how do

55
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,919
you uh recognize that this might be a time where you can bring forth a

56
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:30,120
wholesome State how would you do that and then

57
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:37,240
the fourth one is maintaining an Arisen wholesome state so once it's Arisen what

58
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:44,880
do you do to keep it going so I'll share some of the things

59
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:51,160
that uh Bounty good aratana has written uh and some of the things that

60
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:57,800
over the years I've um acquired either from other teachers or from direct

61
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:04,879
experience you know what works for doing this uh preventing the

62
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:12,919
UNH wholesome abandoning the UNH whome once it's Arisen uh bringing into being unisen

63
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:22,000
wholesome and maintaining the wholesome so the first thing would be

64
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,319
knowing what are these like how do you know what what are wholesome and what are UNH

65
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
wholesome

66
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:41,720
the at a deep deep level there's these it said the the

67
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:49,240
Buddha said there are these 10 Fetters there's these 10 habits of mind and

68
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:57,720
perception that keep us FedEd to suffering keep

69
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,319
us um

70
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:10,440
you know kind of not really seeing things clearly

71
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:17,159
um and those are things that take some period of time I would

72
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:24,440
imagine years or decades although some people maybe it's only days or weeks but

73
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:30,319
I I suspect for most it's it's a long-term practice to see these these

74
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:36,479
feds and um uproot them in the shorter

75
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,640
term the um there's

76
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:47,959
five uh conditions or five uh activities of

77
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:55,440
the Mind called the hindrances which are described as the intense gross manifestations of the

78
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:03,720
feds so I'm guessing at least some of you have heard heard of the the five

79
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:10,200
hindrances um if you haven't there's this wonderful book that Gil fransal

80
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:16,399
wrote a few years ago called unfettered that descri both describes them and

81
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:25,040
describes particular practices you might do to um work with them get get to know

82
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,800
them and over time uh uh reduce them or

83
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:40,079
get free of them so the the five feds the first one

84
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:46,279
is um greed or lust

85
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:53,519
so I would imagine most people would have some notion on what that is you know that it isn't just desire it isn't

86
00:09:53,519 --> 00:10:00,560
just wanting but it's that maybe compulsive obsessive

87
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:08,320
uh grasping after something often a sense experience but it could also be um

88
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:15,240
an object or it might be some kind of identity you know some way that you want to be

89
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:24,880
seen and so that's one of the hindrances that kind of distorts our perception of

90
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:32,800
what's going on you know everything is kind of colored or flavored by that

91
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:41,600
hindrance and so it's one place to start is not by saying

92
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:48,160
okay I'm never gonna I'm never gonna lust again I'm never goingon to have greet again but

93
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:54,519
rather to really get to know it get familiar with it how does you know how does it

94
00:10:54,519 --> 00:11:01,519
feel um and what are the

95
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,200
conditions under which it

96
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:12,440
arises so knowing knowing that is very

97
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:18,760
helpful in doing this practice um I I'll say essential I mean

98
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:26,600
I I don't think that you can say I'm I'm going to practice the Buddhist

99
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:32,040
path and become enlightened but I'm not going to look at greed and

100
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:37,680
lust it's it's there so you might as well make a you know kind of a conscious

101
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:46,200
decision that that's something to look at the second one is

102
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:55,360
uh uh sometimes called um aversion or ill will hatred you know that movement

103
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,959
towards pushing away um

104
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:09,079
but pushing in away in an unskillful way either not not

105
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:15,279
acknowledging that it's operating

106
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:26,639
um you know or or having some kind of Judgment of or

107
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:35,639
opinion about either some sense desire or some person or some object or some

108
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:41,839
identity that you're trying to get rid of that

109
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:47,120
um you know doesn't well that you're trying to get

110
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,279
rid of by Contracting your mind around rather than looking at it carefully just

111
00:12:53,279 --> 00:13:00,839
there's some contraction and some pushing and not really acknowledging

112
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:11,160
so those are the first two hindrances they're probably the uh often the strongest the third

113
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:19,199
hindrance is actually described as a pair of hindrances um sloth and torper now those

114
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:25,680
are words that I suspect none of you use in everyday language it's kind of Old

115
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:33,040
English what they point at is a certain sluggishness a certain

116
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:40,320
dullness a certain um kind of low energy that's either in

117
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:47,040
the body or in the mind so the two one refers to sluggishness of the body one

118
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,360
refers to sluggishness of the mind and when

119
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,759
you're um when those are operating you know it's kind of

120
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,920
like you know trying to walk through a thick mud or something you know it's

121
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:08,320
just it's it's very slowo and

122
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:15,800
um hard to see clearly so that's often referred to as

123
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:22,000
sinking energy the fourth hindrance

124
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,680
is um restlessness and worry so again it's a pair kind of like sloth and

125
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:33,320
torper it's energy that's fairly high energy

126
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:40,600
but scattered so restlessness is a physical manifestation of that kind of

127
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:46,600
uh scattered energy and uh worry is the

128
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:53,639
mental manifestation of that scattered energy so it's

129
00:14:53,639 --> 00:15:00,639
not just that there's a lot of energy there it's also that it's it's really kind of of all over the

130
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:06,560
place it's not collected it's not

131
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:17,839
unified and then the fifth hindrance is doubt

132
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,320
um I've tried to come up with a way a good way for myself to understand that

133
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:34,279
one and I think one way to describe it is a tendency to just keep self second

134
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:40,959
guessing yourself like oh should I do this well no maybe I should do it this way know me you know it's it's kind of

135
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:46,800
like never centering on

136
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:53,519
one um one track now it isn't that it isn't useful

137
00:15:53,519 --> 00:16:00,000
there there's times when you have to say okay I've I've been I've been following a certain path and this doesn't look

138
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,160
right so it's it's time to maybe try something different but when the mind is continually jumping

139
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,880
around um always second guessing itself that's

140
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:18,720
that's one way to describe doubt and when that's happening then it's hard to

141
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:26,480
be mindful you know it's like well what's going on right now no you know maybe this is maybe this is sloth maybe

142
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:35,759
this is uh aversion so those are the the five

143
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:44,360
hindrances um ill will uh no sorry uh lust ill will sloth

144
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:50,880
and torper uh restlessness and worry and doubt and within and you can think of

145
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,120
those as sort of like a basis set that all the

146
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:04,720
other um descriptions of unh wholesome mind States kind of fit

147
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,600
within one of those five categories

148
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:20,319
so so it's it's helpful to in starting this to become familiar with the

149
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:25,399
hindrances get to know them particularly how they work for

150
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:34,880
you um so if we move from so the hindrances are

151
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:45,480
really what you're going to be looking for in the first two uh elements of of um right

152
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:53,679
effort and so to prevent the arising of

153
00:17:53,679 --> 00:18:00,400
unisen H UNH wholesome mind States it's helpful to know

154
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:08,120
what are the conditions what are the triggers what how can I recognize

155
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:15,360
that an UNH wholesome mind state lies ahead and do something

156
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:21,360
differently um the example that came to my mind was

157
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:27,320
I've now been managing here at IMC on Monday nights for 25

158
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:33,000
years and I live in Mountain View so I've always had to drive on Highway 101

159
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,760
to get here in the early evening and for many years I would get

160
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:45,640
on the freeway I'd drive a couple tents of a mile and then the traffic would just stop it's right where Highway

161
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:52,960
85 comes into 101 and I would immediately feel

162
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:59,720
frustration and you know a sense of um

163
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:06,280
you know why is this happening to me

164
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,159
and over time you know it suddenly dawned to me well number one I'd often

165
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:20,360
have not eaten supper so my blood sugar was low I was kind of tired low

166
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:28,559
energy um I'd often try to cut it close you

167
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,919
know like not leave any earlier than I had to so then

168
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:42,679
if there was any hold up I'd be feeling anxious about getting there so there were some conditions that I recognized

169
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:50,880
that um I had control over you know things that I could do in terms of eating in

170
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,480
terms of timing

171
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,520
um other things that I didn't have any control over and then the other thing

172
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,919
that I had some influence over was

173
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:15,960
um how I related to the experience that was going on when I looked at it as

174
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:21,679
something bad happening to me it would really cause suffering you

175
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:27,159
know it's like it's like these people are sitting in their cars why aren't

176
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:33,240
they driving you know and you know don't they know I need to be

177
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:39,320
somewhere so one of the things that I found was changing my attitude towards

178
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:46,679
the whole experience of okay this is this is an opportunity to practice

179
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:52,840
patience or this is an opportunity to feel compassion for all the other

180
00:20:52,840 --> 00:21:01,679
drivers that are in the exact same place that I am you know it's not it's not like they don't all have places to

181
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:10,960
go um so there so over

182
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:18,120
time after a number of years how too many for me to want to uh

183
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:23,360
confess I came to realize

184
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:30,600
that um that I knew that there were

185
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:37,000
conditions I could change the time that I left the amount that I ate also the my

186
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,240
expectation you know my it was kind of like I had an expectation that I should

187
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:49,000
be able to do it in 20 to 25 minutes and sometimes I could but sometimes it took

188
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,440
45 minutes so changing that expectation of this is the way life is supposed to

189
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:01,919
go to um uh you know getting in the car and going

190
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:09,000
I don't know how long it's going to take so why don't I go early and you know get

191
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,640
a hot chocolate at pizza or

192
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:23,000
something yeah so so I don't think you can really do

193
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,120
the first element of preventing until you've spent enough time in the second

194
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:34,159
one of being in the UNH wholesome States and getting to know them and getting to

195
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:40,159
know what are what are the causes and conditions what

196
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:47,880
um what are the flags that I can see you know it might be that

197
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:57,679
um uh if you're going to have a difficult conversation with somebody it might be that there's some times of the

198
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:05,240
day that you're just more stable and clearheaded than other times you know so

199
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:13,000
getting to know uh your own heart and mind is helpful in

200
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,880
that first uh

201
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:26,679
element uh the second one of abandoning Arisen un wholesome

202
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:32,080
States uh can be more difficult because you're

203
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:39,679
already in it you're you know like when the mindfulness Cuts back in or you start to

204
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:45,120
pay attention you might find oh okay well now I'm really really angry or

205
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,960
I'm uh you know really

206
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,600
um anxious or Restless or what whatever it

207
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:03,519
is and so

208
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,279
the there there's kind of five strategies that the Buddha laid out and

209
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:15,679
I'm sure there's other ones that you can probably come up with for yourself for when you find yourself in

210
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,880
one of these uh unskillful

211
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,919
States um the first one is if it's not very strong you may be able to just

212
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:34,960
ignore it that doesn't mean pretend it's it doesn't mean to not

213
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:40,720
know that it's happening to not be mindful but rather to decide okay I'm

214
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:47,440
not going to get involved with it like it's there

215
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:54,200
I know it's operating but I don't need to get involved in it just kind of ignore it and for some

216
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,440
unskillful uh states that can work you know it's

217
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,480
just um I was in a car once with with two people that

218
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,960
were having an argument about or trying to decide who is to

219
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:17,080
blame for something and I realized it

220
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:22,880
was kind of a worthless argument I mean like there was no reason for me to even

221
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:29,080
offer an opinion or say anything because it just was like yeah I doesn't it

222
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:36,039
doesn't seem like it would lead anywhere useful so sometimes you can just ignore

223
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:42,960
it but still be mindful so this is not a

224
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:50,679
delusion uh the second one is to divert your attention

225
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:59,120
so um like when I'm sitting in my car and the traffic's not moving

226
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:05,279
rather than kind of watching every single movement of the car and wondering if okay well now we're starting to move

227
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:12,240
a little bit maybe this is going to be it you know maybe it's over I could just turn on the radio and listen to

228
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:18,840
classical music you know and just let that be a more soothing satisfying

229
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:24,399
experience than um getting caught up

230
00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:30,120
in wondering when the traffic's going to start moving

231
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:36,240
again so that's a little bit more so there's ignoring it there's diverting

232
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,399
your attention there's replacing the hindrance with its op opposite

233
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:47,880
quality so each one of those five

234
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:56,240
hindrances you could imagine has some opposite to it you know so uh lust and

235
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:03,640
greed might be um renunciation generosity you know instead

236
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:11,880
of trying to get something just giving it away um or recognizing

237
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:18,000
that trying to hold on to it isn't doing you any good

238
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,880
so uh that's one thing that comes to my mind for being the the opposite of um

239
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:31,720
greed and Lust For ill will and hatred aversion is uh

240
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:37,799
Goodwill you know um loving kindness

241
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:43,679
um wishing well uh offering people uh

242
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:52,159
harmlessness and safety um let's see sloth and torper I

243
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:59,000
guess the opposite of that would be bringing some bright energy

244
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:06,960
uh maybe through investigation Joy uh Restless restlessness and worry

245
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:13,840
would be you know bringing some can you find somewhere in your

246
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:19,278
experience a feeling of uh calm and

247
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:24,200
collectedness and um

248
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:31,159
peacefulness and uh one of the things that comes to me for

249
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:36,880
the opposite of Doubt would be some sense of confidence or

250
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:42,159
trust um

251
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:48,679
Faith so so that's one of the ways in is

252
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:55,039
to actually recognize what's happening and see if you

253
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:59,799
can bring some of the opposite to

254
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:07,720
it um the next one is it says to reason

255
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:15,279
with yourself to really examine what are the downsides of being

256
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:22,440
in this state what you know how does it feel where's it going to lead is this is

257
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:27,880
this how I want to live my life and so sometimes just bringing the

258
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:37,559
mind and the reasoning to the experience may help you recognize that um this

259
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:45,000
isn't something that you want to feed energy into and the last one and this this is

260
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:52,320
one I've actually gotten some push back from psychologists um is to crush it with all

261
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:58,600
your might so sometimes if it's just you know it's

262
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:04,480
just uh Beyond be Beyond ignoring or diverting

263
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:11,320
or replacing or reasoning you just just use your will

264
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:18,240
like no I'm not going there now I think the difference is this doesn't mean

265
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:24,279
repression in the sense that you're pretending as though it's not

266
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:30,080
that that impulse is is there you know it's

267
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:37,039
there but part of you knows I'm not going to give in this

268
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:41,200
impulse so I think of things

269
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:49,600
where you're ready to do some sort of um damage physical damage or

270
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,679
violence um I

271
00:30:54,679 --> 00:31:00,159
think if you're mindful it it could be a really really strong

272
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:06,679
desire to take your coffee cup and throw it across the room or so you know or

273
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:12,360
something like that but just knowing I'm not going to do that so

274
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:19,039
that's kind of the the the last option that the Buddha

275
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:24,840
gave and I think it's also maybe one of the least effective so I don't I

276
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:30,919
think as you cultivate with time you hopefully won't H get there that often

277
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:37,919
but there may be times when you just need to

278
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:43,200
um not give in to a very strong

279
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:54,120
impulse um so some other thoughts um to prevent

280
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:59,158
negative thoughts from arising maintain mindful

281
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:06,559
so your mind is always going to be doing something you're always going to have

282
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:11,960
some sort of State going on so with mindfulness at the very least

283
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:18,679
you can know what that state is you know kind of be aware not just a name for it

284
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:28,840
but what it feels like um the emotion associated with it

285
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:37,120
and then mindfulness combined with um wisdom kind of that knowing

286
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:47,320
it uh patience and effort can help you uh both prevent and

287
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:51,120
abandon the UNH wholesome

288
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:59,039
States uh some of the other advice on this is

289
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:05,919
the longer that you wait to notice it the stronger it may get so there's a

290
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:13,039
real value to noticing these unskillful states sooner

291
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:20,440
rather than later you know like not after a full-blown argument

292
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:26,639
like oh huh I guess I was angry you know but noticing it before you say the first

293
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:34,440
word is is is that M much better than after the last word has been

294
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:42,480
said so then the the last two

295
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:50,360
the the bringing into being of wholesome States uh wasn't talked as much about in

296
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:55,639
this book but there's several that come to mind

297
00:33:55,639 --> 00:34:04,039
number one is practicing the Brahma baharas so loving kindness compassion

298
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:10,760
practice sympathetic joy and Equanimity those are all those are

299
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:18,839
four practices that you can read about there there's a book called loving kindness by uh Sharon

300
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:25,878
saltzburg and and others I mean it's it's it's a it's a heavily traveled

301
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:32,240
topic and so that's something that you can do

302
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:37,520
either in a period of loving kind in in a period of

303
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:43,000
meditation or just anytime throughout the day I usually try to do a little bit

304
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,839
before I get out of bed in the morning there was one practice that uh

305
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:56,398
somebody taught me that when you're waiting in the airport to get on the plane you can just wish well for all of

306
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:02,440
these Str strangers that are walking by on The Concourse like they're people you've never seen before you'll probably

307
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:10,720
never see them again but can you just like wish them well like oh yeah you know may you may you be safe you know

308
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:17,280
may you be happy may you be healthy may you be peaceful

309
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:24,520
um I think it's a much more productive practice than sitting and

310
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:30,520
reading a magazine uh you know so it's or or listening to the news on the big you

311
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:39,000
know television screens in the waiting room in the uh waiting area so there's so those are practices

312
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:46,880
that you can do for uh creating uh wholesome States if they're

313
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:55,240
not Arisen um there's a whole series of practices

314
00:35:55,240 --> 00:36:02,280
called the uh parames um that are foundational

315
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:07,640
practices uh for this so things like practicing

316
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:13,000
generosity um you know practicing patience

317
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,480
determination uh ethics uh

318
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:25,160
renunciation these are all practices that you can do

319
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:31,160
um the don't necessarily immediately create the state that you

320
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:36,400
want but they set the conditions for it so for example if you're doing uh loving

321
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:42,400
kindness practice Mata there's phrases that you can uh

322
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:48,119
create for yourself and you know sometimes you you say the phrases and it

323
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:55,680
just doesn't seem like much is happening but it's creating the conditions for

324
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,920
um for wishing well for others for yourself

325
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:07,480
and for others and then so there are practices

326
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:14,040
that you can do um and that you can make part of your

327
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:20,359
everyday life for

328
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:25,720
um um bringing into being on aisen State

329
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:32,160
on un arisen and wholesome States and then maintaining

330
00:37:32,839 --> 00:37:41,000
them there's the suggestion at least in this book and I and I I wholeheartedly agree

331
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:48,040
with it is um gathering with likeminded friends and

332
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:55,920
reading Buddhist texts so finding other people that you can that

333
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:02,640
are interested in this that you can talk to that

334
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:10,039
um share the challenges that they're facing you know

335
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:19,920
um you know that um that support you and that you support

336
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:25,520
in cultivating wholesome states of mind

337
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:31,760
um I'm in a group that meets once a week on Thursday uh Tuesday

338
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:37,440
nights where we we talk about our practice with each

339
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:44,599
other there another group I meet meet with once a month we do the same thing and then I come here and I get a

340
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:51,640
chance to talk to uh people that show up um and I usually have a you know at

341
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:57,520
least some kind of conversation with whoever's teaching that night

342
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,800
um about what came up for me in the course of the

343
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:08,040
evening it doesn't necessarily need to be even another Buddhist practitioner I

344
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:14,359
mean there are people in other who follow other

345
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:20,519
paths that also want to

346
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:28,160
cultivate um kindness harmlessness uh freedom

347
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,520
and so uh you know you might find a a family

348
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:41,760
member or a friend or a coworker somebody you other people that will

349
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:47,000
um help you maintain some of these wholesome

350
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
States

351
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:59,960
um cuz it isn't to use a common phrase it isn't one or done it isn't like okay now now

352
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:05,040
I've cultivated love and kindness I don't need to do that anymore

353
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:10,119
the mind has a tendency to go back to the habits it's had over a long period

354
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:17,480
of time so it's a it's a long-term project to keep moving your

355
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:23,440
awareness from these um

356
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:30,040
uh afflictive states to ones that are

357
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:36,240
uh peaceful and free

358
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:43,359
so I hope that was useful to you all um we've got a few minutes if anyone

359
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:46,400
wants to ask any

360
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:55,839
questions or make comments or sure A girlfriend of mine said Janet

361
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:02,440
you're talking negatively again everybody could hear that well there's people online oh Janet you're talking

362
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:08,160
negatively again she reminded me of that last night I thought oh no I need her

363
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:13,920
around me more often to remind me that I'm doing that

364
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:32,640
it's thank you um um just a comment uh your anecdote about uh your commute 101

365
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:40,319
was uh reminding me of of a quote I read online I think it was like a systems engineer or something discussion um but

366
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:45,359
a lot of people like to say oh I'm stuck in traffic right they tell others and

367
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:52,040
the quote went something like uh the reality is you're not in traffic you are

368
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:58,160
traffic exactly and it got me thinking about that so wanted to share that thank

369
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:03,960
you thank you yeah that's right it's you know you are you are part of it it isn't

370
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,280
something that's happening to

371
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:30,680
you when I'm in one of those negative States

372
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:36,280
I uh I think of think of it as could you hold hold it yeah think of it as time to

373
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:42,359
weather the storm so you know I'll recognize it you know allow

374
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:48,400
it maybe be with it a bit and then then it fades

375
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:55,920
away eventually hopefully sooner rather than later yeah but yeah all right well

376
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:02,760
part part of this practice is if you recognize it you can the very least open your

377
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:08,520
umbrella I mean you you know you don't have

378
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:17,079
to you have some valtion in what happens so anyway thank you for

379
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:28,079
