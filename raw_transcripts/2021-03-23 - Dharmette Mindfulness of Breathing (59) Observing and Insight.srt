1
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,639
so

2
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,359
we continue with this series of talks on

3
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,800
the 16 steps of mindfulness of breathing

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,840
and we're now coming into the last

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,240
tetrad

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,160
that's a tread on observation

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,120
on observing the last tetrad is the last

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,680
steps 13 14 15 and 16

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,559
and they have in common all four steps

10
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,160
in the introduction of a new

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,760
verb a new and that's the verb

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,960
to observe

13
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,719
and it goes something like this one

14
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,559
trains

15
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,120
to observe x

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,239
or tr on trains observing

17
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,799
x when breathes in

18
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,080
when trains observing x when it breathes

19
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,680
out

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,799
and so in these uh last four steps

21
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,520
there's something we're observing

22
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,080
and and we continue with the breathing

23
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,040
and there's something about the

24
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,080
continuity of mindfulness of breathing

25
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,079
which is allowing us to observe things

26
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,640
but helping us not latch on to them

27
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,200
helping us not to cling or hold on

28
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,720
there's a kind of way in which by

29
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,320
staying with the breathing

30
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,600
there's a continual kind of letting go

31
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,320
that breathing is where the mind is

32
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,680
resting

33
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,560
and we notice all kinds of things happen

34
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,079
but in a certain way we're kind of

35
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,520
letting go of our involvement

36
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,079
letting go of any prioritization or

37
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,000
doing anything with it or

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,759
changing it or or thinking about it

39
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,360
we're just kind of going along with the

40
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,360
breathing going back to the breath being

41
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,719
with the breath

42
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,799
and it's a way of keeping ourselves soft

43
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,560
fluid relaxed

44
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,319
a letting go and allowing the psycho

45
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,360
physical system to have a break

46
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,480
from our active involvement our active

47
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,720
deliberate kind of engagement and doing

48
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,319
and wanting

49
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,560
and uh and letting something deeper to

50
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,239
happen that could only happen if we get

51
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,400
out of the way

52
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,440
and so in these last four steps

53
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,080
uh this is uh represents represented

54
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,519
very strongly by the word

55
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,480
the this verb to observe the idea of

56
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,959
observing

57
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,160
and it's the first time in the

58
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,160
anapanasati this

59
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,360
discourse 16 steps where observing comes

60
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,120
into play

61
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,239
and and

62
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,319
if you go if you read through the

63
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,040
teachings of the buddha and the suttas

64
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,720
we see that most commonly observing

65
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,400
as a practice is a very well-developed

66
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,319
practice when the mind is able to be

67
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,159
really centered in the present

68
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,040
concentrated a strongly concentrated

69
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,840
present

70
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,040
mind is the one that begins

71
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,720
doing the practice of and

72
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,800
so there's a lot of preparation in in

73
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,840
the 16 steps you know the first 12

74
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,480
are preparing ourselves for this

75
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,760
capacity to

76
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,560
to lean back and just kind of watch and

77
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,480
just observe what's happening

78
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,519
without being involved

79
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,519
some translators translate this work

80
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,080
this verb anupasati

81
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,760
as contemplating and

82
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,840
contemplating uh in in the way that i

83
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,280
relate to that word is closer to

84
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,400
thinking

85
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,239
reflecting about something thinking

86
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,480
about something it suggests a kind of

87
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,439
more active

88
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,319
thinking process observing which is

89
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,040
actually the

90
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,640
etymologically what the word anapasati

91
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,680
means anu the prefix means

92
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,560
towards something and the pasati means

93
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,680
to see

94
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,720
seeing uh and to put him together we're

95
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,519
we're gazing onto something seeing

96
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,440
looking towards something

97
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,800
in a sense and um but because of this

98
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,320
uh i think observing works very well

99
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,400
as it as a translation we're observing

100
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,479
and observing does there is a kind of

101
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,800
deliberateness kind of uh

102
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,720
uh in observing but it's not quite the

103
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,520
same

104
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,880
as as actively looking

105
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,960
it's just settling back and just being a

106
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,320
being an observer

107
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,960
and i liken it to being a naturalist who

108
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,400
goes into

109
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,639
some kind of natural setting to observe

110
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,560
some natural behavior of animals or

111
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,240
birds or something

112
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,639
and it's very important that the

113
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,360
naturalist

114
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,120
not interfere with the life there and

115
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,000
somehow stay kind of unrecognized by

116
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,360
what's happening so they

117
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,240
watch nature unfold without the

118
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,280
interference

119
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,680
from the humans and just but and then

120
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,479
just to observe

121
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,720
and um so earlier in in these 16 steps

122
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,800
it begins with breathing in one nose

123
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,639
one is breathing in breathing out one

124
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,320
nose or breathing out

125
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,360
so this idea of knowing is one of the

126
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,199
attentional faculties we have to know

127
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,759
as we begin knowing the breath and no we

128
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,400
never stop

129
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,160
knowing the breath we recognize with

130
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,479
breath we bear with the breathing

131
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,400
but then we're also what's happening

132
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,919
we're experiencing things we're

133
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,080
experiencing the body

134
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,240
we're experiencing joy and happiness

135
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,080
we're experiencing the mind

136
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,560
we're experiencing gladness experiencing

137
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,120
subtleness steady concentration and

138
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,039
we're experiencing

139
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,840
liberation and this experiencing is also

140
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,479
a little bit

141
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,600
uh passive it isn't that or receptive it

142
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,120
isn't so much like we're doing

143
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,880
something we're just allowing yourself

144
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,880
to experience

145
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,039
knowing also we're just knowing

146
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,000
something

147
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and we're not judging it or criticizing

148
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,400
it we're just knowing it clearly

149
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,560
and these two activities of knowing and

150
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,680
experiencing

151
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,000
are here to ground us here in the

152
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,800
present moment

153
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,120
and so at some point then it shifts to

154
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,199
just observing

155
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,400
and um and so this is where the art of

156
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,199
deeper mindfulness is to observe

157
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,919
and um in the other mindfulness

158
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,280
discourse of the buddhism

159
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,759
there there's a lot of language of

160
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,880
observing

161
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,479
and there also if you read the text

162
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,560
carefully it's

163
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,360
there the observing is the higher stages

164
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,360
of mindfulness that's where observation

165
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,199
comes in

166
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,199
and and so it's earlier

167
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,919
than knowing the experiencing is kind of

168
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,520
grounding us in the present moment

169
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,960
helping us stay present

170
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,880
learning to develop concentration to be

171
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,880
resting in the present

172
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,039
and when the ability to be focused and

173
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,120
present in the moment

174
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,080
is becomes uh easy and light and we feel

175
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,800
really grounded and centered here

176
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,199
that is when observation becomes

177
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,720
stronger

178
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,759
and because uh we're going towards being

179
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,240
less and less

180
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,360
intentional deliberate even

181
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,720
less and less um

182
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,319
activated or active in the mind

183
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,479
because the more activated we are in the

184
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,840
mind the more

185
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,160
kind of waves or agitation or clouds

186
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,039
there are

187
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,160
over our capacity to see clearly

188
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,120
and so as we get quieter and quieter and

189
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,160
quieter

190
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,199
what we're left with is this ability

191
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,800
just to observe

192
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,520
and then we learn to trust that to

193
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,479
settle back okay now i'm just observing

194
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,199
i'm not needing to interfere or again no

195
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,160
judging

196
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,319
i don't have to fix anything or adjust

197
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,599
anything or

198
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,840
make anything different i'm just just

199
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,440
watch just watch

200
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,360
and you can feel that in this kind of

201
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,560
very centered place that

202
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,640
if we start reaching out to do something

203
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,479
to fix something to judge something or

204
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,159
think about something

205
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,560
it feels a little bit like we're losing

206
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,159
something we're losing the

207
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,240
open field we're out losing the freedom

208
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,440
we're losing the

209
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,399
peacefulness of just observing and so

210
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,320
it's very clear that observing is a

211
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,920
better place to be

212
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,519
in this deeper states of meditation

213
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,080
and it becomes very important in these

214
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,360
final steps

215
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,080
because we really want to get out of the

216
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,920
way

217
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,240
and not overlay concepts ideas judgments

218
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,959
should

219
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,000
shouldn't on top of our experience we

220
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,720
want to really be able to take it in

221
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,800
things much closer to actually how

222
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,880
they're perceived

223
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,200
actually how before the experience

224
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,360
before a lot of judgments and concepts

225
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,120
and generalizations that we make about

226
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,000
things

227
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,600
just to observe just to observe

228
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,560
and so

229
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,760
so there's a turning with this last

230
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,120
tetrad

231
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,360
from the practices that are more meant

232
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,040
to be concentrating

233
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,399
settling focusing uh to

234
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,920
now we're switching to vipassana

235
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,959
observing is where

236
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,480
the personal insight practice begins

237
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,600
and uh and classically inside practice

238
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,720
is built or or is done

239
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,000
on the foundation of

240
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,800
a mind was gotten very stable

241
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,160
concentrated

242
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,920
still joyful happy soft

243
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,200
at ease content

244
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,320
safe and liberated from the hindrances

245
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,120
and and so and now the mind is ready

246
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,640
for insight practice and the inside

247
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,440
practice

248
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,640
is built on this capacity just observe

249
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,760
just observe the experience and

250
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,839
in fact vipassana the word that we

251
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,200
translate as

252
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,720
insight has the same

253
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,240
verbal root as anupasana

254
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,200
v pasana and um and pasuna in vipassana

255
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,399
again means to see and the v

256
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,079
is usually understood to be a prefix

257
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,839
here meaning um

258
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,640
to see clearly or to see in a it's kind

259
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,279
of a

260
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,240
prefix of emphasis to really see or

261
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,560
clearly see

262
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,880
or to observe to clearly observe to

263
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,200
clearly

264
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,480
be aware

265
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,120
so um

266
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,720
to observe and that's the um

267
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,839
that's the medium through which

268
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,720
we're going to explore these next four

269
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,279
sets of practices of mindfulness of

270
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,680
breathing

271
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,440
then someone asks why is vipassana often

272
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,839
taught as an intro to mindfulness

273
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,279
it also works that way and it doesn't

274
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,160
have to be done

275
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,040
only with the strong base of

276
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,560
concentration

277
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,360
and and so it can be done at fact

278
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,880
practice directly

279
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,279
but a lot of what people are doing when

280
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,440
it's practiced directly and immediately

281
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,760
is sorting their way through all the

282
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,720
ways in which they are not concentrated

283
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,880
and so they're beginning to become wise

284
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,360
about the hindrances about distractions

285
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,839
and and so rather than kind of more

286
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,240
directly getting concentrated

287
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,839
there's a concentration through a lot of

288
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,760
understanding and wisdom

289
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,680
about all the things that keep us going

290
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,959
distractedly

291
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,560
so then we can settle and uh

292
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,200
and with wisdom rather than settling

293
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,760
with uh

294
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,760
sometimes they say settling with faith

295
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,040
when person just

296
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,040
dedicated just being simple and focused

297
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,480
and but sooner or later

298
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,880
if you start with mindfulness the

299
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,279
concentration is brought in

300
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,600
and mindfulness and concentration become

301
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,639
partners

302
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,040
if we start more of the concentration

303
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,680
then

304
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,519
later mindfulness is brought in so they

305
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,120
become the partners

306
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,120
so both are true and both are valuable

307
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:06,079
and this anapanasati um

308
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,560
can be seen as kind of a hybrid of these

309
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,360
two

310
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,600
with a lot of emphasis on this settling

311
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,800
relaxing

312
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,560
concentrating that that sets a stage

313
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,680
for a strong mindfulness

314
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,880
thank you all very much
