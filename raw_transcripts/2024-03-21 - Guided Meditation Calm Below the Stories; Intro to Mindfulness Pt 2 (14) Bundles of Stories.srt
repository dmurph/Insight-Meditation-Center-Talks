1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:07,878
ah good morning good hello and uh

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,480
greetings sometimes I enjoy a little bit of fun

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,640
by reclassifying human beings rather than calling them Homo

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,519
sapiens um I call them consider them to be homo

5
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:33,399
stor uh that we tell stories one of the

6
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:39,520
distinctive qual distinctive characteristics of humans is their ability tell

7
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:46,440
stories uh other animals

8
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,280
know they can understand a lot but uh I don't know how much other animals tell

9
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:58,920
stories the way we do and we tell stories we make

10
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,199
plans we

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,240
um pass judgment we bring things experiences people into the court of our

12
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:21,920
mind and where we are the judge and we will be judging things we fantasize we

13
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,200
imagine we tell stories of all kinds and certainly part of the richness

14
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:35,240
of human beings that sitting around a campfire and telling stories and it's

15
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:42,399
and sometimes it's the way we understand ourselves understand our people our history and and uh make sense of the

16
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:49,680
world so stories are a very important part of being a human being

17
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:57,719
and so is um you know other things eating is

18
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:04,240
important but if all we did was eat all the time that would be a

19
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:13,879
problem and sometimes when we meditate the story making mind is

20
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:21,120
clearly a form of agitation formly a way a way of being spinning out or being

21
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,920
preoccupy being being in a certain kind of way disconnected from ourselves in the

22
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:32,480
present moment and it can be lovely in meditation

23
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:39,200
when uh that storytelling mind planning mind

24
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:46,879
stops reviewing mind stops uh it I think it maybe belittles

25
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:52,720
that moment to associate it with or compare it to the hum of the

26
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,159
refrigerator going off and there's a Ah that's good we didn't even know there was a

27
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:05,840
some little bit bit of tension with the hum until it

28
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:13,040
stops and or we don't know that the our windshield of the car has gotten dirty

29
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:20,440
slowly on a long road trip until someone cleans it and wow now I see

30
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:28,200
clearly so to let the story telling mine take a break or

31
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,760
rest you don't have to eat all the time you don't have to tell stories all the time you don't have to make plans all

32
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:40,720
the time you don't have to review the past all the time you don't have to be

33
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,319
at court all the time judging and evaluating you don't have to be a

34
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:52,480
scientist or an engineer constantly probing to understand and to figure out

35
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,720
or to build or to create ah all those

36
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,519
efforts of the mind that the thinking mind which is

37
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:10,480
complicated active can go to

38
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:20,359
rest there might be other forms of thinking maybe species of thinking

39
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:30,479
the that continue without that particular species of thinking known as story making or

40
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:37,120
that that this part of the mind that constructs

41
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:46,639
spins fabricates there might be very simple

42
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,880
thoughts that say oh that's nice for things to be quiet

43
00:04:52,880 --> 00:05:00,720
ah I'm home I was up in my head all the time

44
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,360
and disconnected from anything below my neck ah they went quiet that part of

45
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,759
thinking so another voice says Ah this is good I'm here I'm

46
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,960
home I've arrived for these minutes it's good to

47
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:25,319
be here just like if you go to take a rest

48
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:31,560
with a little nap you don't bring your device with you

49
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:38,680
to continue doing emails you put that aside and

50
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:45,720
ah I can put that aside for now so here we are going to meditate

51
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:53,080
putting aside not abandoning but putting aside the story making mind the

52
00:05:53,080 --> 00:06:01,639
constructing mind the mind that has abstract thought about things

53
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:12,440
so we can have the pleasure and the

54
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:19,400
challenge the important challenge of just being here with what's deeper and

55
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:28,280
more intimate more connected than the story making

56
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
mind

57
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:43,560
to know without a story to know without

58
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:51,000
imposing knowing just know simply the most simple

59
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:58,160
way without any conclusions and judgments

60
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:05,198
predictions here so assuming a meditation

61
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:19,840
posture and considering have you

62
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,440
been are you activated have you been activated with a abstract mind of

63
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:33,479
thinking thinking of abstract thoughts of plans and memories and

64
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:43,160
stories and it has its place in our life to do that but not

65
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:54,879
now now is the time to connect to a deeper Source

66
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
Within

67
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,120
closing the

68
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:17,840
eyes taking a moment to imagine that you're dropping

69
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,479
your attention down into your body to what for you feels like the

70
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:28,639
deepest place you can touch the deepest place that awareness

71
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,440
can rest in

72
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,240
maybe it's in the heart area generally General heart area maybe it's in

73
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,839
the diaphragm area or deeper down into the

74
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:04,440
belly whatever it feels like the quietest comest deep place

75
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,279
within let your inhale begin from

76
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,360
there spreading

77
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
outwards

78
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,240
and let the exhale return to

79
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,839
there and if that's at the

80
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,160
center the calm still place

81
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,959
within let the mind of stories and ideas

82
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:09,240
and Fantasies and abstractions let that be on the far

83
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:20,079
edges almost like it's occurring in a be just

84
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,160
beyond the range of your

85
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:32,120
hearing center yourself in the calm still place

86
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,120
within where there might be very simple

87
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:48,720
thoughts and the simplest thought you can use maybe is the word here h e r

88
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:56,600
e here at The Quiet Center

89
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,240
the of all things

90
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,519
relaxing into that

91
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,720
Center breathing from that

92
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,959
Center allowing the thinking mind the story

93
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:41,399
mind to relax fade

94
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:48,320
away the tensions of the story making mind melts

95
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,519
away centered

96
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
here

97
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:12,639
maybe it either at the inhale or the exhale saying the thought to

98
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:19,839
yourself here but saying that

99
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,639
thought from that from a place deep

100
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
within

101
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
on

102
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
for

103
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
e

104
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
for

105
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
e

106
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
for

107
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
for

108
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
for

109
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
for

110
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
for

111
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
for

112
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
for

113
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
for

114
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

115
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:06,880
e gently turning off the thinking mind the

116
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,799
story making

117
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:18,080
mind relaxing the tension or effort to

118
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:24,480
be perpetuating ongoing flow of thoughts

119
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:30,640
that have nothing to do with Here and Now

120
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:42,880
finding relief in being

121
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,799
here here with the whole

122
00:20:52,640 --> 00:21:01,559
body gently lovingly repeating being the simple

123
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:04,559
thought

124
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
here

125
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
for

126
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

127
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
for

128
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
for

129
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
for

130
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
for

131
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
for

132
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
for

133
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

134
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
for

135
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,919
and then as we come to the end of the

136
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,440
sitting to take a few moments to

137
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:58,279
appreciate the potential potentials available to us when we are

138
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:04,240
truly here when we're

139
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,360
present in a relaxed rooted

140
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:16,000
way without the momentum of stories from the [Music]

141
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,720
past desires about what's to

142
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:29,520
come and now this is the way we can be with someone who

143
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:36,120
needs our support needs to experience the basic

144
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,120
human

145
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:47,600
companionship someone who needs to feel that someone is present for them without

146
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:53,080
any filters just

147
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:03,240
here that in the Simplicity and the

148
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:11,240
clarity here without stories there's a Clear

149
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:18,320
Channel for our respect and love and care for

150
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,960
others may we

151
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,120
offer our our friendship our friendliness to

152
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:41,440
others through the medium of a Simplicity of heess being able to be here in a

153
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:47,279
clear and simple way not wanting anything particularly

154
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:56,320
from others without aversion to others just here with friendship friendliness

155
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:02,640
meta May our good will spread to others out

156
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:09,000
into the [Music] world may our friendliness spread from

157
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:17,399
us to others and out into the world may our simple respect for others

158
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:24,679
spread out to them and to others may it be that this practice and

159
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:29,760
its goodness spreads wide and far

164
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,840
thank

165
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,960
you

166
00:30:56,919 --> 00:30:59,919
e

167
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:26,919
so hello to this fourth uh talk

168
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:34,240
on grasping or clinging and how we create not just a

169
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:40,559
single grasping and clinging but we create bundles of clinging

170
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:46,799
we some of us specialize in clinging and grasping and holding on and attachment

171
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:52,440
to many things and it's almost like we go through the day collecting things to

172
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:57,919
be attached to we start the day not even knowing

173
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:04,600
what we're going to new thing we're going to be attached to today today and sure enough we something comes

174
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:12,519
along and something maybe we never even thought about maybe we have a

175
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:18,919
smartphone and there's suddenly there appears a new operating system or a new

176
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:25,320
new app that does something we never dreamed of before and uh and now we

177
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:32,840
really have to have it and we've collected a new attachment a new clinging and so we can

178
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:38,519
go through the day and acquire more and more um we see something beautiful and

179
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:44,279
we want it we see something ugly and we want to push it away and it's a kind of

180
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:51,279
a clinging and attachment for it to go away and um and it's fascinating to

181
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:57,039
watch how this the the the the appearance new attachments new clinging

182
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:02,679
the mind watching on the mind fixating on one way or the other either for or

183
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:08,760
against things the mind is fixated now and um it sometimes people have

184
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:15,080
amazing capacity for one-pointed attention uh when it's for something

185
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:20,399
they're attached to they're clinging to wanting something really hard

186
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:26,320
including not wanting it to go wanting to go away wanting to get away from

187
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:32,960
it so um so the Buddha uh put a tremendous

188
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:40,080
emphasis on understanding clinging and what we cling to and and

189
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:46,720
how what clinging feels like and so uh he has he lists four five

190
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:52,120
different bundles five different categories that we bundle up into forms

191
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:58,639
of clinging attachment the first one we talked about I talked about on Monday is appearances

192
00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:04,799
physical appearances the second is feelings of pleasant and

193
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:11,679
unpleasantness the third is our perceptions our recognitions of things

194
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:19,919
and today it's um the constructions of the Mind the poly words sunara can

195
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:30,320
literally etymologically be translated its constructions um and um uh Tanis biku

196
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:38,240
monk who's a translator into English he calls this Fabrications and I like to use the word

197
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:44,638
constructions and uh some translators do mental formations but mental formations is a

198
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:50,878
little bit weak and uh it's or abstract Fabrications imply something which is

199
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:56,159
made up that we make constructions means kind of the same

200
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:02,720
thing and it's not any any con any activities of the mind it's not all

201
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:08,200
mental activities it's a particular kind of mental activities which has to do

202
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:14,560
with um uh constructing stories judgments

203
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,920
identities uh constructing um ideas that are about the

204
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,839
future and the past um building up and an edifice of self by all the different

205
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:32,040
kind of ideas of what self is who myself is what I'm supposed to be doing who I

206
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:38,079
and we create these edifices these complicated worlds of constructions and some

207
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:47,480
people you know maybe you know 50% 90% you know if it's close to 100% uh uh

208
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:52,880
sometimes we're considered to has to be somehow mentally ill the more we live in

209
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:58,359
these constructions these fantasies these delusions delusion that the mind

210
00:35:58,359 --> 00:36:06,640
can create uh the more disconnected we are from reality and U most of us are

211
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:15,160
not go so far that others are worried about us um but uh it still we're going kind

212
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:22,000
of where there's a range from having no stories no no constructions about things

213
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,319
and being very innocent and simple and and maybe naive about what's right here

214
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:32,520
to to being completely disconnected from what's here just have spinning out in

215
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:38,200
stories but in between there there's a range and in that range uh there are

216
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:44,720
times we get attached to these stories constructions um uh built up identities

217
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:50,440
that we have so uh we're making things up in the mind we're building things up

218
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:58,079
in the mind and we get attached to them and um and that can be as simple as

219
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:04,680
um you know maybe i' I've never been on a that's true I've never been on a on a

220
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:11,400
electric scooter that they have now around town so maybe today I try one and

221
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:18,480
uh it turns out that I have aptitude for doing it easily and simply and zipping around town and between pedestrians and

222
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:26,520
between cars and and after a few hours of zipping around on this scooter um I

223
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:31,920
conclude that I am the best scooter driver in

224
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:39,720
Redwood City no one's as good as me look at me I'm just my my my role in this

225
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:48,440
town is to show people uh what a good scooter scooter scootering I'm doing and

226
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:54,280
um so here you know before I woke up today I had no identity no story about

227
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:59,880
myself and on a scooter but then I it gets constructed right in front of my

228
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:05,680
own eyes or behind my own eyes um as I do this and I have this whole sense of

229
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:11,480
Pride and status and you know Wonderful delusions of grandeur and probably I'll

230
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:19,720
be interviewed by Oprah and different things because I'm so good and I'm drifting off into this world of story

231
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:25,079
making the Buddha said that that this world of constructs is one of the

232
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:34,119
bundles things that people get attached to cling to and um and uh to become free

233
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:40,839
the kind of spiritual Liberation the Buddha was emphasizing all grasping has to come to

234
00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:50,040
a stop all the ways in which we're tightened up and fisted up in the heart and the mind wants to be released so we

235
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:56,680
release the mind that holds on to stories the mind that has attachment

236
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:03,359
that's the fuel to for building and making the stories and uh we can feel that

237
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:09,319
sometimes we can feel it sometimes as um tension in the mind

238
00:39:09,319 --> 00:39:15,280
pressure we can feel it as a the the effort is operating effort is can be

239
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:21,920
tiring can be forceful we can feel it as a limitation where our world has narrow

240
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:28,520
down into this this little world of story making little world of

241
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:35,040
in the head from the neck up and we're just kind of going and spinning around and around and around making these

242
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:41,760
things and sometimes one makes the next so I make him have an identity around

243
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:49,240
around being a good scooter driver and then um that gives birth to ideas that

244
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:54,800
well certainly there's a nice scooter outfit that I should be wearing and um

245
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:03,680
and this is really important and to appear right so they get attached to my appearance and then I want to have um

246
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:09,839
gloves for my scooter driving that's are really comfortable and and uh get attached to the comfort of what I'm

247
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:17,880
going to wear and and then it goes on and on the uh the these bundles I start

248
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:24,640
collecting more and more bundles of attachments in relationship to something that when I woke up this morning I had

249
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:31,960
no attachment to and I create maybe a Universe around this thing and by end of the day nothing else is important in my

250
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:37,640
life except everything to do with um my scooter and what it means and the

251
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:43,000
different aspect of it so um so some of

252
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:49,720
us will live in these kinds of uh mental constructs AB abstractions

253
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:56,200
Fabrications and not know that they are that um it's just a part and parcel of

254
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:03,200
kind of how the mind oper op Ates that we think that it's true and this is how it is and it's

255
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:10,200
accurate but if we sit and meditate and get quiet enough we can feel the tension

256
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:19,200
of that kind of thinking the tiredness of that kind of thinking we can start feeling how it keeps us limited from the

257
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:26,240
whole and um uh and so to um learn how

258
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:32,040
to to quiet that down enough to begin re

259
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:38,440
bringing our attention here in a Simplicity of being a radical

260
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:44,760
Simplicity of being that the story making mind will criticize as being

261
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:50,079
simplistic and not important not fun not where life really is the where it really

262
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:56,520
is is building and succeeding and making something fantastic and wonderful that

263
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:02,599
uh uh requires that kind of thinking that kind of story making that kind of

264
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:12,560
ambition and uh and to be resting in a Simplicity of being is um is um a

265
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:20,000
betrayal even or is a not as much fun or it's not going to get us ahead in the world and important

266
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:27,720
ways but to let go of our grasping opens up a door opens up a capacity to be

267
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:33,359
present for ourselves and the world in an fantastic

268
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:40,800
way it gives us depth it gives us fullness it gives access to the all the

269
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:47,319
working of this intelligence of this body and mind that we have if we're just

270
00:42:47,319 --> 00:42:55,400
in the neck up in the stories and we're disconnected from The Amazing capacity

271
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:03,240
that this body mind heart art has for knowing here and now our whole system body and mind has

272
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:08,359
been designed to be

273
00:43:08,359 --> 00:43:13,520
intimately attentive int

274
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:21,079
intimately processing intimately responding intimately

275
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:27,160
interacting with present moment reality and so much over the fullness of

276
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:33,079
of who we are comes out when we turn off

277
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:41,440
the story making mind and can come from this [Music] deeper uh operating system that we

278
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:48,720
have that uh is so much richer than what anything the story making mind can do for

279
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:56,240
itself and what's fun about that is that when we're more connected and settled

280
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:04,359
and not attached to the story making mind the we can still tell

281
00:44:04,359 --> 00:44:11,160
stories and that but we know their stories we're not grasping at them but

282
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:19,079
they can arrive arise out of this deeper C uh place of creativity within that can

283
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:28,040
be have its own fun its own wonderfulness its own wisdom that uh cannot operate if we're

284
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:35,920
from the neck up so you might go through

285
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:43,079
today looking and seeing what are the stories about the

286
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:48,400
future you're living in actively like reflecting on thinking

287
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:56,640
about what are the stories and ideas of the past what are the stories you're making up about self who you are and who

288
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:04,920
you are in the eyes of others a lot of the story making is has to do with Me Myself and

289
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:13,599
mine and and then see if you can notice the contrast between the stories you live

290
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,800
in and the Simplicity of

291
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:28,240
being that you can live in may you live in the fullness of your life

292
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:35,000
without having the story making mind

293
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,040
obscure be an obstacle to the fullness of your

294
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:43,240
being thank

295
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:48,559
you
