1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:12,160
hello and welcome to our meditation and in this now multi-week

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,520
series on samadei that we are touching into the

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,760
topic of Janna and Janna is uh deep absorption it's not something that we

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,720
storm not something we assertively aggressively expect to experience

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,640
push ourselves to have it's a little bit like grace it's a little bit like um

6
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:44,719
gift that we receive that we set up the conditions for some deep letting go set

7
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,879
up the conditions for some deep settling steadiness that leaves us deeply

8
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,920
absorbed deeply engaged interested um

9
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:03,920
uh it kind of interests that it's almost enraptured in the simplicity of the

10
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,400
meditative experience and um so how we approach

11
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,600
sami how we orient ourselves towards it is very important and there is something

12
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:23,720
called the approach stage and part of the function of that stage is to uh reorient

13
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:29,680
us in a way where we're not selfish not greedy not

14
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:37,439
um be not feel like we're in charge it's up to us but orient ourselves with some

15
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:45,200
feeling of receptivity of of um gratitude gratefulness

16
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:53,040
uh of appreciating there's something more profound operating here than ourselves

17
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,520
as the agents of change meditative change and so some people find that the

18
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,200
reorientation uh at the beginning of meditation they

19
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,319
uh express their faith they evoke their faith some people have deep kind of

20
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:16,400
faith in dharma Buddha dharma sana they chant the refues for themselves

21
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,040
something that allows for shift what we what would be what is a little bit

22
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,760
um a um lost opportunity is if we just live our life

23
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:35,840
and then just slide into our meditation seat and just continue the mind stream and the momentum of our day just without

24
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:43,440
any other concern uh there is a way to somehow go through a little process of

25
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,560
reorientation this is not daily life as usual this is not the mental stream as usual that

26
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,959
we're going to connect to we are reorient reorienting

27
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:04,440
ourselves and one ritual for that reorientation is the care we give to our

28
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:11,040
posture that posture is not incidental it's not just to make a posture which is

29
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,640
only comfortable enough that not disturb our meditation because we're s it's cozy

30
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,080
and comfortable but to take care and time to

31
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,480
get into the posture um to make that a ritual

32
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:36,400
transition a ritual reorientation to now something

33
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:41,560
profound is going to might happen or we're going to make ourselves

34
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,560
available receptive ready

35
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:53,840
open in a way that maybe maybe our minds or hearts are not as we go about our

36
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,920
daily life so taking

37
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,239
a a comfortable but alert

38
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:10,519
posture so there's some degree small even small

39
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:15,720
degree that the posture evokes

40
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:24,080
attention a physical alertness a physical presence here at this time at

41
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,040
this place in this

42
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,080
body lining up the vertebrae of the

43
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:53,600
spine placing the hands in a way where the hands themselves the way the

44
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,080
arms are

45
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,800
provokes a certain kind of

46
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,880
attention

47
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:20,240
attentiveness and as part of this ritual reorientation to another way of being

48
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,520
than the usual one another set of values another way

49
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:35,039
of tending attending to this life of ours

50
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:40,919
part of that ritual is gently closing your

51
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:48,720
eyes gently relaxing the eyes the eyes don't have to work in

52
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,960
meditation they can relax

53
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:05,919
and and then take a few moments again part of this ritual transition

54
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:14,720
reorientation to feel your body in some broad global

55
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,080
way

56
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:26,440
kind of like if you step into from out the ordinary

57
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:31,600
life into a sacred

58
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:38,720
place that we enter maybe through a door through an opening a gate

59
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,520
not casually but we enter

60
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:50,680
it with all of who we are and so we

61
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:58,159
enter by feeling our body entering our

62
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:09,599
body and if it seems nice you can readjust your posture a little bit more

63
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:21,960
and then to begin orienting

64
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:31,520
yourselves on breathing without breathing deeper or

65
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:39,599
fuller slow the inhale so it just takes longer to

66
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:49,240
inhale slow the exhale but do so just short of being

67
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,599
uncomfortable so maybe just a moment or two

68
00:07:54,599 --> 00:08:00,800
slower to do the ordinary amount of breathing

69
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:11,520
in slowing your breathing down

70
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:22,599
enough that you can feel the body's desire to breathe

71
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:44,320
and trusting how the body is breathing at

72
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:50,560
this moment not making anything a

73
00:08:53,160 --> 00:09:00,040
problem and if you prefer you can go back to your usual speed of

74
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:06,959
breathing maybe now a little bit more conscious of breath breathing

75
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:19,440
and as you exhale to soften your

76
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:33,640
body softening the edges of your body

77
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,800
softening the thinking

78
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,480
mind softening in the heart

79
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,839
and maybe as a act of love or

80
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:32,640
faith or tenderness let there be a Small pause at

81
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:41,920
the end of the exhale very short but long enough for

82
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:48,800
there to be a feeling of care tenderness

83
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:55,640
love or faith in this process of meditation

84
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:10,959
where the short pause is like saying

85
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:18,920
hello to the deeper meditative process that

86
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:24,440
you're inner life is capable of

87
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,519
maybe more capable than your

88
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:37,399
mind's belief that is it is in charge

89
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,399
and in whatever way there's some

90
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:26,360
pleasure gladness wellbeing or

91
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:33,440
joy however small it might be in whatever way you feel it in your

92
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,440
body

93
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:46,360
orient yourself with that by orienting connecting your

94
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,920
breathing to the

95
00:12:53,560 --> 00:13:01,480
well-being as if breathing breathes with or through the well-being

96
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,639
or as if the

97
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:25,680
well-being is what's providing the awareness of

98
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,248
breathing it's [Music]

99
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:37,480
well-being that tends to the breathing

100
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,240
if there is any gentleness

101
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:21,000
tenderness in a very simple

102
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,680
happiness contentment deep in your

103
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:36,560
body or tingling along the surface of your

104
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:50,000
skin a happiness that feels calm and

105
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,279
peaceful allow that

106
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:05,959
to mingle with the body breathing

107
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:44,120
Where part of you gets absorbed pulled

108
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,440
into the mingling

109
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:57,640
of well-being and breathing

110
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,000
part of you gets pulled into the rhythm of

111
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:12,480
breathing where there's a

112
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:19,200
massage where there is a

113
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:34,160
gentle care between breathing

114
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:45,400
An embodied feeling of contentment

115
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:54,679
happiness wellbeing however small that feeling is

116
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:19,600
If there's any way in which you're holding yourself apart away

117
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:27,919
from where breathing and well-being meet mingle

118
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:39,679
See if you can let go give up the holding back holding away

119
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:46,760
from release yourself into the breathing

120
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:55,600
allow yourself to slide into the embodied

121
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:02,320
experience of breathing breathing through and

122
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:08,039
with happiness contentment

123
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,400
and as we come to the end of this

124
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:47,159
sitting take a few moments to feel whatever degree of

125
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:52,080
well-being you feel in your body

126
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:58,159
any warmth glow

127
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:07,360
tingling any radiance or

128
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:16,520
pleasure associated with a simple happiness well-being

129
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:32,000
and as if that well-being is being held in check held

130
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,880
within a certain limitation in your body certain

131
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:45,279
area as you breathe in stretch the area wide

132
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:52,400
as you let go breathe out let that well-being be

133
00:27:54,120 --> 00:28:00,840
unbounded let it release almost as a

134
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:08,000
balloon where a person releases the string the balloon can fly out across

135
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:15,559
the world let your well-being free

136
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:23,679
into the sky the space around

137
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:33,440
you imagining that your happiness and

138
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:44,360
well-being can be shared can touch the hearts of others

139
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,279
that your happiness is not just your

140
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:57,440
own we are living in this planet in kinship

141
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:03,960
with all other people all other beings and may it

142
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:10,320
be that what we know about happiness

143
00:29:11,399 --> 00:29:19,440
well-being is experienced fully in us so we can share it with

144
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:24,720
others may all beings be

145
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:32,480
happy may all beings be safe

146
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:38,960
may all beings be

147
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:44,720
peaceful may all beings be

148
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:51,679
free and may we know these three these four

149
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,919
things so we're in a better position to wish it for others

150
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:03,919
may all beings be

151
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,839
[Music]

152
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:26,760
happy thank you

153
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:27,840
so welcome back to this ongoing series on samadei and we're now this week covering

154
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:33,520
the first Janna the first level of absorptive immersive

155
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:39,840
meditation and one of the

156
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:45,200
great aspects of this sta

157
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:51,039
uh stage of meditation this area of meditation is that we're allowed to give

158
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:59,279
ourselves over to being happy we're allowed the the ability to trust joy and

159
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:04,760
well-being it's okay to give ourselves to

160
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:09,840
it and one of the reason there's a number of reasons why it's okay more

161
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,360
than okay it's actually beneficial and very important part of the Buddhist path

162
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:22,200
one is that the happier you can be in a genuine peaceful meaningful

163
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:30,720
way the more you know that this is a possibility for others and the more you can support

164
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:36,720
others and see people's potential for well-being the more I think it inspires

165
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,919
care and love for others and perhaps also it's a gift we

166
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:47,559
bring others our happiness is a gift it's

167
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:53,279
also a gift to ourselves because there's something about a peaceful healthy

168
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:58,880
happiness that's embodied and present that helps the mind get organized helps

169
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,679
the mind get become whole or be be fully here be immersed in this

170
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:10,080
experience and what immersed means in part it means we're not distracted we're

171
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:15,640
not divided we're not fragmented we're not

172
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:22,880
caught in any attachments or clinging this full embodied happiness is is a

173
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:28,559
there's a movement in it to spread out through our whole being and bump up

174
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:35,760
against the places where we're restricted where we're tight where we're holding where we're afraid

175
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:41,200
and it's a loving happiness that can s gently kind of touch the places that are

176
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,240
hard for us hold them care for them um

177
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:53,919
accompany them so that we're not over identified with our challenges with our

178
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:59,120
pains our emotional ch difficulties we don't we don't overidentify it so

179
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:04,720
we're subtly reinforcing them or you know picking the scab in a sense but

180
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:12,800
we're loving them we're caring for them we're offering them something profound nourishment of attention and care that

181
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:19,679
comes in the form of well-being and trust and confidence and allows us then to

182
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:28,000
continue on the path of being settled so uh in the teachings of the Janna it's

183
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:35,280
quite common to provide a listing of what johnic factors are present in each

184
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:42,878
of the four Jas and um and there's a in the first genre there's five factors and then as

185
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:49,040
we go along into the deeper Jas um certain ones of these factors fall away

186
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:55,440
and so there's a shorter list then and Um and so sometimes the ways that these

187
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,800
genres are taught is that there's a kind of quantum steps of letting go of

188
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:06,400
deepening of releasing as we go through this and uh

189
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:15,359
and as what gets released is the what's more coarse what's more um uh has has

190
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:20,880
more energy or more activation to it and so that we we let go of those so that we

191
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:26,200
can drop into the more subtle factors that are are much more sublime and more

192
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:32,240
peaceful and so there's a movement from coarser to more refined from more

193
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:38,359
activator energetic to less and less to more and more peaceful and

194
00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:45,680
quiet so some people emphasize uh these stages as being the four stages and so

195
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:51,040
the first second third and fourth Janna and so there can be definitely a feeling

196
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:58,079
of kind of kind of taking a big step a quantum kind of sudden dropping and going further

197
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:03,320
opening further um but it doesn't have to be that way and sometimes there's an

198
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:10,000
overemphasis and attachment and expectation and drive to go from one to

199
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,400
the other uh and if instead what we do is we don't

200
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:22,000
focus so much on the stages as being these these uh you know

201
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,520
you know um raified kind of states that we go into i find it sometimes much more

202
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:34,320
useful to just learn to recognize the primary factors that characterize the

203
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:41,599
deepening of practice and so these the uh these five first johnic factors are

204
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:50,599
useful to recognize so I'll go through them there is the uh the initial application of

205
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:56,320
attention there's a sustained attention it's means placing our

206
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,760
attention someplace and keeping there for a while then doing it again like a

207
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:10,119
massage or kneading dough and then there's u uh there's uh

208
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:18,400
joy and um I'll talk a little more about joy tomorrow because such an important part of the beginning stage here but

209
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:24,800
there's joy and rapture and then uh the the um the

210
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:31,760
fourth factor is uh happiness suka some people will call it bliss some people

211
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:37,960
will call it because it's kind of deeply embodied um some people call it even

212
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:43,680
pleasure but that doesn't quite give it justice because it's it's so sublime so

213
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:51,359
satisfying so such a contentment that comes with it that I prefer to use the word happiness

214
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:57,839
and then there's uh becoming one the unification the onepointedness that I

215
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:03,640
talked about yesterday so these the initial application of

216
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:11,480
attention the sustained attention joy happiness and becoming

217
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:17,760
one and um and uh uh so these are the

218
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:23,920
five that are at play and um and it's nice to recognize them the one that

219
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:30,320
seems most important at this stage is is you know they're kind of in in order

220
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:35,760
initially we need some kind of subtle way intentionality subtle continuation

221
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,960
of some gentle effort to stay present we're pretty much locked in we're pretty

222
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:47,520
much not going anywhere it feels like there's the mind's not going to wander off and there's no discursive thinking

223
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:53,920
it's very peaceful uh but there's still there needs to be a little bit of kind

224
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:59,280
of staying here stay here be here yes i

225
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:05,280
like the word yes yes with this in this needing of our attention into this

226
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:11,359
present moment um so it's very subtle very slight but it's going to stay here

227
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:17,359
stay here and um and uh there can start being

228
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:24,320
this joy and the joy in compared to happiness the joy is is said to be even

229
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:32,480
though it's can be a lot of manifestation of of uh joyful energies in the body tingling thrill

230
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:39,280
uh it um it uh is understood to be more of a mental activity it's a little bit

231
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:46,280
the mind is a little bit excited a little bit delighted like when I say yes this is good it's a little bit more that

232
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:52,920
yes than the mind than it is uh to be as uh deep

233
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:59,440
contentment that the mind is hardly involved it's almost like the body the the

234
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:06,520
um the breath is involved in in saying ah this exhale

235
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:13,640
ah the happiness is deep that deep place of ah so the joy is a little bit of like a

236
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:18,720
yes and um but whatever this is both of them are present so you don't have it's

237
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:24,480
not that important at the moment to distinguish them initially but the instruction the Buddha

238
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:30,720
gives when this joy and happiness arises from really being in the moment in the

239
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:39,280
flow of the present moment is to relax with it open with it let it pervade suse

240
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:46,000
and spread the Buddha uses a series of words like this spread through the body

241
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,040
and so there's a tendency in the body to the body to be through body and mind to

242
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:58,240
hold things in check to hold things in place there's tension in our body there's tension in our mind there's uh

243
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:06,720
attachment to what's happening there's many ways in which we bound things up to keep it limited and the opportunity here

244
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:11,839
uh is to soften the body soften the attention

245
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:18,079
open to a rep receptivi receptivity in the body and mind and as we as we do

246
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:23,960
this uh blowing on the fire as we do this kneading of the dough as we do this

247
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:30,800
Yes it's almost like sometimes I've thought of it as a as um ironing out the

248
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:38,800
wrinkles on a sheet of paper just kind of spreading it out spreading it out until the sheet is completely flat with

249
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:45,920
no wrinkles at all um sometimes it's just more like um a gentle heater that's

250
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:52,319
heating up from inside and spreading out in all directions some people like the image of

251
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:58,000
light there's a light that's spreading uh golden light that's spreading through

252
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,079
the body and beyond and some people are much more physically oriented it's actually the

253
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:10,400
phys physical sensations of that joy the physical warmth glow tingling vibration

254
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:17,040
of it that uh pleasure of it that begins to flow outwards and the pleasure is

255
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:22,880
actually quite useful as an object at this point um we're letting that

256
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:28,000
pleasure spread and spread and spread so it's not kept bounded it's almost like a

257
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:34,720
letting go around it or with it so so there's nothing holding it you know from

258
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:39,800
spreading out beyond beyond us beyond our edges of our

259
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:46,560
body and um and uh I prefer some people will just focus on the pleasure itself

260
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:52,800
like become one with that pleasure uh I prefer to um have that pleasure and the

261
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:59,720
breath be cerminous the pleas the pleasure the well-being the joy to be

262
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:06,240
intimately associated with the breathing almost like the pleasure the joy and the

263
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:12,560
breathing are holding hands or there's or they have become one and um and so

264
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:17,839
this wonderful the rhythm of breathing is what supports the spreading the

265
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:24,000
letting go the opening of that well-being through everywhere so this can't of course be

266
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,280
done too easily or just you know sit down plop down and do this

267
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:34,480
uh this becomes the the instruction when

268
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:40,079
we finally arrive in the present moment we feel oh now I'm really here this is

269
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:45,880
good i'm not and that you know as I've said number of times now don't expect that

270
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:51,680
often and um um what you'd expect often is that

271
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:58,800
you're always a beginner and that is incredibly profound to always be a beginner and be content to practice with

272
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:07,560
how you are at any given time but if you do practice regularly every day every day that

273
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:12,800
slowly the tendency to go into deeper meditation will become easier and easier

274
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:18,640
there'll still be ups and downs through the days and weeks depending what's happening in your in your life but you

275
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:23,680
you're predisposing yourself to be able to go further and further over time and

276
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:29,839
for this samadei series as I've said uh this is a time in the series where I

277
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:37,359
want to encourage you again to consider meditating more uh maybe twice a day I

278
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:45,359
mean one once with with this uh YouTube offering then maybe one time on your own

279
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:51,119
then uh or if you really needed to support would like to support you can listen to the guided meditation again a

280
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:56,520
second time but it really kind of make this more part of your

281
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:03,720
life and so as you go through your daily life today um look again for the look for the

282
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:10,640
pleasure look for the times of well-being for most people there's a lot

283
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:17,040
more pleasure a lot more things that are joyful that's that are available to us

284
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:22,319
than we avail ourselves of that we take time to experience

285
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:28,160
the weather it's springtime here in the northern hemisphere maybe maybe there's

286
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:35,160
delightful colors of green or flowers or new life being born or maybe

287
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:42,160
there's delightful animal running around that brings you a lot of pleasure you see

288
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:50,640
someone smiling whatever it might be the small pleasures of life take time to feel those and your

289
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:55,839
ability to let go and feel the small pleasures might support you to feel

290
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:04,680
those pleasures in meditation as well may you be happy thank you
