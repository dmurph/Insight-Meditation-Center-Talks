1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,639
good evening welcome

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:14,320
welcome lovely to see you all here thank you for ringing the bell Jim

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,960
it was a little bit loud and I thought I don't know it just made me happy like it's Memorial Day

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,599
boom it was really nice

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,398
so I wanted to start with a little bit of a poem today that in some maybe not

6
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,640
completely directly way that kind of like honors this idea of people dying in

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,840
wars and the wish for wars to end those of you who have been listening

8
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,960
to me for a while will not be surprised by the poet it's uh Rosemary

9
00:00:51,960 --> 00:01:00,000
Tramer and this poem is called because it's because by Rosemary Tramer

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,240
and it goes like this so I can't save the

11
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:15,680
world can't even save myself can't wrap my arms around every frightened child

12
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:23,799
can't foster peace among nations can't bring love to all who feel

13
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:29,040
unlovable so I practice opening my heart

14
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,360
right here in this room and being gentle with

15
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:42,280
my insufficiency i practice walking down the street heart

16
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:50,360
first and if it is insufficient to share love I will practice loving

17
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:56,720
anyway i want to converse about truth about trust i want to invite compassion

18
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:02,240
into every interaction one willing heart can't stop

19
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,399
a war one willing heart can't feed all the

20
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:15,319
hungry and sometimes daunted by a task too big I tell myself what's the use of

21
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:21,080
trying but today the invitation is

22
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:27,680
clear to be ridiculously courageous in love

23
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:34,599
to open the heart like a lilac in May knowing freeze is possible and opening

24
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:41,440
anyway to take love seriously to give love wildly to race up to the world as

25
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:48,560
if I were a puppy adoring and unjaded stumbling upon my own exuberance

26
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:59,480
to feel the shock of indifference of anger of cruelty of fear and stay

27
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:08,640
open to love as if it matters as if the world depends on

28
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:15,720
it this is because by Rosemary

29
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:21,599
Tra this is a a beautiful poem and there's lots of things I could say about it

30
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:27,360
a few things I want to pull out uh this evening is we could say that part of

31
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:34,239
meditation practice is like in the gross generalization but in a way that can be

32
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,280
really helpful to think about too is this movement from just concepts and

33
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:46,200
ideas and living in our minds to actually being present for our

34
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,680
experience like what's actually happening this moment and instead of all

35
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,720
the thinking that's going on in the ways that we think it should be and disappointed how it's not and that kind

36
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,080
of thing and she has this poem so I can't

37
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:10,319
save the world and then she continues so I practice opening my heart right here in

38
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:17,120
this room this idea of I can't save the world in some ways you know the world is just

39
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:24,800
an idea in our head in some ways right we don't experience erience the world we experience whatever's being experienced

40
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,560
in this moment and so she's practicing to be

41
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:37,520
meet her bring her heart uh bring her love to just what's actually being known

42
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:46,040
in this moment and we could say all of this meditation of practice is about this is about noticing all the ideas we

43
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:53,280
have about what should be and what shouldn't be who we are who we aren't those people over there how they should

44
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,360
be different or how I should be different you know all these thoughts that we

45
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,960
have just noticing that they're just thoughts it turns

46
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:10,000
out and what are thoughts they're they're just right they're insubstantial

47
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,720
ephemeral how many quadrillion bazillion thoughts have you already had in contrast to hearing the voice

48
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:25,919
feeling the pressure against the chair the cushion maybe there's an emotion that's being pre being experienced at

49
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:32,560
this moment so we could say that this is one uh arc

50
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,759
of this poem one kind of uh element that's been being expressed in this poem

51
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:45,039
but I appreciate that she also talks about this feeling of insufficiency this feeling like yeah

52
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:51,280
whatever I'm going to do it's not going to be enough this sense of like being inadequate not quite enough maybe not

53
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:58,680
good enough or inadequate in some kind of way and of course those are also

54
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,960
thoughts but uh there's a way in which we can really I don't know grab on to

55
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:13,759
those ones those particular thoughts and make them feel like well these ones are true those thoughts about the snowman I

56
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,160
had earlier today that that was just a thought but uh this this feeling of

57
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:25,479
inadequacy that that must be true and she

58
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:32,759
says "I practice opening my heart right here in this room." And then the line

59
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:38,639
continues and being gentle with my insufficiency so there's this way of

60
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,880
like being gentle with one's feeling of inadequacy or

61
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,960
insufficiency she's not talking about being feel filled with shame she's not

62
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:55,440
talking about pretending like it's not there just acknowledging yep there's a feeling

63
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,960
of insufficiency like I can't do enough or I'm not enough in some kind of way

64
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,599
there's some power in just saying it yeah this feeling is

65
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:13,919
here and we might say that it's you know this turns out to be

66
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,080
so common not everybody has this but it was a big wakeup call for me when in

67
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,440
part of my training to be a Dharma teacher to initially to be sitting in on

68
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:32,800
practice discussions that another teacher was doing and just to see how person after person after person on

69
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,800
retreats would come in all the details different but all of the sharing this

70
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:45,560
flavor of I'm not good enough it was really heartbreaking to realize

71
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:53,440
wow so many people are having this feeling and we could say well maybe it's

72
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,639
not surprising there's so many messages we get from our culture from our family

73
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:04,000
from our upbringing education there's all kinds of reasons

74
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,000
and there's also maybe even this way in which the we see these messages that

75
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,479
uh it's a individuality like okay you know I have to do it all by myself I got

76
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:22,560
to make it happen and I want this and I don't care what you want you know I'm exaggerating a little bit but there's

77
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:30,039
this way in which this message is there in order for you to succeed you got to go out and do all kinds of

78
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:37,360
stuff or or if you aren't like that or if you do say you know I need to uh like

79
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:44,320
honor and respect my actual experience right now there's a way and sometimes it can seem like selfish if you're not out

80
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:51,959
there trying to save the world or doing I don't know trying

81
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:58,560
to end the hunger that she talks about in this poem so there's been a way in which we've

82
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:05,279
kind of uh often been dismissive of our what's happening to us our inner life

83
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:11,959
our specifics in this way that kind of like undermines

84
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:18,959
our sense of worth maybe our sense of being okay sense of being adequate or

85
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:25,519
sufficient so there's this way in which with

86
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:32,760
Buddhist practice some of you may be familiar with this is

87
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,839
that we don't have to wait for chance or

88
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,880
we don't have to assume that we have to have have had

89
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,399
a different childhood or something in order to feel okay inside

90
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,440
instead this is something that can be cultivated and in fact we would say

91
00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:00,959
needs to be cultivated and it's a tremendous benefit for one's life to cultivate this feeling

92
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:07,480
of warm-heartedness this feeling of goodwill not only to

93
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,519
ourselves but to others and to all

94
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:21,680
beings this like expanding out this feeling of care and warmth and goodwill

95
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:28,240
respect and in Buddhist practice this gets uh developed we would say to these

96
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,880
universal uh dimensions having this without limits without

97
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:39,880
exceptions without distinctions just having this orientation of

98
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:47,360
goodwill and for some of us we might hear something like that like Oh isn't that cute and might feel like maybe this is

99
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,480
saccharine or artificial or feels uh

100
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,959
ooey gooey in some kind of way but there is this way in which we

101
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:08,120
can train the heart and the mind and that it does have this natural

102
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:15,440
orientation towards goodwill or warmth or care or love and

103
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:22,000
kindness or respect different words to uh you can choose which word

104
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,600
you like the best often this is called meta meta often gets translated as

105
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:36,000
loving kindness but it's not a like a single thing it's not like a single

106
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:45,519
feeling and we're like do I have it do I not have it like it's this binary switch or something like this more it's like a

107
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,680
maybe sometimes it feel like it has some warmth or and

108
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:57,760
gentleness or maybe sometimes it feels bright and energetic or maybe sometimes

109
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:06,240
it has this quality of healing and caring for ourselves or for others but

110
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,680
maybe it has a soothing quality to it just this

111
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:20,800
warmheartedness or maybe even that's going too far maybe it's just this softness and

112
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:28,160
openness because when I first started practicing with meta with loving kindness I started to notice like how

113
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:35,120
all the ways in which I wasn't feeling loving kindness all the times and places

114
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,560
I got irritated or annoyed with myself with other people

115
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:47,600
was kind of really highlighted that and it was uncomfortable it was hard to see that i thought I was a nice person but

116
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:54,880
then I started to notice everything that wasn't meta started showing up and this turns out I didn't know it

117
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:01,279
at the time but this is a standard part of the practice it's not a mistake it can feel

118
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:08,600
like oh I must be doing this wrong but it's part of this we could say the

119
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:14,160
purification the cleansing the opening of the heart and

120
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:20,000
mind so some of you will be familiar with this idea of loving kindness

121
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
practice this uh just briefly I'll say that it's

122
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,360
a practice um it's a all it's a like a different meditation

123
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:38,800
practice and maybe as a brief aside I will say Monday through Friday 6:00 p.m

124
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:46,079
to 7:00 p.m is uh what we call happy hour that's happening on Zoom so 5 days

125
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:52,920
a week this is uh being taught that type of meditation practice on the IMC website you can find a link

126
00:13:52,920 --> 00:14:01,279
there and I taught that for a number of years it was beautiful beautiful all these people that uh coming to I don't

127
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:07,399
know open the heart so briefly I'll describe what is that

128
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:15,800
practice start where it's easy absolute easiest like the easiest to feel

129
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:20,959
warm-heartedness for many people this kittens or puppies or babies maybe like

130
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:28,920
generic kittens puppies babies whatever it feels like oh whatever whatever kind of has that feeling for

131
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:34,079
you and then you maybe like connect with this what we can call a lovable being

132
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:40,480
this could be an actual kitten puppy baby that you know maybe grandchild or

133
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:48,000
maybe there's somebody in your life that's really helped you often it's like maybe coaches or mentors or teachers or

134
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:55,800
somebody that has really uh touched you in some kind of way that you easily have a sense of uh

135
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:01,199
appreciation bring them to mind and then to help the mind and the heart kind of

136
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:09,680
like soften and stay connected we repeat phrases may you be safe may you be happy

137
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:16,959
may you be healthy may you live with ease these aren't prayers as much as

138
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:24,880
it's just this intention this wish for goodwill for this person and that could be it it could be

139
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:30,880
that simple just stay in words absolute easy and sending goodwill to this

140
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:36,880
lovable being many of you will be familiar with but there's to go on to all these

141
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:43,360
different categories but uh what I've discovered from teaching this and with my own practice if you just stay where

142
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:50,079
it's easy it just naturally overflows into the other categories we don't have to force

143
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:55,120
ourselves because sometimes then it feels too contrived and uh constrained

144
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,639
instead it can be really helpful to just connect with a lovable being

145
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:06,720
i could give talks and talks about this and I have but uh and just connect with

146
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:14,480
this sense of goodwill or warm-heartedness and there's Rob Burbaya

147
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:20,720
who was a dharma teacher he's uh did a number of uh dharma talks and did a

148
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,920
number of retreats on meta and he had this uh expression that I really

149
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:31,000
appreciated about it he said "We don't have to be a squeaky clean meta

150
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:40,240
machine." Like this idea like when we hear these ideas of loving kindness we might have this idea that well it feels

151
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,920
like maybe it's robotic we repeat phrases and we wishing goodwill maybe it

152
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:52,120
seems a little unreal or unrealistic in some kind of way

153
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:59,680
but there's a way in which we all of us it it uh allows our personality our

154
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:05,918
uniqueness to be a part of it it's not like we're just uh marching along to a

155
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:13,600
particular drummer and exact in step it allows us it honors our own humanness

156
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,678
our own potential for having big beautiful

157
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:24,400
hearts and importantly this meta practice we start

158
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:31,679
with where it's the easiest and sometimes then intentionally

159
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,799
often not always turning towards ourselves

160
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:46,760
may I be safe may I be happy may I be healthy may I live with

161
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:53,559
ease it turns out this is really difficult for a lot of people this whole

162
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:59,720
notion of uh just caring for oneself or sending love for oneself is

163
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:06,400
uncomfortable but there's this [Music] way that it can make such a giant

164
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:13,880
difference as I said before some people feel like "Oh that's selfish i should only be doing it for others."

165
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:20,440
But we could say that having a relationship with ourselves of care and

166
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:27,840
warmth then we stop demanding it from everybody else we stop demanding it from

167
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,280
everyone else and then just think how your life is different if you don't feel

168
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:39,720
like every you have to just always be uh met with care and warmth and uh some

169
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,880
love just think how your life would be different if you had this healthy

170
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,799
positive regard for yourself you'd be willing to take risks learn new things

171
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:57,600
you'd be creative like you because you're not so much afraid of fear you don't have fear of failing like oh okay

172
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,640
that creative thing didn't work that's okay i'm still okay even though I did

173
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,120
this or what would it be like to just love others

174
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:15,280
freely and maybe they exchange or maybe they uh reciprocate love and maybe they

175
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:23,600
don't but just love what's lovable about people and then you'll find that people

176
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:30,799
start to show you their lovable the most lovable aspects it's quite something if

177
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:39,840
we kind of there's a way in which what we expect from people they often are showing us not in the obvious ways that we we'd

178
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:46,160
think but it's quite remarkable don't underestimate how

179
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:53,399
powerful this can be to have this positive regard for ourselves

180
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:01,360
so not only does it help our love our life unfold in a different way but it

181
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:07,440
becomes a foundation from which we can give to others it becomes a foundation

182
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,919
from which we can grow from or build from

183
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:19,039
so rather than it being about what we think we deserve or what what we think

184
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:25,080
that we've done or not done it's this this recognition

185
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:32,200
that we exist we're here and that's good

186
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:38,880
enough it turns out that's good enough it's not like we have to achieve

187
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:45,799
and attain something and this such a way in which it definitely is a gift to

188
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:51,840
others not kind of like demanding this love from

189
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:57,120
others and then maybe I would say importantly

190
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,360
there's this warmheartedness towards ourselves helps us

191
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:10,240
meet our resistance to so much of what's happening in our life it's not uncommon

192
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:17,320
for us to meet our experiences with this subtle or obvious no i don't want

193
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:25,520
that i don't want to feel that pain in my knee i don't want to feel hungry i

194
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,799
don't want to be too hot i don't want to have a boss that's like this i don't want this i don't want that i don't want

195
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:37,120
this i don't want that and so much of our life is saying like "No no no no."

196
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:44,400
And often this no is thoughts because we've thought up in our

197
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:50,039
mind completely 100% made up in our minds how things should

198
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:56,799
be and then we lay that on top of what's actually happening and they never match

199
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:02,880
it's I don't I'm saying the word never rarely let's say rarely what's made up

200
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,000
in the mind isn't precisely matching what's actually happening and then with

201
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,720
this what's made up in the mind somehow seems to be the what's the authoritative and there's this way we're saying no no

202
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:20,640
because it doesn't match this and this practice is about saying yes to what's

203
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:27,679
actually happening what's actually happening sometimes is uncomfortable what's

204
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:33,080
actually happening is frightening what's actually happening is

205
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:40,760
sad what's actually happening is beautiful or joyful and lovely as

206
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:46,799
well but there's something when we stop fighting with things and being

207
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:52,320
disappointed in them and saying no to them and just meeting them like we saw

208
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,760
in this poem there's this way in which there's this

209
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:04,159
relief of just putting down the burden of always trying to make things be

210
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:10,320
different i am not saying to be passive i am not saying don't have goals and

211
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:16,880
work towards them i'm just saying notice how often you're saying no and subtle

212
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:23,919
and obvious ways and doing this loving kindness for ourselves helps us say yes

213
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:29,360
to what's happening the uncomfortable experiences because let's be frank a lot

214
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:36,559
a large part of life is uncomfortable it's doesn't go exactly

215
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:44,320
the way we thought sometimes it goes better and sometimes it's just different it's just

216
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:52,480
different it's not better or worse so how can we or maybe I should say I

217
00:23:52,480 --> 00:24:01,440
want to say a little bit more about resistance there's this way about like acknowledging the resistance

218
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,960
and like maybe even just be becoming familiar with the experience of resistance this way in which we're

219
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:13,520
saying no I want it to be different if we can say yes to the

220
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,960
resistance like the resistance doesn't have to go away just say yes to the resistance because that's what's

221
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,000
happening in the present moment it turns out this can be a

222
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,520
gateway to more and more freedom this is a definitely a gateway to a way in which

223
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,559
your life can have much more peace and ease

224
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:40,919
this way of which going into the resistance can be a

225
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:48,919
portal into as I said so many of the ways in which we're saying no and they begin to

226
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:55,559
soften they begin to maybe we're choosing what we've been

227
00:24:55,559 --> 00:25:00,799
rejecting in some kind of way sometimes the way the reason why we're saying no

228
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:06,240
is because maybe there's an aspect of ourselves or um something we're really

229
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:13,080
trying to avoid because it's uncomfortable but saying yes is a way in which things can kind of be more

230
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:19,360
collected we don't have to try to excise those uncomfortable parts and they start

231
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,400
becoming together and there's a sense of wholeness that starts to become gets

232
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:32,720
created and experienced so loving kindness for oneself really

233
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:40,559
can make this giant difference in our lives it might seem sappy and I like

234
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:45,640
this word saccharine but it turns out to be really

235
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,799
powerful really powerful to help us meet what's

236
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:59,360
arising you might say okay well that sounds nice but uh is there a way that we can do this cuz really I you know

237
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,640
it's not so easy necessarily i know for me the first

238
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:12,000
time that I did ment I thought like yeah yeah yeah give me the real stuff i I

239
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:19,360
wanted to uh you know do some insight practice and insight practice is absolutely important and uh is a

240
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:26,559
integral part of this path toward freedom but I would say you there will be a limit to how far you can go with

241
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:31,760
insight practice if it's not also a certain amount of willingness to open

242
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:37,360
and soften the heart so how can we do

243
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:45,480
this there's this way can we just have a little this a little confidence in the

244
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:51,720
notion of practicing with loving kindness is very much like planting

245
00:26:51,720 --> 00:27:01,039
seeds planting seeds in the soil so we often don't see when seeds in

246
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:08,520
the soil are starting to germinate and they do their first part of growth right there in the soil we don't see

247
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:14,480
them in the same way love and kindness practice wishing goodwill for the

248
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:21,039
lovable being may you be safe may you be happy may you be healthy may you live

249
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:26,400
with ease you can feel like really is this all I'm going to do but there's a

250
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,960
way in which it kind of like conditions we could use the expression

251
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:38,720
neuroplasticity is this continue reorientation this

252
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:46,440
reorientation and it gives the mind something to do other than ruminating about terrible unhelpful

253
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:52,559
things not even terrible but so many of our thoughts turn out to not be so as

254
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:58,559
helpful as helpful as we wish they would be or could be so what helps this meta

255
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:05,960
to expand and to have a big impact in our life it's a little bit of confidence or

256
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:13,279
trust and this idea that even though we can't see that the seeds that were planted are immediately sprouting

257
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:18,399
doesn't mean that they're not having an impact doesn't mean that they're not

258
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:25,840
having an impact and if it feels like well this is kind of dry and mechanical

259
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:31,919
i'm not so sure about this or even if we feel as I said

260
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:39,600
earlier I started to everything that wasn't loving kindness started to come up all this anger I couldn't believe it and this hatred like wow we're like I

261
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:45,200
was so surprised so surprised by it it just started to come up so I was on a

262
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,240
retreat and I had been practicing for some time with loving kindness and I was

263
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:57,039
very sheepishly telling the meditation teacher and she's like "It's okay it's okay Diana just keep going just keep

264
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:03,520
going." And I trusted her and I did and it made a a big difference

265
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:10,080
so even if what's coming up is the opposite of uh love and kindness can you

266
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:16,399
hang in there with it and not jump too much into judging how things are like ah

267
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:26,320
this doesn't work or I don't like it or something like that because maybe there's this sense in

268
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:35,200
which what's going on under the radar isn't uh maybe isn't seen isn't and

269
00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:45,120
felt so you might say well what's the relationship between loving kindness practice and insight practice and I'll

270
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:52,159
just say briefly different people practice it different ways some people will and there's been

271
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:59,039
seasons of my practice that I've done it differently but you some people will start the first part of their they'll do

272
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:07,520
5 10 15 minutes of loving kindness practice and then do 15 30 minutes of uh

273
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:14,480
insight practice or there'll be some people who will just start without insight practice

274
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,760
or I'll say mindfulness of breathing and then realize is "Oh my

275
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:26,399
gosh the mind is crazy all over the place and I'm really agitated and restless." And so then they'll just

276
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:31,600
switch to loving kindness practice which has a calming and a soothing way to do

277
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:37,039
it and some people will just say "Okay I don't know Monday Wednesday Friday I'll

278
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:43,440
do loving kindness tuesday Thursday Saturday Sunday I'll do uh mindfulness and breathing." Or Mondays I don't know

279
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:49,120
you just like do a whole sit one or the other so you can play around with it

280
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:54,480
explore with it and you'll start to see that if we have this loving kindness

281
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,679
practice it really starts to impact the like mindfulness of breathing the insight practice there's this

282
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:05,279
warm-heartedness that starts to show up with whatever is being known whatever is

283
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:11,200
being seen with our meditation practice it just starts to unfold in a

284
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,440
much more smooth way helpful way

285
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:24,720
so I'm going to read this poem again maybe in this uh context after her

286
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:30,320
hearing this this poem is called because by

287
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:38,240
Rosemary Tramer so I can't save the world can't

288
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,840
save even myself can't wrap my arms around every frightened child can't

289
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:50,679
foster peace among nations can't bring love to all who feel

290
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:59,600
unlovable so I practice opening my heart right here in this room and being gentle

291
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:06,799
with my insufficiency i practice walking down the street heart first

292
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:13,480
and if it is insufficient to share love I will practice loving

293
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:19,440
anyway i want to converse about truth about trust i want to invite compassion

294
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,640
into every interaction one willing heart can't stop

295
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:30,720
a war one willing heart can't feed all the hungry and sometimes daunted by a

296
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:36,960
task too big I tell myself what's the use of trying

297
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,279
but today the invitation is clear to be

298
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:48,320
ridiculously courageous in love to open the heart like a lilac and

299
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:55,440
may knowing freeze is possible and opening anyway to take love seriously to give

300
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:01,679
love wildly to race up to the world as if I were a puppy adoring and unjaded

301
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:07,919
stumbling on my own exuberance to feel the shock of indifference of

302
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:16,600
anger of cruelty of fear and stay open to love as if it

303
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:21,600
matters as if the world depends on

304
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:31,279
it to love as if it matters as if the world depends on it

305
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:39,840
so I think I'll close there and open it up to see if there's some questions or comments so thank

306
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:54,720
you so when I was 21 um like my uncle was in the Navy he was

307
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:00,799
a pilot and I was a really good athlete i was working out all the time i I was thinking about trying to become a Navy

308
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:07,600
Seal the good trying to apply and see what would happen well ultimately stopped me was I thought you know what i

309
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:14,800
don't think I could shoot anyone i couldn't kill anyone so I didn't even I just said "Forget it." My question is

310
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,919
hypothetical question is for someone who is a Navy Seal and the president has

311
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:26,000
ordered them to assassinate uh some terrorist leader can they have loving

312
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,118
kindness for who they're about to kill do you think or would they have to kind of like suspend that within themselves

313
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:36,280
so they could so they could do the mission i don't

314
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:42,720
know i'm not a Navy Seal and I haven't been in that position so I I don't I

315
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:48,480
don't spec I don't need to speculate i can't speculate exactly but yeah no I

316
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:54,720
love your talk cuz your talk was why I chose not to do it i can't do that i

317
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:00,079
just couldn't do that you know my my uncle wanted me to and he was pushing me to but I said you know I can't I I

318
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:06,480
couldn't I couldn't shoot someone so that's why I just gave up on that so and

319
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:15,240
there's lots of avenues of things to do with one's life other than that yeah great thank you thank you

320
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:27,440
thank you for the speech um in the middle of the speech that you mentioned uh meta the loving love kindness uh

321
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,800
practice would help with the aversion and that will help us to say

322
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:38,400
yes to the reality um yeah I heard about that too

323
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:46,000
could you I mean I was on a retreat and my teacher taught about talk mentioned that too but that was inside tree so

324
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:53,760
they didn't talk further so I could you like elaborate more how the like what

325
00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:00,640
part of the practice will help us say yes to the reality yeah yeah so let's

326
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:06,960
I'm just going to make this up let's say that you're at a dharma talk on a Monday night in a meditation center and let's

327
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:14,880
say that you feel like oh why is this person talking so long i want to go home so there's a certain amount of aversion

328
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:21,440
can you just recognize the experience of the aversion not what's you don't have

329
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:28,960
to uh change what's happening an aversion and how does that get experienced it's often like maybe

330
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:34,960
tightening of the jaw there maybe the shoulders go up and maybe there's this like sense of restlessness like wanting

331
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:43,200
to leave so to be willing to even turn towards the aversion is not so easy

332
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:49,040
because so often we have aversion to aversion so this like the loving

333
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:54,480
kindness practice to help us soften up like okay I'll I'll she's saying in this

334
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:02,720
I forgot what the exact line is but to have love the world okay can you just bring have this yes love the experience

335
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:08,160
and so what often happens is you have aversion to the aversion to the aversion and then you have aversion to the

336
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:14,640
aversion to the aversion and it just goes on and then at some point you're feeling like oh wait I think I can meet

337
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:21,040
this this experience and it doesn't matter whether it's the third iteration

338
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:28,240
of a version or the first or the 300th but there's this way with softening the

339
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:33,680
heart somehow just makes it easier to turn towards

340
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,960
it thank you

341
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:47,800
anybody else have a comment or a question yeah right behind you can

342
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:56,720
Thank you for this reminder can you Can you use it put the microphone like this like this yeah there we go yeah thank

343
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:03,520
you for this reminder that this practice can help us open to what's happening and

344
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:09,760
not turn away from it one way I heard this phrase is to make fear feel safe

345
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:16,480
which I didn't always understand what that meant but I think I do now thank you yes yes make fear feel safe this is

346
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:22,160
exactly that is to have some warm-heartedness towards towards the uh

347
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:28,400
what's being experienced thank you thank you for the beautiful words uh and

348
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:35,680
the poem my question is regarding um just if you could comment a bit on

349
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:42,240
when this feeling of um you know wanting to care for oneself

350
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:52,000
uh arises but then there's this other other uh uh force that is like um maybe

351
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,560
inertia or just as you said like just the forces of the world and so on uh

352
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:06,400
what type of things uh can we do to to promote this sort of um just

353
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:14,800
caring for oneself mhm mhm can you care for that feeling of not

354
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:20,720
wanting to care for yourself whether it's the inertia or you know often there's this sense like no you have to

355
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:28,320
work harder you have to achieve more attain more right there's so much of that message can you care for that feeling

356
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:36,160
like oh yeah okay oh here's that feeling i have to achieve more i have to attain more hello that feeling I kind of wish

357
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:41,359
you weren't here but here you are so there's this way we don't just to

358
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:49,040
acknowledge it and it doesn't mean that we're not going to stop wanting to achieve and attain immediately but to

359
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:56,520
not make that be a problem what happens is things start to just come together and it's like oh yeah okay this feeling

360
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:02,800
of drive achieve attain and even sometimes to not take care of myself

361
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:10,480
okay that can be part of the mix too and I also have this feeling of wanting to take care of myself and can I honor and

362
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:17,359
respect that there's these two different things that are going on and can that be okay and so without

363
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:24,160
insisting that one's wrong and one's right And that's the beginning like it was like okay yeah it's a mixture it's

364
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:29,599
not neat and tidy it's not so obvious sometimes how to go forward or with

365
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:36,960
wanting to take care of oneself but for that to be okay

366
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,200
thank you

367
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:51,720
anybody else have something they'd like to say sure

368
00:40:54,160 --> 00:41:01,280
i forget how to do this like so okay thank you well I always feel like I have

369
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:07,480
to fix the world i have to fix all the things I don't like that I see in the world and other people too of course of

370
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:16,319
course that's how it works and I can't seem to get away from that i don't It's just this obsession I have like if I see

371
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:22,319
a woman walking down the street and she's just she could so looks so much light nicer than she looks but she's

372
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:27,440
dress dressing like a slob and all she has to do is just you know what not much

373
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:34,560
but you know it sounds like maybe you know what I'm talking about maybe I don't know

374
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:39,839
yeah this is quite something so I have a few things to say about this okay um

375
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:46,960
often when we're about the way that we have about what we're seeing external it's not so different than what's

376
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:52,000
happening internally that same kind of voice is often where think like oh I

377
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,359
really should be doing this or that and that person over there really should be doing this and that the same type of

378
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:05,680
thing if you look closely we'll see these same type of uh energies so that's actually me then and

379
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:12,880
not the other person right we're just one person right and

380
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:19,359
we're not like we have a completely different inner life that's uh completely separated from our outer life

381
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:24,480
but often our inner life is really uncomfortable for whatever reasons so

382
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:31,119
we're really focused out there like I want to fix things and this idea of

383
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:36,400
wanting to fix things is related to wanting to control things of course we

384
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:42,240
want to control the world and so there's because then everything would be fine right

385
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:48,720
but turns out right we don't control other people and we don't control the world but we keep trying but there's

386
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,880
this way if we can just realize yeah actually I don't

387
00:42:53,880 --> 00:43:01,760
control this or that or this person or that or that turns out we control so

388
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:09,200
much less than we think we do and just even noticing that makes your life just

389
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:15,599
go so much easier just to recognize oh yeah I don't have to control what's happening over there and to kind of step

390
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:20,640
back and be with our own experience because it's frustrating because we

391
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:26,000
don't control things and yet we keep on trying so these are two big giant things

392
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:32,640
the idea of trying to control and the way that often we're busy with things out there I'm using this word busy just

393
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:38,079
to this we're oriented towards things out there when what's in here is really

394
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:44,839
uncomfortable or Maybe not always uncomfortable it's just not a habit to

395
00:43:44,839 --> 00:43:50,160
be familiar with our what's happening with ourselves sometimes we've been

396
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:57,160
socialized or something to just really be focused outwards so I shouldn't say it's only just to be

397
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:03,520
uncomfortable how does this sound that sounds pretty good well a girlfriend of mine is just always trying to fix me

398
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:10,839
always so so my situ result what I should do is just change the subject

399
00:44:10,839 --> 00:44:16,640
right cuz she asked me how I am i tell him I tell her I how I am and then well

400
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:22,079
you did this you did that and have you thought about doing this and that i'm becoming like her in a way and I hate

401
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:29,280
that because I don't like when she tries to fix me well yeah and so what I'll tell you

402
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:35,200
sometimes what I say if this happens to me oh Diana you really should and I say I know wouldn't it be great if you could

403
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:40,560
control everything and then I kind of laugh and I recognize oh yeah okay I'm just trying

404
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:47,839
to control you Diana that's a pretty big responsibility yeah right right

405
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:57,200
so I I think we'll end there it's uh 8:30 here but thank you all for your

406
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:07,000
attention and your practice and I'm wishing you a lovely rest of the evening and safe travels home thank you

407
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:13,400
and if you'd like you're welcome to come up here and uh talk to me if you'd like
