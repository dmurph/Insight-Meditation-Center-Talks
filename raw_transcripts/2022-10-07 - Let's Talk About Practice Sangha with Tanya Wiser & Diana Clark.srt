20
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,139
so welcome welcome everybody for those of you who don't know me I'm Diana Clark

21
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:24,360
and uh I'm so delighted to be teaching with Tanya and especially on this topic

22
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:30,180
of songa because we've been friends for quite some time and we talk about

23
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:37,440
practice all the time right we talk about Dharma things and what a delight it is it makes such a difference

24
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:43,500
which one you just have a new part of my life has made a difference so

25
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:50,759
I wanted to start by talking about a little bit of a story that in the suit does that we find in this kind of the

26
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:57,000
ancient Buddhist literature and this story is about this character's name is megia

27
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,460
and he's the attendant of the Buddha some of you may have heard like Ananda

28
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:10,259
is the attendant of the Buddha but this is before Ananda so before Ananda was attendant megia was the attendant

29
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:15,300
and this one day maggia went out for alms around in the morning

30
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:22,500
you know nothing unusual about that and as he went out he noticed like oh

31
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:28,620
there's this mango Grove wow it looks so peaceful I think I'd like to go meditate

32
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,960
there this is a wholesome thing right he has this idea that he wants to go meditate

33
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:42,440
so after he comes back from the alms he says to the Buddha I saw this fantastic mango Grove I'm paraphrasing obviously

34
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:48,960
I'd like to go meditate there and the Buddha says no right now is not a good time

35
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,300
and Megan says no but I really want to and the Buddha says this is not the

36
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:59,400
right time and then magia says something like well

37
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:05,819
you don't have any more work to do but I have work to do and I really want to go meditate like recognizing he's not

38
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:12,660
awakened yet and he really wants to become awakened so the Buddha says okay

39
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:20,280
so Mega goes off into this mango Grove that he had seen he sits down in my mind

40
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,800
he's having it's you know ideal setting because he really wanted to go and he

41
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,620
has this kind of Gusto for practice and and he's sitting there in the Grove and

42
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:38,039
he's uh starts to meditate and he discovers that his mind is all over the

43
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:43,680
place and in not only that not only is he distracted but he's having all these

44
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:49,339
unwholesome thoughts that just keep on arising

45
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:56,459
hangs in there spends the day meditating and he says to himself I can't believe

46
00:08:56,459 --> 00:09:02,519
it I think uh in the quality I don't remember the Paulie words but in English it often gets translated like this is

47
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:07,800
incredible that my mind is so out of control and all these unwholesome things

48
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:13,980
are happening [Applause] so he comes back at the end and he tells

49
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:20,100
them Buddha to the Buddha this my mind was all over the place and I had all

50
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:25,200
these unwholesome thoughts arise I know for me I thought well this is

51
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:32,220
kind of surprising because maggia right he's a he was a monastic he

52
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:38,880
had completely dedicated his life to practice so this was you know in order to ordain means this is like the most

53
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,100
important thing ever and not only that was he a monastic but

54
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:50,339
he got to hang out with whom we might say is the world's greatest meditation teacher the Buddha right that was his

55
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:55,740
own personal teacher and he got to serve him and he has and he had all these

56
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:03,079
difficulties so this is what the Buddha tells him when after magia says this

57
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:09,120
for those whose freedom of mind is not fully mature he's just acknowledging

58
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:17,220
that Maggie is not quite awakened there are five things that lead to maturity what five

59
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:25,080
the first one megia a practitioner has a good friend a good companion a good

60
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:32,040
comrade this is the first thing that leads to freedom of mind

61
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:38,040
and then the suta continues with four more things I'll just mention them we're not going to talk about them virtue

62
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:43,080
having opportunities to talk about Derma topics having energy and effort which

63
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:50,160
will be next week and having wisdom it's striking to me that the Buddha his

64
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:58,079
instructions to maggia the first thing he says is the importance of good comrades good Associates and good a good

65
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:05,700
friend companion and comrades so it's not sufficient to dedicate your

66
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:10,980
life to practice but I also appreciate that the Buddha he's using three

67
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:17,820
different words different translators do it differently and this translated as friend companion

68
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:25,140
and comrad I'm understanding this to point to different levels of intimacy

69
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:31,260
like some people are our friends and we share lots of things with them

70
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:36,839
some are companions that maybe we don't share so much maybe some are comrades

71
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:43,740
that we maybe we don't even know their names maybe we'll never know their names but they were just people that were in

72
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:50,399
the meditation Hall with us I have this one time when I was sitting

73
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:57,240
a long retreat those of you who have a retreat practice you know how it is that you at the beginning of the retreat

74
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:04,019
before it's started you um often choose a sitting place and you choose you like

75
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:11,160
put your cushion there or you'll put something on a chair if you're going to sit on a chair and I kind of I have like a certain

76
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:17,579
region in the meditation Hall I like to go and I put my uh cushion on a zubutan

77
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:23,519
on a mat there and nobody else was in the hall so I had no idea like where I'm gonna be

78
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,860
and as it turned out when there was came time for uh you know all of us to be in

79
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:35,700
the hole I had a woman on one side and a man on the other side and um they were

80
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:40,980
both kneeling maybe a little bit like hamidra is here and when you're in the kneeling posture you're a little bit

81
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:46,560
taller so I felt like oh I kind of have like Mom and Dad here right you know next to

82
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,720
me it turned out to be so great they were

83
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:57,899
like so steady and I don't know I felt kind of like protected and

84
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:05,399
a happy and I was just an amazing Retreat for me actually just sitting

85
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:10,980
between these two people as it happened this was a long retreat

86
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:17,519
and it was a three-month retreat but I was only sitting six weeks so at the end

87
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:23,220
of the six weeks I got up you know and left and they were staying in silence so

88
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:28,920
I never knew their names I couldn't even tell you what they look like because right I saw them from the side of my

89
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:36,180
eyes but just this recognition that other people really support us and those people

90
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:42,540
probably will never know how much they supported me either so this idea of

91
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:49,019
good companions good friends good Associates is being foundational for

92
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:56,760
practice and then in the suit of the the Buddha is using this word good good friends

93
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:02,100
and the word good here is kaliana many of you might have heard of this

94
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:07,620
expression kalyanamita meet does the word friend and coliana

95
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:13,320
can mean good but it can also mean beautiful

96
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:20,519
so this idea beautiful like the way that maybe inspires us or touches Us in some

97
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:26,160
way it could also just be good it doesn't have to be you know elevated up into

98
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:33,420
something that's the the highest but does this recognition that we can

99
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:40,560
support one another and be supported by others but it's not so easy as just sitting

100
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:47,160
next to people silently I mean that's one way but it's not the only way because

101
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:53,399
there's a way in which if we're going to really learn from

102
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:59,040
people that we spend time with be influenced by or allow ourselves to be

103
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:05,160
supported by people that we spend time with there's a way in which we have to

104
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:11,579
be open to that we have to be like a willingness to

105
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:19,860
learn from others to be influenced by theirs so can we be teachable

106
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:25,320
sometimes there's people who show up and kind of like don't want to they are so

107
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:31,079
busy showing you how much they know that they don't uh ever learn anything like

108
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:37,800
they don't really want to acknowledge that there's something that they don't know so it's a little bit of humility to

109
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:45,420
recognize well can I learn from others can I be inspired by them and and

110
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:52,139
without feeling a sense of Envy or this sometimes we can have these mixed

111
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:57,420
feelings when other people have some knowledge or some experiences that we

112
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:05,820
don't have it also requires that we're not so attached to our views

113
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:12,959
it's related to you know having an open mind but it also includes views about

114
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:21,060
ourselves and the ways in which we've set up Us Versus Them me versus you kind of

115
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:26,880
dynamic in our life my type of people are like this not

116
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:33,720
those type of people you know in whatever way that we've done that in our lives and it's the human thing to do

117
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:39,360
right to kind of want to hang out with people that are similar to us but is

118
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:45,899
there a way in which we can relax that and be open to

119
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:52,079
whomever I mean here in the context of IMC and as a practitioner I've met

120
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:58,380
people from all kinds of different walks of life and different backgrounds different ages right that I would have

121
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:05,520
never have learned back in my kind of a the life that I had before where I was you know surrounded with people that had

122
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:12,058
similar livelihood than I did or the same neighborhood or something like that

123
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:17,640
so not only does it mean that we have to be open in our views but this may be one

124
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:24,178
way to say is to let go let go of some of our biases let go of some of our

125
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:30,299
assumptions about other people and

126
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:37,200
this is why I think that the Buddha is when he's telling megia how to

127
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:43,760
as a support from Megan's practice he's saying that the first thing is good

128
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:49,380
friends Companions and Associates because all the characteristics that

129
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:56,400
allows a person to be ported by learn from to and and to

130
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:02,520
support others are all the same practices the same way in which we're showing up in the world

131
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:09,299
for just freedom in general this letting go and willing to be

132
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:18,000
influenced and willing to have different experiences but I also want to say that there's

133
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,460
maybe uh something else here is this idea of discernment

134
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:30,660
this idea of good spiritual friend well how do we know

135
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:36,740
that's good and what's not

136
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:44,220
so we can ask ourselves does it feel like it supports greater freedom

137
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:49,740
and we all know that doesn't mean that it's Pleasant all the time right sometimes we have relationships with

138
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:56,640
people and it's not always smooth and you know rainbows and hearts

139
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:03,020
sometimes it's you know we have difficult conversations but is there a way in which people

140
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:08,340
are allowing the best sides of ourselves to show up

141
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:13,919
they're giving an opportunity for us to be the best versions of ourselves and

142
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:19,260
allowing the wisdom that all of us have to for us to tap into it and for it to

143
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:24,860
come forth or do we find that so the

144
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:30,419
habits are bad habits quote unquote that we have maybe tend to come out when

145
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:35,640
we're with somebody and we're finding that we have less freedom and more regret

146
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:41,460
when we spend time with them and this can be a really difficult thing

147
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:47,299
when we start spiritual practice I I think it's pretty common for people's

148
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:53,100
relationships to start to shift as they start to have maybe different priorities

149
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:59,820
or they understand themselves different or they understand what it means to really show up fully

150
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:05,760
and they're realizing oh yeah this relationship that I've had for so long

151
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:13,140
but now I feel like I maybe will limit though a time that I spend with this person or something like this or maybe

152
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:19,620
they realize wow this person here that I've kind of didn't I knew them but I

153
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:24,660
didn't spend that much time with them turns out to be really a great support

154
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:31,440
so discernment is also needed and of course this is something that the

155
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:38,340
is a big part of our practice is okay what's helpful and what's not

156
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:44,520
helpful so then maybe I'll just

157
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:50,039
um introduce something just a little bit here I've been talking about good spiritual

158
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:57,480
friends and Tanya introduced this idea as a songa so what's the difference between good

159
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:02,820
spiritual friends and songa maybe there's no difference

160
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:11,340
maybe there's a way in which we can understand Sangha as fellow practitioners or comrades in practice

161
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:18,660
I think that's in a kind of contemporary parlance we often use that language as kind of the song is just those people

162
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:24,000
that we practice with and those that are supporting our practice

163
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,460
in the literature of early Buddhism

164
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:34,799
the Sangha is defined as those people that have a certain amount of Awakening

165
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:43,980
I don't we don't use that so much uh these in fact I don't know anybody that does but it's also a nod to there are

166
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:50,640
people who have some freedom and it makes sense right there's people have been walking on this path longer than we

167
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,100
have to just kind of acknowledge that and is there something that we can learn from

168
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:03,120
them is there something that we can maybe emulate or be inspired by or work

169
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:10,919
with or something like this maybe maybe I'll just stop there as a

170
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:15,960
kind of like talking about introducing this idea of Sangha and good spiritual

171
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:21,080
friends so thank you thanks Diana

172
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:26,820
I have an idea but let's see if if it feels good

173
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:32,419
I wonder if we could make a circle that you guys could come a little closer

174
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:40,919
and instead of doing you know small groups or whatever let's be one group let's make a you know a Sangha

175
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:46,559
and um not make it but you know what I mean

176
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:51,960
um and uh Sage if you can come over with us

177
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:57,299
and um Sage maybe if you bring the microphone

178
00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:03,480
um and Ben maybe you can scoot your chair a little that way and then people

179
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:09,600
on YouTube might be able to see I don't know maybe if you pull back the camera a little bit the people on

180
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:17,960
YouTube might be able to see our group yes and it's a virtually a part of us

181
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:26,120
oh good great that's what this blue tape

182
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:37,700
yeah yeah to help so that somebody doesn't sit or

183
00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:44,820
yeah it comes come closer Sage thank you now I feel I feel you more not

184
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,899
that time that's okay

185
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:57,600
now it's live I don't know let me did you did you set it that's okay I'll set

186
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:03,600
it and my mic's still a little too loud your mic yeah is it this one here say

187
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:09,780
again my mic is there that's better okay yeah and let's see this is especially so

188
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:16,200
that you guys are close yeah so this is uh three

189
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:23,820
okay does this feel okay to all of you

190
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:31,080
nice Jeff okay with you okay yes yes very good

191
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:37,140
so I thought we could just um practice mindfulness of speaking and

192
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:42,720
listening with each other I'll kind of you've got the handout but

193
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:50,400
I'll kind of talk about what those guidelines are and um and then I'll I'll introduce a

194
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:56,220
maybe a way to get us started talking and listening mindfully

195
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:03,240
but um I think a huge part is uh

196
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:10,559
well let me say it is inspiring me to me to think about being here in this way with you right that at the time of the

197
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:15,679
Buddha people practiced in community

198
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:23,220
people didn't learn how to meditate on an app by themselves at home

199
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:29,120
they they learn to meditate with others

200
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:35,460
and um and you know people tell me a lot how uh and I experience it it feels

201
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:40,679
different to meditate with others you know it feels different than

202
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:47,220
meditating at home not that it's not nice to meditate at home by myself but but there's something profound and

203
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:53,760
obviously with everyone here but Ben maybe has been on a retreat

204
00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:00,419
um but Ben's been here a lot and um

205
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:05,700
so there you really kind of almost need for the amount of meditating you do

206
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:11,100
you're carried by everybody's practice around you and

207
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:20,400
holds the frame holds you up in a way so you know just uh

208
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:26,460
yeah and and thinking about being in the kind of

209
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:32,240
community that the Buddha taught would be more like being on Retreat people are

210
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,260
practicing they've got their however many hundred rules that they have to

211
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:42,360
follow to keep them Mindful and um

212
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:48,840
so here we'll just have a few rules you know that we're working on paying

213
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:56,340
attention to but first feel your bodies to me this is a huge support for staying mindful is to

214
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:02,100
feel our bodies here in this room and the space

215
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:07,679
and maybe I'll just say every part of you all of

216
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:14,580
you is welcome here every part of you all of you every feeling all of it is

217
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:21,020
welcome here Diana talked about

218
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:31,278
you know inclusion or in group I was thinking about the terms other ring and selfing

219
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:36,539
we do so much other ring and suffering and so my thought was let's invite each

220
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:42,179
other not to self and not to other during this practice and this little

221
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:47,279
group that I don't have to be any selfing

222
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:55,799
person that you make another and I don't need to make myself a self I can be in this experience and aware of

223
00:27:55,799 --> 00:28:01,320
it as it's happening and unfolding and with you and your experience as it's

224
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:08,760
unfolding so that what helps stop othering meaning

225
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:16,260
creating some idea of who you are what you are like what your story is what who

226
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:21,559
I what I think you're going to do next what I think you need to do

227
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:28,679
instead of all of that my my goal will be to sit back and be

228
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:36,720
surprised to let each of you surprise me by however it is you show up whatever you

229
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,880
do or don't share to not try and

230
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:49,820
make it into anything but to receive whoever you manifest into In This Moment

231
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:59,700
and being you know in my body and being grounded and feeling our feet

232
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:05,940
feeling having awareness of speaking and or of

233
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:11,460
listening as we listen or speak actually makes it kind of hard to do a lot of

234
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:16,980
othering and suffering it gives us something to let go into

235
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:24,120
instead of all of that creating of ourselves we devote that energy that

236
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:30,240
we would to creating a self or another to being aware

237
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,820
so no I'm speaking when I'm speaking

238
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:40,100
no I'm listening when I'm listening

239
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:49,380
talking a little slower than normal normal General conversation helps

240
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:55,919
tuning into the impact of my words or your words on my body

241
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,000
in my heart

242
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:07,980
allowing space for pausing not planning what I'm going to say in

243
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:13,679
advance allowing myself to speak spontaneously

244
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:20,159
when it's my turn so that I can keep being Changed by whatever next happens

245
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,659
whatever next I hear

246
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:34,919
it just like when we're sitting relaxation is helpful

247
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:41,520
so when you find yourself feeling some tension maybe tune in

248
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:49,340
and see if you can soften or support whatever it is that's tensing up

249
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:56,960
maybe even being able to be aware of breathing as you're breathing

250
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:01,880
and talking or listening

251
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,820
and maybe you just choose one of these things in particular that you want to

252
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:21,960
practice tonight it's a lot of different things but maybe you just tune in to one of

253
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:27,620
them in particular that you feel would be supportive for you

254
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:33,240
so what I thought I'd share first what I thought would be nice is Diana shared a

255
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:40,440
story about being on Retreat and feeling supported by the two people on her side

256
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:46,260
and that made me I could I felt a lot of warmth when you were sharing that and

257
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:52,039
just that sense of being supported by others and it reminded me of a story

258
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:58,500
a very different kind of story where I felt supported by a spiritual friend kalyanamita

259
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,539
I was um I had been here for a Sunday morning talk

260
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:09,480
and was with um several of my friends at the time and

261
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:15,360
we decided to go out to breakfast together and we were in the car on the way to the

262
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:21,419
breakfast or on the way back I don't remember which I don't even remember what we were

263
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:28,460
talking about but there was the conversation

264
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:36,380
started to move in a Direction where there was some

265
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:41,820
critical elements to it there was

266
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:49,919
I don't know what it was but there was a little bit of um like somebody could maybe be harsh or

267
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:55,919
it wasn't anything blatant or awful but there was one person

268
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:01,380
who just got very quiet they stopped talking when the

269
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:07,140
conversation started to get a little edgy and I really noticed it I could feel it

270
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:12,779
I could feel their Stillness I could feel they're not kind of you know when you're doing gossipy thing and people

271
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:20,220
are going yeah yeah but nope this person was not nope and I felt it it was like it was

272
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:26,460
like a a weight that pulled me back and made me mindful

273
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:32,519
and aware and I chose to be careful about

274
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:38,159
how I engaged and for me I was really visceral

275
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:43,320
experience it was very powerful because this person said nothing their whole

276
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:50,039
impact the whole thing they did was to say nothing and I felt it and I was supported by

277
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:56,100
that it was a beautiful gift to me from us kalyanamita

278
00:33:56,279 --> 00:34:02,580
so that's the story about Sangha I'll share and then

279
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:08,820
we we can popcorn it or we can go around in the circle and I'll invite should we just go in a circle so it's

280
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:14,580
predictable yeah Richard would you start would you be willing to share a story

281
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:22,460
for you that speaks to kalyanamita with the microphone

282
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:42,720
well to be honest I'm a little reluctant to do so because I just finished Gill's three

283
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:48,240
week and one of the things that I became very uh

284
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:53,339
aware of is my tendency to story hmm

285
00:34:53,339 --> 00:35:01,080
and it's not so helpful to me just as honest as I

286
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,400
can about it and

287
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:17,099
but I can't imagine my life at this point

288
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:22,260
without the friends who support me in in this

289
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:30,019
practice and that I support in this practice so I have

290
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:37,440
countless examples of that you two sitting there is one example

291
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:43,740
so and this young man am I right we just sat this Retreat together and it

292
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:49,099
was very very special for me to have him there so

293
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:57,440
that's about all I'll say right now vows to you Richard thank you

294
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:08,760
hi my name is Jeff um yeah just coming off retreat

295
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:14,160
um yeah being at the retreat

296
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:21,500
with experienced practitioners which yeah um

297
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:28,039
it was really inspiring there were there were people that just

298
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:35,099
were so embodied and so they just felt like they were really

299
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:41,540
Mindful and with their experience and I tend to watch people

300
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:46,619
and I think I learned from doing that so

301
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:53,339
um yeah just seeing seeing people on that Retreat I I feel like I learned

302
00:36:53,339 --> 00:37:01,520
from just being in their presence and it was it was a beautiful experience

303
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:20,579
is this okay beautiful Ben thank you yeah um as I was listening to talk just now

304
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:29,940
um um I started my mind started wondering

305
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:35,579
and that

306
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:42,180
I mean I wouldn't call it an epiphany like I think I always knew it but it kind of solidified it for me

307
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:49,320
that um all of these teaching

308
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:57,060
is about it's teaching you teaching me at least I'm learning

309
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:04,859
how to live better in community with other people

310
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:12,500
and all of these sitting still

311
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:19,619
being quiet being observant

312
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:24,660
it's it's it's not about you

313
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:31,400
it's about everybody that's that's why

314
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:49,260
um so Ben and I are married have been married for 30 no yes I don't know some

315
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:55,380
years 30 some years um we just forgot our anniversary last week

316
00:38:55,380 --> 00:39:01,500
so um but what thank you

317
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:09,599
and we've been practicing for a few years maybe me a little bit more but both of

318
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:15,420
us at IMC and I was thinking

319
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:21,300
how valuable that is that has been more and more every day

320
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:28,320
and I noticed that driving here tonight we have we're both on this email

321
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:35,220
chain with with a group of friends one of them is now in Iran and was had

322
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:42,780
just written a story of what's happening in Iran and she also has her mothers in ICU so she

323
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:48,660
was kind of reporting on all all events um

324
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:56,160
and I had responded to her some people just reply to all so you see everybody's

325
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:03,300
replies there's a group of like 30 of us on there um so we were talking about that

326
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:09,359
and I started talking maybe not very nicely

327
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:17,099
about something someone had said he's a writer so he writes beautifully but

328
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:22,760
I started saying it was a little bit of exaggeration and

329
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:30,060
what Ben said made me realize what I'm where I'm going and I

330
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:36,599
stopped and then I thought about how valuable it is that

331
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:42,420
we're both practicing and we're both I feel like he was helping me

332
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:50,099
he helped me get reminded of you know what my value is about

333
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:56,640
being kind even if the person's not hearing it and that keeps happening more and more

334
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:03,740
these days at home or our conversations or um

335
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:10,079
I'm so grateful for that I think that's that's a good example of

336
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:15,440
um our son got home

337
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:28,880
um so my song story is about somebody that I didn't share a language with

338
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:34,920
but it's really interesting experience and I like I think about it all the time

339
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:41,700
um the very first Retreat I went on was at Shasta Abbey like really far the like

340
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:47,700
north of California um and I went there by myself and I must

341
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:53,280
have really wanted it it was like five plus hours to get there and it was like a three-day Retreat so I was

342
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:58,800
basically gonna get right back in the car and as we were practicing

343
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:06,599
uh it was a silent Retreat we just got to know people if I just got to look looking over the like uh dividers they

344
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:15,020
had between us kisses like a Zen monastery um in the second we had time

345
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:20,220
to talk to one another this woman like walked up to me and like brought one of

346
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:27,780
her friends like they were all part of a group who had tried to go to a different Retreat that had been canceled because of kovid and just kind of hung out a

347
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:33,599
shot um and she like started talking to me and

348
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:39,060
like went like this under my chin and like her friend was like she says like

349
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:46,980
quit looking at the ground you're like always looking down and like never look like never looked down like you like

350
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:52,160
yeah you're worth always looking up and I was like

351
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:58,260
it's kind of crazy like it was just I don't know quite a while into the retreat and the

352
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:05,160
first time we had anything to say it's like like that kind of observation that had such a like profound impact on me and

353
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:14,220
like I still think about it all the time and yeah we never got to really talk because I didn't speak her language but

354
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:17,060
it was really special

355
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:37,200
do you want to say anything more we I I was waiting for Tanya to direct us

356
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,260
yeah I could say I have uh all kinds of stories

357
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:48,300
we love your stories Diane I don't know about that but uh

358
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:57,000
um so years ago Gil used to do Dharma

359
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:03,300
practice days here maybe some of you have been to them and that was like a

360
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:09,960
day long and it would include small groups and guided meditation and talks a lot of what we do online but it was in

361
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:17,040
person and a friend of mine that I had met here

362
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:22,319
and that you guys know very well also that um

363
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:28,319
he said Diana you should come to these Derma practice days they're really great and you learn a lot and you get to

364
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:35,359
meditate and you can meet other people and I was like oh my goodness I don't want to go to something like that

365
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:44,040
but uh he's I was like just afraid like in these small groups like what am I gonna say I don't know why this would

366
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:50,460
just be sounded scary to me horrifying or something and he said I'll go I

367
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:56,640
actually I think I asked him will you be in every single one of these little groups with me

368
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:04,020
and he said yes so I sat next to him and then when every time we had to make small groups that I dragged him along

369
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:11,460
you know great day I learned a lot and this

370
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:19,500
really kind of kick-started my Dharma practice to to practice in community with other people and to hear how other

371
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:25,140
people were understanding right in small groups we kind of talk about different ideas and just the whole world opened up

372
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:32,700
like oh not everybody thinks exactly the same way I do and this I don't know just I feel so

373
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:39,359
touched by this person who said Diana you really should come to Dharma practice days and what a

374
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:46,380
big impact that had on me and his willingness to get into every group with me after that it was fine but uh so

375
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:51,318
that's one of my stories that's a great story

376
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:00,440
so I'll invite us to go around the circle one more time

377
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:07,260
and I'll give you um a couple options invitations

378
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:14,400
one is you could share what you're noticing what you've been noticing when you've

379
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:20,220
been mindful of speaking as you speak or listening as you are listening anything

380
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:25,980
that's you're kind of coming up for you as you're aware of it as a practice

381
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:32,880
so you could share about that if that feels right

382
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:38,460
or if you have another Sangha story you would like to share or

383
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:43,619
you could if you have a question about Sangha this Sangha or Sangha in general

384
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:48,660
you could ask a question and we can see what the group response

385
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:55,020
is so does that does that give you each something feel great okay Richard do you

386
00:46:55,020 --> 00:47:01,140
feel there's a mic right there too is it not on okay

387
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:05,359
okay thanks

388
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:30,740
um

389
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:39,660
I'm pretty pretty aware of

390
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:45,180
really not wanting to talk too much right now um

391
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:50,220
very very enjoy hearing other people

392
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:56,660
right now just listening to what's going on um

393
00:47:56,819 --> 00:48:04,740
I think I have uh peeled away certain levels or layers of

394
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:10,319
armor that I think this culture has a tendency to build up through different

395
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:14,660
ways distracting and

396
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:18,780
foreign

397
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:33,960
I'm feeling a lot of emotion right now more than I typically do through my

398
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:40,078
normal life prior to sitting The Retreat so it's

399
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:46,680
there's a fragility in my emotions right now that is uh

400
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:53,240
not common so that's what I noticed

401
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:12,200
so I think well I've been trying to practice with

402
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:22,079
um just trying to stay in my body um it's quite difficult but

403
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:27,180
um yeah when when talking um

404
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:33,660
I try to try to stay with my breath and also when listening to others

405
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:40,319
um yeah just go back to the breath and I notice it

406
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:46,560
it really helps me get out of like if I'm like being judgmental or having like

407
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:51,960
a view or an opinion it just helps me um

408
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:59,160
yeah just kind of drop back and um I don't know like feel more compassion

409
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:08,838
or um calm or yeah so

410
00:50:13,859 --> 00:50:18,380
um um

411
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:25,740
the the only story that comes to mind for me right now is uh

412
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:27,740
um

413
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:38,280
because of what's happening in Iran I get up in the morning first thing I do

414
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:44,579
I check all the news feeds Twitter this and that to see what happened

415
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:52,800
and then I know I'm not supposed to do that before I admit it I just get up like 5 30 6

416
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:59,460
o'clock I did I just gotta I just gotta see what just happened overnight in Iran

417
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:04,619
and then I think it was Monday I was sitting

418
00:51:04,619 --> 00:51:12,119
there listening to Gil and I was looking at my iPad with all of these like three

419
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:18,740
four hundred people on it and I was thinking

420
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:25,339
why I couldn't be like this

421
00:51:26,839 --> 00:51:33,800
why couldn't it be just like this it's very simple

422
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:40,559
why why are we doing this to each other why what why are we doing this to each

423
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:47,460
other Iran yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean we all have our own excuses why but yeah

424
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:51,078
and I was just thinking

425
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:59,880
if we just did nothing how much energy we would have saved now

426
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:05,700
what we could have done with it all of us I mean I think my small way is

427
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:11,640
somebody's big way but uh I don't know I'm an engineer I

428
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:17,099
always think about entropy entropy there's a lot of entropy

429
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:24,318
and I saddens me Henry yeah thank you Ben

430
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:39,300
I had a question but I about

431
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:47,220
um community and how

432
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:52,859
during our life it changes even without a practice like

433
00:52:52,859 --> 00:52:58,640
this it kind of changes as we change

434
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:07,760
you know and I um I have a hard time with um

435
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:22,980
thank you I don't have a hard time with with knowing what I'm what how my needs have

436
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:29,220
changed and what I want in a community of close friends

437
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:34,440
but I have a hard time making that change

438
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:38,180
I don't know if that's clear I

439
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:45,660
I think if I could just be myself

440
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:51,960
if it was just me and I would just leave this place and go somewhere and start

441
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:58,500
all over again it would be easier but you know I'm not gonna do that obviously

442
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:08,059
so I don't know if there's any suggestions or you did say about community that um

443
00:54:08,819 --> 00:54:16,339
to look be Beyond all our judgments and all ours

444
00:54:16,619 --> 00:54:22,079
you know biases and what all the surface things where I do agree

445
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:27,839
that we're all all the same

446
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:34,440
but um when you are

447
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:41,280
I don't I don't know if I five if that's enough for you to know what I'm talking about or should I go on

448
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:48,119
I can try and respond and see what happens I really appreciate what you're bringing

449
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:57,059
up Mitra a lot about um you know maybe if when we have a group

450
00:54:57,059 --> 00:55:04,619
of people that we've known and then we come to the practice and we start to change how we want to show up

451
00:55:04,619 --> 00:55:09,960
um that group doesn't necessarily change right

452
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:17,940
um and if you think about gossip as a simple you know but super common way people

453
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:26,119
actually tend to relate and connect so if you think if I think about that as just a simple example

454
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:32,819
um I think a couple things come to mind one is

455
00:55:32,819 --> 00:55:38,040
um you know the story I told is kind of

456
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:44,700
about that and it did change me feeling the other person right but that's because I was

457
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:50,420
inclined that way and it makes me think about the story tick knock on tells about

458
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:55,800
refugees on a boat where um

459
00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:01,200
you know the refugees that were coming right leaving Cambodia going on these

460
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:10,859
boats and small boats all these people in these boats and Pirates would come pillage and rape and worse

461
00:56:10,859 --> 00:56:17,400
and the stories that take not Han would hear about and

462
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:23,099
what he would say is that all it took was one person on that boat

463
00:56:23,099 --> 00:56:28,440
who stayed grounded equanimous mindful

464
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:34,380
and it could save the whole boat or most the people on the boat because of

465
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:42,180
everybody gets on fire emotionally

466
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:47,940
about capsize people jump over people do irrational things but one person is

467
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:54,240
enough to save a whole boat of people

468
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:59,720
so that's the second thing that comes to mind

469
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:06,059
foreign that person needs to be far along further along than I am

470
00:57:06,059 --> 00:57:10,700
in the practice you know um

471
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:18,839
so let me tell you about a story somebody was sharing with me about something that they did which was

472
00:57:18,839 --> 00:57:25,619
to go and sit and not speak when they were in a difficult situation

473
00:57:25,619 --> 00:57:31,800
and they just sat there and they even cried because it was so hard but they

474
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:38,180
were determined and by that action many people weren't harmed

475
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:49,160
and I think that's where I am right now at this stage I I see the harm

476
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:54,540
um and I don't for the most part I don't participate in it

477
00:57:54,540 --> 00:58:01,319
I hear it and I don't like it and also another thing I'm saying I'm starting to

478
00:58:01,319 --> 00:58:08,880
notice is that I'm not I'm not hating it as much you know I'm

479
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:14,339
not um judging it as much either I'm a little

480
00:58:14,339 --> 00:58:20,520
softer on like you know I I notice it but I

481
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:27,740
don't feel like oh my God I'm so much better than that um so that's not really making another

482
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:33,180
yeah and not necessarily having to make yourself into something better or yeah

483
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:41,460
yeah and I see that that that's happening and that's a great thing to happen I think the other but my point my

484
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:47,400
dilemma is that time is so limited and um

485
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:53,520
we only have time for a few things in our life in our day so

486
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:58,799
to choose some things really have to go and

487
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:06,359
choose that is sometimes difficult when you're already have established you

488
00:59:06,359 --> 00:59:12,960
know 30 40 50 year relationships and but yeah that's something I mean I I

489
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:20,780
think I need to keep working on myself

490
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:25,920
foreign

491
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:33,960
I guess I I have elected the song a story

492
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:41,520
two option um so my song story is actually the story

493
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:49,079
of two sanghas um since I uh I started

494
00:59:49,079 --> 00:59:55,920
coming here to IMC and to Canada and uh Mountain View a couple months back

495
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:01,260
like basically right after I had like gotten out of the hospital and like fit

496
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:07,260
in Courage by like a chaplain to like receiving spirituality and is that a

497
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:13,559
particularly like difficult time in my life and I was very much alone and like since

498
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:18,720
I've been coming to IMC and over to Canada um

499
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:26,099
I've definitely felt more like I'm part of something and it it matters like deeply to me it's

500
01:00:26,099 --> 01:00:31,319
something I and get really excited about like glad to

501
01:00:31,319 --> 01:00:37,260
get my time so song has made like a huge difference for me even if I'm

502
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:43,880
not necessarily like talking about like Dharma friends and like giving you the Dharma sense of it

503
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:48,920
uh yeah that's been good for me

504
01:00:53,460 --> 01:01:01,380
thank you for sharing so if what would you like should I speak

505
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:06,780
to or what would be best Tanya or

506
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:12,660
um for you to check in and still was right and we have this piece of paper that has

507
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:19,140
this little schedule yeah there's a schedule and there's guided meditation that you were going to do and so I think

508
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:25,200
you can decide um how much time you want to spend with that versus how much time you want to

509
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:31,619
share and and reflect and when and how I'd like to share a little story

510
01:01:31,619 --> 01:01:38,000
great just kind of a really short one this was a long time ago

511
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:45,720
I don't know 15 20 years ago maybe I don't remember exactly how long but where somebody said

512
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:51,720
something that uh really had a big difference for the way that I kind of

513
01:01:51,720 --> 01:02:00,540
understood how I was showing up in a way that I hadn't really noticed before and uh this person

514
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:07,920
talked about she used this expression bonding through mutual outrage

515
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:13,799
maybe it was something like that and and I hadn't really noticed how this is at

516
01:02:13,799 --> 01:02:19,380
that now it's pretty obvious but at that time I hadn't noticed how people myself

517
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:25,980
included at that time would get together and like oh that terrible thing or that

518
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:32,220
terrible person and like and this and then did you hear about this and then this and then this and somehow kind of

519
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:39,299
like this good feeling like okay well we're not that person but then so I don't know it started to feel like it

520
01:02:39,299 --> 01:02:47,339
just didn't quite feel so good as soon as that got highlighted for me I started to notice oh this is sometimes the way

521
01:02:47,339 --> 01:02:53,579
that we bond with each other is to complain or something about something

522
01:02:53,579 --> 01:02:59,760
else and I don't know that had a big impact on me when I said I'm gonna try not to

523
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:06,420
do that anymore and maybe that speaks a little bit to what you're this othering that you've been talking about

524
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:12,420
and I know when I there was a time when I worked in Corporate America and you know there was this was something that

525
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:18,480
we would do literally like around the water cooler is complain about that person in that department and can you

526
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:25,440
believe it and you know this kind of stuff so I don't know that that I still think

527
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:30,660
about and even today like with the way kind of social media at that time right

528
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:36,299
social media didn't really have a role on the news cycle everything is all about this

529
01:03:36,299 --> 01:03:42,900
bonding through mutual outrage I don't is that the right expression but whatever it is so

530
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:48,599
I don't know just this story that had a big impact on me to see how

531
01:03:48,599 --> 01:03:56,819
we like to do that it turns out not to be so helpful always did you did you say the word outrage or

532
01:03:56,819 --> 01:04:04,579
Outreach oh outrage anger outrage yeah

533
01:04:07,799 --> 01:04:12,920
okay so maybe we'll do a little guided meditation

534
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:19,440
that's good to me so this idea of

535
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:25,559
kaliana Mita and Sangha and practicing together is

536
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:31,559
a way of you know about connection and and there's so many different ways we

537
01:04:31,559 --> 01:04:37,140
can have connection we can be you know literally touching

538
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:45,420
somebody or maybe it's just softening that which is inside us that is maybe

539
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:51,359
um Making Connections a little bit more difficult

540
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:56,460
and so I'd like to do a little bit of loving kindness meditation because I

541
01:04:56,460 --> 01:05:04,050
find that this really can help soften kind of our inner experience

542
01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:11,819
[Applause] I keep on looking at this uh schedule

543
01:05:11,819 --> 01:05:17,240
I'm a little bit confused about okay here we go

544
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:23,700
so just arriving this moment

545
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:29,220
take in the posture that feels comfortable comfortable enough

546
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:35,220
for the next little while we won't be here for too

547
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:42,140
long checking in with the body

548
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:50,579
connecting with the body feeling where the body

549
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:58,578
rests on the chair or the cushion feeling the pressure against the body

550
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:10,500
feeling the feet on the ground we're connected we're here

551
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:13,460
this location

552
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:26,000
and having this sitting posture and just to know that we're sitting

553
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:31,220
how does the body feel in this posture

554
01:06:39,059 --> 01:06:42,559
connecting with the breath

555
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,880
connecting with the sensations of breathing

556
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:16,920
right now there's nowhere else to be and nothing else to

557
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:22,559
do we're just here

558
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:26,960
with the sensations of breathing

559
01:07:36,599 --> 01:07:42,020
and then to begin our loving kindness practice

560
01:07:42,059 --> 01:07:47,299
bring to mind a lovable being

561
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:54,720
the most lovable uncomplicated straightforward

562
01:07:54,720 --> 01:08:00,599
for many people these might be kittens that they see on internet videos

563
01:08:00,599 --> 01:08:07,079
something that kind of just makes you smile and in a warm-hearted way

564
01:08:07,079 --> 01:08:14,700
maybe there's a teacher or author that has touched you

565
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:22,258
maybe there's somebody in your life that you have a relationship with whomever

566
01:08:22,259 --> 01:08:28,140
bringing this really lovable being somebody for whom it's straightforward

567
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:34,100
to have a sense of warmth or care for

568
01:08:38,219 --> 01:08:43,380
and and any way that makes sense for you to

569
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:48,560
connect with this lovable being

570
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:56,960
might be by bringing an image of this lovable being

571
01:08:57,179 --> 01:09:02,480
can even be an imaginary it doesn't have to be an actual being

572
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:11,338
or maybe there's a way in which the Heart Center a little bit of a radiation and

573
01:09:11,339 --> 01:09:13,758
connection

574
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:41,580
and as a support for this connection and cultivation of

575
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:48,140
warm-heartedness can say these phrases

576
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:56,660
you're welcome to modify these phrases there's nothing magical about these particular words

577
01:09:59,219 --> 01:10:06,440
a simple wish warm-hearted wish for another

578
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:14,420
may you be safe

579
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:24,440
may you be happy

580
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:36,139
may you be healthy

581
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:48,920
may you live with ease

582
01:10:56,460 --> 01:11:00,500
may you be safe

583
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:10,340
may you be happy

584
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:21,480
may you be healthy

585
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:31,880
may you live with ease

586
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:07,460
just keeping us simple

587
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:14,480
with warm-hearted wishes for this lovable being

588
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:18,679
connecting with this lovable being

589
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:28,699
just allowing ourselves to feel the warmth or feel the care

590
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:34,980
and it's perfectly fine if you don't feel anything in particular that's okay

591
01:13:34,980 --> 01:13:43,800
to but if you do allow yourself to be supported nourished

592
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:53,760
by this feeling of warmth respect care love Goodwill benevolence

593
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:57,380
for this lovable being

594
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:57,780
and then to expand our loving kindness to include ourselves

595
01:15:57,780 --> 01:16:05,059
of course of course we do loving kindness for ourselves

596
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:10,860
so in the same way that we have this warmth and care for

597
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:15,900
the lovable being can we stretch or expand that

598
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:19,158
to include ourselves

599
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:26,120
may I be safe

600
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:36,020
may I be happy

601
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:47,900
may I be healthy

602
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:58,580
may I live with ease

603
01:18:48,659 --> 01:18:54,600
and then can be really helpful really supportive

604
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:59,239
do a little bit of equanimity practice

605
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:06,540
for this practice bring to mind somebody who's a little bit troubling or

606
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:11,580
Troublesome for you bothersome or annoying

607
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:18,000
on a scale of one to ten choose somebody that's like a two or a

608
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:23,239
three just sometimes a little bit irksome

609
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:31,219
bring this person to mind somebody that you care about

610
01:19:35,159 --> 01:19:42,659
and we can say this phrase I wish you happiness

611
01:19:42,659 --> 01:19:50,480
and I cannot make your choices for you

612
01:20:04,679 --> 01:20:14,840
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you

613
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:50,239
I wish you a happiness and I cannot make your choices for you

614
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:50,630
[Music]

615
01:21:55,800 --> 01:22:01,260
this idea of loving kindness practice is a support

616
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:08,300
for Sangha for kalyanami does it's important to like soften maybe

617
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:14,699
Tanya talked about sulfane and othering to soften that but also for us to have

618
01:22:14,699 --> 01:22:22,020
some care for ourselves it's so important but not in the way in which we're

619
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:27,840
willing to like sacrifice ourselves or tried to control other people or not set

620
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:33,120
boundaries or those kinds of things so it can be helpful to also do some

621
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:39,600
Equanimity practice as a support for that and then maybe we'll just open it up for

622
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:45,120
some last questions or comments see if anybody has some

623
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:51,360
anything you'd like to share about that meditation or about this topic of Sangha

624
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:56,760
or this idea of let's talk about practice or something like that and if

625
01:22:56,760 --> 01:23:03,960
