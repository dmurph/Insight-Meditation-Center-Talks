1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:05,920
okay so hello and welcome everyone to this

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:14,559
rendition of happy hour so so today's happy hour um

3
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:21,600
i'd like to invite us to consider bringing a perspective of

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,000
and the practice of joy to bring more joy into our lives

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,120
joy is a very important practice it's it's not

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:40,719
a luxury it's not um oh it's reserved for some and also if

7
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:47,760
i'm a serious buddhist practitioner oh no i would be really serious i wouldn't have so much joy quite the opposite

8
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,320
actually joy happiness bliss are parts of the path as the buddha has

9
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,520
taught this the path leading to nirvana to liberation to freedom

10
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,560
the steps along the way actually you require the happy heart happiness bliss joy are part

11
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,479
of the path when they're happy when the heart is happy when the mind is is

12
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,240
joyous letting go letting go becomes easier concentration settling of the

13
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,680
mind becomes easier so so um it's actually good for our

14
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,799
practice and also it's good for our humanity joy gladness

15
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:35,840
is is good um it's good for all of uh for for us and and for others too as we show up in the

16
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,399
world as we serve others and practice is not supposed to be this grim duty

17
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:48,240
and there is a line that i heard actually recently in

18
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,000
a documentary that i saw i wanted to share with you and the documentary was excellent by the way so highly

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,920
recommended the name of the documentary is um is uh jazz fest and new orleans story i

20
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,879
don't know if any of you have seen it yet but i saw it on the plane when i was coming back so whether or not you're

21
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:14,879
interested in jazz it was a really wonderful documentary about new orleans

22
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,879
and also the challenges that new orleans has had with hurricane katrina and

23
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,239
and also the joy of music and and

24
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,160
musicians creating and there was this line that really caught my attention one of the musicians was saying

25
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:40,480
that and i forget whom so i can't give him credit life is to be enjoyed not endured

26
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:47,040
life is to be enjoyed not endured and

27
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,599
that really landed for me especially the word endured because i think sometimes maybe

28
00:02:53,599 --> 00:03:00,319
our perspective or it becomes one of enduring like okay all right suffering or i'm gonna endure

29
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:06,000
this some more i'm gonna be really loyal to my suffering i'm going to endure

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,080
this life and yet we forget about joy we forget about enjoying how can we

31
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:19,040
bring more joy and and it's not just about hedonic pleasures so that we

32
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,879
we um distract ourselves into oblivion just

33
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,720
enjoying enjoying and not looking at at uh at sorrow and suffering but the

34
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,920
balance is needed the balance is needed not just trying to endure

35
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:43,760
but also bringing joy gladness and that's what we do happy hour we do try to see

36
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:51,840
feel into the suffering of course it's there but we bring care we bring love we bring gladness we bring joy we do we do

37
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,120
that so this is a practice we do already but but this is another way to

38
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:04,319
um [Music] to really look at it you know from from this perspective of this quote

39
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,760
not to be just endured not to just be endured um

40
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,720
but but to have joy to to to cultivate joy so

41
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,000
so with that as the as the frame

42
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,040
as the frame for this practice let's meditate together let's meditate

43
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:36,800

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,880
this moment trying to get through it to get to the next

123
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:23,400
what if we let go of that way of being way of seeing just enjoyed what is

124
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:31,760
if there are challenges a crowd of sorrows can we open up to them hello life hi

125
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:38,600
this moment what a smorgasbord

126
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:45,480
not to endure but to enjoy what is

127
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:30,080
this impermanent impermanent life permanent moments not to just endure

128
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:36,320
them they pass through quickly all

129
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:43,840
and too soon but to enjoy the fleetingness

130
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:52,760
not in spite of but because of its fleeting nature

131
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:13,919
and if there's a challenge arising in your sphere experience right now whether it's

132
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,720
pleasant sensations in the body fatigue

133
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:29,520
anxiousness even whatever is happening right now can we have a really spacious

134
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:36,960
perspective not just endure it but can we expand our perspective

135
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,080
ah expand her heart breathe around it

136
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:49,360
let the fact that this is at all whatever it is here

137
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,559
can it be appreciated even enjoyed

138
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,039
that anything exists at all

139
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,799
even if it has unpleasant feeling too

140
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:21,120
and maybe a sense that can arise when the mind

141
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:28,880
settles could be that there is just enjoyment there's just delight there isn't me and

142
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:36,880
mine i want this i don't want that person to me or mine it's just enjoyment

143
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:44,399
delight gladness knowing itself

144
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:53,200
being known not owned

145
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,840
not claimed without ownership

146
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,759
for the last moments of this practice period

147
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:36,960
can we enjoy that we sat we practiced

148
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:43,599

and i see claire yes claire

168
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:02,560
thank you this gives me a chance to tell one of my all-time favorite stories my whole life

169
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:08,480
i was listening to the radio many years ago and they were interviewing an actress who

170
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:15,599
was like doris day somebody who always played really happy parts and they were asking her about her life

171
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:21,440
and it went on from one awful story to a worse one it just was

172
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:28,000
her life was miserable and so the obvi the interviewer finally interrupted the interview and he said

173
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,640
you know i've got to ask you with the life you've had how could you possibly play the parts

174
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,760
you do and she paused and she said well you know at one

175
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:45,839
point i realized that i had a choice and i chose joy

176
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:52,400
and that's has stuck with me my whole life and i i go with it um beautiful

177
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,920
yeah exactly we have a choice happiness is a choice you make beautiful thank you

178
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:05,359
claire that's lovely yeah such such wisdom right it can arise in so many places so many ways and atlanta you have

179
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:10,640
a choice we have she had a choice and we have a choice every single one of us

180
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:17,760
thank you claire so may we choose joy may we choose joy not a perspective of

181
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:24,560
have to endure another moment another day even if it's challenging as as it is

182
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:30,880
it's human life we all have our challenges welcome to being human

183
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:37,920
thanks claire so any other reflections

184
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,760
questions comments richard says gratitude works for me yay

185
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:53,359
any other reflections was there i wonder here is a specific question as i was inviting you to um

186
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:58,400
to really try a perspective of especially if there was enduring like

187
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:05,520
there's a sense of enduring like if you shifted towards towards enjoying enjoying versus enduring did

188
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:12,000
you did anyone play with that did did it open up something for you in the practice that it wouldn't have was is

189
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:19,200
there a moment in your practice like okay another meditation practice ah breath in i was like oh can i enjoy this

190
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:25,440
any of you have a shift that opens something up for you would love to hear

191
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:33,599
or any other opening

192
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:42,000
again for the benefit of everyone to share that fuzzo please

193
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,040
just thought of some things that you know i have to do that

194
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:53,920
i'm not particularly excited about it's like well maybe i can approach it from a different

195
00:39:53,920 --> 00:40:00,079
perspective great great awesome yeah thank you for

196
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:07,440
that yeah beautiful yeah yeah i was also reflecting on that myself there's like a few things i need

197
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:14,000
to do that i i need to do i have just like like what what if i really enjoy doing it

198
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,240
so susan i see your hand please yeah that was a great reminder about the

199
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:25,920
joy thing i definitely got raised and then my life as a consultant you know it really

200
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:31,839
reinforced you know work before play kind of thing you know

201
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:37,359
like you know and is the to-do list ever done right so um this is great you know it's like

202
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:43,760
oh yeah just enjoy you know and um two days ago i learned that a dear

203
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:49,520
friend of mine had just had a massive stroke and so i was pretty upset yesterday and then today i started

204
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:55,280
getting where okay you know more accepting it and then you know it's like okay i think it's

205
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:00,640
still okay to enjoy that i'm alive and not having a stroke you know

206
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:07,839
just how as you said how precious and fleeting and fragile it is and even more reason to enjoy it

207
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:15,920
yeah exactly beautiful beautiful he said thank you for bringing that reflection in susan how it's a lie for you yeah

208
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:23,599
we're here it's it's to be enjoyed to be grateful for not to focus on all the challenges and yeah i'm alive i i don't

209
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:29,359
have x y z a stroke being one of them and and also when you pointed out um

210
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:35,520
chuckling like yeah this this always worked before play you know always have a to-do list the to-do list is never

211
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:41,680
gonna end we're all gonna die with an unfinished well i'm gonna die with an unfinished to-do list i know that so

212
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:49,040
we're never done so that's sweet thank you susan thanks for those reflections

213
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:59,119
[Music] yeah okay avi has a reflection here i'll read it's a long one see

214
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:04,319
related to enduring it engaged my identity clinging so to speak

215
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:11,200
i'm in joy and a small internal tension toward fear of the idea of just enduring

216
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,960
and then the moment of awareness around my fear of unhappiness i'm also grateful

217
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:22,720
for finding silver linings much like the actor's story that claire mentioned with

218
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:27,920
pain or suffering finding the space there to learn i guess

219
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:33,920
so thank you so very much i get curious about equanimity around abundant joy

220
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:39,680
finding the balance and even background joy of neutral neutrality

221
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:46,960
question mark i think i'm a little unclear about the question at the end abby if you want to raise your hand and

222
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:52,560
clarify the question at the end i see you i have a curiosity about equanimity

223
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:59,119
uh of abundance well maybe i'll say something if i if i don't address it um

224
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:04,480
so so you know um

225
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:11,680
equanimity you know which was the sense of equipoise and unevenness of mind

226
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:18,800
in the face which is not falling into nor nor pushing away so with joy you can

227
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:26,160
absolutely enjoy joy enjoy and have delight as long as you don't attach to it like i

228
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:32,720
want more of this i want this to be the rest of my life like oh this is great yum yum yum it's

229
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:38,720
like kissing it's it's like this um this this poem uh

230
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:45,760
um forgetting the name of the poet they'll come to it's like kissing the joy as it flies you just kiss it as it

231
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:52,400
flies and there is the equanimity it's like oh yeah you kiss it as it flies instead of like trying to catch a

232
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,839
butterfly and pin it and kill it's like no let the joy be so that's the way

233
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:04,640
equanimity can can be coexistent with abundant joy yeah

234
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:10,400
great thank you for that yeah

235
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:15,760
yeah yeah i see if i see your comment here

236
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:21,280
sometimes i could cry or i could laugh um i see this as a comment i'm not quite

237
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:28,079
sure how to reflect on that so i'll let that sit as it is so uh many reflections on

238
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:33,440
on um [Music] youtube here

239
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:41,200
uh i'll pick a couple not a moment but i'm coming out of the practice time in the mode of enjoying not enduring yay great

240
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:48,000
morty and um thank you sid

241

story may it be of service made serve you thank you marty also says die with a completed

243
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:05,839

244
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:12,960
oh that's fine so so so okay dear ones the time has come

245
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:20,319
for us to to practice to practice sharing our joy sharing our kindness

246
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:25,920
in small groups so we've done it now in silence in in our meditation and now we

247
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:33,119
get the chance to enter the sandbox and practice relationally so create the breakout

248
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:40,400
rooms and as always the invitation is uh be kind to yourself be kind to others

249
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:47,119
you're invited to just offer a nugget maybe just a word you know just say not another word just a sentence

250
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:52,160
um of what what was this practice like for you and you

251
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:57,839
can also offer silence and say pass and hold kind space for

252
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:03,200
yourself and others the next person will say something and then the third person

253
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:09,359
and it will come back to you so please don't take the entire time the long monologue just say one

254
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:15,680
short nugget and and give time make space for others as an act of

255
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:22,000
kindness as an act of generosity and care for everyone may and may not be appropriate to give your whole life

256
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,760
story in the monologue just a little nugget just as an act of kindness to yourself

257
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:35,760
and to others um so and let's speak in reverse alphabetical order

258
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:42,240
and um and again just speaking from your own experience not managing

259
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:47,839
the group just showing up with with humility and kindness so

260
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:53,359
i'm opening the rooms take care of yourself take care of each other and be

261
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:59,200
kind and enjoy enjoy each other enjoy here we go

262
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:07,119
okay all the rooms are closed everybody's back and it is seven o'clock so

263
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:12,480
um okay well we had wonderful reflections before i'll see one quick question

264
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:19,440
follow up from abby so i'll just respond to it and basically it's what she's following up on is about

265
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:25,520
choosing moments of neutrality instead of joy or enduring um

266
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:32,720
i would investigate whether uh there is a um whether actually

267
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:40,240
the there is a masquerading of choosing neutrality is actually pushing something away whether it's pushing joy away or

268
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:45,920
pushing so that i'm hearing some masquerading there so i invite you to to

269
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:52,480
explore that because ah opening up to it is very different than choosing new valley there's some

270
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:57,680
pushing you away there so watch out for that all right dear ones thank you so much

271
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:02,720
for your practice for your cultivation supporting each other supporting

272
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:08,319
yourselves and i see gratitude for your group there and

273
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:14,960
at least in the chat i see that may all beings be well may all beings be happy

274
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:21,720
and free including ourselves here we go

275
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:30,000
thank you all take care i'm teaching oh i should i should have mentioned this earlier i forgot maybe i'll ask neil if

276

277
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:44,079

278
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:51,119

279
