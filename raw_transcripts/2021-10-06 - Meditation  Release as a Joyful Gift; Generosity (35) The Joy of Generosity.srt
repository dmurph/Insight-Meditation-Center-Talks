it's the other side of the coin of joy

68
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,839
so perhaps that becomes more present

69
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:47,120
and notice if and when

70
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,440

thank you for the gift of your practice

114
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:51,840
greetings greetings sangha lovely to practice with you

115
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:59,440
and in this practice today we tuned into the invitation was to tune

116
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:06,080
into the joy the delight of of

117
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,279
release letting go which is one movement of generosity

118
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:19,120
and in as an inner dimension how generosity as an outer dimension of giving

119
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,880
supports the inner dimension of practice is to consider every time we let go of

120
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,760
entanglement thinking or perhaps a

121
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:36,960
yeah an entanglement the times when it's useful to let go there are times that it's

122
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:43,600
helpful to to be aware and be present with it and there are times that it's it's just skillful to let go

123
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:50,799
to to consider that letting go that relinquishment the the ease the joy

124
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:56,799
the delight of that instead of oh you were thinking you were entangled instead of the judgment really tuning into the

125
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:04,080
delight the the beauty the grace of of of of this letting go and considering this

126
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:09,120
letting go as a gift as a gift of our practice as a gift of generosity

127
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,559
that we put on the altar of humanity of of the buddha of ourselves of this

128
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:20,080
practice so in that way making a gift out of every moment of

129
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:25,760
release in our practice making a gift out of that so really bringing the sense of

130
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:31,120
generosity into our practice in every moment

131
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:37,360
so so speaking of

132
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,399
the joy of generosity the idea is

133
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:50,000
is not of course you know this already it's not to be generous or let go from a moralistic

134
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,120
stance of shooting but but

135
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:02,240
to gladden and inspire the heart as as a practice as an inner practice

136
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,600
um and the buddha i love something that buddha

137
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:14,399
said and really impacted me actually early on in my practice when i saw this

138
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:20,159
from angutta nikaya 3 6 37

139
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:25,760
and the buddha says in this world there are three things of value for one

140
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:31,760
who gives what are these things before giving

141
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:38,799
the mind of the giver is happy while giving the mind of the giver is

142
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:49,120
made peaceful after having given the mind of the giver is uplifted

143
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:55,039
so happy before so when we're considering giving a gift of generosity

144
00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:00,960
our mind is happy and you know this when you're thinking about how delighted someone will be

145
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:07,760
when they receive the gift that you're thoughtfully preparing perhaps or

146
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:13,440
and while you're giving it um the delight that it gives you to be to

147
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:21,200
be doing something for the benefit of someone else and this this this release this this act of service giving can

148
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:27,118
bring up joy and peacefulness as the buddha says and then after having given the mind of

149
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:33,118
the giver is uplifted and this can happen for a long long time

150
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:38,240
in fact i appreciate receiving a couple of stories from some of you in

151
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:43,358

were and went and sat and i thought wait you know i have to i have i'm eating one this one i have another apple i can i

166
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:13,359
can give this away so i went and gave it to her and said please have it it's already washed it's from the farmer's

167
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:18,480
market it's organic enjoy and just are you sure no please yes so

168
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:24,800
that was that and i was happy and she was happy and then later on the plane she was sitting a few rows behind me

169
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,560
and uh when i got up at some point she uh said you know

170
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:38,079
this is of course long before corbin she said you know um i grew up in japan and in

171
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:43,760
our yard and uh there was a um

172
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,800
a persimmon tree from my childhood and i live on the east coast where there are

173
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:55,920
no persimmons and um and the way she was sharing how precious

174
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,040
how important it was for her it's that persimmon to connect her with her with her

175
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:07,200
um parents grandparents it moved me so much that to this day there's this

176
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:12,880
uplift there is this delight there is this joy of the persimmon i never ate

177
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:20,880
i've eaten so many i forget their their taste but that one still tastes delicious with joy and uplift knowing

178
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:27,119
how it it uh supported this person so and who knows these acts of generosity

179
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:32,880
that that we give we really don't know the impact they have um and this is just

180
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:39,119
a tiny little story and i trust i'm sure every single one of us we have so many

181
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:47,200
stories that uplift our hearts our minds when we think of them uh and and inspire us to to to be

182
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:54,320
generous as a practice as an inner practice so a couple of things i wanted to bring

183
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:59,359
in as i promised not that we need any scientific research

184
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:06,160
or studies to support this important inner practice that we know is happy making and and as we discussed yesterday

185
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:12,720
is is supportive of release nibana awakenings the same movement of the

186
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:20,079
heart as we discussed yesterday so it turns out that um

187
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:26,560
a couple so couple of studies one in 2008 was done and was repeated actually

188
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:32,000
by others in 2017 the 2008 was a study by harvard business

189
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,280
school professor michael norton and colleagues and the 2017 similar one was

190
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:44,160
by park ital which also brought in fmri so they

191
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:50,720
found that giving money to someone else uh lifted participants the people who

192
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:56,320
participated in the study it lifted their their level of happiness

193
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:03,760
more than spending the money on themselves even though even though before um the study

194
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:09,520
the participants had predicted that spending the money on themselves would make them happier

195
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:16,320
but actually spending it on others made them happier when they actually went through the study so that also not only

196
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:21,359
tells us that generosity makes us happier but also that sometimes

197
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:26,640
we're not a good estimator we cannot exactly predict what

198
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:32,000
will make us happy and trust that generosity will make us happy and a

199
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,200
similar study by sonia leo bomsky

200
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:45,359
at university of california riverside saw similar results when she asked people to perform five acts of kindness

201
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:53,440
each week for six weeks the level of happiness went up there's also a study of what's called

202
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,720
study was 2006 by jorge mull and colleagues that

203
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:04,160
there is [Music] areas that are associated with pleasure

204
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:12,560
uh and social connection and trust and what's called creating a warm glow effect um

205
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:18,000
actually the warm glow effect and what's called the helipers high

206
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,680
which is associated with release of endorphins producing positive feelings

207
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:30,160
uh happen when we are generous so the buddha was definitely onto something he was a neuroscientist

208
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:35,280
in his own way he had studied the mind so clearly knowing that

209
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:42,560
giving generosity brings brings happiness lights up the heart the mind and

210
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:47,680
of course scientists with their fmri's and all of that their their

211
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:54,720
studies they're confirming the same yes it does make us happy generosity makes us happy

212
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:00,720
and another thing i wanted to bring in is also a couple more things one is studies

213
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:06,079
about what's called targeted generosity um so

214
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:11,440
being generous in general is wonderful and specifically there are some studies

215
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:17,280
about when you know the person you are giving to you the person you are

216
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:23,040
supporting uh directly that targeted generosity

217
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:29,359
um it also has some other aspects it increases the feeling of social

218
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:34,800
connection uh and and heaven knows these days

219
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,400
in covet times we all need we can all use increased sense of social connection

220
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:46,160
to feel socially connected to one another so targeted generosity when you know the

221
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:51,920
giver directly support it helping someone increases the sense of social connection

222
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:58,160
and also it turns out it potentially has some health benefits reducing fear anxiety

223
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:05,680
and the amygdala activation so i thought that was interesting about targeted generosity specifically

224
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:11,440
and one of you had asked about the relationship between

225
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:17,520
gratefulness gratitude and generosity in email that i received and yes

226
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:23,680
absolutely of course and we know this first actually let's tune into our own heart before i

227
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:30,800
talk about the research study we know when we feel more grateful when we have gratitude

228
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:36,800
um we feel the abundance of our heart we feel so abundant we don't feel

229
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:43,920
miserly we feel we have so many resources we're grateful we're grateful for life for our bodies for our clothes

230
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:49,359
for our roof over our head for food for all the good we turn to the good we see

231
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:54,560
the abundance of our of our life and our heart instead of what's lacking and that

232
00:42:54,560 --> 00:43:02,240
sense of gratitude not only makes us happier and heaven knows there's so many studies on gratitude making you happier

233
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:07,440
and and and supporting well-being

234
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:14,240
and liberation too of course and also that that that abundant heart

235
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:19,680
becomes more generous of course and the last thing i'll say is studies by

236
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:26,319
christina carnes uh fmri studies where he where she

237
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:33,200
suggested that participants engage in writing a gratitude journal for three

238
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:39,599
weeks and then in the fmri machine study there are the activities

239
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:45,200
of their brains and they derived there was more

240
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:50,400
delight more joy more pleasure from giving

241
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:56,000
when people had engaged in gratitude so as she puts it you can proactively

242
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:02,720
choose to retrain your brain so it gets more pleasure out of giving

243
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:08,000
increasing neurotransm transmitters so and the way you proactively choose to

244
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:15,440
retrain your brain so it gets more pleasure out of giving is through the practice of gratitude so these are

245
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:21,040
absolutely connected so i'd like to invite us

246
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:27,520
if you wish to for today if you'd like to um so yesterday the

247
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:33,440
invitation was to look for an opportunity to be generous in some way

248
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:39,119
your choice of course and today um but looking for an opportunity to be

249
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:44,480
generous and also observing before during and after what is the state of

250
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:50,720
your mind noticing what the buddha talks this delight this joy of generosity before

251
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:57,359
the act of generosity during generosity and after again it could be

252
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:02,960
um your resources it could be your time it could be your affection your smile

253
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:09,520
