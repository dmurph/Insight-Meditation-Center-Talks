1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:00,799
[Music]

2
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:03,439
so i want to begin this talk

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:04,319
by

4
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,680
uh recounting um

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,760
a famous uh

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,599
psychology experiment some of you have

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,200
probably heard of it

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,160
and

9
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,599
so

10
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,119
being told again is maybe not so

11
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,720
interesting you know it but the

12
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,960
implications of it are interesting and i

13
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,519
think important to consider

14
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,760
and this was an experiment done at the

15
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,240
princeton theological seminary in 1970.

16
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,279
with

17
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,920
and the subjects who are going to go

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,399
through unwittingly go through this uh

19
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,680
experiment

20
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,239
were theology students of chris

21
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,000
christian being trained to be christian

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,399
ministers

23
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,160
and um

24
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,480
and who supposedly were quite familiar

25
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,480
with their scriptures and stories in

26
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,559
their scriptures

27
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:53,680
and uh

28
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,239
the experiment was at one of these these

29
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,399
different different times the theology

30
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,600
student was

31
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,280
told that

32
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,120
they were late but they would you know

33
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,518
they really need to go across campus

34
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,920
to give a talk on the story of the good

35
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,360
samaritan

36
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,040
the good samaritan story if you don't

37
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,360
know had to do with a man who was sick

38
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,200
on the side of the road i think he'd

39
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,600
been robbed and beaten up and was very

40
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,280
sick and

41
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,720
you know and maybe in the danger of

42
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,000
dying

43
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,200
and

44
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,880
a variety of people coming down the road

45
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,720
just ignored him

46
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,040
until this man who was a belonged to the

47
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,799
people of the called submit

48
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,720
cemetery and samaritans

49
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,240
stopped and helped him and then

50
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,720
supported him took him to it in

51
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,280
left and and so made it possible for the

52
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,560
person to

53
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,600
um

54
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,240
not die to save the person's life so the

55
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,200
good samaritan was a stranger who stops

56
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,360
to care for someone

57
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,439
and um

58
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,640
and um

59
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,079
so i told my wife this morning that i

60
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,159
was going to give this talk on this kind

61
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,840
of story and

62
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,640
and

63
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,000
she says well if

64
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,600
on the way to imc if someone needs you

65
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,560
you better stop

66
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,480
[Laughter]

67
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,720
and then i thought

68
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,239
i better have i better i should have

69
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,040
left earlier then

70
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,520
so

71
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,520
so they did this experiment so the

72
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,840
theology students were they had to go

73
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,160
give this talk about the good samaritan

74
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,760
but they were given very little time

75
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,599
they're like late for giving the talk so

76
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,680
they were told to go across campus to

77
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,360
give the talk

78
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,840
on the way there unbeknownst to them

79
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,800
an actor was there uh disheveled and

80
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,239
dirty and

81
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,360
you know and

82
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,040
sitting propped up against the wall kind

83
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,800
of slumped over kind of hidden their

84
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,200
hands or something in their knees

85
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,519
and as the person who walked by this per

86
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,519
this actor was moaning and groaning

87
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,239
and uh and the study was to see who

88
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,640
would stop

89
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,640
and after all the what was the subject

90
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,920
of their talk was that very thing

91
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,560
and a great majority of the seminary

92
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,599
students did not stop

93
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,840
but just kept going

94
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,400
and the idea being that somehow

95
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,400
in being in a hurry

96
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,360
uh people don't have time to help

97
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,440
the h the hurried mindset maybe you

98
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,360
don't even notice maybe what's there

99
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,040
because you're so in a hurry to get

100
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,159
something and

101
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,599
maybe it's high pressure maybe they're

102
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,080
being graded on the giving this talk may

103
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,159
be and so the pressure all kinds of

104
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,000
things contributed to

105
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,680
you know not

106
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,400
stopping to take care of someone

107
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,400
and um so it's kind of heartbreaking

108
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,519
that's how

109
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:44,879
how it works

110
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,080
but

111
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,120
so

112
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,280
the implications of this story for us

113
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,480
is that um certainly one simple one is

114
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,480
that maybe is that

115
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,879
if we want to be live in the world

116
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,360
in a way to help people to help society

117
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,840
help this world of ours

118
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,319
don't be in a hurry

119
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,319
don't even be a hurry to help maybe

120
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,120
don't be in a hurry give yourself time

121
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,280
live a different life

122
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,720
then um

123
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,560
because there's certain ways of living

124
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,440
life

125
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,479
where

126
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:20,720
you're not you don't in in the mindset

127
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,320
and the heart set

128
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,680
to be able to notice and stop and care

129
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,680
and come from that caring place for the

130
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,440
world

131
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,840
this world of ours for some of us has so

132
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,080
many temptations so many things to do so

133
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,919
many demands

134
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,520
the more there's been

135
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,680
time saving devices kind of invented

136
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,479
over the last 150 years or so

137
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,720
the more it gives us a chance to do more

138
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,479
more things and more things and more

139
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,800
things and so it's kind of epidemic in

140
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,199
our kind of circles for some of us

141
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,680
how much little time there is to do all

142
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,080
the things that we can do and fill our

143
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,759
time with

144
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,160
how does that affect us how does it i

145
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,880
think one of the ways is that it

146
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,639
makes it bring make it causes us

147
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,280
sometimes to be out of touch

148
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,880
with important healthy valuable places

149
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,160
within us

150
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,759
because we're so distracted we're so

151
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,840
caught up in a hurry we're preoccupied

152
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,919
we're doing things

153
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,759
rather than feeling things and being

154
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,160
present

155
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,039
so in uh in buddhism there's discussion

156
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,240
of a lot of discussion and uh of um

157
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,840
kind of opposites

158
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,360
like there's uh there's greed and

159
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,680
there's generosity there's hatred and

160
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,960
there's love

161
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,000
there's delusion and there's wisdom and

162
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,919
this idea that we've talked about the

163
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,960
unwholesome and the wholesome

164
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,759
and

165
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,840
when we presented that kind of simple

166
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,280
way

167
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,039
this kind of divide

168
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,479
between these two

169
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,240
it could almost seem like they're kind

170
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,960
of not exactly of equal value

171
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,720
but have some equality to them it's like

172
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,800
a like a seesaw or something or a

173
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,600
spectrum and it's one side and the other

174
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,039
side and they kind of have equal weight

175
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,680
or in that spectrum or something

176
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,080
but they're radically different

177
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,120
the wholesome and the unwholesome the

178
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,319
the um

179
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,639
this healthy place we can come from

180
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,400
where we can maybe the place that might

181
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,759
help others

182
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,600
and the other place which is unwholesome

183
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,120
the place where we're not just simply

184
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,680
not helpful but maybe worse or maybe

185
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,120
even cruel or unkind to people

186
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,400
uh they're

187
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,280
they are um they're they're kind of very

188
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,880
different in a number of ways

189
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,680
it's not either or

190
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,960
first of all

191
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,440
the wholesome side has a different

192
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,319
source inside of us than the unwholesome

193
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,759
side

194
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,440
and this different source is different

195
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,880
place the origin for where they're born

196
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,319
is so different

197
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,319
that if we're interested in one more

198
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,520
than the other

199
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,599
live in that source live in that place

200
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,240
where they arise from

201
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,599
the other is it's not either or

202
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,680
it's in some ways possible to have both

203
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,199
coexisting

204
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,280
and this is actually very important for

205
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,759
our healing it's very important for the

206
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,160
path of practice that's trying to

207
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,840
in a healthy way

208
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,440
find freedom from some of the

209
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,599
unwholesome motivations and

210
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,680
and uh ways of being in the world that

211
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,840
we have

212
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,160
so the the idea of this having different

213
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,240
sources within

214
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,120
um

215
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,759
the um

216
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,199
so

217
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,680
uh the preoccupied mind

218
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,720
the mind that's spinning and

219
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,039
ruminating caught up in its concerns its

220
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,280
worries its conceits

221
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,599
its problems all kinds of things that's

222
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,639
kind of we can get lost in the labyrinth

223
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,479
of our concerns and preoccupations

224
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,479
that there's so much energy there and so

225
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:57,919
many kind of certain kind of emotions

226
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,280
that go into it

227
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,840
anxiety is a common one

228
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,319
uh desires wanting wanting is another

229
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,560
one

230
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,479
the

231
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,919
you know ill will aversion not wanting

232
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,759
is another one there's a lot of kind of

233
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,520
energy that goes into that kind of

234
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,560
preoccupied caught up mind state

235
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,919
that comes with insistence sometimes it

236
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,759
comes with

237
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,520
a

238
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,240
despair comes with undermining us comes

239
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,479
with kind of um

240
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,719
uh keeping us in touch with a part of

241
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,680
ourselves with if we're if we are in

242
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,760
touch with ourselves that hurts it's

243
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,959
difficult

244
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,479
and in the the pain of it all

245
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,440
it tends to we can recoil from it

246
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,519
in such a way that we put more energy

247
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,680
into that kind of mindset

248
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,440
and we're more spinning out and more

249
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,440
angry and there's anger and hate that

250
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,240
just

251
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,480
just cultivates more of the same there's

252
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,440
greed that cultivates more of the same

253
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,800
there's fear

254
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,760
that cultivates more of the same

255
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,560
if we stay in this kind of reactive kind

256
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,200
of i think of it as kind of a

257
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,600
uh i think of it as

258
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,320
especially as kind of higher up in the

259
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,760
head

260
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,959
in where we are in the head

261
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,120
spinning

262
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,200
there's another source

263
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,720
and there's a source that i i think

264
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,800
spatially is deeper within us maybe in

265
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,279
the heart or maybe in the belly

266
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,600
when we're settled on ourselves

267
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
when we're not caught in the rumination

268
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,000
and preoccupations of our lives

269
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,399
when we're not caught in this spinning

270
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,720
of emotions that are pushing us and

271
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,240
driving us and

272
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,760
and being like

273
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,120
reinforcing it themselves in us

274
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,120
if those can become quiet enough and

275
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,399
still enough

276
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,320
soft and you know and more in the

277
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,480
background or not even there

278
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,480
and we can become settled

279
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,000
here

280
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,279
then there's a places of love

281
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,800
of care

282
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,680
there's a places of generosity

283
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,560
there's places of wisdom and

284
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,959
of patience

285
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,760
that

286
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,200
really they need time to exist

287
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,240
they need space to exist

288
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,920
i like to think of these parts these

289
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,160
really healthy parts of ourselves

290
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,959
often in ways people live their lives i

291
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,320
like to think of them as shy

292
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,320
and so uh

293
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,480
you know they're shy they they need to

294
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,440
be given time and space and

295
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,519
to feel safe to come forward and be

296
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,480
there

297
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,279
and

298
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,079
if we have a loss in self-criticism and

299
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,160
self-hate lost in

300
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,200
in um you know blaming the world for all

301
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,079
our problems lost in our fear and

302
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,600
preoccupations

303
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,360
the healthy parts of us

304
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,200
are kind of they're shy right they're

305
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,560
maybe a little

306
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,480
tender and tentative about

307
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,240
showing up

308
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,600
but if we could

309
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,600
give time and quiet and openness and

310
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,560
enough time to let these shy places come

311
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,920
forward

312
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,720
enough time to give ourselves

313
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,839
a real real opportunity to feel or sense

314
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,760
the generosity

315
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,399
the love the care

316
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,160
the

317
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,160
the generosity

318
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,920
all these healthy parts that exist in us

319
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,720
then those can condition us those can

320
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,720
affect us

321
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,120
they have an impact to live in those

322
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,360
close to those

323
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,279
if we are just kind of and they also are

324
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,680
self-reinforcing

325
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,680
and so but we have to give time for them

326
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,040
to be able to

327
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,320
be self-reinforcing support and change

328
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,680
us and open us and develop us

329
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,720
and

330
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,160
you know it's not like you check it off

331
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,320
generous done that

332
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,440
you know

333
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,320
and

334
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,079
now let's go out and get the ice cream

335
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,160
and you know i deserve it and we need to

336
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,920
rush around the time in either town

337
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,200
trying all the different ice creams

338
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,639
until we find the right one is going to

339
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,920
do it for us

340
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,600
because checked off the generosity thing

341
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,079
because you smiled at someone

342
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,839
and that's done

343
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,399
you know the idea is you know to live a

344
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,399
different way

345
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,880
to come from this place to make time to

346
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,360
feel the generosity to feel this

347
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,600
different source

348
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,360
and that's one of the possibilities that

349
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,040
come from something like meditation it's

350
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,120
not the only way to do this

351
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,800
but it's one of the purposes of

352
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,240
meditation

353
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,480
is to give time

354
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,839
to settle

355
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,320
and feel and open

356
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,480
and start feeling what's this deeper

357
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,079
place

358
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,360
and let and live in that source let that

359
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,160
be the source

360
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,839
in case you're

361
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,600
you know

362
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,839
interested in the pursuit of wealth

363
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,760
over everything else

364
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,480
the buddha had a response to that

365
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,600
he said what comes from this source

366
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,320
is the greatest wealth

367
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,880
greatest wealth is not money and goods

368
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,600
and material things it's really your

369
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,279
loving kindness your compassion

370
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,680
that comes that lives within you there

371
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,680
your integrity

372
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,800
and so that's how you become wealthy

373
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,800
and it's a wonderful wealth because it

374
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,440
fills you from the inside out

375
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,639
that

376
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,839
external wealth can never do

377
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,920
it's not uncommon for me to hear stories

378
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,440
about people who are phenomenally

379
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,880
wealthy

380
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,199
who are empty inside who are you know

381
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,040
don't don't have any not in touch with

382
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,839
his inner wealth

383
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,880
and

384
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,720
some years ago i had there was a person

385
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,800
my circle of friends people i knew who

386
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,560
was probably the poorest person i knew

387
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,920
and the way that he lived his life

388
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,120
i saw him as the wealthiest

389
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,079
you know material he was poor but

390
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,480
in terms of how he lived his life not

391
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,880
just how he felt his life was but just

392
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,120
like the feeling of abundance and

393
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,399
it was quite inspiring to me

394
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,360
so this uh to it takes so to really

395
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,120
appreciate this different source

396
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,360
of what motivates our life what animates

397
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,120
our life

398
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,680
and i would like to suggest

399
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,920
that there's no one but you

400
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,480
who take can take responsibility

401
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,880
for that where you come from we're what

402
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,920
motivates you deep down inside

403
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,240
um there's no pill that can do it for

404
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,360
you i think

405
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,519
i hope not

406
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,040
um you know there's no one else who can

407
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,880
do it for you

408
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,399
it isn't that you wait until you find

409
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,399
the person who's gonna you can be around

410
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,120
that's then you can do it

411
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,120
it's for you to do

412
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,360
and it's really a choice matter it's a

413
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,160
choice a choice point

414
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,639
and don't think it's so all or nothing

415
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,240
it's like i have to not have to choose

416
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,320
to be all good

417
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,320
and choose to avoid all bad it's not

418
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,760
it's not like that kind of all or

419
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,720
nothing

420
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,760
but it's a choice about where you lean

421
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,600
choice of where you want to come back to

422
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,680
what you want to be reminded of

423
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,839
what you want to inspire you

424
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,560
what you want to be reminded of

425
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,240
what you want to try to do that come

426
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,759
from the best you can

427
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,600
and this brings it to the topic a second

428
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,600
topic around this in that these things

429
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,199
can co-exist

430
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,600
luckily they can co-exist

431
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,199
and they can co-exist in a variety of

432
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,320
ways

433
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,839
but the most important way for a

434
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,600
practitioner

435
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,560
is that that part of us that's a healthy

436
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,240
part

437
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,560
can hold

438
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,720
and care for the part that is unhealthy

439
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,639
that part which is

440
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,079
full of greed hatred delusion fear

441
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,720
we don't want to dismiss it

442
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,639
because then it'll come back and bite us

443
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,720
i think

444
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,920
but rather

445
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,839
um we don't want to then kind of think

446
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,759
oh that i can't do that i have to now i

447
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,600
have to feel good

448
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,199
and then have set up a a

449
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,360
a resistance or a

450
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,360
wall between these parts of ourselves

451
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,120
but rather this as we get more and more

452
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,199
aware of this deeper place to come from

453
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,560
then we want to

454
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,800
have that deeper place hold or be

455
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,079
present for

456
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,199
the part that's difficult

457
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,839
because otherwise the that part is

458
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,320
difficult if it's ignored or repressed

459
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,160
will fester and come back in all kinds

460
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,720
of unhealthy ways

461
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,560
so pretending you're good doesn't work

462
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,040
and one of the simplest ways i don't

463
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,480
know simple maybe i should be careful

464
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,558
with the language i use

465
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,000
but i'll say it again but maybe i can

466
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,319
you can

467
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,720
reinterpret it for yourself

468
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,959
the simplest way of doing this

469
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,160
is

470
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,600
not to come from places of generosity

471
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,918
and love and wisdom that they like like

472
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,640
as easy to find

473
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,400
but

474
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,520
bring mindfulness attention

475
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,440
to what's happening

476
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,520
there's mindfulness is considered to be

477
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,280
healthy part of the healthy part of who

478
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,200
we are

479
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,520
and so if we can bring the attention

480
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,400
attentiveness

481
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,799
and hold the difficult parts of

482
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,440
ourselves and learn how to hold it

483
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,480
without

484
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,160
adding more

485
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,440
hatred to our hate

486
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,679
without adding more greed wanting

487
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,720
something so desperately

488
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,320
you know if only i can get rid of my

489
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,080
greed then i can really have that good

490
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,399
stuff

491
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,720
you know or feel like i'm a bad person

492
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,559
because i have delusion i'm supposed to

493
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,640
be wise i better get more books and read

494
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,120
you know then i can practice

495
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,559
but rather

496
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,200
these parts are rather difficult almost

497
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,360
like you it's useful to think of them

498
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,480
they need to be healed

499
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,720
they're parts of us that are kind of

500
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,360
wounded or broken or

501
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,120
hurt or

502
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,880
or undeveloped

503
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,280
and so

504
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,600
to hold them in awareness to hold them

505
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,480
in our good will to hold them in

506
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,559
friendliness

507
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,600
to be present for the make room for them

508
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,840
not so they can motivate us

509
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,280
not so that they drive us anymore

510
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,200
the driving force hopefully is this more

511
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,440
healthy place

512
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,679
as as whatever degree that you can

513
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,120
access it whatever small degree

514
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,880
and from that place

515
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,320
to hold what is an unhealthy earth that

516
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,559
needs to be resolved or settled or

517
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,559
healed

518
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,440
and some of us have a lot of pain

519
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,360
tremendous amount of psychological

520
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,120
emotional even physical pain sometimes

521
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,280
that comes from that's associated one

522
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,039
way or the other

523
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,120
with how we live

524
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,240
from this different source

525
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,240
and some of it is because the deeper

526
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,320
source the deeper parts the tender parts

527
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,480
the shy parts

528
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,960
have been hurt have been betrayed

529
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,280
welcome to society people do all kinds

530
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,080
of terrible things to each other

531
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,320
and uh and so all kinds of things make

532
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,160
it difficult even to be

533
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,280
in that deeper place because of the pain

534
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,559
and so part of this be we can do both

535
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,640
means we learn how to be present for the

536
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,240
pain

537
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,600
difficulty

538
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,799
we don't dismiss anything

539
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,520
but we allow to settle to open

540
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,320
and slowly we begin to more and more at

541
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,200
home

542
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,679
in this place of a deeper source

543
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,919
this deeper wellspring

544
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:14,960
for

545
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,520
the emotions the motivations

546
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,720
that according to this uh psychology

547
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,320
experiment i discussed

548
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,760
are were considered i think they were

549
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,159
considered more the helping dispositions

550
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,000
the helping

551
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,080
and the world needs more helpers doesn't

552
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,520
it

553
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,880
i think that there's not enough

554
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,679
but there's a lot there's plenty

555
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,480
so i some of you probably heard the

556
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,520
famous story that

557
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,520
mr rogers

558
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,520
told of his childhood

559
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,080
when he was young a kid and there was

560
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,840
some catastrophe in the world terrible

561
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,039
things happen in the world i think he

562
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,240
grew up during probably world war ii

563
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,039
and

564
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,080
and his mother would say

565
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,360
remember the helpers in many situations

566
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,880
there are more people helping than the

567
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,039
people who did the terrible things

568
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,559
remember that remember the helpers

569
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,559
so what about

570
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,240
the helper in you

571
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,600
what about you living from place of care

572
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,760
in of this world not because it's an

573
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,360
obligation

574
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,240
not because you should do it

575
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,679
because

576
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,679
you will do that

577
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,480
in your own personal way

578
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,520
if you can find that deeper source

579
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,799
within

580
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,640
if you can rest there come from there

581
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,520
and learn to be very careful

582
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,520
to recognize the difference between

583
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,320
these two different sources for

584
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,440
your behavior your speech and even how

585
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,919
you think

586
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,400
the source from which you that life

587
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,799
comes is a crucial to who you are

588
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,679
and many people don't don't know that

589
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,760
there's these two sources

590
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,159
most people think that the spinning

591
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,960
ruminating difficult challenging

592
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,039
preoccupied

593
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,919
reactive kind of mind

594
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,760
is what there is it's all they've ever

595
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,080
known

596
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,240
and it's a radical thing

597
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,159
to begin

598
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,640
discovering slowly maybe at first as

599
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,720
just trusting as possible

600
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,919
to begin

601
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,080
finding your way to this other source

602
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,480
within

603
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,480
and

604
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,360
thinking that it's shy

605
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,960
that if you want to receive the benefits

606
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,360
of it you have to spend time there close

607
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,200
to it

608
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,440
so for example when you maybe if you get

609
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,080
in touch with this little bit at the end

610
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,080
during something like meditation or

611
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,279
other things you do in your life

612
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,520
when the meditation or whatever thing is

613
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,760
over

614
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,679
don't live the checklist approach to

615
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,679
life okay done that

616
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,840
and pop out of your meditation and rush

617
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,120
off to the

618
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,320
you know

619
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,320
you know to kind of figure out what the

620
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,559
best netflix is to watch

621
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,440
you know

622
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,679
for you to be watching on your commute

623
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,679
to work

624
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,760
while you're checking emails and

625
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,000
and the news has to be you know you know

626
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,679
it's like

627
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,200
don't do that right after meditation

628
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,360
because

629
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,039
i mean you could but

630
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,200
but you but then you're not giving it

631
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,120
opportunity a chance

632
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,600
for this deeper source

633
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,799
to condition you to affect you to

634
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,600
to benefit you to reinforce something

635
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,200
really great

636
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,640
we have to live a different life

637
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,120
if you want to be have a different life

638
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,559
if you want to have a different life but

639
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,039
not change anything

640
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,240
it can't be a different life

641
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,480
so um

642
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,480
and maybe just maybe

643
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,559
you're more likely today to be the good

644
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,400
samaritan

645
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,159
if the need arises

646
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,919
that would be nice

647
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,120
or this week

648
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,960
this year

649
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,360
this life

650
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,039
so thank you all

651
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,480
very much

652
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,880
and as i said earlier

653
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,520
those of you who would like to come and

654
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,520
now and

655
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,960
meet outside

656
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,120
uh we need to have the folding chairs

657
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,640
which they're in the cabinet some people

658
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,000
know where they are

659
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,840
just the other hall

660
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,279
and we'll carry them out there and i'll

661
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,039
come out as soon as i can and join you

662
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,640
and we'll spend about half an hour

663
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,679
together just chatting about this

664
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,840
thank you
