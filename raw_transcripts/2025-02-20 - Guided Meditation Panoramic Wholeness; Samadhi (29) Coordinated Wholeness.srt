1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:06,520
so good morning and hello and welcome to this meditation session that's part of

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:14,519
an ongoing series on samadi and um samadi is the means in

3
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,840
Buddhism in the ear to see things clearly as they

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,279
are and to do so with equinity to do so

5
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:32,320
with a nonreactivity so because reactivity prevents us from

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,120
seeing things as they are and the primary thing that we want to see is

7
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:46,719
ourselves or see in such a way that um we see what's there we see the world

8
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,160
clearly but uh we don't uh get caught in it we become

9
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:59,239
free and so for some of us it's an indirect way of uh finding our equinity

10
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:06,479
with the world it's also an indirect way of responding to the world soat is not a retreating

11
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:15,000
from the world it's a strategic stepping away in order to come back into

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,280
Health psychological spiritual Heth and what's remarkable about the

13
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:30,840
whole process of Buddhist Meditation and Buddhist um uh kind of uh spiritual life

14
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,360
is that uh we have selfhealing properties we have there's a

15
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,720
movement towards homeostasis or a movement towards Health to wholeness

16
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:51,159
there's a movement towards no longer um living in a divided way or no

17
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:59,039
longer caught uh in our reactivity and our fears and our Ambitions and conceits and

18
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:04,479
it's remarkable what opens up for us and it's remarkable how we start allowing

19
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:11,440
and trusting the self-healing the self growing movements the onward leading

20
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,120
nature of this practice and it is onward leading if we

21
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,280
allow trust a deep process of connection

22
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:30,000
to ourselves here and now so part of this with suade is uh

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,519
somebody is a process of becoming whole a process of unification of gathering

24
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:43,159
ourselves together uh to allow this process of the whole of who we are to come into some

25
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:50,920
kind of healed holistic State and so uh as we develop as we

26
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:56,360
settle in and calm down and be more really here grounded in ourselves

27
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:03,000
grounded in this place grounded right here uh meditation practice becomes less and

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:12,080
less concerned with accomplishing anything with uh uh attaining anything

29
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,360
with proving ourselves or making something happen for ourselves

30
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,879
because more and more we see that that movement of mind takes us away from the

31
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:29,200
whole takes us away from really allowing this deeper onward leading process to

32
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:37,239
happen and so the Paradox is that the fastest way from A to B is

33
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:42,840
to be fully at a to be fully here in this

34
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:50,400
experience uh with what's happening now uh uh to not not be interested or

35
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,400
with accomplishments and attainments and getting anywhere in meditation is actually a way in which the whole

36
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:04,319
system uh unfolds and actually moves into some of the deeper places in

37
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:10,959
meditation so it's almost like giving up attaining anything is the way to make

38
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:17,639
progress in the practice so the when we approaching

39
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:23,520
somebody uh there starts becoming more and more a sense of deep con contentment

40
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:30,360
deep happiness deep Joy a deep kind of peace with just this moment here

41
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:37,759
here that uh is feels compelling feels like it has its own life that begin to

42
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:44,919
unfolding and in with that comes a sense of of um of unification and what this

43
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:52,000
means one one of the things that can mean is we have a sense that awareness now becomes more whole more inclusive

44
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,720
more Global and we might be very centered on some point on the settling point in the

45
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:06,800
breathing but that it's not focused it's not tight there's a there's a open soft

46
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,080
relaxed feeling of being centered at ease resting there and the same time a

47
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,280
soft wider focus a sweetness a joy a

48
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:23,280
delight a contentment that is not so specific but is more

49
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,479
diffuse and as we're more content to be here there's a more emphasis on the

50
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:34,800
diffuse awareness then there isn't a tight narrow you know focused attention

51
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,000
but that diffuse awareness that spreads out is nicely

52
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:48,440
centered and the attention is kind of centered but not um uh not uh tight not

53
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:56,400
straining to be with something and it there might feel a great intimacy but there's a feeling

54
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:03,160
it's in a wider container or wider field that could be feel quite

55
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:10,360
spacious quite bubbly quite soft quite warm a glow

56
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,599
something so this broad awareness inclusive

57
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:22,000
awareness so with those introductory words to assume a meditation

58
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:32,039
posture and um and to enter your

59
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:36,319
posture maybe with your eyes

60
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:45,240
closed and as if you're kind of lowering yourself into a refreshing pool of

61
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:52,759
water that you would take a deep breath and on the exhale lowering yourself into

62
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:55,919
the pool of your

63
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:04,240
body settling the

64
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:12,280
body breathing in deeply so that awareness of the body spreads through

65
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:18,599
the Torso with the expanding rib cage and

66
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:31,520
belly breathing in deeply and also feeling the more subtle sense of movement and expansion in the back rib

67
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,638
cage so the experience of breathing is

68
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,560
three-dimensional through the whole

69
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:52,400
torso and then a threedimensional settling on the exhale

70
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,800
and maybe a TW steps exhale exhale as you normally

71
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:14,960
would and then exhale a bit more by relaxing

72
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,360
further the diaphragm the belly

73
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,240
and then letting your breathing be

74
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:49,519
normal and for a few moments here with your eyes

75
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:56,800
closed feel or sense the edges of your body

76
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:08,959
some places where there's contact with the chair or the floor the hands contact with

77
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:16,959
body there's a very clear sense of Edge and other places there's no

78
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,360
contact maybe the edge feels more

79
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:29,839
diffuse more continuous with the space around it

80
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:45,160
and then within the the skin of your body this bag of

81
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:52,560
the body be aware of the global Sensations on the

82
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:00,279
inside almost as if you can imagine

83
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:12,839
a large spacious room within you or large Cavern or a open

84
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:18,320
space and as you breathe that you're breathing within

85
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:26,560
sensations of breathing are moving through the wider space of this body

86
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:42,639
and that as you exhale a calming of the body like a wave

87
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:46,399
that travels through

88
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:14,480
and so the experience of the body breathing is occurring within a wider

89
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:22,680
field of the lived body the general sense of being in a

90
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:31,360
body as it sensed or felt right now maybe a soft a few sense of

91
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:37,839
a vibration energy glow

92
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:46,920
hum where there's not an awareness that fixates on any particular

93
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:57,040
thing like the space in a room doesn't fixate on anything it allows all the

94
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,240
objects to be there as they are

95
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:14,279
or as if you're gazing into the space of a room into the space of an Open

96
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:23,600
Sky the attention doesn't land on any object but the peripheral awareness

97
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:29,480
knows in a general way what's around

98
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:50,199
and within this Global body as you

99
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:57,639
exhale soften the thinking mind a gentle calming of the thinking

100
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:00,639
mind

101
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:27,079
as you're exhaling calming and letting go of

102
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:33,639
thoughts let go in into the body breathing like

103
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:38,800
you're like a leaf settling from a tree onto the forest

104
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,519
floor Awareness on the exhale is

105
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:56,440
settling into the floor of breathing the settling Point

106
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,079
Within for

107
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:51,199
a panoramic sensing feeling of your

108
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:55,079
body without any

109
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:03,240
strain as you saw soften relax calm the

110
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:15,279
body settle into a panoramic sense of being

111
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,440
present with breathing at the

112
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
center

113
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,959
e for

114
00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:46,600
if the whole body is like the ocean the breathing is like the

115
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:53,279
waves lifting and falling on the surface of the ocean

116
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:07,199
and as you breathe like waves through the

117
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:21,159
body also feel whatever pleasure that's

118
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:27,839
present especially any pleasure wellbeing

119
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,039
that comes with a

120
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
meditation

121
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
for

122
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

123
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

124
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

125
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

126
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
for

127
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

128
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

129
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

130
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

131
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
for

132
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

133
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

134
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,360
e e

135
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,480
and as we come to the end of this sitting

136
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,919
gently softly as you exhale

137
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:07,600
let there be a calming settling throughout your

138
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:22,120
body as if there's a wide soft

139
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:30,240
awareness that pervades your body and that breathing in

140
00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:41,919
is a movement that travels through that field of calm or

141
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:50,639
space particular Sensations that travel through the wide field of the

142
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:04,159
body in a sense the body is like an antenna all the sensations that we feel

143
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:13,279
in the body are there because we have the

144
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:17,480
ability to sense to

145
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,520
feel like an antenna

146
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:42,240
and as we get ready to open the eyes and begin the process

147
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,720
of returning into this wide

148
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:59,799
world the wide world is a field of

149
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:05,000
connections wide Network before there were wireless

150
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:13,159
networks there were Wireless people networks of

151
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:20,440
relationships and connections and interactions between people some

152
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:29,880
wordless every communication we have with someone else is part of this human Network

153
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,120
whether we're writing or speaking

154
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:40,440
or sharing a space with

155
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:48,720
people we're designed to be in relationship in this human Network that

156
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,480
we're all part

157
00:28:55,799 --> 00:29:03,320
of and to offer into that wide feeli and network of our

158
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:12,159
Humanity some equivalent of a smile as if a

159
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:17,679
smile brings brightness to the whole

160
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:23,880
field as if a smile is reassuring and calming for the

161
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,919
field a f a smile of friendship smile of

162
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:34,399
care a smile of

163
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:39,240
respect may it be that this practice we

164
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:47,799
do disposes us to spread smiles and kindness and

165
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:56,640
warmth and and Care into this world may we bring a

166
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:05,919
brightness to the this human world human Network may all beings be

167
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:12,519
happy may all being be

168
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:19,559
safe may all beings be

169
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:25,200
peaceful may all beings be free

170
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,600
thank you

171
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:29,240
so hello and welcome to this next talk on samade and we're now at the point of Sam

172
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:36,039
where we're at the phase of the approach the approach phase the approach

173
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:43,159
approaching somebody and uh the classic way of talking about this is that is a

174
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:48,559
gathering together or maybe we can say a coordination of five different factors

175
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:57,000
come into play and having these somehow in in the field there to be coordinated uh creates

176
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:04,120
a kind of Honor W movement onward kind of opening or settling or or

177
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:11,279
strengthening of the state of awareness meditation that we're in and so to kind

178
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:16,840
of gently not try to make anything happen but to allow the coordination to

179
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:23,519
happen and then to kind of gently feel where that onward leading spot is and

180
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,960
just rest with it that almost like you're allowing yourself to be pulled

181
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,799
long so these five coordinated faculties of ours that come into play that become

182
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:40,320
a little bit more pronounced and they have to identify every single one but

183
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:45,399
the tradition says these are the five things that are starting to become in coordinated and working

184
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:53,200
together and um so the first is these two uh the applied and sustained

185
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,639
attention the connecting attention and the sustaining attention and so there is

186
00:32:58,639 --> 00:33:03,679
uh we're not just resting still on some focus of attention like they're

187
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:10,960
breathing there is a kind of gentle kind of like a wave like movement of connecting and releasing connecting

188
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:20,039
releasing connecting wondering away coming back there's a kind of gentle massage that's there stay here stay here

189
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:25,440
and sometimes even I've had the very sense sense of a little voice in the

190
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:32,840
back of the mind that said says it's telling me stay here stay here with us stay with this

191
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:38,760
stay now now sometimes I've used the word yes for this

192
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:44,840
yes yes and there's a little bit wave a little bit kind of like connecting and

193
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:50,720
sustaining and I like the yes because that speaks to the next thing that other

194
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:58,320
five coordinating faculties so the first is the connecting attention the second is sustaining that attention

195
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:04,399
and um and uh in a very small kind of relaxed kind of nice way like

196
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:11,520
yes um and the second the third is some degree of Joy some degree in which the

197
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:18,720
mind is is getting lit up mind is saying oh yes yes this is

198
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:25,118
good yes this this is nice and it's not necessarily verbal like that or but it's

199
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:31,599
as if there's a kind of a of a bright a kind of a maybe a teeny bit of a thrill

200
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:37,599
or a teeny bit of of a pleasure that feels delightful and wonderful that

201
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:43,398
comes with this feeling like um like uh you're now on the slide and it's so

202
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:49,878
great to be sliding along and uh now you're in the field now you're kind of

203
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:56,040
nicely connected and it's almost as if this connecting and sustaining attention

204
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:01,320
is like um you're like a cat being petted and that just something is kind

205
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:07,960
of just feels so joyful happy thrilled but then there's also and this

206
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:14,079
sometimes is less clearly felt but there's also a deeper feeling or or

207
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:19,720
embodied feeling that maybe initially can be described as

208
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:26,240
contentment um I often think of it as happiness uh and it's as less of the

209
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:33,000
mental brightness and thrill that can be there the mental yes this is great but

210
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:40,520
now there's a more settled ah and it's then it becomes easier to kind of this happiness is a a place

211
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:46,320
where it's easier to happily be calm happily be settled happily to be here

212
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:52,359
not needing anything else happy to just be arive and be

213
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:59,200
present because just being alive is enough and so it can it can be feeling of content contentment it can be a

214
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:04,839
feeling of coziness a feeling of sweetness that's settling calming

215
00:36:04,839 --> 00:36:12,520
reassuring uh it is a kind of happiness that brings a sense of confidence like this is the bright place to be this is a

216
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:19,040
good thing and um and uh so there's the connecting

217
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:26,960
attention sustaining attention there's joy there's happiness and then the fifth of these factors coordinating factors is

218
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:34,880
um sometimes called one-pointedness but that one pointedness is too easy to uh have the idea that

219
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:40,440
we're tensing up and straining to be really locked into something and

220
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:46,880
sometimes there is a feeling of being really clicking in and really being present in a very clear way but we're

221
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:54,480
not the one who's doing it it's the it's the system that's doing it so the mind could be quite relaxed so the metaphor

222
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:01,200
or the example I like to use for this is that say we're just staying with the

223
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:10,560
breathing and the breathing is let's say the breathing is like a way of coming and going rising and passing and um and

224
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:16,880
then someone says you should concentrate on the breath and so then there's a mind here and the concentrate every

225
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:25,160
everything in the mind gets tense and focused like a point and then it goes and kind of points and tries to pierce

226
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:30,800
this breath that's kind of is a moving flowing thing and u and sometimes that

227
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:38,960
can create strain and headaches and all kinds of problems to do it this way another way of doing it is um is to let

228
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:44,720
the mind be very soft and relaxed to calm the Mind calm the body relax

229
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:53,480
everything so there's a feeling of spaciousness and open like the hand now is open not collapsed on itself and then

230
00:37:53,480 --> 00:38:00,240
you bring these two together and so this is the holistic kind of broad uh wide

231
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:06,480
sense of being aware because the the mind is quite open and spacious the body

232
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,560
feels quite open and kind of pervade with a kind of a hum of just being alive

233
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:17,079
or the hum or vibration of all the different little sensations of the body

234
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:22,200
kind of singing together and um and the open mind that

235
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:27,800
there's no tension in the mind and the the breathing is still moving and what

236
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:34,839
you do is you bring this together so that the the um maybe the breathing gets quieter and

237
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:41,280
quieter and so the breathing and the most sensitive part of the Mind meet and

238
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,359
join and so there's a resting a coming together so there's a kind of a sense of

239
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:52,119
being right centered on the breathing the the massage of the breathing staying

240
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:58,440
there the connecting attention is kind of like connecting sustaining

241
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:05,599
Falls away connecting sustaining to the most sensitive part of the of the of the

242
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:11,760
mind so there's a lot really s centered there but it's not focused it's not

243
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:17,319
preoccupied and there's all same time a broad field all around it that can feel

244
00:39:17,319 --> 00:39:25,400
sometimes like just like space sometimes it can feel like a sweetness a pleasure a joy a a holistic kind of sense of

245
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:30,800
being here in the whole body and but this is soft and relaxed but and so this

246
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:39,040
begins taking prominence and sometimes what will happen is is this here this connection will uh become stronger and

247
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:46,000
stronger and everything around it becomes softer and softer and maybe parts of the body seem to disappear The

248
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,640
Wider World disappears because and we're just sitting right there on the

249
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,839
breathing so uh so that's the one pointedness that the one Gathering the

250
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:04,200
one settling the set settling place the Gathering Place the sensitivity place

251
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:11,040
that we really feel oh this is it and um so then when these when these uh five

252
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:16,920
factors are coordinated then there's a kind of a gentle there might be a gentle gentle

253
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:23,040
gentle feeling of onward movement and one way that I felt

254
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:29,640
it is it's almost like there's a place maybe in this breathing Maybe and whatever the where the where the sense

255
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:34,680
of Joy or the pleasure maybe is the strongest with all this it's almost like

256
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:41,119
the Dharma up ahead with a string and it's gently pulling you here here and so

257
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:48,160
there's a some place inside that feels like oh here is where the slide is here's where the world is opening up

258
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:56,040
here is where to relax into not to rush into not to uh uh but it's a place of

259
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:03,640
approach and as we are approaching um this feeling of being content being holistic

260
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:09,200
being whole being unified becomes a little bit stronger and stronger

261
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:14,280
everything is here together there's nowhere else we'd rather be there's

262
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:19,480
thinking mind is quieter and quieter to the degree to which we're thinking uh

263
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:24,640
it's thoughts about the meditation his thoughts about ah here it is here's the

264
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:31,040
in breath here's the whole whole feel here and present and it's nothing more

265
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:37,480
sophisticated than that just the most simple kind of thoughts about the experience and then in the process of

266
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:44,000
that uh you there might be a feeling there there's something operating here which is not

267
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:50,960
you it's something operating here that U that you can trust something an onward

268
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:58,040
movement a a deepening settling a deeper opening um and this

269
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:04,760
and and this is something that if you have any role at all to it is to trust

270
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:11,960
anything at all it's kind of to let go let go into that place where into

271
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:19,000
that onward leading feeling where either it's onward leading because it feels like the pleasure the joy is going to

272
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:26,119
grow if they're onward leading because it feels like this is where the the center point is that you want to kind of

273
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:31,440
really rest and follow and be with allow yourself to be pulled by that

274
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:38,559
string allow yourself to be carried on that slide allow yourself to open that

275
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:44,960
door allow the the uh the

276
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:50,359
the you know like if you have a parachute on allow kind of the the the

277
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:55,599
floor of the airplane to fall open so you can start floating and flying in the

278
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:01,400
space with the that parachute so there is this kind of so

279
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:07,720
onward leading so this coordination of all these things and that coming into a

280
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:13,960
wholeness this way is not exact not something you can engineer and plan for

281
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:20,440
but you can feel the symptoms of it you could feel the joy feel the pleasure

282
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:26,240
feel the the the goodness of it all the sweetness of it all the contentment of

283
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:33,680
just being fully here and trust it trust it and allow for it don't be the

284
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:39,559
engineer don't don't be the Constructor and the maker of it don't be measuring

285
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:47,720
and trying to am I there yet just trust to be the fastest way from A to B is to

286
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:55,079
be fully at a and as we're at a at this approach stage then the

287
00:43:55,079 --> 00:44:01,359
Dharma will know what to do your job is to trust the process not be

288
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:06,520
in a hurry not to try to make it happen and maybe the biggest thing you can do

289
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:13,400
is to let go into trusting the process rather than making the process and uh

290
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:18,760
however long it takes so um we'll have one more talk on

291
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:27,319
this approach point and um thank you very much
