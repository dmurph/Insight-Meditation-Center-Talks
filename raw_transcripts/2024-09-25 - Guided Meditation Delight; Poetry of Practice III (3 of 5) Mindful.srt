1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:07,160
oh good morning welcome welcome everybody this is the third in this

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:15,559
series I'm doing on the Poetry of practice and something I'd like to say about some of the power of poetry and

3
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:22,160
maybe part of reason why some some of us not everybody appreciates it I certainly

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,320
did not appreciate poetry earlier in my life I thought it was frivolous and I

5
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:33,000
didn't understand it and uh but uh now I have this much greater

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,680
appreciation but part of the power what excuse me

7
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,879
here I had to mute myself while I was uh cing so I wanted to say part of the

8
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:08,200
power of poetry like some of the impact or its um Beauty I might even say is

9
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:14,600
that it lets us see things in a different way see things in a different way or

10
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:20,280
maybe even just see different things that we might ordinarily like just

11
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,000
ignore or not notice but poetry kind like often like points us to this way

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,360
and to see things from uh maybe like a different perspective and sometimes this is a a surprising perspective you know

13
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,520
maybe a little bit different one and maybe there's often this very subtle

14
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,680
sense of delight like oh like Oh I thought of that or oh it's

15
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:52,799
not interesting and there's this way that this subtle sense of delight is not

16
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:59,200
so different from that subtle sense of delight that we get when we finally kind

17
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,880
of like align ourselves with reality and start and they're Mindful and present

18
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,920
for what's actually happening in that moment even if what's being experienced

19
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:16,440
is not pleasant if it's uncomfortable but there's this subtle sense of

20
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,519
like yeah okay it's like this instead of

21
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:26,879
you know trying to convince ourselves differently or Gaslight ourselves in

22
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:34,879
some kind of way so this subal sense of delight that poetry allows and I would say that

23
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:43,360
mindfulness like being present for whatever is happening whether it's ordinary Pleasant unpleasant neutral

24
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,159
just uh to be present for what's

25
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:55,239
happening so with that is a short little introduction let's do some

26
00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:02,599
meditation those you who have been here earlier in the week know that um oh guide us a little bit in some meditation

27
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:07,680
and then I'll drop in a poem and then I'll talk a little bit

28
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,040
about the poem after the

29
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:26,280
meditation is there a way that we can bring a sense of

30
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,560
collectedness like bringing in all the different aspects of our

31
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:38,120
experience to be here sometimes the mind is in one place

32
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:48,480
while the body is in a different place can we combine them and be here

33
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:20,560
maybe there's a way it makes sense to have the imagery of dropping into the

34
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:27,400
body like maybe there's the the Mind joins the body and drops in or something

35
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:35,758
like that touch that we inhabit this bodily

36
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:57,440
experience so that we're present or whatever there is to be

37
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:06,319
present for right now right here

38
00:05:53,039 --> 00:06:01,319
feeling connected and supported with our sitting surface

39
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:14,319
you shouldn't underestimate how helpful and supportive it can be to feel

40
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,319
grounded connected

41
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:58,680
you're sitting to allow the posture to rise out of the groundedness the

42
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,520
foundation

43
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,520
connectedness e

44
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,720
in the attention on the experience of

45
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:30,319
breathing not the idea but the experience

46
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:36,039
the felt sense

47
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:44,200
feeling for example the stretch with the

48
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,080
inhale and the release of the stretch with the

49
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,440
exhale e

50
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:57,800
that body is experienced this morning today right now this

51
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:07,640
moment can you be okay just for this session can you be

52
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,640
okay with however the body is at this

53
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
moment

54
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240

55
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,279
e e

56
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:06,960

57
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:12,639
[Music] do just very simply

58
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:18,560
gently begin again with the sensations of

59
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
breathing

60
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120

so I'd like to offer a palm

74
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:07,760
you don't have to do anything with this poem it's just an

75
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,880
offering allow it to be experienced you don't have to figure it

76
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:20,400
out or understand it or don't look it up or anything like

77
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:28,600
this just allow it to join you in your meditation

78
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:41,400
this poem is called mindful by Mary Oliver mindful by Mary

79
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:50,600
Oliver it goes like this every day I see or hear something

80
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:58,640
that more or less kills me with delight that leaves me like a needle in

81
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:06,600
the haystack of light it was what I was born for to look

82
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:15,480
to listen to lose myself inside this soft world to instruct myself over and over

83
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:22,039
in joy and acclamation nor am I talking about the

84
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:29,159
exceptional the fearful the Dreadful the very extravagant but of the ordinary

85
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:35,120

[Music]

114
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:12,320
thank you for meditating together it's my way to meditate

115
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:20,440
together so continuing on this uh theme of poetry is practice say a little bit

116
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:26,360
more about poetry there's this way that in poetry

117
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:34,760
you find like this comp of expression like where things get said like a lot gets said in a few

118
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:40,159
words and maybe there's a certain amount of directness but maybe not in the

119
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:45,799
directness that uh we often think about in Pros there's like a it's

120
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:51,159
pointing with um some cleanness or

121
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:58,640
Clarity of where it's pointing but that's the manner of pointing is not direct direct would maybe to say

122
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:05,360
something or label something specifically but this uh Clarity I would

123
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:12,399
say maybe is similar to this a non-distracted mind like when we're meditating there's a certain Clarity of

124
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:18,320
the mind and so in the same way poetry has this uh Clarity in the way that it

125
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,519
points to things and maybe you know the way that poetry points is through the we

126
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:31,559
might say the magic of metaphor or use of other senten senses you know the way things smell or

127
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:39,519
how they look or or maybe there's a way in which um

128
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:46,720
they highlight different ways of experience things but it's pointing towards experience so often at least the

129
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:52,480
poems that I'm uh bringing forth for this and there's maybe one more thing I

130
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:58,039
want to say about poetry here is that it can shine a light in some kind of way

131
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:03,159
towards something that maybe otherwise we just wouldn't see or the light helps

132
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:08,279
us to see things differently with a different perspective this is part of

133
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:14,679
the what I'm calling the Poetry of practice it's like how poetry and practice of this uh

134
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:21,000
relationship not only using poetry as a support for practice but uh in ways in

135
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,639
which the experiences in some kind of way uh share some

136
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:32,080
elements so this morning and during the guide meditation I introduced this poem

137
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:38,000
called mindful by Mary Oliver Mar Oliver many of you knows an American poet she

138
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:45,960
won the petzer prize uh like in the mid 80s and then this poem she wrote got

139
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:52,320
published in 2005 when she was 70 years old I just love this right you know she

140
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:57,360
was in the later season of her life and

141
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:03,000
she was still writing poetry still offering things of beauty to the world

142
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:09,200
this meaningful for me that it's not like we just have a only one season of

143
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,480
our life in which we're offering things that's of value but uh here's Mary

144
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:20,158
Oliver when she's 70 years old offering

145
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:28,600
things so here's this poem it's called mindful by Mary Oliver

146
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:35,559
every day I see or hear something that more or less kills me with

147
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:41,120
delight that leaves me like a needle in the Hast stack of

148
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:48,639
light it was what I was born for to look to listen to lose myself inside this

149
00:32:48,639 --> 00:32:53,840
soft world to instruct myself over and over

150
00:32:53,840 --> 00:33:00,919
in joy and acclamation nor am I talking about the exceptional

151
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:07,279
the fearful the Dreadful the very extravagant but of the ordinary the

152
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:16,159
common the very drab the daily presentations oh good scholar I say to

153
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:24,880
myself how can you help but grow wise with such teachings as these the untable

154
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:32,240
light the untable light of the world the oceans Shine the prayers that are made

155
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,760
out of grass I don't know this uh poem just uh

156
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:44,159
makes me happy and each time I read it like you know of course I read it a few times before I offered it for you guys

157
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:50,440
but while I was reading it during the guide meditation I had some new ideas about it and just now I had some new

158
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:56,880
ideas about it and for me this is something I love about poetry that there's this depth to it it's not like

159
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:02,480
it's just one dimensional one way to uh interpret it or understand it those of

160
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:10,040
you may know I've also taught a lot of suta study Through The Years both in the academic setting and uh and in the

161
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:16,480
Dharma setting and this is also something I love about the sutas there's such a depth and a breadth

162
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:22,960
of meaning it's not like the first time we understand it it's the first time like okay I got it next you know it's

163
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:29,040
not like that with poetry or with sutas so I'll offer some things here

164
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:36,679
about this poem but maybe you find you found something different that was helpful and meaningful for you and again

165
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:44,839
the encouragement here is to take what's useful and just leave behind what isn't so here are some of Diana's

166
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:52,520
thoughts about this I appreciate that she's pointing to the maybe we might use this word uplift

167
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:58,800
uplift of the heart and mind she's uh saying this kills me with

168
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:04,720
delight instruct myself over and over in Joy so she's using these you know

169
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:11,480
obvious words kills me with delight over instruct myself over and over in Joy but

170
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:19,079
she's also using some of this uh less um uh direct language this is what I was

171
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:26,240
born for right there's a there's a an uplift of the heart when we feel like oh

172
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:32,640
this is what I was born for so she's pointing

173
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:39,520
to brightness you know obviously joy and Delight but uh maybe I'll use this word

174
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:47,880
brightness but I love that she's not uh assigning this to some Peak experience

175
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:57,200
she's not saying okay there's Delight because I got what I wanted it's not Delight uh because um I am feeling love

176
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:04,119
in some some particular way with a person I finally had the perfect relationship or the perfect job or

177
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:11,800
perfect anything she's pointing to the ordinary and in some ways we could say

178
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:18,440
the very first line of this poem you guys can't see the page breaks unless you're looking at it or I'm sorry the

179
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:24,960
line breaks but uh she starts this poem starts with every

180
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:30,640
day this is the ordinary stuff stuff that happens every day and then there's

181
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:38,240
this expression in the poem nor am I talking about the exceptional the fearful the Dreadful the very

182
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:43,960
extravagant so when I was reading that um just now for you guys it occurred to

183
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:50,440
me like oh this kind of sounds like the news something else that is every

184
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:55,680
day but the exceptional fearful Dreadful and extravagant this is what makes it

185
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:02,240
into the news these days right it's uh if it bleeds it leads you know if it's

186
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:07,440
going to um provoke us and poke Us in some kind of way that's what gets in the

187
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:15,040
news and that's not what Mary Oliver is pointing to here instead she even says

188
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:22,200
right um in the poem she says explicitly the ordinary the common the

189
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:28,560
very trb the daily presentations

190
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:35,680
ordinary the common the very drab the daily

191
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:41,319
presentations I think she's uh encouraging us not to wait for something

192
00:37:41,319 --> 00:37:47,520
that's extraordinary not to wait until

193
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:53,560
something you know noteworthy quote unquote shows up and before we start to

194
00:37:53,560 --> 00:38:01,880
feel some Delight to start to feel some um some of this uplift and I appreciate

195
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:08,920
that she's not denying that there's D fearful Dreadful

196
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:14,160
extravagant extravagant in terms of like whoa that's too much that's too extreme

197
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:19,760
she's not denying that that exists she's not pretending that it's not that it

198
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:26,200
doesn't exist but she's encouraging us can we just look towards the the

199
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,440
ordinary the daily

200
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:37,960
things and also there's something about this ordinary this the last line of this

201
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:44,079
poem are prayers that are made of grass I scratched my head a little bit

202
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:50,119
like prayers that are made of grass what what is this but maybe there's this way

203
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:55,839
we can think of like grass is one of the most common and maybe unremarkable

204
00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:01,640
things right that is on this planet it like there's grass everywhere different types of grasses in so many different

205
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:07,800
types of ecosystems and there's so many different ways in which grass shows up

206
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:14,599
like even like between the cracks and the sidewalk type of thing like we just think that grass is

207
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:22,480
just everywhere so the prayers that are made of grass so bringing something maybe this connection with the Divine or

208
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,960
maybe a prayer is kind of represent something that's heartfelt and meaningful or maybe there something

209
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:35,960
about devotion that says ordinary and maybe everywhere is

210
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:41,480
grass maybe we can consider maybe even uh grass as something a connection to

211
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:46,880
something bigger than ourselves and then here's something that

212
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:54,760
I want to point to that um really um I think is so important also in this poem

213
00:39:54,760 --> 00:40:01,720
and that is oblique in the pointings to it and now how she's pointing to with

214
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:09,160
this delight and this uplift and connection with the ordinary no longer being the exact

215
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:15,599
center of everything there's a lack of self-centeredness in this

216
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:22,079
poem there's a lack of I finally got what I wanted there's a lack of I

217
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:29,000
finally made the world work the way it should there's a lack of

218
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:35,359
I um I I don't I don't know we'll have to I'm sure we could fill in the blank with

219
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:42,040
so many different ways but here are some of the oblique ways in my view in which she's pointing

220
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:49,760
to this she writes every day I see or hear something that more or less kills

221
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:55,520
me with delight so kills me there's a sense of

222
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:04,040
the me goes away and it's just Del light it's not that oh I'm finally happy

223
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:10,160
I'm finally feeling something good it kills me with delight and then the next

224
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:16,000
line is that leaves me like a needle in the Hast stack a needle in the Hast

225
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:23,800
stack right it's one thing that's just like the other so no longer having to be the center of attention but happily

226
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:30,560
being in the with the other things you know

227
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:38,000
indistinguishable and then she also um has this line it was what I was born for

228
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,160
to look to listen to Lose

229
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:49,599
Myself lose myself right often when we are at the center of

230
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:56,240
attention or the S I should say you know that expression isn't quite right when

231
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:03,280
we are uh feel like we're at the center and everything is all about me me

232
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,960
me then it's that's it's about me me me because there's something not quite

233
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:17,560
right we're trying to fix something or we're trying to get something but uh part of this delight is being part of

234
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:23,640
the universe not being the center of the

235
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:29,599
universe and for some of us that might feel like no no no no no I need to be the center of the universe I need to

236
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:34,680
because I have all these needs that are not being met and and there's a way that

237
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:40,359
I think Mary Oliver here she's pointing to so much of

238
00:42:40,359 --> 00:42:45,880
the uplift of the heart can happen if there's a way if we can

239
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:51,359
soften if we can let go if we can not

240
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:59,119
cling so tightly but to allow uh our experience to be part of the

241
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:05,680
Universe maybe in the same way that she's talking about this un trimmable

242
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:13,000
light of the world and the oceans shine these I would say like pointing to

243
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:20,359
Radiance things that are like moving out and being shared with indiscriminately with

244
00:43:20,359 --> 00:43:27,440
everybody everything things that are boundless they're untable they're shine they

245
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:33,599
they're just going out and don't have an end this is part of the way that we can

246
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:40,800
show up in the world we can find the Delight we can experience the delight and share the delight and joy of the

247
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:46,800
world this boundless Radiance that she's pointing

248
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:55,480
to I'll read this PO One Last Time mindful by Mary

249
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:02,160
Oliver every day I see or hear something that more or less kills me with

250
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:11,640
delight that leaves me like a needle in the Hast stack of light it was what I was born for to look

251
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:19,119
to listen to lose myself inside this soft world to instruct myself over and

252
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:25,480
over in joy and acclamation nor am I talking about the

253
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:32,000
exceptional the fearful the Dreadful the very extravagant but of the ordinary the

254
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:39,640
common the very drug the daily presentations oh good scholar I say to

255
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:45,599
myself how can you help but grow wise with such teachings as these the

256
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:54,480
untradable light of the world the oceans Shine the prayers that are made out of

257
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:02,520
grass my wish for you is may you find joy and delight and the untable light of

258
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:10,640
the world and maybe even the oceans shine thank you
