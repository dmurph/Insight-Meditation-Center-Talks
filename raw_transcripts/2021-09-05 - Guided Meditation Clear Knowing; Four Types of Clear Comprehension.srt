1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,680
thank you for being here it's delightful for me to be able to come here to imc and

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,200
sit and practice and be able to teach so it's wonderful

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,439
and um one of the kind of north stars the guide

4
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,720
orient for this orientation of mindfulness practice is uh

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,560
the possibility of clarity of clearly knowing what's

6
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,079
happening in the present moment and it takes a while maybe for new practitioners to learn this clear

7
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:44,399
knowing but um and have a sense of what that means and i get a feel for it a sense kind of a

8
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,800
a inner kind of recognition of what clear recognition is clear knowing

9
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,559
and to appreciate it and to appreciate clear knowing

10
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:02,640
and then maybe it's easier to come into this quiet or non-discursive

11
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,799
uh meditative mode of being where we're not chasing for states of mind

12
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:15,360
we're not trying to make ourselves concentrated particularly the concentration definitely is a good

13
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:23,600
thing to happen but we're relying first and foremost on our ability to clearly know

14
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:31,200
and not to chase after clear knowing but to clearly know what is obvious

15
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,119
so it's not like a lot of work to know but then appreciate what that clarity is like

16
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:44,240
and even if we are unclear the mind is tired and fuzzy um and perhaps

17
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,920
it's good enough just to clearly know that and to appreciate something about this

18
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,200
clear simple simple knowing that's possible

19
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,758
so to assume a meditation posture

20
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,640
that the posture itself encourages a little

21
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,360
bit of embodied alertness

22
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,280
embodied attentiveness

23
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,200
and to take a few long slow deep breaths

24
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,319
and those breaths can be easy relaxed

25
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:38,560
leisurely just a leisurely longer breath than usual take your time doing it but don't

26
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,480
make yourself winded or strained in doing it

27
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:51,840
three quarters full and a long leisurely exhale

28
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:04,599
and in this long exhale to settle in and relax your body

29
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:16,000
and then letting your breathing return to normal in the core practice of mindfulness we

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,560
don't do any special breathing anymore it's just a kind of a warm-up

31
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:33,840
but part of this settling in then with the normal breathing can be continuing to relax the body

32
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:41,319
as you exhale to soften and relax around the face

33
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,120
to soften and relax the shoulders

34
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,920
to soften and relax

35
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,159
the belly

36
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:28,120
and then to just settle into the simplicity of the body breathing

37
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,680
and in doing so

38
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,600
see if you can know something about the breathing

39
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:51,120
with clarity clear recognition it can be as simple as clearly knowing

40
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,919
that you are inhaling

41
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,280
clearly recognizing that the exhale

42
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,280
clearly knowing the sensations that appear as you breathe in

43
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:26,720
and knowing the sensations that appear when you exhale

44
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,240
and if you're practicing this clear knowing just simple knowing

45
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,039
see if you can adjust it so there's no strain

46
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,759
there's no reaching to try to attain something or get something or

47
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,199
avoid anything

48
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,039
if your mind gets involved in thinking step back and clearly know that that's

49
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:42,720
the case where the knowing is not further thinking

50
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,080
but rather a kind of quieting calming

51
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,440
awareness but clearly knows

52
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,319
this is thinking

53
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,840
and then begin again with the breathing

54
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:14,800
whenever you return to your breathing notice if you return to an inhale

55
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,840
or an exhale

56
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,519
so

57
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:42,480
is there available to you a kind of clear knowing of the moment of

58
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,679
what is obvious that the clear knowing itself feels

59
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:54,160
peaceful quiet calm

60
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:02,840
at ease with what is known words simply knowing

61
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,840
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

62
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:39,120
to take a moment or two to clearly recognize

63
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:45,520
where you're sitting the location here in your

64
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:55,279
seat and that there's a you can be grounded in your place

65
00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:00,799
rooted here in clearly recognizing and

66
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:06,720
not drifting off in thought to other places other times but to be here

67
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,960
now

68
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:21,440
but then to open your attention to the whole world around you

69
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:29,120
while you stay rooted while you stay embodied here

70
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:37,440
and take in that across the world

71
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:44,960
locally and far away there there are fires and smoke

72
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,720
hurricanes and rain

73
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,640
heat and drought

74
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:03,518
there's illness of all kinds

75
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:11,279
coved and people and lock down

76
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:15,559
people struggling with illness

77
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,960
war and poverty and hunger

78
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,720
to sit grounded here

79
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,440
losing the embodiment and groundedness in here

80
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:42,559
not getting swept up in the conditions of the world

81
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:50,639
but in being grounded to have a greater capacity to witness it

82
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:55,398
to be present for it all

83
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,080
and through this practice that we do may we find

84
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:11,440
the ability to balance being grounded and centered in the present moment here with us

85
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,679
here we can find our inner freedom

86
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,158
and

87
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:28,880
be mindful of what's happening in the world around us so that we can live for the care of the

88
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:35,600
world that our ability to

89
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:43,759
support the welfare of others is also part of our

90
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:51,360
how we can live our life may it be that this meditation practice

91
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,480
we do together supports us

92
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:02,880
to be more capable in living for the welfare and happiness of others

93
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:11,118
and for ourselves may all beings be happy

94
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:16,878
may all beings be safe

95
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:22,720
may all beings be peaceful

96
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,638
and may all beings everywhere

97
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,000
be free

98
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:49,669
[Music]

99
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,520
so good day to everyone

100
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:08,880
and i just finished yesterday teaching a week-long retreat

101
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,079
on through zoom it was online retreat

102
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:19,440
lovely to teach this with lovely to be part of it

103
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:25,440
and the theme of the retreat was the topic of clear comprehension

104
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:31,839
or clear recognition and so i'd like to kind of

105
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:39,040
follow continue with that theme since it's kind of fresh on my mind and on my heart

106
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:45,359
and it's an integral part of mindfulness practice in fact sometimes the teachings

107
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:50,960
of the buddha the word for mindfulness sati

108
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:56,560
and the word for clear comprehension clear recognition

109
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:02,800
some pajama are treated as a compound sati sampajana

110
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,560
and you know they're kind of maybe all part of the same they're closely and

111
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:13,920
intimately connected to each other our capacity to be mindful

112
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:20,160
gives us or awakens or makes room for our capacity than to know what's happening

113
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:25,520
and this ability to really know not in some complicated way but to

114
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:32,000
really recognize what this is what's happening this is what is is a kind of superpower

115
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,880
it's that valuable it's that significant once we can stop and clearly rest we

116
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:45,280
have to stop but once we clearly recognize something that makes room for it to register for

117
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:51,200
all kinds of other understandings to follow there's less confusion

118
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:56,960
sometimes there can be a clear kind of relaxation oh now i understand what's happening

119
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,880
oh it's like that uh the clear recognition of something

120
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:09,200
that allows for sometimes the next step to occur the next thing to happen but if we're fuzzy if

121
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:16,800
we're not really clear what's there then we can't build on that or can't grow from that or can't let it somehow

122
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:23,680
register or be felt or be processed in some deep way and the clearer we can know what we're

123
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:30,480
feeling what's happening with us what the impact has been on world events for us

124
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:36,400
all kinds of ways that the clear recognition clear knowing makes room

125
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:42,400
for the heart to move on and open up and process in some way

126
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,760
and it's a great support for mindfulness practice and in fact

127
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:54,160
in the teachings of the buddha the primary function of clear recognition is in the teaching in the practice of

128
00:38:54,160 --> 00:39:02,480
mindfulness and to practice clear recognition of of all aspects of our life as we go

129
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,200
through it so that we stay close to

130
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:14,960
always kind of being cognizant always being conscious of what we're doing as we doing it

131
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:21,280
so rather than buddhist teaching so if you're walking clearly know

132
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:28,320
that you're walking if you're standing clearly know you're standing and sitting down clearly know you're

133
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:34,880
standing and it's so simplistic this little instruction that it can seem like you know i'm more

134
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:41,040
sophisticated than that i don't have to kind of slow down for anything just to recognize that i'm standing or sitting

135
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:48,480
but uh to remain close enough in with awareness to really track and be conscious of

136
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:54,960
what you're doing what you're doing as you in your body also what you're doing in

137
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:02,800
your speech or what you're doing just before you speak be so you're conscious of what's coming

138
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,920
you start living a mindful life but you also start living a life where

139
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:14,319
you're more close to the place where you make choice about what to say what to do

140
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:20,400
and to stay that kind of close in and clearly recognize and be conscious live a conscious life

141
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:26,319
is a clearly important part of buddhist spirituality

142
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:31,680
now as the buddhist tradition developed over the centuries they developed

143
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:37,440
an expansion of this idea of sampajana clearly recognizing clearly knowing

144
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,960
that's uh where they listed four different things you can clearly know

145
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:49,359
and and this i think of this is this is now a little bit stepping away

146
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:55,680
from the clearly knowing breathing or clearly knowing standing or walking or clearly knowing how we're feeling in the

147
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:01,040
moment it's a but it's a clear knowing of something that's definitely part of

148
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:08,079
human life but it's a little bit more higher order a little bit more a little bit more involved than the

149
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:13,280
simple moment moment experience that sometimes happens in mindfulness meditation

150
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:20,319
so these four kinds of clear things to clearly know something we're able to clearly know and

151
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:26,640
and clearly knowing it we get so much benefit and this is where it becomes kind of a superpower

152
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:32,160
so the first one is [Music] clearly knowing the purpose of what

153
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:38,640
we're doing clearly knowing the suitability

154
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:44,319
what's suitable to fulfill that purpose clearly knowing

155
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:50,560
uh how we get nourished from that it's called the the pasture

156
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:57,680
the place where the cows go and eat go chara how do we clearly know how we get

157
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:06,319
nourished by engaging in the purpose what we're doing

158
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:13,119
and then uh the fourth one is clear comprehension of non-delusion clear comprehension how to go forward

159
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:19,359
without the overlay of projections and bias and fantasies and stories

160
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:26,880
that make the whole thing so much more complicated so to uh and in many cities

161
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:34,800
and these can be understood these four or they can be practiced as uh in the form of questions

162
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,720
what's the purpose of what you're doing right now what's the purpose of why you're going

163
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:46,000
to say what you're going to say to ask and to ask that question repeatedly

164
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,839
is in all kinds of circumstances uh begins uh bringing clarity to what

165
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:57,839
drives us what motivates us also gives us an opportunity to adjust

166
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:04,000
the purpose that uh we might have a you know a um

167
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,920
a simple answer right away now sometimes uh people who've been

168
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:15,599
practicing some forms of buddhism like to you ask them what's the purpose

169
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:22,079
and they don't like to get into a complicated purpose they're just like oh you know why are you you know what purpose are

170
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:28,000
you going for a walk and um you know like today i went for a walk this morning

171
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,359
and someone could have stopped me said why are you going for a walk and i could have said i'm walking just

172
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:39,920
to walk but that wasn't actually the case i had another purpose in mind for the walk the

173
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:45,200
purpose was to begin thinking about this dharma talk to give today

174
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:53,040
and so the purpose was thinking and then for about the talk and so then what is a suitable way to walk if that

175
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:58,160
was what's in mind well i when i think about my dharma talks i tend to walk a little bit slower

176
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:04,240
than i would if i'm not doing something like that so i knew that i was you know a slower pace

177
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:10,079
and it was also not to spend a lot of time looking around and

178
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:17,200
and noticing a lot about the different things in my neighborhood but to kind of walk and be attentive but

179
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:24,240
allow myself to kind of stay close to the kind of uh flow of thoughts about different ideas

180
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:30,000
about this case clear comprehension and how to do it in a way that is

181
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,359
nourishing and so if i'm worried about the talk

182
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:41,520
or if i'm so pulled into the world of the thought and the ideas then i'm not nourished by it but if i take my time

183
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:47,760
walk slow i did walk slowly and stay connected to my body as i walked in my

184
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,880
to my kind of inner experience as i walked in as i thought about it

185
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:58,160
then there's a way in which that thinking uh kind of uh was in harmony with

186
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:05,920
something within and it was actually very pleasant and enjoyable to uh to do this

187
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:11,680
and then um i wasn't deluded about what i was doing i was very consciously aware of what i

188
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:17,040
was doing i had chosen what i was going to do and i was in i was engaged in that

189
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:23,040
choice and and it felt kind of uh it was like it was a clarity and simplicity to

190
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:28,319
what i was doing that i felt it also was kind of nourishing and satisfying

191
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:35,040
so that's going through so so this these four kinds of clear comprehension can be used in all kinds of

192
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:40,560
circumstances in life and and sometimes we do something for one

193
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:46,400
purpose and and if we reflect what's the purpose of doing it we realized that actually

194
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:53,280
there's a higher purpose we could do this for if i realize it's time for me to

195
00:45:53,280 --> 00:46:01,359
cook for my family so the purpose is to cook for my family well that's nice but if i reflect and or

196
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:06,640
ask myself the question for what purpose are you cooking then i could say well i'm cooking for my

197
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:13,599
family but i'd like to offer offer food to my family that's nourishing for mind and body i'd like to

198
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:20,400
be able to offer it with love and then i orient myself to the cooking in a different way than if just to get

199
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:27,599
the cooking over with so i can go on to other things so um

200
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:35,359
and to live a purposeful life is actually one of the orientations for doing buddhist practice

201
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:41,839
in buddhism and for doing buddhist practice there's many purposes for why people do it and

202
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:47,760
but it helps have a clarity of what that purpose is if we're vague about doing buddhist

203
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:53,359
practice if we're doing because we have a general idea it's a good idea

204
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:58,880
we might still do it and might still benefit from it but there isn't such clarity

205
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:05,920
about how we engage how to do it in a way that supports the purpose

206
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:12,960
there isn't a clarity to understanding the purpose and then prioritizing that with other purposes

207
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:18,720
that we have there are many good things to do in the world but it's hard to do all of them in

208
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:25,680
fact to spread ourselves itself thin we don't do anything really well and so for example in the case of

209
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:32,720
buddhist practice if this is a high enough priority in a person's life and they know that

210
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:39,440
then then they can easily hopefully organize their priorities in terms of

211
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:46,160
what they mostly engage in something for some people buddhist practice is the dharma life is the most

212
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:51,680
central thing in their life and so then uh it makes sense if it's that

213
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:57,280
central to really give yourself over to it to give time for it

214
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:04,160
and not spend a lot of other time doing other things and so you never get to the practice itself

215
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:10,240
so uh this is not a requirement to do this it's not like meant to be in

216
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:15,760
an obligation but um to ask ourselves the question what is the purpose

217
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:22,960
that i want to live my life for what's the intention what was the organizing principle i have

218
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:29,040
if there's clarity around that then we can put ourselves behind it

219
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:35,119
but then how do we put ourselves behind it how do we engage in the purpose we do and for that

220
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:41,359
uh it's good to reflect on to contemplate suitability

221
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:46,480
so clear comprehension of what's suitable so it could be that

222
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:54,079
your dedication is to meditate every morning for an hour but maybe you have new kids at home

223
00:48:54,079 --> 00:49:00,880
and uh simply it's not possible to do that and you keep trying to do it and it just becomes frustrating and

224
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:06,880
present resentmaking to do that so this idea of of that the purpose of living a buddhist

225
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:12,319
life means you have to meditate for an hour every day when the circumstance doesn't allow for it easily

226
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:19,359
means it's not suitable to do it that way maybe what's suitable is to engage in the domestic life of

227
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:25,200
caring for kids by bringing in mindfulness to that or bring in

228
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:32,800
generosity care compassion to it to really infuse the activities you have to do

229
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:38,319
with the practice rather than having the practice be something separate

230
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:43,440
or it might be that the way to practice

231
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:51,200
what is suitable for this body and mind some people some of us have physical conditions health issues or something

232
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:57,119
that maybe we have to adjust to how we practice sometimes we have had a difficult life

233
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:02,319
and the difficult emotions that persist from that means that what's suitable to do

234
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:07,839
mindfulness is to do it gently very gently with maybe a lot of

235
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:14,720
self-compassion someone else who has a mind that drifts off into fantasy really easily and spend

236
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:20,240
an ordinary amount of time developing the habit of fantasy they don't need gentleness maybe and

237
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:27,520
compassion maybe they need is a certain definitiveness okay now i'm going to practice and for them maybe practicing

238
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:34,960
definitively every hour you know for an hour every day is really what they need in order to really begin breaking the

239
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:43,280
habit of always being in fantasy so these are simple examples but the idea that to take stock take of our

240
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:50,640
conditions and to begin appreciating what supports me what's a helpful way for me

241
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:55,760
and in this way we become our own teacher and really we need to become our

242
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:01,839
own teacher that's the direction we're going in this practice and having a clear sense of purpose is

243
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:08,400
part of this task and then having this question of what is suitable and what's suitable given the conditions

244
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:15,359
around me if um you know again if a neighbor has need maybe it's not

245
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:21,760
really suitable to practice freedom and compassion and presence by sitting in meditation

246
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:27,920
ignoring the neighbor it probably might do actually be more undermining a practice to hold

247
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:34,240
something at bay like that just so i can take care of my own practice maybe as a practice is supported more by

248
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:39,280
letting go of my practice and caring for the neighbor

249
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:45,839
so what is suitable here what is the question and then uh the next thing is to

250
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:51,599
consider uh where do i get nourished from this where where's the pasture to

251
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:59,280
and the buddha was very clear he always had an answer for this and this maybe is not a little bit surprised for some of you

252
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:06,319
the answer is in the four foundations of mindfulness the answers found in being mindful

253
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:11,440
of our embodied experience being mindful of the feeling tones the

254
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:16,960
feelings of experience being mindful of

255
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:23,839
of the mind states we have the feelings and the attitudes we have and being mindful of the inner mental

256
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:29,680
process that are operating in our relationship to our experience and

257
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:34,800
and what this does is that it brings our attention close in

258
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:41,520
this is where the idea of being grounded and rooted here in our direct experience and realizing here is where we get

259
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:48,960
nourished sometimes we want other people to make us happy other people to provide us with

260
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:55,680
what we need other situations experiences and they certainly can be supportive and

261
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:02,319
helpful and wonderful sometimes but to depend on the external world

262
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:08,640
to depend on certain kind of uh stimuli uh alcohol drugs

263
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:15,280
uh food in order to kind of feel uh spiritually nourished is kind of a dead end

264
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:21,599
and the remarkable thing is that um the very it's not this remarkable thing

265
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:28,240
that if we practice mindfulness to stay close into our experience

266
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:34,400
our mindful experience is generative of a sense of nourishment a sense of

267
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:41,119
well-being that's where we find our centeredness our peace or happiness even

268
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:48,160
and and so the very system that gets nourished is a system that

269
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:53,920
generates the nourishment and this is a remarkable kind of

270
00:53:54,319 --> 00:54:00,480
kind of system where through mindfulness

271
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:07,920
this very psychophysical system that we are part of generates the sense of well-being that

272
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:13,119
nourishes the system itself so it's self-generating in a certain way

273
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:20,559
as opposed to again needing something outside so the clear comprehension of the

274
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:28,559
nourishment of the pasture in the buddhist teaching is to stay close to mindfulness stay grounded here

275
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:33,680
don't lose yourself stay conscious of your lived experience

276
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:39,280
as you go about doing what you're doing so you can stay so then you can one thing you can notice when you get

277
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:45,200
stressed when you get exhausted when you get tired and then you don't just push keep

278
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:50,640
pushing yourself that way but you also uh you can recognize

279
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:56,079
that not only by avoiding stress but by being relaxed with what you do

280
00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:01,680
there's a deeper inner well-being that can come as well

281
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:09,280
and then the clear recognition of non-delusion some people think it's a little hard to recognize delusion and non-delusion

282
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:14,960
but when we stay close to the four foundations of mindfulness when we stay close to our experience in our some

283
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:20,400
degree of calm or subtleness then the mindfulness is strong

284
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:25,680
we can watch the arising of thoughts and most illusions

285
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:30,960
are ideas or thoughts that we that are created by the mind

286
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:37,119
and if we stay close enough to watch thoughts arise watch ideas and projections arise

287
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:44,400
then we can start seeing oh it's not inherent in the situation that i'm that this is how it is this is just the way

288
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:50,240
i'm seeing it it's the way i'm interpreting it and sometimes with that ability we can

289
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:55,599
see it clearly there's a fantasy clearly i'm deluded here i've had the

290
00:55:55,599 --> 00:56:01,599
same idea you know a thousand times and it's never proved to be true

291
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:07,040
and and so maybe i should stop thinking thinking it

292
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:13,119
but to watch thoughts arise and have the mindfulness to see it

293
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:20,400
the mo it's the watching the mindfulness itself which is the non-delusion

294
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:25,440
and to begin appreciating that there is a place of clarity of witnessing

295
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:31,440
that in and of itself sees clearly and in that clarity

296
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:36,720
it's not uh prior to the filters through which we see

297
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:42,839
and that's where non-delusion is and that's a place that's very close to non-clinging

298
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:50,799
non-reactivity so to to learn this place of non-delusion

299
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:58,000
and have that support us and it's very closely related to this idea of that this whole

300
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,599
enterprise begins with of clear recognition clear knowing

301
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:10,799
clear knowing has a lot to do with clarity simplicity not all these layers and veils

302
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:17,920
of ideas and interpretation and to learn this idea to relax and soften and quiet

303
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:23,599
and to see the simplicity of the moment allows us

304
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:29,440
then to have clear comprehension so some of this clear comprehension is

305
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:34,559
very simple these four different categories and some of it

306
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:40,480
comes from a contemplative life a life of being reflective and thoughtful

307
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:46,400
and in buddhist life buddhist spirituality is not just a life of

308
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:53,920
mindful attention to the moment what's going on it's also a life where we spend time

309
00:57:53,920 --> 00:58:00,559
quality time thinking about our life reflecting about our life reflecting about purpose

310
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:06,160
of particular things we do reflecting on the purpose of our life itself

311
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:15,920
why we do you know what what what do we want to dedicate our life to what's most important for us today this week this year this lifetime

312
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:21,520
to spend time staying close and reflective in a calm relaxed contemplative

313
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:27,359
kind of spirit kind of spiritual kind of way to reflect about suitability what's the

314
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:32,400
most useful way to accomplish this purpose given the causes and conditions around

315
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:39,839
me how do i approach this how do i do this so i'm nourished by it

316
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:45,680
when we're nourished by it then we're able also to support other people better

317
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:52,160
we actually have more resources within to live for the benefit and welfare of others if

318
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:59,280
we are nourished and then now to practice non-delusion

319
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:06,079
where is the delusion where is the non-delusion where the projections where are the agendas where the expectations

320
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:12,160
what are the associations i ever bring with me from the past that maybe cloud the water

321
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:20,319
to really kind of look and see what's happening here so a contempt a life of contemplative

322
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:26,559
reflection about and these are four things that are useful to contemplate

323
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:31,760
and one of the things you could do is he you know you can journal about it you can go for walks and think about these

324
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:36,880
things figure out where you can have quality time and for some people this quality

325
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:42,160
reflection can happen in conversation with friends

326
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:47,680
talking about purpose exploring it discussing it

327
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:55,040
and you know suitability and all this and it is a kind of superpower because once you're clear about purpose

328
00:59:55,040 --> 01:00:00,240
and you really have you know this is really what you want to do then

329
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:05,440
you can organize other things organize your life yourself okay this is what i'm going to do i'm going to do it

330
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:10,880
wholeheartedly even if it's just cooking a meal if that's the purpose

331
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:16,559
and you the purpose is to do it you know do it in a suitable supportive way

332
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:23,200
to do it in a way that's nourishing maybe you just want to give yourself over to just cooking when you're cooking

333
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:29,440
and for the purpose that you have or maybe it's for what's really important for how your life energy what

334
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:36,640
you want to do with your life to make it a priority to really know what that is

335
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:43,359
and get behind it is a superpower so much can be done

336
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:49,440
behind a clear sense of purpose so thank you

337
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:55,920
very much and and may you this next week reflect little

338
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:01,799
bit on the value of clear comprehension
