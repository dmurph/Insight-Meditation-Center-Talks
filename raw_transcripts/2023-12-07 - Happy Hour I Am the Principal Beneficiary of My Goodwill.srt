1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,080
great so hello and welcome everyone it's wonderful to be with you this community

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:13,400
that comes together um from around the world cultivating our

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:21,560
hearts in kindness in Goodwill for the sake of ourselves and for the sake of

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:29,599
others as I shared on Monday last week I was leading a uh a residential silent

5
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:37,399
retreat at Spirit Rock and um teaching with my dear friend and teacher Sylvia

6
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:44,960
Borstein and and in her teachings it's so beautiful in her teachings um she

7
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,559
infuses meta kindness just infused with everything she says she does is just

8
00:00:51,559 --> 00:01:00,480
such a beautiful inspiring way that she shows up and and that's who she is how she who she has become and one sentence

9
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,640
that she shared in her teachings um she she repeated that multiple times it

10
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:13,759
really struck me really struck me and that sentence that sentiment is

11
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:21,640
which is so true is I am the principal

12
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:31,479
beneficiary of my own good will of my own kindness I am the principal beneficiary

13
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:38,000
of my own goodwi that struck me it because it is

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,920
true it is so true we often think we're cultivating kindness as we do for other

15
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,960
beings may you be well may you be happy we cultivate compassion for other beings

16
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:57,360
who are suffering and of course um it might seem that we are and we truly are

17
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:06,159
others benefit as well well people in our lives people around us our loved ones our

18
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:12,319
family our friends and people at the grocery store

19
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:18,760
the checkout counter people behind us in the line people who who are driving with us on the highway you know people

20
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:24,959
benefit of course they benefit from our own Goodwill but we benefit the most we

21
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,959
are the principal beneficiary of our own Goodwill

22
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:38,319
because when our mind or hearts are

23
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,360
imbued with kindness with

24
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:51,599
Goodwill they become non-sticky our heart our mind becomes non-sticky we are

25
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:58,760
we are much Freer we have much more freedom we suffer less things become

26
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,280
non-sticky because we have our own Good Will that is turned towards us it's

27
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:11,599
turned towards others we don't keep stewing in resentments towards

28
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:17,480
others which of course who's getting hurt when we're resentful we're the

29
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:23,120
principal person who's becoming hurt when we're resentful or angry or upset

30
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,480
or reactive or or greedy or or you name

31
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,920
it you name a dozen unhelpful UNH wholesome states

32
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:41,400
of mind that hurt us the most heard us the most so as we

33
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:48,319
cultivate Goodwill as we cultivate kindness we are the principal

34
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:56,319
beneficiary of our own Good Will I think that is so profound so I want to

35
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:03,000
spend this this session this this day

36
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,560
um with the profundity of this teaching of this realization as we turn our

37
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:16,799
hearts to kindness so that is the preamble and I think I've said enough to

38
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:24,880
set up the stage so so let's turn let's turn to sit

39
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:36,600
together we need to

40
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:43,440
move so that we're sitting comfortably sitting upright with our back straight

41
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,039
as much as possible or if we're lying down let our backs be

42
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:55,919
upright straight the spine without as much Integrity in our posture as

43
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,560
possible

44
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:27,000
and relaxing this body relaxing this body relaxing

45
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,440
into the chair the cushion offering the weight of the body to the

46
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:43,198
Earth finding refuge in the Simplicity of this

47
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,479
moment

48
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:24,599
with each in breath bringing more ease bringing more breathing in more kindness

49
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:31,400
lightness lightness of heart expansiveness

50
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,319

51
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:50,120

52
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,080
ours this body that's doing its best this

53
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:04,560

54
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
others

55
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:12,520
thoughts arise as they will inevitably do thoughts

56
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:18,639
arise and we find ourselves thinking about the past the

57
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:24,879
future it's okay realize what's happening and don't kick the

58
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:31,240

calming

63
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:55,040
soothing Gathering collecting our hearts and Minds in The Refuge of Goodwill

64
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,680
Refuge of kindness if

65
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:08,519
someone comes up in our heart space mind space wishing them well and

66
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:11,959
returning to the

67
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:21,560
breath and and with each breath wishing this being this body this

68
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,480
being who is me

69
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
well

70
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:41,360
resting this being is doing their best and as Suzuki roshi said you're

71
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:50,839
perfect as you are you are perfect as you are and there is room for

72
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
improvement

73
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:04,759
may I meet this moment fully may I meet this moment as a

74
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
friend

75
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:48,720
now if you like turning this teaching that I am the principal

76
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:55,600
beneficiary of my own good will dropping this in as a reflection

77
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,880
into your body into your heart not your head but into your body and letting it

78
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:08,880
resonate that it is okay for for this being who is me to be

79
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:15,320
the Principal beneficiary it's

80
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:23,880
okay letting it be nourishing letting this teaching be

81
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
inspiring

82
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:48,759
and maybe to let this reflection resonate maybe the meaning or the scope

83
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:54,360
of the concept I will expand I am the

84
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:00,600
principal beneficiary of my own good will

85
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:13,360
you think about it just drop it in see different Impressions Reflections that might

86
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,720
arise hold some Reflections if you start to spin out please let it go just come

87
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,160
back to the breath and sit [Music]

88
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,519
silently

89
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
e

90
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,559
I am the principal beneficiary of my own good

91
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:52,600
will just drop it in your body your heart without thinking about it let it

92
00:18:52,600 --> 00:19:00,320
work through you

93
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,080
I am the principal beneficiary of my own

94
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
Goodwill

95
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:26,279
I am the principal beneficiary of my

96
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
goodwi

97
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:59,760
and as we turn to bring this sit to a close

98
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:07,320
dropping this reflection one last time as if it were the sound of a bell

99
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:14,559
resonating in this body I am the principal beneficiary of my good

100
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:21,480
will let it touch your heart your

101
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:30,200
limbs every cell of your body and could perhaps for a moment the

102
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,130
eye [Music]

103
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:41,360
dissolve the beneficiary of my good

104
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,440
will and I can dissolve perhaps for a

105
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,679
moment

106
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:09,559
perhaps there is no boundary between I you me

107
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,679
them the beneficiary of my good

108
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:26,600
willll the I can be so expensive

109
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,600
impersonal

110
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:44,080
beneficiary of my good will me all beings

111
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:51,760
everywhere including this being who is me benefit from my good

112
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:59,600
will all beings be well may all beings be free

113
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,080
so everyone thank you for your

114
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:23,760
practice so there are so many ways at this teaching I'm the principal beneficiary

115
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,919
of my Goodwill and I decided the own was extra I don't think sovia was saying

116
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:34,640
putting the maybe that was my extra addition um I am the principal

117
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:40,279
beneficiary of my Goodwill there's so many ways that this can show up in our

118
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:45,640
hearts and our minds the more we reflect on it the more dimensions of this

119
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:52,120
teaching can come up so I'd like to invite us to explore this teaching together um in small groups and each

120
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:59,440
person is invited to ex to explore um what is one way that you can you are the

121
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:06,240
principal beneficiary of your Good Will in your life in your daily life in your

122
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:12,320
interaction with others with how you treat yourself um how you treat others

123
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:17,720
uh your mind your body just different ways so the invitation is will be in

124
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:24,720
small groups and the order will be uh it's do alphabetical order first name

125
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:31,200
and and each person the first person will explore well I realize that if I

126
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:37,799
have good will towards myself and if I'm not self- judgmental so much that that

127
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:45,000
that good willll really benefits me it's really a way that I can be in the world with more freedom and more ease so

128
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,480
that's one way this practice this this teaching show up shows up for me then

129
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:56,720
the next person can do an exploration well I realize if I'm really angry at someone and if I have good willll

130
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:02,679
towards them and perhaps see their side of the story yeah my heart lets go I'm

131
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:08,120
I'm less angry I'm less clinging to being right clinging to

132
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:14,840
being the righteous one oh and actually I benefit from my Goodwill to the other person but I benefit more because I

133
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:21,640
suffer or whatever it might be so the next person can say something or it can say past and you just go around and

134
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:27,919
round exploring together um not teaching not edifying but just exploring with one

135
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:34,919
another and trying to go deeper and deeper supporting yourself this is such a rich teaching and it's wonderful to

136
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:40,559
have this Dharma group that's interested in these teachings to unpack these

137
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:45,799
teachings with one another just honoring each other not asking questions not you

138

151
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:20,480
eye out when you took the eye out I felt like when we were saying I am it was

152
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:27,720
yeah I could see that but when we took the eye out it was like Global like all of a sudden there were no barriers we

153
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:34,919
were one and I was really moved by that and I'm still feeling like the reverberation of that um taking the eye

out how how big that is to take that out thank you Nikki thank you so much Mima

156
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:56,200
this invitation um yay I'm just delighted that was my hope that that

157
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:03,880
would be the outcome to because really this teaching about we take things so personally and

158
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:09,960
it is impersonal and yet if we try to get rid of ourself it becomes like a

159
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:15,760
fight but then when the eye just drops away ever so gently right it kind of

160
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:21,519
drops away it's like wow this is expansive there's this Goodwill that can

161
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:27,919
be expansive and beautiful for the benefit of this being and all being so

162
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:35,799
great lovely thank you Mima yeah bill I see your

163
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:42,559
hand hello hi um in the group I had just a a small

164
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:50,440
observation just occurred to me for the first time which is that that the love and Patience are so intertwined and that

165
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:56,559
you that I have to slow down to show concern for others and that the the

166
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:03,799
rushing and being impatient is is part of self-involvement so just a quick thing

167
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:08,880
thank you that's all I wanted to say awesome thank you how how did you say it

168
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,919
bill that impatience and and rushing is part of

169
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:21,159
self- involvement yes uh I mean I think you just yeah I think that's what I said

170
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:28,679
yeah beautiful it's it's brilliant it's so interesting and then we get to I I noticed that if I'm rushing I get tight

171
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:34,000
and just kind of my my vision my sense my body gets tight and my vision gets

172
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,919
smaller and my perspective gets smaller tight tight tight um yeah yeah the self-

173
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:46,399
involve the relationship between the self- involvement the self the eye that we dropped away so

174
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:51,440
gently um and and um kindness benev in

177
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:14,079

178
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:21,200
Sara hi and thank you uh this was a great practice uh and in our group we

179
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:27,720
had this conversation also about the or we talked about the eye the kind of

180
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:34,599
dropping and just opening the heart and letting the other the others in and I

181
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:40,200
was also thinking about this concept of nonself or not self that is very Central

182
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:46,000
in Buddhist teachings and sometimes um I start philosophizing about it so much

183
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,158
the Mind becomes like wow what what is it what does it mean what should I do how how can I achieve that like this is

184
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:58,560
so Grand I can't even think about it and and yet what you said made it so

185
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:05,440
achievable like it can be such a simple thing just like opening your heart and

186
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:13,400
letting the other person in and it just drops and um yeah and and this also came

187
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:21,440
to mind recently I listened to Joseph Goldstein talking to Dan Harris about Nirvana which is a great talk and and he

188
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:28,480
talk about these moments these maybe fleeting moments of experiencing Nirvana where this eye is

189
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,800
dropping and you you can expand and I really like that and just connecting it

190
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:41,040
to what you just said so thank you thank you so much SAR this is lovely yeah many

191
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:48,560
moments of nirvano and the self- involvement with with or um yeah self

192
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:57,319
how should I I want to say it positively because yes we want to take care of this this being who is me care for it be kind

193
00:35:57,319 --> 00:36:04,480
to it dress it feed it you know it's not that we completely drop it away but sometimes we just we're too Ang we're so

194
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:10,359
concerned about how this self is perceived and seen and like it there's a

195
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:15,480
lot of selfing which is not helpful it's

196
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:22,040
it's the selfing is not the same as taking care of oneself one one's being

197
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:28,280
um and and yet it can drop it's not this High hoyy doy IDE it's very practical

198
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:33,720
and here I hear that it it made sense for you yeah that's what they're talking

199
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:40,520
about these Buddhists it's it's easier than I think like yeah just dropping the

200
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:46,920
yeah the self-c concern and just ah relaxing a little bit yeah this eye

201
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:54,680
beautiful thanks s I'm just abolutely delighted yay yeah as Sylvia was saying in this um

202
00:36:54,680 --> 00:37:00,160
in this Retreat the first book that she ever wrote wrote the title was it's easier than you think and she said if

203
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:06,280
she had to do it all over again she would say she would have the title be it's easier than you think and the

204
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:12,200
subtitle would be it's harder than you imagine so so because our

205
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:18,040
imagination makes it kind of hard in a way but anyway so thank you for that and

206
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:24,160
Jerry says being vulnerable is a gift of Good Will and of beneficence and it's

207
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:30,760
not transactional especially when it is truly vulnerable beautiful thank

210
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:49,800
of yourself ourselves as we are the principal beneficiary I am the principal

211

beneficiary and then who is this IE ah

212
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,560
