so yeah again I feel a little bit reluctant to speak I feel quite content

7
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,600
sitting here and quiet inside and what is there to

8
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:00,000
say sometimes silence is more useful than

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and speaking we are doing gratitude this

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,080
week so grateful for all of you grateful to be able to sit here and reflect and feel and sense

11
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:22,680
what's happening in this way and um so to begin our

12
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,119
meditation um gratitude is not just something

13
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:36,520
to think of the mind it's also not just something to feel of the heart it's also something

14
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:42,360
of the body and sometimes we Express

15
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:50,280
gratitude with a sometimes a handshake sometimes a bow sometimes um a

16
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:57,520
smile sometimes offering a gift to someone a small gratitude

17
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,000
gift and it's possible to think think of the meditation posture you're sitting

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,840
in as a posture of gratitude and you might want to take a

19
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,920
little care about how you sit right now and maybe sway back and forth a little

20
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:24,480
bit forward and back just to kind of limber up and and then kind of come back

21
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:31,599
into whatever posture that is your posture to do so with the idea that now

22
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:38,519
this is the posture of gratitude it's a very special thing anybody's meditation posture where

23
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:44,360
they're standing walking sitting lying

24
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,800
down but what it would be like if this posture was the expression of

25
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,519
gratitude a thankfulness and sometimes it doesn't

26
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:02,840
have to be for anything there can just must be a Thank A A

27
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:11,400
gratitude just because it's what dwells up from within or gratitude to be able to

28
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,599
practice it's one of the great things in a human life to have a spiritual

29
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:25,840
practice to have a practice of Liberation so to to this practice

30
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,640
grateful for it it's almost like a reciprocal thing

31
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,959
that we take this posture to practice and we're grateful for the

32
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,040
practice which then helps shape our

33
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:48,040
posture gently closing your

34
00:03:51,040 --> 00:04:01,400
eyes and what if gratitude now in meditation is a quiet shy gentle

35
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:07,040
quality within and H how would you Orient

36
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,040
yourself how would you settle yourself how would you listen to yourself

37
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:19,880
sense so you can be attuned to something that's

38
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,960
quiet deep

39
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:33,120
settled it's already here under the layers of agitation

40
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:42,320
preoccupation difficult feelings you might be having to allow

41
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:49,680
yourself the thinking mind to become quieter so you can

42
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:58,000
attend care for be with yourself

43
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,720
as a as your best friend be with

44
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,560
yourself as a good spiritual friend that will

45
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:21,120
listen to you know attend you as you are listening to

46
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,759
what's deep

47
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,639
within and if breathing is a comfortable place for

48
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:40,360
meditation to breathe with that quiet

49
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:48,919
depth to breathe out of it and return to

50
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,240
it and if there's no quiet depth in

51
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,000
you then be focused more on how you're mindful how

52
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:13,360
you attend to yourself to see if you can be the

53
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,360
quiet

54
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,120
companion who accepts you as you are feels you as you are and gets to know

55
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:30,160
you as you are in whatever way you are

56
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:38,919
and perhaps what you are then is grateful to have such a

57
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:43,960
companion sitting here together in a

58
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:53,160

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:33,600
meditation as you sit here lay here stand

90
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,440
here in your

91
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:49,440
body the whole of who you are includes your

92
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:56,960
body isn't that you have a body so much as you are a body physical

93
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:04,559
body you our body mind heart all

94
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:13,039
together and a huge part of this body that

95
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:17,279
meditating is made of

96
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,960
water made from the waters comes from the Waters of this

97
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:30,320
Earth the rivers streams and lakes and oceans

98
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:37,440
over a lifetime so much of the Waters of the world have passed through

99
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,320
you have had a home in you have been

100
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:51,799
you and to be grateful for Waters grateful for how incredibly important

101
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:58,200
water is for our life our body our being

102
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,200
acknowledging appreciating

103
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:12,200
water as something to be thankful

104
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:25,679
for another big part of this human body is all the mole molecules made of carbon

105
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:32,840
where carbon life and all the carbon that makes us

106
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:38,440
up is a form of solidified

107
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:49,000
air the carbon dioxide in the air is converted into by photosynthesis by

108
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:55,600
plants into some molecules that then become

109
00:26:56,679 --> 00:27:04,520
carbon molecules that holds our body together builds the

110
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,640
body and to be grateful for the air thank

111
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,440
you in a sense the air that we don't

112
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:21,039
see becomes a solidified air that we do

113
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:32,200
see and then together with the carbon molecules were made up of

114
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:38,799
minerals that come from the earth and if you mostly eat local

115
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:45,200
food part of you is comprised of the Earth in your

116
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:54,559
area with International Trade we're made up of the Earth from all over the world

117
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:04,039
thank you to the earth the earth that supports Us in so

118
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:08,320
many ways thank

119
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:15,639
you and then there's the Sun the

120
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:23,279
fire that burns quietly for us far away lighting

121
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,480
the days

122
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:36,159
the light that's converted to boto Senses Into the carbon molecules that

123
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:41,039
are the source of sugars and source of our

124
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:49,559
energy that passes through carbonized molecules to be

125
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:55,519
released as little little sunlights in our body little electricity through our

126
00:28:55,519 --> 00:29:03,279
nerve nervous system thank you son the big one and

127
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:11,679
the Teeny ones of electrons in our body wow thank

128
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:21,919
you and then there's the wonderful wondrous capacity that Evolution has

129
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:27,120
given us slowly steadily all our different capacities

130
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:33,880
for attention for sensing feeling knowing

131
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:45,760
recognizing being aware somehow the dynamic processes of

132
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:53,480
life that brought us this the capacity to be aware to think and to

133
00:29:53,720 --> 00:30:00,600
know thank you all the life processes that brought this into being that we

134
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:08,919
share in this wonderful wondrous way that we are the universe knowing

135
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:12,200
itself thank

136
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:22,480
you and then there's space when we walk through this

137
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:28,880
world it's because there's empty space that we can walk

138
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:40,200
empty space makes possible walking and talking and communicating

139
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:47,360
and doing things moving around moving our fingers and

140
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:55,480
hands in the same way we have to have space within us space in

141
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:03,720
our body and our mind in our hearts for all that moves within

142
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:12,399
us and we offer often fill the space with thoughts and preoccupations and our

143
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:20,320
pre our focus on the emotional life our suffering our pains our

144
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,760
successes but we have a practice that allows us to give space to live in a

145
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:32,240
spaciousness that makes so much possible so much more

146
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:39,679
possible than for hemmed in by our thoughts and thank you

147
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:46,240
space thank you earth

148
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:54,240
water air fire

149
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:02,000
awareness and space always here with

150
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,279
us to be grateful for all that sustains our life

151
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:15,279
Moment by moment so that we're better

152
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:21,200
equipped to be with the difficulties and sufferings of this

153
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:29,000
life may us may we touch into love compassion

154
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:36,840
good will care is a

155
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:43,799
culmination of all that sustains our life may we be

156
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:50,440

[Music]

161
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:30,760
happy thank you for

162
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:29,560
so hello and welcome to this third talk on gratitud

163
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:36,520
ude and I present a little bit about the different aspects dynamics of gratitude

164
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:45,358
which I've called the Ecology of thankfulness gratitude and begins with uh there is

165
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:52,200
the cognitive aspect of appreciating something and acknowledging it and part

166
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:58,720
of what the Buddhist Buddhism that the word for the one of the words for

167
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:04,640
gratitude is um can kind of be more more literally be translated to English is

168
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:11,839
acknowledgement acknowledgement of what has been done for us and then there's the thankfulness

169
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:19,800
which is the feeling that and to allow ourselves to feel and there's a way in which allowing

170
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:25,200
taking in taking a moment taking a minute taking a year taking a lifetime

171
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:31,079
to take in uh uh the experience the feeling of

172
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:38,119
well-being that comes from gratitude comes from thankfulness to open up to it to to be

173
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:43,400
let it register and one of the reasons to do it is not for just

174
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:50,119
to indulge in those feelings but rather it becomes more whole that way the

175
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:56,319
Gratitude and so when we say thank you or we bow uh there's much more

176
00:35:56,319 --> 00:36:02,560
embodiment behind it much more here and so there's more that's offered in

177
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:08,160
return uh if I just kind of keep walking and and wave my hand you know thank you

178
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:14,319
um I mean I don't know if that's going to really going to touch someone else it's not going to you know it's kind of

179
00:36:14,319 --> 00:36:21,880
like incidental and Casual almost like a um you know unimportant you know kind you know just kind of bark out thank you

180
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:29,440
you know thanks but to stop with someone and maybe even hold their hands and say

181
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:35,760
thank you though you have to be careful who you do that with but you know to really stop and bow a little bit even if

182
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:42,839
you don't put your hands together thank you so so to really feel it so it can be

183
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:50,319
embodied and then the part I want to emphasize today is expressing gratitude

184
00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:55,720
if this is a extremely important thing again not only for the person you're

185
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:02,560
saying thank you to but I believe it's important for us that uh this is one of the things I learned from my years of

186
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:09,880
monastic practice that um there's something about deep appreciation deep

187
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:17,200
welling up of gratitude that happened to me uh day after day but all the

188
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:25,119
meditation I did and there was something about the experience the goodness the well-being of meditation that I felt so

189
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:30,680
grateful so appreciative that it felt like it there was something inside of me

190
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:35,920
that needed to express it otherwise it was bottled up it was restricted it

191
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:41,359
didn't really have a life it couldn't be F come to its fullness and so one of the

192
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:47,920
reasons I like to bow at the end of meditation whenever I meditate is that

193
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:53,480
um it gives a life it gives acknowledgement it allows a movement

194
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:59,800
that's happening inside of me to live and uh and have its fulfillment and

195
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:07,200
that's the that's the Deep feeling of appreciation of gratitude and in return I think it also

196
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:14,960
then changes me inculcates or it kind of uh kind of reinforces that side of

197
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:21,359
myself and um and so after my years of monastic practice uh we did a lot of

198
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:27,920
bowing and it didn't always want to bow it wasn't always out of appreciation but after a while it was something about

199
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:33,560
putting my hands together and bowing even when I didn't want to it had an

200
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:39,440
effect on me it was a gratitude posture that kind of little drop by drop

201
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:45,800
actually did do something to me and by the time I left the in at the monastery we always bowed to each other whenever

202
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:51,560
we passed each other and uh when I left the monastery after three years I was

203
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:58,800
walking down the street in in the city of Berkeley nearby and um and I was you

204
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:04,599
know the first day out of the monastery I was passing all these people on the sidewalk and I just wanted to bow to

205
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:11,079
them all but you know they were strangers and I think that would be weird and then luckily I saw across the

206
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:18,119
street down the street someone had had visited the monastery at some point during the summer and I went running

207
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:24,000
after her and said you know I think I kind of said stop stop wait wait and um

208
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:31,599
it was really I just wanted to have someone to bow to and uh who I could express my gratitude for just you know

209
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:39,480
just all these people for the people I was there and give it life so to express it Express gratitude

210
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:45,240
so certainly to do it with a thank you and words um but let the words be

211
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:51,119
embodied not just kind of like casual stop and do it say it with you know in a

212
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:58,599
in a good way and fullness of it there is also um so it's not just the words

213
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:04,400
but it's also the gestures you use so you know and people who don't know about

214
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:11,800
bowing you don't want to do that to you that maybe it's weird for them but you know a little nod a stopping and looking

215
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:17,599
at them there's um uh you know some movement of the hand that's expresses

216
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:24,280
something maybe just sometimes thank you kind of opening your your hands wide

217
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:30,880
um um the old days men would tip their hat hats that Express a little bit more of a gesture of

218
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:36,000
something and um so what's the gesture what's the embodiment of it could be

219
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:43,400
stopping physically and turning towards the person say thank you these are wonderful uh photographs and videos of

220
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:50,359
the Daly Lama uh going over to people who he sees and bowing and holding their

221
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:56,440
hands and just completely with them for those few minutes like they're the most important person I don't know if he's

222
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:04,240
expressing gratitude UD but there's something deep he's because he's really there the has changed so many people

223
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:10,160
just by how he greets people and then

224
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:15,720
um um the um you might want to give

225
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:21,280
something there's something called the Gratitude gift and uh sometimes you know

226
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:27,720
later so I want to thank you for what you did for me and here here's a small gift not not a big gift that makes

227
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:33,119
people obligated to return or but uh you know you know something we bake

228
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:39,359
something and give them here's i b I bake this for you it's please or or you

229
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:45,760
know here some flowers I want to thank you for the favor you did me the support you did or that little expression of

230
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:52,000
gratitude so it's more embodi and fing makes so much more that goes

231
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,079
on and um and then the the other thing I think

232
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:04,800
about is sometimes it's useful to go out of your way to say thank you um uh show

233
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:10,480
up go see someone you know and um and walk up to them and say I just wanted to

234
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:15,839
take the time to say thank you it's clear you're going out of your way you go into their office you walk down the

235
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:21,079
hall and I'm here to just to say thank you thank you or to go uh to a neighbor

236
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:27,280
and just knock on the door and say you know I just want to say thank you for yesterday it was really nice to be be

237
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:33,160
invited over for dinner it was really nice and doesn't have to be a gift it just you know that's that's all I wanted

238
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:38,520
to say and uh so to go out of your way so again so it's something deeper in it

239
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:46,040
it's not just a casual thank you it's like we're investing we're doing something and what I'd like to

240
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:52,720
suggest is that this way of really living in gratitude is a way of um

241
00:42:52,720 --> 00:43:00,160
letting the love or gratitude or the the the uh D Dynamic aspect of Human

242
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:06,319
Relationships in a healthy way to flow the something cycles of giving and

243
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:14,680
receiving gratitude and generosity it just keeps flowing and moving just

244
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:20,880
like all the elements within us the water that we have comes and goes water

245
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:28,119
that in us now probably some water molecules were there of the Buddha of

246
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:34,079
of uh the you know all kinds of wonderful compassionate people in the

247
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:40,800
past wonderful you know so much the it keeps flowing out of us our water in

248
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:47,480
house now will probably be in some other human being or animal or being um in the

249
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:53,319
future thousands millions of years and we want to just keep it flowing keep it

250
00:43:53,319 --> 00:44:00,839
moving keep it going smoothly and so it is with our the Human Relationships the Dynam

251
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:08,599
dynamism of Love of care of friendship keep it flowing and um and uh one of the

252
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:14,559
ways to do that is uh to Express gratitude and sometimes when we neglect

253
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:20,079
to do that something stops it you know stops with us and maybe it never

254
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:29,720
continues again and um so keep it going pass it on through how you say Thank

255
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:35,319
you so for all of you thank you very much for

256
00:44:35,319 --> 00:44:40,880
today and I'll be here tomorrow in United States it's a

257
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:49,680
holiday and Friday and we'll do continue this topic of gratitude thank you
