1
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,640
so warm hello

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,199
and welcome

3
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:23,359
and this idea of welcoming applies to our meditation practice as

4
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,560
well in that when we sit and meditate we're

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:36,960
also welcoming meditation we're welcoming something to

6
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:44,160
arise or to settle or unfold or to let go we're welcoming

7
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,520
the process and what this implies the idea of

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,480
welcoming is the idea that

9
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:03,600
we are responsible to open the door we're responsible for

10
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,200
welcoming and then if what is standing in front of

11
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:17,040
the door what's standing there what wants to come in wants to arise and occur

12
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:24,479
is wholesome and beneficial then we welcome it we allow it to arise

13
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:34,079
if it's not wholesome if it's not beneficial then we you know say no thank you

14
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:41,520
no need to get involved no need to pick it up no need to make room for it

15
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,479
but to allow something to happen and so the meditation has this wonderful dynamic between what

16
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,079
we offer in terms of ourselves and what we do

17
00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:00,079
and what we welcome what we allow to arise to occur to

18
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:05,520
unfold and how much that what the balance is between these two

19
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,760
is variable but that's part of the art of meditation is finding the right

20
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:19,760
balance sometimes clearly we have to engage purposefully intentionally and

21
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:26,239
apply ourselves maybe to the breathing or apply ourselves to letting go of thoughts or something

22
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,239
because to not do so maybe means to just continue

23
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:40,239
drifting off in thought or drifting off into ways of thinking and being which are not useful

24
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,280
but if we're only the one who does and is applying ourselves and think

25
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,760
we're responsible it's up to us to make more effort then there's no space in room for

26
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:00,720
the welcome for to allow something to appear to arise to come

27
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:09,040
and so this play of welcoming and allowing the welcome is what we do we prepare

28
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:16,720
ourselves so that we're there to receive or to allow and so this can

29
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:24,879
play itself out with our breathing in a sense one half of the

30
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:32,959
breathing cycle can be clearing the deck

31
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:40,720
or opening up or opening the door so the other half of the cycle of breathing can be allowing that cycle

32
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,720
part to just unfold maybe it's different for different people which they prefer i

33
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,760
prefer that the um that the the the allowing the clearing the decks

34
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,959
the emptying out is with um that's what i kind of do

35
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:07,200
on the exhale the releasing and then the inhale there's the allowing

36
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:13,439
the inhale to happen there's allowing for meditation to unfold it's allowing it's

37
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:19,759
getting out of the way and then seeing what wants to come and this kind of the cycle of letting go

38
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,520
and allowing letting go and receiving

39
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:34,240
welcome and letting go and then welcoming it could be the other way

40
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:41,840
some people might prefer the other way to welcome what happens as we let go and

41
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:49,039
to clear things away open up open the doors as we inhale

42
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,800
and this can be done gently mildly just a very light touch

43
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:02,639
riding on the inhale and exhale um and in the way i was talking about it

44
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:11,039
to let go of thoughts let go release relax on the exhale and to welcome on

45
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:17,919
the inhale and then as meditation deepens it gets stiller and quieter and more settled

46
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:26,320
then um each of these movements of um opening and then welcoming

47
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:34,159
becomes softer and stiller and quieter until neither is happening

48
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,639
it's just we're just there with experience maybe a little bit closer to welcoming

49
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:46,400
but even welcoming at some point is not no longer needed

50
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:54,240
so assuming a meditation posture

51
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:03,360
and in taking a a good meditation posture

52
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:11,120
you can also think of it as a posture in which you're ready to welcome

53
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:20,400
and you don't want to welcome a guest by slouching or

54
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,520
receding or making yourself small

55
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:32,638
you have more you have more of a welcome if you are a little bit

56
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:41,120
upright or big or fully present so a posture of

57
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:48,160
fullness full presence but a posture that's there to welcome

58
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,120
our experience

59
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:03,840
and gently closing the eyes

60
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:17,840
and welcome a deep inhale

61
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,199
and release a long exhale

62
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,800
like you're welcoming the air to come into your lungs you're welcoming the whole body to

63
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,360
expand

64
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,759
and then you're releasing it all setting it free

65
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,680
so you're ready to welcome again

66
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,719
then letting go and then letting your breath return to normal

67
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:13,680
and to relax different parts of your body holdings and your muscles

68
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,720
perhaps so that your whole body becomes more receptive and ready to welcome

69
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:26,479
to allow in some ways tension in the muscles is a

70
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,599
kind of resistance holding back or closing down

71
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:38,560
the simple ways in which we can relax beginning of meditation

72
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:55,839
are ways to make ourselves more receptive more sensitive

73
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:19,120
and then to settle into the body's experience of

74
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,839
breathing

75
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:38,640
perhaps a gentle with a light touch gentle letting go releasing as you

76
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,200
exhale

77
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,399
maybe so ever so slightly there's a fuller release at the end of

78
00:09:52,399 --> 00:10:05,839
the exhale

79
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:33,839
and then welcoming the inhale

80
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:42,480
i'm wide welcome it is not just the welcoming the inhale

81
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:49,519
but is opening ourselves to allow it all to be here

82
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,640
without involvement without getting caught in

83
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,839
where there's space for all things

84
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,839
so

85
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,839
so

86
00:16:54,399 --> 00:17:00,720
when you get involved in thinking there's very little receptivity there to

87
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:08,240
our inner direct experience the welcome is gone

88
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:19,760
when you notice you've drifted off in thought return to the welcome the receptivity

89
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:28,880
of your experience here in your body a quiet receptivity

90
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,840
a silent welcome

91
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:47,840
welcoming as you inhale letting go as you exhale

92
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,840
so

93
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,919
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

94
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:05,278
to step forward into the world with clarity

95
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:14,240
with presence with a certainty certainty of really

96
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:22,720
being here and then with that clarity and certainty

97
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,000
being welcoming for others

98
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:37,679
allowing people to be how they are and to listen and notice and see

99
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:44,240
and respect people for how they are

100
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,000
as long as they're not hurting us

101
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,278
can we give them the gift of being respected

102
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:02,559
meaning to see them again to take a second look and really be

103
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:09,919
present so that we welcome others into

104
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:18,799
us empty space of goodness of heartfeltness of openness

105
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:24,398
where they can be more fully themselves and be known for who they are

106
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:29,679
and just as as we know ourselves

107
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:36,880
the dharma begins to move through us we begin to grow and mature and unfold

108
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:43,840
so when we help other people to be known

109
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,640
they give the experience to others that they are really known

110
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:57,919
something is welcome something shifts something relaxes something can open in others

111
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:04,000
may it be that what we learn in meditation practice

112
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,480
can be useful we meet others and relate to other

113
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,278
people and even when we read about them in the news

114
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:28,080
may that which is a profound knowing in receptivity and openness

115
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:35,520
be how we meet others in our dedication to live a life

116
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:42,480
that supports the welfare and happiness of all beings

117
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:54,159
may we contribute to the happiness the safety the peace

118
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,760
and the freedom of others

119
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:05,840
may all beings be happy

120
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:17,010
[Music]

121
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:35,840
so so today i'll continue to

122
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:43,679
recount some of the stories that occur in the suttas the ancient discourses texts that

123
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:49,360
contain the teachings of the buddha and one of the reasons for these stories

124
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:54,799
is that the stories often contextualize the teachings

125
00:31:54,799 --> 00:32:05,120
or the stories highlight what's important about the teachings and or illustrate them in some way

126
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:12,880
and so today's story comes from the second discourse in the anthology called the long

127
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:19,200
discourses of the buddha and it's called long because these discourses these texts

128
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,000
are relatively long compared to

129
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:32,320
compared to many others in other anthologies and so the second one and uh

130
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:39,600
it's uh generally called in english something like the fruits of the renunciant life or the ref

131
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:47,760
uh the fruits of the of the reclusive life further

132
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:54,399
and it's a samanya pala means fruit samanya means

133
00:32:54,399 --> 00:33:02,799
someone who's a recluse or a contemplative or renunciant

134
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:09,120
maybe it's a little bit like in the old days in english we would talk about someone who's a religious

135
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:14,559
and a religious person a religious generally meant someone who's kind of dedicated themselves to a life of the

136
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:19,600
religious life and so this is a someone in ancient india who dedicated themselves to a

137
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:27,840
lifestyle of full-time dedication to to the religious life for the times

138
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:34,960
and um so it involves a in this particular discourse i think of it as being like an opera

139
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:42,240
a predict and it's and some of it is this huge pathos this uh a display of you know that involves a

140
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:48,240
kind of a operatic kind of suffering that kind of is a context for the teachings

141
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:54,240
and um and uh so maybe i don't know if i can uh describe the

142
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:00,320
scene to be kind of but it's grand like an opera but it begins

143
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:07,679
with the greatest king of india at the time of the buddha a king by the name ajata sattu

144
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:13,679
and the king was it was a full moon night beautiful full moon night with a clear sky

145
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:19,599
and the king was on the high terrace on his palace looking out across the scene above the

146
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:26,000
treetops the full moon and the beautiful light and clarity and he's there with uh

147
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,158
his ministers and and he's uh exclaiming how beautiful how

148
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:37,280
wonderful the night is the full moon it's wonderful to see

149
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:44,480
and then he asks his ministers um because who can i go visit what what

150
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:50,638
what what spiritual teacher can i go visit the spiritual teachers often gathered on the full moon with their

151
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:56,480
disciples so it was kind of a time to remember the spiritual life perhaps

152
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:02,640
and so he said who could i go visit who might bring peace

153
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:10,240
to my distressed heart and the reason the king's heart is

154
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:15,520
distressed and we get a sense that comes up at the end of this discourse we understand why

155
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:22,480
is that he became king by killing his own father and this was troubling him and so he

156
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,920
wanted to go find someone who could kind of settle or calm his troubled heart

157
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:34,720
and so the ministers uh six ministers each of them uh uh suggested that he go see

158
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:40,079
a particular religious teacher of the time and each of them the king said no no i

159
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:47,280
visited before and what the person said didn't help and but this uh a seventh minister i

160
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:54,000
didn't say anything just was silent and then the king at some point turned to that seventh minister

161
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,079
jivaka i think he was the king's minister but maybe the king's doctor

162
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:05,920
and said jivaka you're not saying anything do you have a suggestion of who i might visit

163
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:14,400
and jiveka says well in fact there is a religious teacher who's in town nearby in the woods who

164
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:21,440
is has a really good report is said to be not only a wonderful

165
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,480
teacher for other people but a wonderful teacher for the gods and the word of

166
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:32,640
god in ancient india also meant king so it's a either it was so wonderful it is good

167
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:39,359
for the gods but also so wonderful he's good for the kings and he you know and

168
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:45,520
was the king and hearing this wonderful report about the buddha i guess he had never seen the buddha

169
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:53,359
said let's go and and so they assemble a grand pageant

170
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:59,839
he resembled eight um 500 elephants maybe it's a little bit like

171
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:05,599
the bradley tanks of modern world the these ancient you know the king would have all these

172
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:12,640
war elephants maybe but 500 of them were assembled for this going into the woods to see the buddha

173
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:21,119
and on each of the each of the these 500 was the king and his 500

174
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:27,599
wives and this represents maybe the uh the setting up a

175
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:34,560
contrast between the largeness the power the wealth of this great king

176
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:40,079
and then his great involvement with sensual pleasures which later you can see that's one of his

177
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:45,680
primary occupations and they march uh into the into the

178
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:54,079
forest to go see the buddha in the full moon night and as they get into the dark forest the

179
00:37:54,079 --> 00:38:00,720
the king gets really frightened and his hair stands up on end and he says to jiva ka jivaka

180
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:06,160
uh are you you're taking us into the forest so my enemies can ambush me is

181
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:11,839
this a trick and jiveka reassures him no no no it's not a trick but

182
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:18,960
but it's so quiet here and you told me there were 1250 monks with the buddha and i don't hear a

183
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:25,280
peep from any of them ah that's because these buddhist monks are really well behaved and quiet

184
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:31,280
they're sitting listening to the buddha so ajata sato gets off his elephant and does the final

185
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:37,520
distance to where the buddha is sitting by foot but he says ajivaka jibaka where is the

186
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:42,720
buddha i don't see him anywhere and suggesting that the jubika

187
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:49,280
is in the assembly with the other monks but he doesn't recognize the buddha but then jiveka says the buddha is up

188
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:55,280
against that central pillar facing all the monks so the king goes up

189
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:00,720
to the buddha and offers his greetings and then

190
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:08,240
the buddha kind of picks up something and he says i mean are you thinking of the people

191
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:14,240
you love and the king says yes i'm thinking about my young son

192
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:19,520
i wish he could be this calm and settled as these monks 1250 monks are sitting here so

193
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:25,520
peacefully and quiet listening to you i wish my son could be this calm and quiet

194
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:30,560
and that's all he says about his son but the audience who's watching this opera or listening to the

195
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,320
story know they know that the the king killed his own father to become

196
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:41,680
king and they probably because this was told story was told for centuries

197
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:47,240
after the buddha died that the audience knows that

198
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:53,200
ajayatosatu's son later then killed ajata satu to become king so this

199
00:39:53,200 --> 00:40:00,400
petricide continued so there's there's this pathos that's kind of in the air around the suta

200
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,760
and then um sato asks the buddha

201
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:12,319
what is the fruit of the renunciate life what's the benefit of becoming a monastic and practicing the religious

202
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:18,640
life and the buddha says have you asked anyone else that and he says yes i asked the six other

203
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:24,640
spiritual teachers but i wasn't satisfied with their answers and the buddha said well tell me and one

204
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:29,680
of them teaching was there is no such thing as evil

205
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:34,880
or badness or demerit and you can just do whatever you want

206
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,920
and you won't do any evil someone else said that that doesn't

207
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:46,480
exist really people don't exist they're empty they don't really exist and if you chop someone's head off it doesn't really um you're not

208
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:52,240
killing anyone because people don't exist someone else said that the amount of

209
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:57,599
suffering and pain that you have enjoy you have is allocated when you're first born and you

210
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:04,160
just have to kind of just play it all out and it's all predetermined and so nothing you can do makes any difference

211
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:10,800
someone else said that um they didn't know anything they didn't know they simply didn't know if there was any

212
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:16,720
benefit or fruit of the practice and and um and so had no answer to give

213
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:22,640
and someone else they went on these teachings and all the teachings you can kind of feel as these teachings

214
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:28,800
are recounted that for someone who killed their own father none of them really settled the heart none of them really

215
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:34,000
touched him or worked for him so he came to the buddha and he asked the buddha then

216
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,760
the same question so then the buddha said it it answered indirectly by asking a

217
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:50,480
question of the king the buddha often did that rather than answering directly he said dear king if you have a slave

218
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:57,200
uh so here's the most powerful person in the world at the time and i'm talking and then buddhist talking about one of the most

219
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:03,599
at least power a slave and your slave decides that there's another way of living and wants to do good in the world

220
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:09,040
once it wants to acquire merit and not just kind of do this grudge

221
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:15,599
grunge work for the king on and on for the whole life and so their slave goes off to become a monastic ordains

222
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:21,680
becomes renunciant lives a holy life what would you do would you insist on the slave coming

223
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:26,880
back and being a slave and the king said no no if they were really living a

224
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:33,119
redundancies life and a good life then i would honor that person and i would bring them gifts and food and

225
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:40,000
robes and support them and the buddha said well is this one of the fruits of the holy life of the

226
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,359
prevented life the king said oh yes this would be one of the fruits if you live that life

227
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:52,319
freed from slavery and then the king said well tell me something more and the king

228
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:59,760
and the buddha said well if someone was one of your workers like a minister or something and they

229
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:06,480
left your your employment to become a monastic what would you do then oh i would honor them and give them

230
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:12,880
gifts and support them and protect them this too is a fruit of the redundancy of life

231
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:18,160
and then sato said well tell me is there any other fruits of the holy life

232
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:24,720
so the third time the king asks the buddha then gives some of his own teachings and there's an ancient

233
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:34,318
tradition that you don't really teach someone until they ask three times so then um sato says well

234
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:41,200
as a person hears the teachings from the buddha or some person like that and becomes a monastic

235
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:48,400
renunciant and then they engage in the spiritual life and as they engage in the spiritual life

236
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:54,960
the buddha describes how all the what's called the gradual path of practice the practice of morality

237
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:00,240
of cultivation of concentration to all the way to awakening and there's

238
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:06,560
all these steps that are described but many of the steps result in

239
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:13,839
in happiness and bliss and gladness and joy and so the whole practice once we

240
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:21,359
get into the world of practice of living an ethical life there's a bliss of blamelessness

241
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:27,440
there's contentment as we practice meditation and the hindrances abate there's

242
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:32,640
gladness that we're no longer enslaved by these powerful mind states

243
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:38,240
and as we enter into the jhanas there's all this deep joy and happiness and tranquility of the jaundice that comes

244
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:45,040
along so the buddha is describing this wonderful gradual path where there's all this benefit this fruit and joy and

245
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:52,560
happiness and well-being that comes along all the way up to awakening

246
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:57,599
and when uh and when they when the king hears all this he says wow

247
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:04,480
yes this is the fruit of the homeless life i'm so inspired from now on i go for refuge the buddha

248
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:10,880
let the buddha be my teacher and the buddhist kind of nods and ascent and then ajah tattoo is great teaching

249
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:17,359
and so inspired he says something well i have a lot to do the king has a lot of work to do and

250
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:23,440
a lot of sensual pleasures to attend to so i had to go back to my job

251
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:30,160
and uh something like that then and uh and so the king says oh do as you wish and

252
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:35,760
um and then the king goes off and the buddha's left and he tells his

253
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:42,240
other his monks who were there and monks and nuns that that that

254
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:50,000
well if the king had not killed his father in hearing this discourse

255
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,760
he would have attained the first stage of awakening this dharma eye would have opened

256
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:02,640
but with this heavy you know harm that he caused the fruit of that

257
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:07,839
the consequence of that is that he didn't say this literally but kind of my interpretation of it

258
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:16,240
the consequence of that is that his heart is closed to the liberative effect of these teachings

259
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:23,119
and so that's a fruit of of causing harm in this world that your

260
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:29,920
heart's heart is much more closed is it permanently closed or not

261
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:36,079
we don't know my teacher in burma gave lots of stories to me of people he'd known who

262
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:42,640
not that he killed their parents but soldiers who had killed people and the struggles they had to open up their

263
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:48,560
heart but they always succeeded to do it to the teachings and to be changed

264
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:54,960
so this contrast between the king

265
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:00,960
and the consequence of his actions and the choice of a monastic and the

266
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:06,640
consequence of their actions their practice and what arises

267
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:13,920
what's welcomed what's received the fruit that comes from the spiritual life is

268
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:21,599
the theme of this operatic sutta so

269
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:34,000
so that's the story for today and we'll continue tomorrow thank you
