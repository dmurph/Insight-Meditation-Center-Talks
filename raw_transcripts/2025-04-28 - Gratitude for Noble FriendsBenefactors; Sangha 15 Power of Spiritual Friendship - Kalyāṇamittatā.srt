68
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:53,320
way to brighten our heart and mind to drop in this reflection into our

69
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:59,360
heart into our belly our abdomen as if dropping a pebble in a

70
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:05,600
pond in a body of water into our heads this is not a heady reflection but drop

71
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,199
it in see what happens not to think about this

72
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:17,680
reflection but drop it in let yourself be silent let it

73
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,000
resonate and the reflection is

74
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,760
this bringing to heart a

75
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:38,240
friend or a benefactor who has been there for you at

76
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,120

dropping this reflection into your heart and listening for what

85
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:45,360
arises just sitting with what arises not making stories not thinking but just

86
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,880

87
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:57,720

88
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,279
let the goodness of this being this

89
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:12,800

goodness of this being as if you're spreading this gladness of the heart

95
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:02,160

98
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,400
And if your heart has a tendency to go towards

143
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:42,840
mentioned I'm in Tuscanyany now i'm in Italy it's in the

144
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:49,200
afternoon and had some challenges with internet earlier and hopefully it's

145
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:56,398
smooth now you haven't lost me i haven't lost you yay so much gratitude this is

146
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:03,679
good so so for today's theme I'd like to um

147
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:10,799
I'd like to speak a bit i'd like to expand on the power of spiritual

148
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:15,398
friendship kalyana mita

149
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:23,039
so in in the Buddha's dispensation and

150
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:32,320
the sassana the cultivation of virtue and wisdom is inseparable from nurturing

151
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:40,720
of wise companionship and spiritual friendship

152
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:47,679
is not merely support but it's the entire holy life it's the entirety of

153
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:59,240
this path it's the entirety of this path and as this beautiful story goes

154
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:04,519
um Ananda who was the Buddha's attendant and

155
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:10,480
cousin uh one day he approaches the Buddha and remarks "Admirable friendship

156
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:17,320
is half of the holy life." And the Buddha corrects them and says "Not so Ananda not

157
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:25,040
so." This is the entire holy life when a practitioner has admirable

158
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:30,638
friends companions and comrades it is to be expected that they

159
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:36,240
will develop and cultivate the noble eight-fold

160
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:42,919
path and it makes sense right it it's not it's so beautiful i love the way

161
00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:48,398
Ananda comes and says "Oh it's half of it right it's 50 person." It's like "No no no it's the entire thing it's

162
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:56,560
spiritual friendship it's good friendship it's it's wholesomeness of whom we associate with." And modern

163
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,800
research psychological research aligns with this and

164
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:10,720
um the there's a long longitudinal longitudinal study uh that shows that

165
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:20,359
social connection is the most powerful um predictor of of mental health of even

166
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:26,119
mortality much more than success and fame

167
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:34,560
and various other aspects so um so there's there's a wholesomeness to

168
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:41,760
to connection to good connection and right companionship isn't

169
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:49,040
just helpful it is vital for our life even for survival for us to live um and

170
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:55,000
and the study by the way also talks about mortality that that those with without

171
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:01,440
um lack of of uh connections social connections also

172
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,560
it's it's a um it correlates with with

173
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:12,480
shorter lifespan not as not as much health etc and it makes sense we know

174
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,520
this we we don't need research to tell us this but yet it's so interesting for

175
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:24,240
me also how the teachings um of the Buddha about how important connection is

176
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,520
how important is you know because in practice we we we go towards meditation

177
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:37,160
silent meditation oh yes silent meditation yeah yeah that's of course silent meditation is so important in the

178
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:43,599
context of connection spiritual friendships they are not just 50% of the

179
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:48,160
path they're 100% of the path

180
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:56,960
wow so kalana mita uh kalana the word kalana means

181
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:03,680
beautiful virtuous and mitata means friendship so kalana mita beautiful

182
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:10,640
virtuous friendship it in it it's um this this beautiful

183
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:16,800
term that you might have heard uh in in the teachings it's an elevated bond

184
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:25,440
that's that's not just friendship of oh let's go for a walk though walks are nice but

185
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,480
it it really it's elevated this kind of friendship is elevated to foster ethical

186
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:36,720
and spiritual growth and and again in in studies show

187
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:43,359
that there is emotional co-regulation that that we unconsciously

188
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:50,520
regulate um our emotional state through trusted relationships there is mutual

189
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:56,400
attunement that calms our nervous system and strengthens our resilience so this

190
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:04,480
attunement that uh that this emotion deep emotional attunement is part of the

191
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:13,680
gift of kalana mita of this rich beautiful virtuous friendship

192
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:21,680
friendships and so so in Buddhist terms one can say

193
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:29,200
that spiritual friends buffer us from afflicted emotions and steady our minds

194
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:36,640
on the path isn't that beautiful to consider that there are many benefits

195
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:42,880
that spiritual friendships offer we'll talk more about it this week and of

196
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,920
course our role in it too we'll talk about that too to consider that it's a

197
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:55,359
buffer from afflictive emotions that that good friends good virtuous ethical

198
00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:02,320
friends support us bring us back bring us back they inspire us they they they

199
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:08,559
support us through modeling through their presence through their own

200
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:16,160
goodness and and there is this what's called the soil principle we grow in

201
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:22,160
accordance to our environment we grow we're like these seeds that we grow in

202
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:28,079
accordance to our environment just as a plant needs fertile soil and good

203
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:34,800
conditions to flourish a practitioner also needs an environment of virtue

204
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:44,720
wisdom and kindness in Majima Manikaya 95 in the Changi Suta

205
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:50,599
it highlights the importance of proximity to the

206
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:56,800
wise so the Buddha says when one approaches associates with and attends

207
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:02,040
upon the wise one gains faith or

208
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:09,520
trust energy mindfulness concentration and wisdom isn't that beautiful

209
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:16,079
i'll read it again when one approaches associates with and attends upon the

210
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:21,880
wise one gains trust energy mindfulness

211
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:26,200
concentration and wisdom

212
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:34,960
and similarly modern research supports that social contagion research on social

213
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:41,760
contagion reveals that our attitudes our behaviors and emotional states spread

214
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:48,480
through the network even unconsciously wow right so much

215
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:54,720
responsibility so again social contagion and this study

216
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:01,680
is by Fowler and Triakis in 2008 the title of it is dynamic spread of

217
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:08,079
happiness in a large social network it's a longitudinal study over 20 years but

218
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:13,119
then they found that happiness and unhappiness spreads through social

219
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:19,599
groups up to three degrees of separation and if they they could only test up to

220
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:27,119
three degrees of separation so your friends your friends friends so if you became happier if your you became uh if

221
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:32,960
your happiness level your your emotional state shifted not just your friends but

222
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:39,599
your friends and their friends three degrees out there was impact so there's

223
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:45,920
emotional contagion three levels out and if they could have measured further out

224
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,440
they I bet I'm willing to bet they would have seen they would have seen um

225
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,800
influence on the social contagion which is why you know when we at the end of

226
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:02,160
the practice when we dedicate the merit to the well-being of all beings

227
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:08,240
everywhere in ways we cannot fathom in ways we cannot imagine it's not just

228
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:14,480
those three levels out but it's the contagion many many layers out when we are

229
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:20,760
cultivating [Music] kindness [Music]

230
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,800
peacefulness care stability [Music]

231
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:32,799
equinimity wisdom it it ripples it ripples through the

232
00:42:34,359 --> 00:42:43,560
network and the the um see how much time do I

233
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:50,400
have maybe I'll share this as well and then the Buddha offers this this

234
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:57,640
metaphor of milk and water the image of blending harmoniously

235
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:05,839
in in uh Angutar Nikaya 854 the Buddha praises two monks and says just as milk

236
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:11,800
and water when poured together blend insepar

237
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:18,480
inseparably so too they dwell blending like milk and water regarding each other

238
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:26,200
with kindly eyes i love that regarding each other with kindly

239
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:31,599
eyes regarding each other with kindly eyes so there are other other places in

240
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:37,599
the sutras when the simile is not mixing like uh water and oil but this is milk

241
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:44,240
and water and they they mix um beautifully

242
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:50,760
so and and also again in in psychological

243
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:57,599
um research there is studies that there's interpersonal synchrony such as

244
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:04,480
shared joy shared laughter coordinated movements emotional resonance that that

245
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:09,920
foster profound feelings of unity and trust profound feelings of unity and

246
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:15,519
trust so like milk and water as the Buddha talks

247
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:22,640
about so just as milk and water blend seamlessly harmonious sa life can arise

248
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:29,760
when hearts and action move in resonance and we see ourselves and each other with kindly eyes and there's a lot more to

249
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,960
say about this which I'd like to unpack over the next few days there's a lot

250
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:40,319
more to say about this so I want to leave us with a few reflective questions

251
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:45,960
given that we have about a minute

252
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:51,920
so who has been milk to your water blending seamlessly with kindness

253
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:58,720
offering stability and protection i invited us to to bring an image of our

254
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:05,520
uh benefactor uh or good friend and allow their presence to really uh their

255
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:11,920
their goodness to bring gratitude to bring uh the light to our hearts and I

256
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:19,359
was enjoying this meditation so much myself i so needed it it's just so lovely to sit in that brightness of

257
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:27,440
goodness of another being's kindness and generosity here's another couple of reflections how

258
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:33,920
has the association with virtue v virtuous friends kalana mita open the

259
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:40,640
path of dharma for me how has association with virtuous friends opened

260
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:46,560
the path of dharma for me and here's the last one the bells are

261

262
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:03,599

263
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:10,520
the qualities of kalana mita to others today in what ways can I offer the

264
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:18,640
