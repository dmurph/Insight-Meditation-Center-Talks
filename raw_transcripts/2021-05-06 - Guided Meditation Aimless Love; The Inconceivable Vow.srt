wherever you are i'm at green gulch farm in marin county california so i want to

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:20,880
welcome you however to the insight meditation center uh where i am a guest of your teacher gil

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:28,800
fransdale my good dharma friend um i'm foo schrader and uh gil and myself and another good

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,719
friend paul haller have been enjoying three weeks of an intensive called the harmony of zen

6
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,000
and vipassana and so there is

7
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:47,440
so during this first half hour i'm going to offer a brief meditation instruction for about 20 minutes just silent sitting

8
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,480
which is a kind of hallmark of soto-zen and then i'm going to talk a bit about

9
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,000
the buddha's teaching of right conduct which is the primary focus of our conversation during this

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,158
week the first week of our intensive gil and paul and i discussed meditation jana

11
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,280
parmita and last week the buddhist wisdom teachings

12
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:17,200
and tomorrow the last day of our intensive we are going to talk a little more about the inconceivable vow to save all

13
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:24,000
beings from suffering so the paramitas in the mahayana

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,280
tradition are seen as the basis for training for those who seek to realize the full

15
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,439
complete perfect enlightenment of a buddha some anutara samyak sambhodi

16
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:42,000
anutara samyak so when you all feel ready please settle yourselves into a

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,240
comfortable seated position while i give a few reminders about how to best care for your body

18
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,320
as you do so so begin by bringing your attention to your ankles and your

19
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,960
knees your thighs and your hips in order to create a stable base to support

20
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,719
your upper body as you begin to settle into a

21
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:12,480
comfortable position explore whatever might be blocking you from a restful

22
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,239
and yet energetic upright posture and if you're able then let whatever it

23
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:25,120
is go sitting practice is the mainstay of both

24
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,440
zen and papasana traditions when we sit we are making the same shape with our bodies that the young prince

25
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,480
made with his the shoulders are relaxed the spine is elongated

26
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,599
upward toward the top of the head the back of the head is in alignment with the base of the

27
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,640
spine in the zen tradition we keep our eyes

28
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:54,720
open with our gaze downward allowing the breath to flow naturally from deep in our belly

29
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,920
out through the nose and then back in again

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,480
it helps to begin with a couple of very deep breaths through the mouth you know taking in as much air as you

31
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,760
can kind of exaggerating the inhalation filling your chest and your abdomen

32
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:20,080
like a billows and then exhaling again with some energy letting all that

33
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,879
air go and do that a couple of times and then after that you know just go back to breathing naturally

34
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:33,840
through your nose

35
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,879
so one simple instruction it's quite basic and and i think common to all buddhist traditions is

36
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,000
the practice of counting your breathing from one to ten so if you choose to do

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,040
so you're welcome to try um i usually begin counting from

38
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:58,080
the in impulse to inhale which is i find in my abdomen so that kind of mysterious impulse to

39
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,680
take a breath on the inhalation is a one

40
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:12,560
exhaling and then inhaling again the two exhaling

41
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,799
and so on to ten if you can it's not so easy actually as

42
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:25,199
it turns out we often you know go off course from counting and find ourselves in the past or in our

43
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:33,199
plans for tomorrow so when you do when you see that which is already inside then come back to your breathing

44
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,840
back to one

45
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,880
so when we take this posture like the buddha to be we're opening ours

46
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:54,080
we are opening ourselves to the silence and the stillness that is at the core of our human life

47
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:02,720
to a world of deep connection and mutual support the earth upholding our weight the sky

48
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,880
upholding our breath and the land and the water upholding the animals and the plants

49
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,360
that we depend on to survive

50
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,960
as we enter ever more deeply into the roots of that connection the living roots of an unbroken line

51
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:28,880
through time and space we find ourselves right here

52
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:35,840
where this exact moment this exact breath becomes this exact wish to let go

53
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:44,240
completely of every loss every pain and everything other than this

54
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,919
just this this is a gift that has been given to

55
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:57,120
you to me to each of us alone we didn't earn it we can't pay for it

56
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:06,479
and we can't make it ourselves it's given to us and all we need to do is say thank you

57
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:12,160
so here's a poem for this occasion by billy collins from a book called the poetry of

58
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:21,840
impermanence mindfulness and joy this poem is called aimless love

59
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,639
this morning i walked along the lakeshore i fell in love with a rem

60
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:35,440
and later in the day with a mouse that the cat had dropped under the dining room table in the shadows of an autumn

61
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,800
evening i fell for a seamstress still at her machine in the tailor's window

62
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:47,199
and later for a bowl of broth street steam rising like the smoke from a naval battle

63
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:53,759
this is the best kind of love i thought without recompense without gifts or unkind words without

64
00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:00,240
suspicion or silence on the telephone the love of the chestnut the jazz cap

65
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,560
and one hand on the wheel no lust no slam of the door the love of a

66
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,680
miniature orange tree the clean white shirt the hot evening showers

67
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:18,080
the highway that cuts across florida no waiting no huffiness or rancor just a

68
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:24,800
twinge every now and then for the ren who had built her nest on a low branch overhanging the water

69
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:32,080
or for the dead mouse still dressed in its light brown suit but my heart is always propped up in a

70
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,520
field on its tripod ready for the next arrow after i carried

71
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:43,520
the mouse by the tail to a pile of leaves in the woods i found myself standing at the bathroom

72
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,440
sink gazing down affectionately at the soap so patient and soluble

73
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:56,240
so at home in its pale green soap dish i could feel myself falling again as i

74
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:03,759
felt its turning in my wet hands and caught the scent of lavender and

75
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,840
stone

76
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:36,190
[Applause]

77
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:48,000
i was having a little trouble i'm muting myself right then so i'm sorry [Music]

78
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,600
if you were wondering what i was doing uh so i've gathered a few thoughts to share

79
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:59,120
with you for the next few minutes and

80
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:04,320
these last three days i've been talking about some practices that have been given to us by the buddha

81
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,840
in support of an ethical life in the buddhist tradition a person who

82
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:16,399
is devoted to the welfare of others is called a bodhisattva or an awakening being

83
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:21,519
and as i've been mentioning to those of you who've been joining for the last few days

84
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:27,840
the guidance system for an awakening being is called are called the 16 bodhisattva

85
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:33,679
so among the 16 precepts the first three are the refuges i take refuge in buddha and dharma and

86
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:40,399
sangha and the next three are called the pure precepts and those are basically a summary of the

87
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:49,200
whole of the whole thing of all 16. the pure precepts are do good avoid evil or unwholesome

88
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:56,159
conduct and purify the mind so that's what i'm going to talk about this morning beginning with a story

89
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:02,799
about a zen master by the name of bird nest roshi so burden s roshi as he came to be

90
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:08,080
called was famous for sitting meditation high up in a tree when a monk came to

91
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:13,679
visit he called up to the teacher and asked what is the secret of buddhist practice

92
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:20,480
the rashi replied do good avoid evil and purify the mind the monk then said

93
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,519
well that's easy even a three-year-old child can understand that

94
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:30,559
to which bird nest replied a child of three may understand it

95
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:36,398
but a person of 80 years may not be able to practice it

96
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:43,200
so many years ago i took a number of zen students with me on a field trip to the asian art museum in san francisco

97
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:50,240
and as we entered into the beautiful collection of chinese buddhist art i saw this wonderful trio

98
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:57,519
of standing figures in the center was shakimuni buddha and on one side of him ananda known as

99
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:03,279
the guardian of the dharma on the other side mahakashapa known as the foremost

100
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:09,919
in ascetic practices and then later on i was reflecting on these stat these standing figures and i

101
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:15,440
thought that together they very nicely represent the three pure precepts

102
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:23,358
so mahakashapa avoiding evil you know unwholesome conduct ananda doing good and shaky many buddha

103
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:29,919
purifying the mind and then as a trio saving all beings from suffering

104
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:35,200
so this first pure precept avoiding evil often connected to the idea of

105
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:42,560
asceticism basically re refers to a wise and a and at times a severe restraint

106
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:48,079
regarding the actions of our body of our speech and of our minds

107
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:54,878
asceticism basically supports us in not getting carried away by the extremes of what the dalai lama

108
00:34:54,879 --> 00:35:01,440
calls the three pathological emotions the pathology of attachment

109
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:09,040
greed i have got to have it the pathology of revulsion hatred i have got to get rid of it both

110
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:16,320
of which are grounded in the pathology of delusion about the true nature of reality

111
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:23,119
so in his very first sermon the buddha mentions the extremes of asceticism many of them familiar to us because of

112
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:30,480
the practices that the buddha himself as a young prince had undertaken in his initial quest for freedom from

113
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,920
suffering he nearly starved himself to death he lived outside without shelter

114
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:42,800
he didn't bathe he held his breath so long that he got a terrible headache and he engaged in long hours of

115
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:48,320
meditative trance and yet it was through such severe practices that siddhartha

116
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:54,960
came to realize what he called the middle way a path between extremes of asceticism on one

117
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:01,520
hand and indulgence in sensory pleasure on the other such as the childhood that he had spent

118
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:07,359
in the palace so because of that insight was called his darshana

119
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:12,480
the buddha declared in his first sermon that the middle way avoiding the extremes is the most

120
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,760
beneficial path for the development of a truly mature human being

121
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:23,920
a being who is awakened moment after moment by this very life a life that is filled with

122
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:29,839
mysteries with wonder and of service to others and yet asceticism

123
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:35,440
as represented by mahakashapa has remained an important part of the buddhist

124
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:41,359
training program as it does here at zen center but the question is to what degree and

125
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:47,440
to what end and it's always a good question for us and it's been a question throughout

126
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,480
the history of not only buddhism but i would say of all other religious traditions as well

127
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:59,280
how far do we humans need to go and more importantly perhaps go where the

128
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:06,079
song asks fayyang where are you going fayan said around on pilgrimage ditsan said

129
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:13,520
what is the purpose of pilgrimage fayang said i don't know. disand said

130
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:20,079
not knowing is nearest so for those who go too far there's

131
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:25,200
ananda standing on the other side of the buddha ananda was the buddha's cousin and

132
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:31,760
lifelong attendant whose name means joy or bliss and who's characterized in the earliest

133
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:38,160
teachings as kind unselfish and thoughtful towards others

134
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:43,520
and also as very popular ananda enjoyed playing with children and

135
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:48,640
spending time with women he was also portrayed as a large body

136
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:54,800
person unlike mahakashapa who was as thin as a rail ananda for the most part was a

137
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:01,040
happy man he too is a perfect model for spiritually satisfying life

138
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:07,119
and the second pure precept as well doing all good ananda also became famous for

139
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:14,400
beseeching the buddha to allow women such as his aunt his mother and his sisters to enter and train in the sangha as

140
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,680
fully ordained nuns albeit with a few extra regulations

141
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,880
to contend with and which they still contend with to this very day

142
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:31,599
following the buddha's death ananda was severely criticized by his new teacher mahakashapa not only for speaking on

143
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:37,440
behalf of women but for a great number of other things relating to play

144
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:43,040
so for me these two mahakashapa representing asceticism and ananda representing

145
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:49,760
pleasure are simply the guard rails on the path to awakening you know each one personifies the

146
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:55,599
extremes by which we navigate the middle way first we slide too far to one side and

147
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:01,280
then we slide too far back the other way and so it goes so this reminds us once

148
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,880
again that our practice is not a thing it's a process you know it's a living process

149
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:12,720
a 10 000 mile long iron road down which we sometimes move merrily

150
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:19,440
along and sometimes not as the case may be in the zen tradition mahakashapa's

151
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:25,760
transmission as dharma's successor to the buddha is said to have occurred when the buddha held up a white flower

152
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:31,599
and twirled it in his hand the other disciples looked on without knowing how to react

153
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:37,760
but mahakashapa smiled faintly and that was it

154
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:44,079
then dharma flower turns the dharma flower i've always thought it was interesting

155
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:52,320
that the buddha according to zen would pick mahakashapa as the first ancestor and ananda as the second and then as i

156
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,359
thought about it it occurred to me that really it is important it's an important sequence for

157
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:02,320
each of us to follow and to understand why that's so

158
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:08,240
so in my view the first thing that we do as practitioners is to commit to a

159
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:13,280
period of ascetic discipline you know the first pure precept avoiding evil

160
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:19,440
unwholesome actions in order to remove the habit body so deeply ingrained in us through a

161
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:26,319
realization of selflessness you know vipassana and then the second pure precept doing

162
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:33,280
good becoming free from selfishness and then seeing the beauty and the joy that runs through all things

163
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:39,040
and therein a natural wish to show that same beauty and joy to others

164
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:45,119
a wish to benefit them and the entire world so then there's the third pure precept

165
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:50,800
by which we transform the body and the mind to whatever is needed for the welfare of all beings

166
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:56,000
mrs kuan yin with her thousands of hands and arms

167
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:03,440
unfortunately our usual habit as humans is to try and capture that joy that runs through all things

168
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:10,480
we try to grasp it and possess it and thereby we lose touch with its transient nature lose touch

169
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,680
with the transiency of seasons of hours and of moments

170
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:23,200
without which there would be only absolute silence as you all have heard many times

171
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:30,240
the cause of human suffering is this futile effort of the illusory self to capture illusory things and that the

172
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:36,480
pursuit of the transient by the transient is the very core of human suffering it's basically

173
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,760
a kind of madness and so we must practice together in order to

174
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,880
reveal in fine detail the depth and the breadth of our insanity and then

175
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:52,960
we must stop suzuki roshi once said that practicing together is like putting unpolished

176
00:41:52,960 --> 00:42:00,160
stones into a tumbler and as they knock around hitting each other their rough edges get knocked off this

177
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:06,240
is a very courageous thing to do you know very courageous service that we offer to one another

178
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:11,839
as we must and this is because none of us here at the zen center or anywhere

179
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:17,440
else for that matter is lacking the emotional and psychological conditioning

180
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:23,440
for becoming excessively angry lustful or confused and as my therapist often

181
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:29,040
said to me when as a zen student i would complain of some kind of personal upset

182
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:35,040
human first so for this reason human first i do believe that all of us

183
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:40,319
have come to this practice in order to face the facts of our ancient conditioning

184
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:46,319
which leads us to enact our pathological emotions we have come to consider how we might

185
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:53,839
alter the outcome of our habitual response towards self-defense self-righteousness and worst of all

186
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:59,599
self-loathing so this is the third pure precept to purify the mind

187
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:07,440
meaning as one of my teachers once said to save all the beings that you are the precepts are a way of learning

188
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:14,560
the truth about ourself and about our relationship to the world and to other people which is basically and ultimately

189
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:21,119
that there is no self and there are no other people just as the buddha saw on the morning of

190
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:27,119
his awakening he saw a world that was not separate or outside of himself

191
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:33,760
and he knew for the first time that he wasn't alone that there was no thing and no one

192
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:40,960
outside of himself no alone only all one and he was happy

193
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:47,599
he was so happy he almost stayed right there under the tree but lucky for us he changed his mind and

194
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:52,640
so can we may all beings be happy may they be joyous and free from

195
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:58,240
suffering and may they live in peace thank you very much

196
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:09,760
would you like to uh take a couple questions sure happy to okay

197
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:23,839
so if anyone has uh questions go ahead and put them in chat

198
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:34,160
i think there was an earlier question about uh the poem and the poet you read earlier yeah billy collins

199
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:39,839
he's wonderful it's a wonderful book a friend gave it to me as a gift i think you can read it without the

200
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:45,359
words being backwards it's called the poetry of impermanence mindfulness and joy by john

201
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:51,359
brem and john brown is a practitioner who was listening to a lot of dharma talks and he said

202
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:56,800
you teachers need some more poems so he put this wonderful collection of

203
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:02,160
chinese and japanese and american poets together under these headings the first section

204
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:07,200
is impermanence the second section the poem is about mindfulness and the third

205
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:12,240
about joy and i don't know if you can see the picture but there's a wonderful image of it an

206
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:19,839
elephant standing on top of some china wear some teacups and improbable

207
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:27,119
but there it is and i think there's another question uh

208
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:32,560
what are the two truths well does the ultimate truth which

209
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:39,760
basically is inconceivable the inconceivable nature of reality itself it can't be broken into parts you know

210
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:44,880
reality doesn't come apart it's just all at once right here and we are all

211
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:50,160
that just this is it as a declaration of the ultimate truth

212
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:55,760
and the relative truth is the other truth which is the truth about our relationships and it's pretty much about

213
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:01,119
language how we have we as clever little primates have created language

214
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:06,240
to take the world apart you know into many many parts

215
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:12,400
in fact i was reading this book sapiens which is quite fascinating about the origins of language and how

216
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:18,800
with language humans were able to begin to say things that were simply not true

217
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:24,480
like that that god up in heaven loves our people better than any others you know

218
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:31,440
it's like where'd that come from but you know we all know these things have been said so uh language allows us to lie

219
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:37,119
and all kinds of terrible things so being conscious of language the relative

220
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:43,119
truth and there's a wonderful series of books by some scholars led by jay garfield from back east

221
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:48,400
tibetan teacher uh called taking the relatives seriously

222
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:54,720
i think all of us who come into spiritual practice are often drawn to the ultimate we want the ultimate truth we want to

223
00:46:54,720 --> 00:47:00,319
you know have that big bang experience of enlightenment you know once and for all

224
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:06,800
um however the ultimate truth is that there is no ultimate truth everything shows up for us as in

225
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:13,440
relative terms you know these truths are about the this one reality it's not about you

226
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:18,720
know two separate realities so it's really the truth about the one thing you know

227
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:24,240
about each object and uh it's a fascinating study i highly recommend

228
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:31,200
all of you you can even just wikipedia as a really good description of the two truths if you want to uh read a little bit

229
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:37,119
about it hey thank you phu and uh what was the name of the book again

230
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:44,480
that you showed with the elephant yeah the poetry of the poetry of impermanence

231
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:53,838
mindfulness and joy john brem b-r-e-h-m

232
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:01,760
and we'll take one question from youtube there was a question about please explain think of

233
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:07,920
no thoughts is it a coin uh-huh definitely that's the question

234
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:15,200
you know dogan says he's quoting some other teacher previously think not thinking so this is the

235
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:20,240
dualistic proposition the relative truth comes in twos you know is

236
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:25,599
isn't me you right wrong that's do a lot dualistic thinking based in language

237
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:30,800
so we think in in twos but there's no twos you can't find the tooth

238
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:35,920
so think not thinking how do you think not thinking

239
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:41,520
non-thinking together this is the essential art of zazen not

240
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:47,200
splitting the word world into half into twos the big one being self and other

241
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:52,640
you know that's the one that hurts us the most think not thinking how do you think not thinking

242
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:58,800
non thinking the essential art of life really of zazen we say zazen but that

243
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,839
just means everything

244
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:13,119
okay fool thank you very much yeah thank you all thank you so much and please have a a good day a safe day and

245
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:16,240
take care
