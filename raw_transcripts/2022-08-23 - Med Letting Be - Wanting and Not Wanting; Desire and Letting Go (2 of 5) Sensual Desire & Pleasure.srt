1
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:09,280
okay good morning or afternoon or evening let's go ahead and start with

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:17,440
the meditation today so just allowing yourself to settle in

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,880
for this period of practice finding your spot

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:31,800
if you're comfortable doing so allowing your eyes to close gently

5
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,440
it's often good to begin a period of meditation with just a

6
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,879
quick check in with the body and inviting some ease

7
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:55,120
so sensing the body in the sitting posture or if you're lying down

8
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,840
or standing whatever posture you're in

9
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:08,920
just sensing the orientation the disposition of the body

10
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,479
allowing the attention to come inward

11
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:31,280
just so that we have that connection with ourself right now

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,600
sensing the place where you're sitting your seat against the cushion or the

13
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,000
chair

14
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,479
sensing how it supports you the stability

15
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,119
and maybe taking a moment to feel balanced

16
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:12,239
where you're sitting so i sometimes even rock back and forth a little bit or forward and back

17
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:18,000
just to find that center point or close to it

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,319
where the body feels as balanced as it can

19
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,239
typically that will be a feeling of uprightness

20
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,040
almost as if the head is being drawn upward

21
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,599
by a string even at the top of the head

22
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,800
and just letting the body soften around that

23
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,840
letting the shoulders release maybe the shoulder blades slide down the

24
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,159
back

25
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,239
letting the arms rest hang down comfortably from the

26
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,239
shoulders

27
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,280
letting the hips and the legs soften

28
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:58,000
and then inviting ease even inside the body so inviting the

29
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,959
eyes to soften in the eye sockets even letting the brain relax

30
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,239
if that image makes sense

31
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,520
sometimes if i've been thinking i imagine that my brain has gotten a little bit

32
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:30,560
compressed and i just allow it to expand to fill the whole skull

33
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:46,479
and down through the chest and torso area

34
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:55,240
maybe also feeling some release and expansion let yourself fill the body

35
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,560
from the inside

36
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:27,520
and bringing some attention to the mind how is it right now

37
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,600
does the mind feel a little contracted

38
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:42,960
a little excited is there some mood or emotion that's prominent

39
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:49,000
it's all fine we're just checking in to see what's there

40
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:08,960
so the invitation is to touch into whatever

41
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,080
degree of contentment you can feel right now

42
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:24,000
things are as they are can we have some mental ease

43
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,440
around the current conditions of body and mind

44
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,360
at least for this moment you're sitting quietly

45
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:43,199
touching into the sense of it's enough for now

46
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,639
to whatever degree that's present

47
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:11,280
it's often helpful to give the mind an anchor maybe the breath or the body sensations

48
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:18,160
or for some people sounds are relaxing anchor

49
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,400
just something to orient around

50
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:31,840
seeing if you can connect with that and just rest with it for a few moments

51
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:05,279
when we have even just some degree of stability and ease

52
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:11,440
in the mind whatever degree it's present

53
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,600
that can serve as a a reference point

54
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,519
for feeling the ways that the mind and the body

55
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,040
kind of pull away from that

56
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:34,399
maybe there's a leaning toward wanting

57
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,320
more peace or more ease

58
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:48,839
or maybe there's a compulsive thought that keeps coming back we keep wanting

59
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:55,279
to plan something for tomorrow or we want to

60
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:00,800
review a conversation that happened yesterday

61
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,839
figure out what would have been better to say

62
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,880
and sometimes we fall into those and get on that train and that's normal

63
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,640
or maybe we really are wanting something to eat or

64
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:29,760
to be outside right now so just taking some time is a simple mindfulness

65
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:36,640
practice of just resting where we are in our seat and noticing the

66
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,839
the pulls of the mind toward various things

67
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,399
if there are any

68
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:57,279
and if we have been able to see some of the ways that the mind

69
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:02,399
wants things or wants to move into things or move toward

70
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,519
things or pull things into it

71
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:14,800
all of those are part of this movement of desire that we're exploring this week

72
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:22,560
and it's also helpful to see the relationship that we have to that

73
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:31,279
sometimes in meditation we react to wanting by not wanting it

74
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:37,839
oh if only my mind would stop doing that

75
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:47,199
so it can get a little complicated if we begin to put wanting and not wanting under the lens and then we combine it

76
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:54,160
with wanting or not wanting those things those movements

77
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,519
but it's also helpful to see the the way the world of wanting and not wanting is

78
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:11,079
complicated so the invitation is to let be

79
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,240
so not to get entangled but not to try to resist if the mind

80
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,279
is pulling this way in that what if we could just let those

81
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:30,800
movements be let them be as they are

82
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:41,839
if not wanting arises we can let that be as it is too they're really just different sides of the same coin

83
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:48,800
we always have the that reference point of

84
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:55,240
whatever ease or contentment we have at this moment

85
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,759
it's okay it's just sitting here

86
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,199
just let it be

87
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,960
the breath that comes in and goes out

88
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:58,000
it comes in without us wanting it

89
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,400
goes out without us wanting to get rid of it

90
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:19,400
many of the movements of the mind come about without us really wanting to bring them into existence

91
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:28,039
if we just let them be they will eventually end also

92
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,640
just resting with the direct experience that wanting and not wanting

93
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:48,600
are only partially related to what's actually coming and going

94
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,440
yes we're able to tune in more often

95
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:29,440
to a place of rest in the mind and heart and body

96
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:36,279
even if it's just a little bit more than what we had before

97
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:44,480
there can be a very slight feeling of joy

98
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:51,440
of happiness of being simply being in the present moment

99
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,880
even if what we're experiencing is somewhat unpleasant

100
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,080
suppose our back has gotten a little sore sitting here

101
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,480
well we're just not feeling well today or

102
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:15,039
any of the myriad things that occupy the mind and body there's something about just

103
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:25,200
being there for it knowing it letting it be that has a very subtle kind of joy to it

104
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:33,640
the joy of being present for her life

105
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:40,000
that's very helpful to tune into when we're able to feel it

106
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,159
because it encourages the mind to stay present

107
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:52,000
and to allow the various wantings and not wantings

108
00:24:53,440 --> 00:25:01,039
to come and go and to not have so much hold on the mind then we would have a choice

109
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:05,639
about whether to act on them or not

110
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:43,200
we may begin to sense in our life that that

111
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,480
centeredness that we can rest in that presence

112
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,880
where it's okay for there to be wanting and not wanting and we have a choice about

113
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:02,000
acting on it that's a gift to the world that little space that we can open up

114
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,039
through our awareness

115
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:15,760
so that we can begin to more often make choices that will be good for us

116
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:23,279
and for others more often the things that we

117
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:30,039
we can choose among the things we want the ones that will be beneficial

118
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,960
we can choose among the things that we feel not wanting toward

119
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,519
we can move away from the ones that are actually

120
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:51,600
harmful and help others to do that too

121
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:03,679
far from being self-serving contentment and ease

122
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:10,080
and ability not to want and not want is a huge gift

123
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:22,360
so valuable for this world that is so busy rushing here and there

124
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:42,000
so we bring in a beautiful kind of desire into the mind

125
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,600
the wish for happiness for ourselves and others

126
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:58,679
the wish to be free of the grip of unhelpful wanting and not wanting

127
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:05,600
may it be so on this day as we go forward into our lives a little bit

128
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:12,440
later or tomorrow if we're going to bed soon

129
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:23,320
may we bring our contentment for the benefit of the world

130
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:44,049

131
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,170
[Music]

132
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:14,399
okay so this week we're talking about

133
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:20,559
desire and letting go and we learned yesterday

134
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:26,640
that desire has a lot of different manifestations in human life

135
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,080
it's a big part of life and just to review the vocabulary for this

136
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:38,320
week i'm we're using the word desire as a general term that just means

137
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:46,159
our mental movement toward something that we want to move toward and it can definitely be unwholesome

138
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:51,360
lust for power lust for sex addictions

139
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:57,360
but it can also range into just the needs of the body hunger wanting to eat

140
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:03,440
and all the way up into aspirations and good intentions and even the wish to awaken so i'm

141
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:10,159
calling all that kind of this space of moving toward or desire

142
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:16,159
and you know we can feel in ourselves that different kinds of desire feel very different

143
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:21,279
and that's important you know we need to gain some understanding and also some

144
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:26,880
strength of heart around handling desire so it's important area

145
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:32,720
of buddhist practice and today we're going to look

146
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:38,640
particularly at the pali word for it is comma

147
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:44,080
which is the realm of the senses and just to be clear that is a different word than

148
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:50,159
karma which is also called comma in poly this one has a long a

149
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:56,240
comma i'll try to be clear on that so this word comma

150
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,279
it has two different sides it has an objective side where it

151
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:06,720
represents the sensual pleasure or attractiveness that's out in the world or that we think

152
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,480
is out in the world and then has a subjective side that's related to the

153
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:19,200
sensual pleasure and also the attachment that we generate the sensual desire and also the attachment that we generate in

154
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:26,320
our mind around sense objects so i'll mostly probably call it sense desire or sometimes sense pleasure but

155
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:32,080
it's kind of multifaceted like that um and i should probably keep repeating

156
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:38,720
this all week which is to say is all desire bad no no it's not

157
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:46,720
but some are clearly more wholesome than others and then as a refinement of that we also need to check if there is attachment

158
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:53,600
coming along with a certain wish this is a little bit of a refinement so you know it's totally fine to wand a cup of tea

159
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:59,039
and head into the kitchen to get it but if our partner has finished the last of

160
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:04,399
the tea and we get there and there isn't any do we get angry about that

161
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:12,159
so the desire was fine but if there's attachment to it then there will be suffering if it's not fulfilled so we

162
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:18,000
have to watch that particularly in the realm that we're talking about today

163
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,279
so comma sense desire or sense pleasure

164
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:30,320
sometimes this refers to the five physical senses seeing hearing smelling tasting touching

165
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:37,279
i.e pleasure at any of those scent stores or desire for pleasant experiences there i think we're all very

166
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:43,519
familiar with that and sometimes it also includes the sixth sense in

167
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:50,320
buddhism the mental sense so like wanting pleasant ideas or having a desire for

168
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:56,080
pleasant thoughts and we have that too you know we we sometimes spend time

169
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:02,880
honing our views or philosophies or creating appealing stories etc

170
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,320
um the buddha just used the word comma differently and

171
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:14,960
on different occasions so sometimes only the five senses sometimes all six um

172
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:20,638
but when we relate this to the different types of desire i talked about yesterday

173
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:26,638
it isn't just one of the five it connects into several of them so

174
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:32,960
just as a review the five that we talked about were tonha which is grasping desire

175
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:38,320
and then the second one was our basic bodily needs hunger and thirst

176
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:45,679
needing to pee and then the wanting the various wantings associated with living a human life

177
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:51,280
and then the elevated wishes for well-being and peace and the fifth is the aspiration to

178
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:58,320
awaken so when comma this sense pleasure is very strong it's

179
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:05,040
part of that first kind of desire when there's a lot of attachment to it the grasping desire or tonha and then when

180
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:12,400
it's milder it relates more to the next two to the simple bodily needs of wanting to keep the body comfortable

181
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:18,240
and then the wanting associated with creating a human life so wants around

182
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:24,960
livelihood and family and community and so in those latter two cases that

183
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,560
are more in the milder form we tend to regard sense pleasure as very

184
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,760
important and useful and justified and um

185
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:40,880
and of course we have to do those we have to create our life but it's very

186
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:47,760
interesting to see how the buddha talks about kama in the teachings that we have from him

187
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:53,599
so i i thought it would be honest to uh to go over some of those and so to put

188
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:58,800
it frankly comma does not come off well in the buddhist teachings um

189
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:05,680
as we read and study the teachings we have to acknowledge that so um he gives a series of very stark

190
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:11,760
and graphic images for sense pleasure in a number of different teachings and i i won't even

191
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:17,839
go over all of them but because there's a lot but just as an example

192
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:24,800
one of them is that it is a it's like a meatless bone that a dog who's very hungry comes to

193
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:32,000
gnaw on the nose and nose and gnaws but it doesn't get any nourishment from the meatless bone

194
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,200
another image is a bird that has found a scrap of meat and

195
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:44,560
it picks it up and flies off with it and then it's attacked by other birds because they see that it has

196
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:49,760
something good and so they attack the bird that has the meat

197
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:56,240
and if it doesn't drop it it's going to get hurt another image is uh

198
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:02,880
going against the wind with a grass torch so if you go if you go with the wind

199
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:09,359
then it will you know it will blow away from you but if you go against the wind the smoke and the fire from the grass

200
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:15,119
torch will blow right onto you and maybe i'll just give one more

201
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:21,040
um which is that it's like uh since pleasures are like a dream world where

202
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:26,880
we imagine lovely parks and lovely groves and beautiful streams

203
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,400
and then they they they go away like poof when we wake up

204
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,599
so there i could go on but i think that's enough to get the idea

205
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:44,560
we say wow that's pretty stark i mean each one has a different uh focus right each one highlights a

206
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:50,079
different aspect of sense pleasure that is painful or troublesome

207
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:55,920
so you know meatless bone shows unsatisfactoriness

208
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:02,400
in the end ultimate unsatisfactoriness the bird with the meat shows other people's envy

209
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,760
you know when we have a lot of nice things that can be a problem in human life

210
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,880
um a dream world is like there's something kind of deluded about

211
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,160
thinking that these things are so wonderful and maybe we've had that experience of thinking that something we

212
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:23,920
were going to get was going to be really really wonderful and great and we get it and maybe we like it for a little while

213
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:29,200
but then you know we realize it isn't quite as good as we thought

214
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:36,240
something like that so i think you get the idea so you can ask wait a minute whoa why

215
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:41,680
why does the buddha do this you know why is this the most common way that he talks about karma

216
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:46,720
is it really so horrible to enjoy a good meal a sunset

217
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:52,480
my comfortable bed and of course the answer is no i'll have to keep saying this

218
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:58,560
it's not horrible we don't want to replace pleasures that we're that we like

219
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,599
with aversion or with guilt that doesn't help

220
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:08,640
so then we're left though with the question you know what is the buddha doing

221
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:15,680
i think the buddha makes a big deal out of the underlying unsatisfactoriness of sensual enjoyment

222
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:22,720
because it's so hard for us to see it you know we often have not just the simple enjoyment of these pleasures but

223
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:28,480
we have attachment on top of that and we don't really want to see

224
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:34,800
the other side of these it's fine to enjoy things when they're present but if there's the attachment

225
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:41,599
then we start getting into these problems so he's getting our attention the buddha wants to wake us up for a

226
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:48,720
moment so that wisdom can come in the buddha actually knew that it's hard

227
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:54,400
for us to see the disadvantages of sense pleasure because even he had a hard time

228
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:00,320
this is also in the suttas you might remember if you know the story of the buddha that he had a wealthy

229
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:07,839
upbringing he had plenty of sense pleasures and in one suta he actually says

230
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:15,119
that he was intoxicated he uses that word he was intoxicated with youth and life

231
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:20,720
and health and hence he just got lost in all the pleasures this was before his awakening

232
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:25,760
and then at some point still before his awakening he realized that it would be

233
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,359
good if he weren't so infatuated with sensuality but he still couldn't give it up

234
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:39,839
i'm reading a quote now of the buddha speaking even i myself before my awakening when i

235
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:47,440
was still an unawakened bodhisattva thought renunciation is good seclusion is good

236
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:52,640
but my heart did not leap up renunciation it didn't grow confident

237
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:59,359
steadfast or released seeing it as peace and the thought occurred to me why is it

238
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:07,680
that my heart does not leap up at renunciation doesn't grow confident or steadfast or released or see it as peace

239
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:12,720
and then it occurred to me i have not seen the drawbacks of sensual pleasures

240
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:20,480
i have not cultivated that insight this is the buddha before his awakening so if he had to he

241
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,599
had to actively look for the difficulties behind sense pleasures

242
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:32,800
and if that was the buddha i would guess it's going to be the same for us so he gives us these things these images

243
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:40,720
for our contemplation so that we can become more wise so that we can back away from the attachment and the idea in

244
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:46,000
our mind that these things are the whole point and if we just get enough of these

245
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,680
that's what life is about um i think we know many people who come to

246
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:56,720
meditation have realized that that isn't quite enough just to have all

247
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:01,839
the things that society tells us we should have it doesn't feel quite satisfying in

248
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:07,920
the end so um we're pointed you know we get pointed out to us these are temporary

249
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:14,480
and they're also not really controllable you know we might have gotten lucky and gotten a bunch of them in our life or

250
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:20,880
enough of them at least but and that's good because that's supportive

251
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:27,200
but do you really have complete control no we don't and so

252
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:33,760
and then they can also cause problems with other people sensual desires lead to all kinds of conflicts

253
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:39,119
so they're bound up with all kinds of unskillful mind states and it's hard

254
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:45,520
i acknowledge that it's hard for us to see this hard for the mind to see this because we feel like we'll be left with

255
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,880
nothing if we have no other source of happiness besides comfort and material pleasure

256
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,400
then it would feel terrible for those to be taken away

257
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:02,880
so it's understandable so the buddha is is being careful but also

258
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:09,119
pointing to the truth so he i did slip a word into that quote that i read you might have heard it it

259
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:14,240
was renunciation that's not a good word in western

260
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:19,760
english understanding um so we're going to talk more about what

261
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:25,920
that word really means in the buddhist teachings it's actually quite a positive word we have to let go of some of our

262
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:32,720
associations so maybe just for now we'll just substitute the word letting go as something better than

263
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:39,599
than the word renunciation for us until we've had a chance to explore it but i want to end on a practical note

264
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:46,480
today so you know what does it mean for our life if we start to question the value of

265
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:52,560
just pursuing sense pleasures if that's all we did what would happen if we started to

266
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:58,240
question that and i think i would guess that many of you have already done some reflection in this area

267
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:04,560
because it's common for people who are interested in meditation to also be interested in some degree of

268
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:10,880
material simplicity you know some understanding that getting more and more stuff isn't the

269
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:17,440
answer to happiness usually simplicity is somewhat valued in our lives

270
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:23,599
and so one you know one realm for simplicity that we can have is material simplicity the physical stuff in our

271
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:30,079
life and we can begin to realize that stuff takes effort to get and to

272
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:35,119
maintain and to organize and to remember all of that stuff

273
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:42,720
and so we start to realize ah it would be easier if we had less so i'll offer a little reflection

274
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:48,880
is there something that you have that it would be easier if you didn't have it

275
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:54,319
something that you have to manage or look out for or deal with in your life something

276
00:44:54,319 --> 00:45:00,880
and what would it be like to let that go it's interesting letting go often brings

277
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:07,280
kind of an ease to the mind and when it's a clean letting go you know when we actually were ready to

278
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:12,560
release it there's peace in the heart there's no sense of deprivation

279
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:17,599
we need so little really so tomorrow

280
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:23,839
we're going to talk about this willingness to let go of things that that we're genuinely

281
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:31,040
ready to let go or that genuinely aren't necessary in our life we don't have to let go of things that are necessary for

282
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:36,079
our support and for our nourishment i'm going to go so far as to say that

283
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:41,599
letting go is a hard quality and that the ability to let go of

284
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:48,400
sense pleasures that are not necessary or even that are causing harm is a heart quality and something that we can do out

285
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:56,319
of wisdom and out of care so that's the focus for tomorrow and i hope

286
00:45:56,319 --> 00:46:01,160
to see you then be well
