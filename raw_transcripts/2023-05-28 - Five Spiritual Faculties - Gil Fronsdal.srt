1
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:06,960
so once upon a time someone asked when's

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:14,299
a good time to be mindful and uh the answer was it was

3
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:20,160
when it's the best alternative when it's the best option

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,939
one of the phenomena that happens as we start practicing mindfulness we start

5
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:32,040
discovering that it's often the best option

6
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:38,040
and it becomes the better option the more we practice it and part of the reason for that is as

7
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:44,399
we're practicing mindfulness we start seeing what our mind stream is doing

8
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,180
and sometimes occasionally our mindstream is not that high quality

9
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:55,500
it it's not doing something that's it might even be harmful it might even be a

10
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,719
drag what goes on in there the topics the concerns the attitudes

11
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:08,340
and and that's our circumstances mindfulness is a better option and what mindfulness does is it kind of

12
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,619
interrupts the the freedom of our kind

13
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:19,740
of unhealthy mind streams from just perpetuating themselves freely which if we're not mindful they can do

14
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:25,619
and if the unhealthy Minds ruminations and thoughts and ideas go freely that

15
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:31,979
actually reinforce themselves to become stronger and stronger but to be mindful is to considered to

16
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:39,540
always be helpful always be a wholesome beneficial thing for the mind to do because it's a way of in to some degree

17
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:45,420
stepping out of that mindstream and seeing it and the more clarity we see oh

18
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,180
that's not a cool way of thinking the more clear more clarity that is

19
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:57,680
without judgment and criticism just oh look at that that's not cool

20
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,360
we're interrupting that mindstream to some degree we're stepping out of it for a moment

21
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,119
and then as we do so you ask the question what's the best time to be

22
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,400
mindful I think it's right now because it's the better alternative it's

23
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,160
a better option sometimes we're thinking about something that's not necessarily harmful for us or

24
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:27,840
for others but we've thought it ten thousand times and uh and maybe mindfulness is a better

25
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:36,180
option uh maybe uh um and as we as we step into that out of

26
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:42,060
the mindstream into mindfulness we start discovering over time that

27
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:49,620
there's something else available to us that's not just simply redirecting the Mind stream like for me I do redirect mine sometimes

28
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:56,580
I'll be thinking about something I say you know this is not useful to think about or you know I'm going to give a

29
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:02,340
talk later in the day and I start thinking about I don't know something nothing to relate to the talk and it's

30
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,680
not such a nice it's not bad thoughts but it's kind of I don't know ridiculous

31
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,959
thoughts and uh and I said you know I think I I

32
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,780
think I'm better off thinking about what to talk about when I come to IMC and so my mind goes there for a while and that

33
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:25,980
seems better so sometimes you can redirect the mind and um and uh and I'll often do that in

34
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:32,840
the course of the day and it isn't repressing anything it isn't um you know

35
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:39,120
pollyanish to think something else it just seems like very matter-of-fact and straightforward and of course I would do

36
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,459
that choose the better option but as I as the mindfulness becomes

37
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:50,700
stronger if there's something else that's possible to discover and that is there's a there's all kinds

38
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:59,180
of um wonderful States wonderful capacities or or qualities inside that can arise

39
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:04,799
that are nothing to do with our mind stream what we're thinking about and concerned with

40
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,900
that there's these wonderful inner qualities that bubble up almost as if

41
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:15,360
mindfulness makes space for it that can you can't have space for it if

42
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,400
you keep thinking and you might have a habit of having the most beautiful Noble

43
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:26,340
and inspiring and healthy thoughts that anybody's ever had in the history of humanity

44
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:33,960
and you have a a real record of usually doing the all day long and uh and you're just proud and engaged

45
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:41,400
and inspired by what you're thinking about then you just want to keep thinking it so please do if you want

46
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:49,440
however that cons you're constantly filling the space with those thoughts and and so

47
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:56,520
there's no Inner Space for something else to arise to develop and as we get a sense that mindfulness

48
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:03,000
makes a space or something beautiful to happen within us the question when is the best time to be

49
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,240
mindful takes a whole different there's more evidence there's more understanding oh

50
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:15,600
now's the best time because even the most beautiful thoughts of I mean this is going to be the Great American novel

51
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,000
or you know whatever well it might be but there's even better things

52
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,840
more wonderful things and there's the qualities and capacities we have inside

53
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,240
that are you know when they become strong

54
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,860
some people might want to describe them as divine

55
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:45,258
and maybe that's what the Buddha did when he called five particular states that we have inside

56
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:53,940
named after the Indian God Indra and so of Indra so of of of of God or

57
00:05:53,940 --> 00:06:00,120
Heavenly or something and and if you don't get a sense of this kind of divine association with these

58
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:07,320
five qualities that are your own personal qualities that you have um in the usual English translation of

59
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:15,720
these which is called the five faculties so five faculty seems nice but isn't that kind of bland oh yeah I have five

60
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:23,220
faculties you know you know but if you have five divinities within I mean like what you know some of

61
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:28,740
you might be now alarmed or running because but anyway these five Divine qualities

62
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,900
like what's that and um these five are also sometimes

63
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:39,360
called five strengths something you also don't get from the word faculties

64
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,000
and the difference between these two words the India and the powers the Bala

65
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,520
is um just linguistic according to the Buddha it's not uh they're the same

66
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:57,419
thing and so these Divine qualities are also wonderful strengths or powers that we

67
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:03,919
can carry within us so what are these so let me before I kind of

68
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:11,340
name them for those some many of you know what they are I want to continue this analogy with the mindfulness

69
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:18,240
so as we're mindful we discover what our mindstream is up to and sometimes we see it's up to

70
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:25,080
something unhealthy for us something not so beneficial maybe even harmful for ourselves sometimes it's just a waste of

71
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:31,860
time and sometimes it's actually wonderful to do and the thoughts the concerns the

72
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:39,240
questions we have they're inspiring we're inspired by it it's really healthy and uh and to see those clearly those

73
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:45,599
options gives us a chance to choose which of those options we pursue

74
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:52,319
and it makes a difference if you see those three options in front of you you know like see three foods in front

75
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,660
of you one's poisonous one is tasteless

76
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:04,380
and one just is so satisfying uh dish like just like maybe it's just like

77
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:10,979
your the favorite Mother's dish growing up or something that represents parental

78
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:17,699
love or something it nourishes you in so many more ways than just with food because of the love

79
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:23,460
that you associate with it so poison Blend or this food that

80
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:30,060
conveys love what would you choose well you know I think not so many people

81
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:35,099
would use the poison and but but the love thing

82
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:40,919
and when we choose the love food the food that associated with kind of maternal or paternal care or

83
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:46,020
grandmotherly care or something then something different happens within

84
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:51,720
us something inspiring something nice something oh this was good I feel I remember something wonderful from my

85
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:58,740
childhood and to this day I still remember when I have toast with cheese on it I remember you know I remember my

86
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:05,880
grandmother and her and her love it's like wow and um so the same thing can happen

87
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:13,800
internally as we see the the Smorgasburg Borg of different uh

88
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:21,060
mind states that my different thought streams and we have inside if you see that you're just always kind

89
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:27,420
of in a complaining mind state that's kind of like getting into the territory of poison actually

90
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:32,700
if you're always filled with hate then and hostile and you're kind of full of

91
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:38,700
resentment you might not want to believe this but it is a kind of poison for our hearts or Minds

92
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:44,100
if you're constantly greedy it's kind of a poison to be caught up in that that

93
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,260
does all these things do negative things to our hearts our minds our body

94
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:54,600
uh generosity love wisdom

95
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:01,260
kindness they do a whole different thing and some of these positive states can really Feed

96
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:08,160
Us in a wonderful good ways and now is for our benefit

97
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,380
so as we do the mindfulness practice we start seeing the range of possibilities

98
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:19,680
of what our mind can be up to in any given time and and first it happens maybe in

99
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:26,100
meditation in meditation you start seeing you know you're you start thinking about um I

100
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:32,580
don't know what you know could be lottery tickets and you're kind of like trying to guess how to calculate you

101
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:39,620
know what are the most likely numbers to win the lottery this next time and what are the lucky numbers and it in a

102
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:46,500
40-minute meditation after 20 minutes you realize you have 20 minutes I've been thinking about lottery numbers

103
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:52,980
and it's it finally Dawns on you what a waste of time I don't think I'll do that anymore let

104
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:59,700
me switch and just focus on my breathing and you focus on your breathing and it feels good and relaxing and by the time

105
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:05,040
the next 20 minutes are over you feel settled and relaxed and quiet and wow

106
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:11,760
that's so much better to have done that rather than spend all 40 minutes of meditation thinking about numbers

107
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:19,019
lottery numbers so maybe that's a silly example but I think meditators as they meditate start

108
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:25,019
seeing what kind of thinking is not useful to do sometimes they discover that there's no good thinking in

109
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:32,519
meditation they have much better things to do than keep thinking just let the Mind get quiet and calm and so in

110
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:37,860
meditation we start making choices what we pick up what we perpetuate and

111
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:43,740
what we put down and uh and uh after a while we developed

112
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:51,360
some um confidence not only that we can do that but some confidence that there are

113
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,820
better choices than spending the whole meditation uh guessing lottery numbers

114
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:02,220
or whatever it might be that we spin off in there are better choices

115
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:08,459
and we start having confidence in that so that it's not after 20 minutes we switch gears it might be after a few

116
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:13,860
minutes we switch gears I know something better not only we have confidence in it we're

117
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:19,860
actually inspired I'm inspired by the other possibility of meditating of these other states of

118
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:25,740
Minds that can happen these other directions we can go into and so after a while there gets because

119
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:34,079
of familiarity with the territory of meditation not only is our confidence there's trust in a different thing that

120
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:40,079
we do some type some people without thinking about it trust resentment

121
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:47,399
trust complaining trust grumbling all kinds of things because what the Mind does most of the time but we come to

122
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,920
meditation we start seeing that the usual mind streams we live in are not so useful

123
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:58,920
and so we start trusting putting them down and trusting something else

124
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:05,160
and when after a while they become inspired by this how lucky I am that I have this practice

125
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:11,579
that allows me to change the Mind stream or do something else to have a practice that seems to settle the Mind down to

126
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:17,639
some degree and I have access to something else we might even say we start having faith

127
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:24,839
in this book this potential and this possibility and over time this sense of Faith or

128
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:30,720
confidence in this becomes stronger and stronger until

129
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,240
it becomes a thing it becomes divine

130
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:43,980
it becomes a strength that we have and it makes a huge difference to have this confidence in the practice

131
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:50,639
because sometimes practice is hard to do sometimes our mind streams are very challenging and there's all the lawyers

132
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:56,519
of the mind that will argue that against it you have to you have to kind of you

133
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:01,620
know plan Revenge that you're required to as a human being

134
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:08,760
aren't you you deserve it or do you have a right to it or whatever but you have so much confidence in what

135
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:16,200
can happen when we don't get caught in these unhealthy mind streams that the faith and the confidence will

136
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:22,440
override the lawyers and will choose the healthy direction

137
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:28,920
so this confidence this faith that we have in the practice can get stronger and stronger and stronger

138
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:36,000
and it becomes something that feels really inspiring and wonderful to have it and maybe it's divine in certain kind

139
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,579
of way as we start seeing more clearly the choices the mind can make

140
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:49,139
then we put effort into doing so and that effort of choosing the Healthy

141
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:56,699
Mind streams or the healthy states of mind or choosing mindfulness it it does involve some kind of effort it involves

142
00:14:56,699 --> 00:15:03,060
choice as we repeatedly make that effort even like the effort to sit down to meditate

143
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:09,540
day after day as we sit and meditate the effort to return to the breathing return to the breathing

144
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:16,519
at some point that effort Factor gets strong at some point that effort factor

145
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:21,720
and the mindfulness together starts giving rise to a certain kind of

146
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:28,440
Vitality that begins carrying us along some people would call it Chi

147
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:34,380
this kind of inner Vitality that's there and some of you probably kind of an

148
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:41,399
ordinary place to feel that maybe for some of us is if you start a new exercise practice you know maybe

149
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:48,480
bicycling or running or something and it first it's really hard and the body screams and says stop

150
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:56,339
but as you do it and get into it and get conditioned sometimes you start feeling this wonderful vitality and joy in doing

151
00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:03,360
the exercise for a while until you get tired or something but you know there's kind of something kicks in a vitality

152
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:09,180
and when you stop doing it the you know the end of the exercise the Vitality

153
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:15,779
remains for a while it's really great so the same thing can happen with the mental practice of

154
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:21,120
mindfulness that there's a Vitality that gets Unleashed that gets opened or released

155
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,699
or awoken and that Vitality is called Viria in

156
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:34,620
poly it's a and then there's uh as we practice mindfulness

157
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:40,680
um mindfulness is one of the things we choose to keep doing we see the mind gets distracted and we

158
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:46,620
come back and we're mindful again over time that capacity to be aware

159
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:53,759
becomes a second nature so much like we're strengthening a muscle and you just stay aware

160
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,820
some of you maybe have had this experience if you do a good session of meditation at home or here

161
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:05,938
and then you uh for the next few minutes after the meditation or maybe longer

162
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:12,780
than that you kind of feel like you're kind of like really here you're really here you kind of notice

163
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:18,360
your feels fresh it feels like you're not automatically rushing off into distraction again and getting busy

164
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:24,480
you're going to the kitchen to make breakfast and it feels like you're just there in a relaxed calm way and you're

165
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,240
very present for the experience of breakfast and preparing it then it's

166
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:36,240
calm and and the maybe even the kitchen Sparkles a little bit because you're paying attention you know you're there

167
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,940
in a nice way and so the awareness that gets kind of

168
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:49,500
built up during and meditation persists after meditation is over until

169
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:55,799
you get caught up and then maybe you start reading the news and that's all it takes

170
00:17:55,799 --> 00:18:01,559
and um but also awareness can become a strength

171
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:07,799
awareness when it has kind of a life of its own it's there and present for you available for you

172
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:14,039
without having to do a lot of work to make it there it's just there as kind of a natural quality

173
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:20,880
and you have to protect it by not getting distracted but it's kind of the stronger it becomes

174
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:27,720
it's kind of divine it's a fantastic capacity

175
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:34,679
and then as we're becoming less and less distracted what we're overcoming is being

176
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:41,780
fragmented being distracted we're kind of beginning beginning to kind of gather ourselves together and being oh kind of

177
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:48,059
wholehearted whatever we're doing or or just kind of complete in ourselves being

178
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:54,780
here right now which is samadhi which is the uh what's called

179
00:18:54,780 --> 00:19:02,280
concentration in English but samadhi the state of being undistracted such a beautiful feeling like you can

180
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:07,500
engage in washing your dishes and you're wholeheartedly everything is there as if

181
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:14,039
this is the only thing to do the most valuable thing to do is to be there with doing the dishes

182
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:21,539
what a rare thing in many people in our distracted world we have how many people do the dishes and will

183
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:27,360
automatically turn on the radio a TV show in order to get input and get the

184
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,580
latest news or get something going and or automatically going through their

185
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:37,860
mind and start going through the to-do list they're going to do and what they're worried about and they're hardly

186
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:44,580
present for the dishes there's no samadhi of dishwashing but there is dishwashing samadhi

187
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:52,559
which is such a pleasure wow because the alternative is to be distracted the

188
00:19:52,559 --> 00:20:00,840
alternative is to be fragmented and split between what we do and so as we learn to be mindful and the

189
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:08,400
mindfulness is stronger and we're choosing to be present more and more there's a unification process that goes

190
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:15,240
on and we learned about how beautiful it is and it turns out that unified feeling of

191
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:20,460
being fully present to what you're doing at the moment can be divine

192
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:26,880
or spiritual it's very just just that is a spiritual state in Buddhism

193
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:34,440
and um and there that can be a strength concentration can become so strong that

194
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:40,620
it's actually hard to shake it off sometimes and you carry it with you more than just carrying calm with you you

195
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:46,399
carry with you a unified State as you go through your day

196
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:53,460
and then as you keep doing the mindfulness practice and you start seeing all those things you start seeing

197
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:59,100
what's wholesome and unwholesome mind streams seeing that you have faith and

198
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:04,200
confidence seeing the strength of the mindfulness seeing the strength of unification

199
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,840
then then there arises wisdom and one of the key forms of wisdom is to

200
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:15,299
really appreciate how valuable it is to make the choice to go in the wholesome

201
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:22,200
Direction and to avoid the unwholesome you see how it benefits you you see how much changes

202
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:28,080
when you do that you see how healthy it is and so wisdom becomes stronger and

203
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:33,659
stronger as well and you see have this wisdom that you bring with you everywhere and it helps you to make

204
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:39,360
these choices that keeps you these spiritual qualities presence

205
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,760
so now I've gone through the five so there are there's confidence there's

206
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:52,260
vitality there is awareness there's a unification and there's wisdom

207
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:59,100
these can be uh strengths that we carry with us they're they're spiritual or

208
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:04,440
Divine qualities we come along for the Buddha

209
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:11,039
these five qualities are part of the description of what

210
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:18,179
changes in a person as they mature in the Buddhist practice that these five qualities get stronger

211
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:23,580
and stronger and stronger someone is fully awakened has these all

212
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:30,120
these five qualities to the maximum strength possible so if you want to know what what is it

213
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:35,299
you know what what's it like to be in fully enlightened

214
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:43,740
they have really fully strong fully strengthened Faith confidence Vitality

215
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:51,539
awareness uh unification and this wisdom vector

216
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:58,080
and um and the Buddha he talks about these not so much something that you practice

217
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,480
but something that arises out of your practice and this is what I was saying earlier

218
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:08,640
what's the best you know when's the best time to practice mindfulness when it's

219
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:14,220
the best we know when should we practice mindfulness when it's the best option we

220
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:20,760
start seeing that there are other options that are better than what we're doing and one of them is to practice a

221
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:29,700
mindfulness and awareness that begins allowing these five qualities to grow and develop

222
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:36,900
and emerge and as they're there to establish ourselves in them to recognize them and

223
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:44,520
make room for them to recognize them and and kind of be in them and not to take them for granted but to

224
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:52,380
be present for it so um uh he doesn't say practice faith

225
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:58,799
he doesn't say practice vitality he doesn't say practice awareness he

226
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:06,059
doesn't say practice unification or practice wisdom we do Buddhist practice

227
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:12,240
the practice of recognizing what's happening our mindstream the practice of choosing what's healthy making the

228
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,940
effort to do so we we make the effort to let go of our

229
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:25,620
distractions there are there are things that we do but there's also what is done to us when

230
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:32,100
we do so and these five spiritual qualities powers are these things that get born

231
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:40,020
within us and grow and develop over time and um and it's fantastic

232
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:46,020
so practice facilitates practice supports the arising of these things

233
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:52,140
and um and they become you know

234
00:24:52,140 --> 00:25:00,120
you know they represent or Define or characterize some of the strong spiritual States

235
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:05,760
that we can live in when we do Buddhist practice I don't know if these five states are

236
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,980
inspiring to you but the alternative to those five

237
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:17,220
hopefully is the opposite of inspiring I mean there's so many you know to not

238
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:23,159
have confidence or they are worse do it be you know to be kind of have a lot of doubt about

239
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:29,880
your abilities or about anything to be caught up in you know skepticism around it all and

240
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:35,580
it's you know not so helpful to uh not to have vitality

241
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:42,480
but to actually be uh Have Your vitality drained which so much of our society these days

242
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:49,500
supports in some of the ways in which we participate in our technology and our society and the beliefs and the politics

243
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:56,100
and everything can be draining and do not be aware

244
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:01,620
be careful you have an accident next time you drive your car or lots of accidents all kinds of things

245
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:07,140
happen we're not aware to not be Unified

246
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:13,919
to be fragmented and broken and Scattered it's not good for us

247
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:19,080
and to not be wise to be foolish probably most of us don't want to be

248
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:24,600
foolish and uh it you know it's usually not a useful thing to do

249
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:30,900
in Buddhism there are no there are no sinners in Buddhism some religions have these big important heavy categories

250
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:37,200
Sinners and Saints um the the the closest the Buddhism gets

251
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,940
to it is there are fools

252
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:49,440
and uh and then the wise people so I don't know you maybe still don't like those dichotomies but

253
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:55,440
um but uh the thing about being a fool is that you can still become wise

254
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,779
and um whereas in some religions where the sin thing you know you know a sinner

255
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:06,659
there's sometimes not much help but we can always always you know

256
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:12,299
become wise in this practice so

257
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:17,940
um so there's this wonderful term that I

258
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:22,980
came up with that represents a very important Concept

259
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:29,700
in early Buddhism but translate it's my translation is

260
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:36,899
um profound generative attention

261
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:44,039
profound generative attention there's a profound way of being present

262
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:51,779
really be present for our lives mindful aware here

263
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:57,539
that allows the the emergence the generation

264
00:27:57,539 --> 00:28:03,000
of wonderful qualities within us these Divine things that can come

265
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,480
somehow inside we have these capacities and for the talk today it's the five

266
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:15,720
faculties the five spiritual Divine Divine States five strengths

267
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:22,520
of confidence Vitality awareness unification and wisdom

268
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:28,260
what a wonderful thing and if we if these are there to support us

269
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:34,080
if we want them to support us it's good to recognize them

270
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,179
and they're operating all the time and the chances are

271
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:45,900
that there's a lot of activities that you do in your daily life where these five are present

272
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:54,779
and that encourage you to consider where in your life you these are operating maybe maybe unbeknownst to you

273
00:28:54,779 --> 00:29:00,480
it could be that washing the dishes you never thought that was a spiritual

274
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:06,960
practice but in fact you have confidence that you can wash your dishes you have confidence you can wash your

275
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,659
dishes well without breaking anything you have confidence you can wash the

276
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:18,120
dishes in such a way that it feels wonderful to have the whole heartedness

277
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:25,500
of just doing the dishes and not being distracted by 10 000 things while you do it they have confidence for that

278
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:31,260
you have and you're willing to put effort into new dishes you know there's without some effort

279
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:38,820
dishes don't get done don't get cleaned so you are putting effort into it but is the effort you're making is it

280
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:44,039
the best effort you can make is there beautiful effort is there

281
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:49,620
vitality and way of washing dishes just this inspires you or you and patients

282
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:56,520
this idea to do dishes is to do them as quickly as you can get it over and you're kind of like you know multitasking and doing

283
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:03,419
but you know how you know what is it like to discover a nourishing effort in washing the dishes

284
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:09,720
what kind of awareness has to be present so you can do do dishes

285
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:15,620
that has this nourishing effort that comes with confidence

286
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:21,720
is there any wholeheartedness that you can do the dishes with

287
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:27,419
that is as wholehearted as

288
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:33,539
doing activities that you love doing that you do wholehearted because you love them and you're so interested

289
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:38,820
can you give yourself over to something that's one of the things I learned from Zen practice being in the Zen

290
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:44,039
monasteries I learned this wonderful art of giving yourself wholeheartedly to

291
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:50,039
whatever you're doing and because I did that and uh in the

292
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:55,200
monastery sometimes especially when I worked in the kitchen there I would work in the kitchen for a couple

293
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:01,440
hours and then I would go to meditate in the meditation Hall just literally walked from the kitchen to meditational

294
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:08,100
and sat down and because I did my kitchen work so wholeheartedly and just fully for the

295
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:14,820
activity when I sat down to meditate I was already concentrated and my mind was already undistracted

296
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:23,100
boom it was fantastic so to wash dishes with that wholeheartedness

297
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:28,140
and maybe some of you do it already and then the wisdom

298
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:33,659
to understand that it makes a difference how you wash dishes

299
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:39,899
if what you want just to evoke and live from the from like when Buddhist in Buddhist terminology and Buddhist

300
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:45,539
orientation from a spiritual place and allows spirituality to flow and move

301
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:52,799
through you the Divine or the strengths that come through you it makes a difference how you wash the

302
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:58,679
dishes and if it's true for dishes

303
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:04,260
it's probably true for a lot of things you do throughout the day how you drive

304
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:09,899
how you speak with your friends how you do your work how you

305
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:15,840
you know just you probably pretty much everything these five spiritual qualities are at

306
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:22,140
play and to ha and to recognize them to learn to recognize them learn to have them

307
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:30,919
make space for them have them grow and develop so that this profound generative

308
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:38,520
attention but there's a tension that that gives this profound generative capacity to do

309
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:43,799
its work that is not our doing it's not like the

310
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:49,380
ego that's making something and we're allowing something profound within us to

311
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:56,000
to emerge this is part of the gift of this practice

312
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:03,840
so I hope that made sense and um I hope even more than makes sense I hope

313
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:09,600
that this inspires you just to explore what I've said today in your daily life

314
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:15,059
and see if uh if you can discover these five qualities in your meditation

315
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:20,700
practice and your mindfulness practices you go through through your day but also in the

316
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:27,779
activities of your day um because if you do that in your life

317
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:34,039
daily life then you don't have to go to a monastery like I did

318
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:41,940
so thank you so we have about five minutes before we stop and maybe get

319
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:49,260
ready get ready for the potluck if any of you would like to ask a question or make a comment or a testimonial about

320
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:53,360
this um please

321
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:09,358
hello my name is Seoul um yeah I just have a question about being mindful because

322
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:15,260
um I like throughout the day I am sort of required to multitask

323
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:22,080
I didn't put my hearing aid in so if you could lift it up this way yeah okay can you hear me now much slower yeah okay

324
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:28,740
um so for my job I'm sort of required to multi multitask a lot so like when I'm

325
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:37,560
in the meeting I'm supposed to answer slack messages and read through email so this is kind of expected for my role so

326
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:43,580
yeah I'm just wondering how what's the best way to deal with so many inquiries

327
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:49,980
throughout the day and making sure that I fulfill my work duties as well so I I

328
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:55,200
I you know I I'm not sure what to say for you so I I what I say might be a

329
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:02,220
Miss but what I learned uh was sometimes it's possible to multitask

330
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:07,380
wonderfully um I was uh in the monastery I was the

331
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:14,400
dishwasher and you know and I did that for a lot of dishwashing the dishwashing machine and it was like multitasking you

332
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:20,160
know it was like a dance spinning and turning and doing this and that and what I learned and then also worked as a Fest

333
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:26,220
uh fast order cook in a restaurant after the monastery where I did multitasking Galore

334
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:31,980
and and what I learned was um uh don't have any resistance let go

335
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:39,599
of the resistance let go of the you know the just give myself over to it completely and um

336
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:45,720
and so I don't know if that works for what you do but just don't resist you just give yourself fully to the

337
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:52,380
multitasking you have to do as if um you're a soccer player who has to

338
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:57,660
multitask because on the field they have to pay attention to so much

339
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:03,960
um so I don't know if this look at your resistance that's what I did and that's what I found and letting go of my

340
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:11,599
resistance thank you behind you

341
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:21,119
good morning Gill good morning everyone I was wondering if you could speak to the process of feeling like you're

342
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:26,400
really riding the wave of somebody and these beautiful factors of Awakening and I always kind of think of in my practice

343
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,440
like I'm surfing the wave and then I slipped and life happens and I get

344
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,780
caught in the wake and just beat up by The Reef is this a common occurrence for other

345
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:43,260
people's practice it ain't quite bother so you have somebody you're caught the wave of samadhi and then what comes

346
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:48,480
along uh maybe their mind or life and then you trip or hit something and then you

347
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,520
 caught up in the wave and tumbled up are you tumbling at all yeah well you just get it back on the

348
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,579
surfboard and paddle out yeah okay so this is very common occurrence for everybody else

349
00:36:58,579 --> 00:37:07,020
that's the what else can you do that's it well there's one more something you can do that's important is

350
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:12,960
uh you know you tumble in life comes over you tumble in and you lose your practice or your somebody your

351
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:19,500
mindfulness and certainly start again start again but what you can also do which is important is to spend some time

352
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:24,720
reflecting what happened and learn from that and maybe there's

353
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:31,920
things you need to learn maybe there's reasons why you keep tumbling maybe it's not the maybe it turns out the waves are

354
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:38,940
kind of you know mild it's just that you're I'm not saying it's your situation but but uh maybe

355
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:45,359
um some you know someone that keeps falling off their surfboard because not because of the Waves because they're

356
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:51,480
trying to show off and to the people on the beach and after they said well why do I keep

357
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:56,640
falling off what's going on oh I'm not paying attention to the waves I'm paying

358
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:03,000
attention to the beautiful people on the beach and um and so then we learn okay I have to stop paying attention to people on

359
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,700
the beach so so you also want to learn so the more you get tumbled around by

360
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:14,760
life the more useful is a step back and spend some time reflecting on it and see what happened there and what kind of

361
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:21,900
changes what what is your contribution to that then and what kind of Behavioral changes are needed

362
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:29,579
and if someone's always falling off their surfboard you know into the waves maybe that maybe

363
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:35,539
what they need is a bigger surfboard or maybe they should stop surfing

364
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:44,220
the last one please um I find you know when things are going

365
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:51,839
easy it's it comes natural to be mindful for me but when I'm surrounded by let's talk

366
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:57,540
about like a political figure where there's hate Division and all this stuff

367
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:05,579
coming at me or I see it written on Facebook or something it's very hard for me to stay mindful I

368
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:13,440
just I don't know how to approach it I want to you know put some positive stuff out there but then you're attacked and I

369
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:19,619
don't want to withdraw from this kind of hate so I so there's many things contribute

370
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:24,780
to that but get based on The Talk today I'd like to say that it's because one

371
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:30,119
reason why you get swept up in that is because you lack confidence in something

372
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:37,380
healthy if you you lack confidence in something healthy if you had confidence in Love no matter

373
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:43,260
what like love it all there always has to be love if there's not love it's not worth

374
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:49,920
it and when there's all this hate and anger and fear of making that comes from politicians or when they're doing crazy

375
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:56,640
making things um uh if you have confidence that love should always be in everything

376
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:02,099
then if you have confidence in that then as you find yourself drifting off into

377
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:08,520
being angry you're upset you wait a minute hold it I really believe in love that's really

378
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:14,700
what's helpful or I really believe in peace I really believe in non-reactivity

379
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:21,720
that's really where I want to be centered come with me I don't want to live in a world where I'm going to be

380
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:28,200
triggered and lose my my commitment to love or lose my commitment to peace or to non-reactivity

381
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:34,920
so I would encourage you that what needs to happen is to figure is to

382
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:40,619
reflect on the deepest values you have and find a way to have more confidence in them

383
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:45,660
so that when these things come to you you're ready

384
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:52,200
because you're you you're established in that in your confidence wow thank you

385
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:59,160
okay one more but then we'll stop so you started out by saying when you go

386
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:04,920
into areas where you feel anger and negativity to kind of say is that the

387
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:11,220
best option or is that the best so so what do you do uh if you're

388
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:18,660
you're going in a direction of anger and all these feelings come up like maybe it's a relationship with

389
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:24,839
somebody and um that you know they're powerful feelings

390
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:31,680
you're absolutely so that's a whole and I don't want to suppress them I mean it's not like of

391
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:37,079
somebody who cut me off type of thing yeah yeah so I think a huge part of

392
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:43,560
mindfulness practice is in fact learning how to be present for difficult emotions and how to be present to them without

393
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:49,260
further reactivity and how to make space for them without giving in to them without participating

394
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:57,420
in them or acting acting through them so if there's sometimes you see that meditation is a fantastic place where

395
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:03,839
the volcano of anger can flow but uh but you don't participate and

396
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:10,140
just allow it to flow and but be really honest to yourself just don't don't don't keep telling the

397
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:15,839
stories of why you're angry don't review the stories just be present oh this is

398
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:21,300
anger this is a volcano of energy this is what's happening this is what's

399
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:27,420
happening this is what's happening let's feel it in the body this is what's happening let me open in the body and

400
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:33,119
feel all this what's going on this is what's happening and and you know and so

401
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:40,200
we start seeing more and more clearly what is happening as we're angry and we're making space for it as we're angry

402
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:46,920
but in this posture of meditation it's we're safe we're not going to lash out at someone

403
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:52,020
we're not going to say something that we later regret we're not going to hit someone because you're not supposed to

404
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:57,839
move when you meditate and uh and uh and then as we do this and

405
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:04,619
practice with this and be present for it we start understanding more and more deeply what's going on and what are the

406
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:10,920
inner triggers for us for this and not a few people for example with anger find out that the anger is really

407
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:15,960
a surface phenomena symptom of something deeper and so then to be able to sit

408
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:21,240
present and mindful and look and watch and observe our anger and start seeing

409
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:28,640
in the cracks of it that actually I feel really hurt or I feel really sad

410
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:34,619
that's more primary and once we realize the sadness and the hurt then it's a

411
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:40,560
whole different game and then that needs our attention too and and the fact that we're angry begins

412
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:47,819
to recede because it's not that important compared to something much more important so uh mindfulness of emotions is a huge

413
00:43:47,819 --> 00:43:54,420
part of what we do in this practice here and and learning the instructions of it learning how to be with it is uh is one

414
00:43:54,420 --> 00:44:00,060
of the great gifts of this practice and it's really essential because of

415
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:07,700
course of course in this life that we live we'll have all kinds of difficult emotions and um and so the kind of

416
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:14,119
confidence and vitality that I talked about today uh the five faculties

417
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:20,819
that confidence gets in faith gets really strong when we learned how to be

418
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:27,119
mindful and through these difficult mind States difficult states of mind we can have and we learn we've learned oh I

419
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:32,540
don't have to give into it I can allow for it I can find a way through to the other side

420
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:39,780
wow this is fantastic of course I'll choose to be mindful rather than go along with the anger or

421
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:45,660
whatever it might be does it make enough sense great thank you

422
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:52,560
okay so thank you all and so we have this potluck you're all welcome to come and since we do have a
