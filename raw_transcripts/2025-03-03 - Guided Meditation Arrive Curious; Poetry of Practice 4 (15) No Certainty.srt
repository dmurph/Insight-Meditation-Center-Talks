1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,520
morning good morning welcome welcome and even if it's not morning where you

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:14,360
are just happy to be here practicing with you all you can see from the title that was

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:21,080
posted there on YouTube that um I'm going to do a week of poetry here done

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:29,320
this a few times before there's a way in which I like to do poetry as a to point to there's a

5
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:37,840
different way in which we can engage with the teachings than the memorization of the list or trying to remember all

6
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,520
the sequence of practices or something that we've learned that's tremendously

7
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,960
valuable and I love the list I teach them sometimes but I think it's a trap

8
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,520
if we think that the only way to practice is that we have to figure something out and we have to understand

9
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,519
it all and get it just right right the less right or something like

10
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:09,799
that as an alternative to that poetry points to something that's in the

11
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:19,400
heart something that we feel our way into or open up to or um allow ourselves

12
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:27,119
to experience and know in a different kind of way than all the lists and the

13
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:33,600
instructions we need both I would say and it's so easy when uh doing a Dr talk

14
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:42,200
to feel like here are the instructions here's something to do extremely useful not the only way to

15
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:48,320
practice in fact I would say but we need a combination

16
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:55,680
so we I'll say that uh part of uh practicing with poetry is allowing the

17
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:03,560
language to touch us in a different way maybe in this way that rather than

18
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:09,239
consuming information maybe a little bit more passively it's a way to allow

19
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:16,720
language to touch us maybe touch our hearts or or maybe allowing language to

20
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,120
nourish us instead of telling us uh what we should be

21
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:27,640
doing so well that is a little introduction about this idea of poetry

22
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,760
of practice but will guide us into

23
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,879
dropping into an certain amount of settledness whatever amount of settledness is

24
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:46,280
available to you this time and then I'll drop in a poem and then there'll be some

25
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:52,360
silence and then uh for the little daret I'll unpack the poem in the way that uh

26
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:58,599
we might use it as a way to support us in our practice and certainly in our

27
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:01,840
life okay

28
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,840
so taking a moment to settle

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,280
in with our meditation

30
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,760
posture connecting to the sitting surface

31
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:40,560
whatever that might be whether it's a chair cushion bed

32
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,519
pouch wherever it might

33
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:53,439
be if you're using a back rest feeling the sensations on the back as it

34
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,640
contacts the back rest

35
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,920
for all of us feeling the contact with the buttocks as we are

36
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,560
sitting we're laying

37
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,960
down we're connected

38
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,720
supported the back of the legs

39
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:46,720
the feet resting our awareness and an easy

40
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:54,880
relaxed manner to feel connected grounded

41
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,280
we're

42
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:25,440
here it can be helpful to do a little bit more of a body scan

43
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,919
to help the body find some ease and

44
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:38,560
let go of whatever tension tightness can be readily let go

45
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,880
of without making it a

46
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:56,520
project checking in around the eyes

47
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,479
the

48
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:24,520
mouth the shoulders allowing them to drop away

49
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,000
from the ears

50
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,919
the chest sometimes we bring a certain

51
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,919
amount of armoring to our

52
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,918
experience can we allow it to soften and open

53
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:04,440
and the

54
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,960
belly allowing that to soften

55
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,479
then bringing an aliveness of

56
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:44,199
attention to the sensations of

57
00:07:53,440 --> 00:08:03,720
breathing feeling into the experience of breathing

58
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:36,599
bealing the sensations more than thinking about

59
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:42,800
them maybe there are no words with the

60
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,440
sensations e

61
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,360
tuning into the

62
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,720
experience of breathing

63
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:19,160
allowing the attention to settle or organize

64
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,680
around the

65
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,320
breath e

66
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:10,680
and we set the sense of direction as one of

67
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:19,360
welcoming whatever is arising it's already

68
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,240
here can we align with the reality of the

69
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
moment

70
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
