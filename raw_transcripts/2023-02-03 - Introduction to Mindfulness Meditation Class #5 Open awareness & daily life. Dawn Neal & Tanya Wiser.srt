1
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:43,200
so we we just still have a couple people coming in here but Richard's been reading us

4
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:03,000
well thank you and as Richard said in the chat if you have a question specific to what we're teaching

6
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,740
all right Don foreign ready

7
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:34,979
so a warm warm welcome everyone welcome back to those of you who have been with

8
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:41,159
us for some or all of the preceding weeks and a warm welcome if this is your first

9
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:50,100
time also so today tonight

10
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:57,360
my friend and co-teacher Tanya Weiser and myself are doing the fifth of a five-week

11
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:04,140
introduction to meditation course class and

12
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,420
we've been over these last four weeks gradually learning more and more about

13
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:17,220
how to be with the intimacy of the direct experience of living

14
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:26,120
watching with awareness mindfulness and mindfulness being a way of

15
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:32,400
noticing experience while it's happening in the moment much like a bird watcher

16
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:40,200
or a naturalist might notice experience what's arising in the birds and the

17
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:47,280
forest around them and this kind of learning how to pay attention on purpose

18
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,700
is process of beginning to cultivate a capacity for choice

19
00:02:53,700 --> 00:03:01,019
for Choice rather than reaction to what's happening in our minds and what's happening in our lives

20
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:06,200
so I'm going to give a very quick overview of the last four weeks we covered

21
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:12,900
mindfulness and breathing mindfulness of the body of emotions

22
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,019
and of thinking and the way Tanya put it a couple of weeks ago these are like

23
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:24,120
cocentric Rings or ripples with the breath in the center and going outwards

24
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:31,260
from there the reason that we often start with the breath is that it's always here as long

25
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:38,819
as we're alive it's changing and dynamic and it can help to build Focus

26
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:46,140
if the breath doesn't work for you and you know it doesn't the body sensations of the body or attending to

27
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:52,319
sound are two really good alternatives which brings us to the body

28
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,420
that was the focus for the second week and we talked about how the how the body

29
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:03,659
has a form of intelligence it has its own form of intelligence and

30
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:09,299
that listening to our bodies is a skill it's a skill we can develop through

31
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:18,600
mindfulness practice Sensations are the language the body speaks

32
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:25,919
and this skill of listening feeling into the sensations of breath

33
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:32,340
and body have the advantage of anchoring us here now

34
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:38,280
you may have noticed your body is always here and now the breath is always here and now no matter where our minds go

35
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:44,639
what they're up to the next week

36
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,100
was mindfulness of emotions which can range from

37
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:55,400
the uplifting to the downright awful right

38
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:03,120
emotions are a form of communication often kind of a Gestalt form of

39
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,600
understanding what's happening or at least how we're interpreting what's happening

40
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:16,740
and that word interpretation is key because emotions can be based on what's actually happening in the present

41
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:23,400
or they can also be triggered now by something that has happened in the

42
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,680
past I think Tanya used the example of seeing a glass of water on the counter and that

43
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:34,199
triggers something in the past and there's an emotional reaction or seeing something

44
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:40,440
a person's shoes and my pathway might have the same effect has nothing to do with the shoes or the water

45
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:46,320
has everything to do with that combination of past experience

46
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:52,759
being triggered by present moment emotions

47
00:05:52,759 --> 00:06:00,900
biochemically are only a 60 to 90 second process in our bodies and our brains

48
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:07,199
if we don't interfere with them they flow through and they can move through

49
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:13,680
so part of a large part of mindfulness practice is learning how to be with them

50
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,380
and let them just flow through without buying into them without interfering

51
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:27,380
with them repressing them pushing away or getting on a soapbox about them

52
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,360
and that brings us to thinking and thinking and emotion are very

53
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:40,620
closely related right symbiotic relationship unseen emotions fuel a lot of our

54
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:46,400
thinking and thinking feeds a lot of our emotions

55
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:54,600
both are true so how our minds relate to thinking

56
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:00,979
has a lot to do with how we relate to reality itself

57
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:08,039
and we have talked about this a lot over the course of the weeks

58
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:14,100
how we relate to things is critical so important

59
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:21,120
to learning mindfulness meditation and to living a life in harmony with what is

60
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:28,919
actually happening how we relate to it so in beginning to

61
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:36,120
understand thinking as something Beyond reality itself as just flits

62
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,580
of our minds it's helpful to understand there are different modes visual maybe

63
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:47,580
word or concept sound it could be like a movie

64
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:53,639
Tanya talked about this I think it was last week right and then it's also helpful to understand there's

65
00:07:53,639 --> 00:08:00,080
different types of thinking imagining remembering planning fantasizing

66
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:07,039
all of this is important because the experience of physical and mental pain

67
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:12,120
increases or decreases depending on how

68
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,120
we think about it how we relate to it

69
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:25,259
which brings me to the last sort of review point which is just like we suggest you take an outer a

70
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:31,020
posture in your body that's a combination of grounded relaxed and alert

71
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:37,740
there's also an inner posture the mood or attitude relationship to

72
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:43,339
experience that's so core and that attitude it's helpful to have

73
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:49,740
interest or curiosity kindness and the willingness to start

74
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:57,300
again over and over so this all brings us to this week's

75
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:04,680
topic which is bringing it all together we're going to teach a form of meditation called open awareness or

76
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:11,339
choiceless attention but first we would love to hear from you those of you who have been here

77
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:17,040
how your practice is going if you have questions from the past weeks

78
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:23,700
anything you want to ask about the practice right now the floor is open and both of us will respond

79
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:30,740
maybe that microphone ah yes and please help each other with the microphones

80
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:37,560
Elena can I put you on the spot to model the ice cream method of the microphone you can see

81
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,680
beautifully Done Right very close

82
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:48,440
um so it The Sound goes in through the top

83
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:55,500
was anybody willing to share yeah behind you Elena

84
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:02,940
thank you and please say your name um hi everyone good evening I'm Divya

85
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:08,279
um and I guess um

86
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:14,880
I've been coming to the sessions regularly I've been practicing meditation a little less regularly

87
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:22,860
um which I'm trying to give myself Grace for sometimes it's a five minute mindful stretching

88
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:28,980
instead of a 20-minute sitting practice um and

89
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:35,580
I feel like I don't know if it's Placebo or what it is but I do feel like it's made a big

90
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:40,980
difference in the like past two months that I've been practicing I've Incorporated some other stuff in my life

91
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:47,220
to like yoga and other things that could also be helping but um

92
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:53,760
like right now I'm going through a kind of difficult situation that I feel like a year ago would have put me in a really

93
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,160
bad place and right now I feel like I don't know I'm

94
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:04,500
like it's hard but I'm okay um and so I feel like that's something

95
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:10,920
that it's really helped me with is like put things in perspective and try to give myself a break from like spiraling

96
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:18,240
all the time so yeah wonderful it's really beautiful to hear how even just a

97
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,279
little bit of practice and the learning over the past weeks has contributed to

98
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:29,760
this greater Equanimity in this greater sense of being able to show up for whatever's difficult in your life

99
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:38,700
exactly that's great that's great I I love too

100
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:45,240
that you're um you know and this is tonight the second half I'll be talking about mindfulness

101
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:50,279
in daily life and it is mindfulness practice to be

102
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:57,120
mindful of movement so that is practice so yes yes

103
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:04,800
oh great so this is a question from YouTube which Tanya helpfully handed to me yes I did

104
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,560
I'll read it aloud can you explain the difference between mindful meditation

105
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,600
and Insight Meditation it's a great question so this is the Insight

106
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,540
Meditation Center and here we're teaching mindfulness meditation

107
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:27,000
and I guess to start with I'm going to try to keep

108
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,779
it short which is not always my strong point mindfulness meditation

109
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:39,600
is the sort of

110
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:46,920
one branch one kind of process within a much larger range of forms of Buddhist

111
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:52,740
Meditation and mindfulness meditation can become

112
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:58,860
Insight Meditation absolutely certainly but it doesn't necessarily have to be

113
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:06,180
Buddhist it doesn't have to have any religious connotations to it it's a term that has

114
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:11,279
been taken outside of Buddhism and used much more broadly to talk about the

115
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:19,560
kinds of skills that we've been teaching for the past four weeks this being aware of our own capacity to

116
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:26,160
be aware of the breath the body emotions thinking open awareness

117
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,260
so mindfulness is focused on that capacity

118
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:37,079
Insight Meditation refers to the poly word vipassana

119
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:43,500
which is to discern break apart to see clearly

120
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:49,019
and mindfulness is one key very important component of that but it's not

121
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:54,959
necessarily the whole thing and other skills and other dimensions of

122
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:02,040
meditation also come to the fore concentration being one of them and so when we talk about Insight

123
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:08,940
Meditation we're talking about it from a Buddhist framework and we're talking about it as a larger part of a Buddhist

124
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,980
path that incorporates some of these other factors in mind as well which do

125
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:20,880
come into play in mindfulness but not necessarily to the same degree do you want to add anything to that

126
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,760
Tanya that was great okay yeah I can we ask you to move over just a

127
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:31,800
tiny bit to the right thank you perfect okay I was just a

128
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:37,380
little concerned about the camera behind her head it's no longer behind your head come on

129
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,180
in please welcome hi

130
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:54,779
welcome again please settle in and we're going to move into the first set

131
00:14:54,779 --> 00:15:02,100
of instructions tonight I'll be talking at you for about another 10 minutes and then we'll go into a 15-minute guided

132
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:07,519
meditation so

133
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:16,740
I'd like you to do an experiment with me it's um kind of an exercise

134
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:24,420
so please close your eyes and I want you to very intentionally

135
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:30,180
think of a leaf like a leaf on a plant or a tree

136
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:35,519
and if you're a visualizer you can picture it but to just

137
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:41,060
think of it and hold it in your mind

138
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:51,680
and now open your eyes and what do you see here

139
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:58,620
perfect a leaf not the leaf I was thinking of was it the wreath any of you were

140
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:04,980
thinking of right so the reason I'm bringing this very

141
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:11,399
simple example is that the thought of a leaf is not a leaf

142
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:18,839
the concept of the leaf is not the physical Leaf right

143
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:25,759
so all of us probably were picturing slightly different or even very different leaves from each other

144
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:31,399
if I had been told to think of a leaf this would not be the leaf I would have thought of either

145
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,019
so that's an important distinction we're

146
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:43,800
going to play with tonight is the difference between concept and what actually arises in experience

147
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:49,019
in this case in your visual experience of seeing this leaf

148
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:54,600
now um

149
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:00,259
just notice this Leaf would you say it's big or small medium

150
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:07,260
medium yeah I think that's fair to say I saw some really small ones I had a good time on a hike today looking finding

151
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:15,438
this so now how big is it

152
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:22,500
yeah so this is a really important kind of concept

153
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,839
is the concept conceptual differentiation of comparison

154
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:34,380
right small large or four medium

155
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:40,460
so this is the large leaf right we're all agreed okay

156
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:49,380
is it still the white leaf so again it's the distinction by

157
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:57,660
comparison so now here's like really important question is one of these leaves better or worse

158
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:03,120
than the other leaf no silly question right is one of them

159
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,840
bad or wrong for being larger or smaller

160
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:15,900
not really um so the reason I'm being a little bit silly

161
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:21,000
about this is our minds do this all the time we draw comparisons between our

162
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:28,679
experiences and usually we have value judgments associated with those comparisons

163
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:34,020
this experience is much better than this experience right

164
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:39,299
or actually I wanted this experience but I've got this one

165
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:46,620
right so letting go of the value judgment

166
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:54,539
associated with distinguishing between big little medium large small

167
00:18:54,539 --> 00:19:03,299
wanted not wanted is a really powerful kind of capacity to begin to develop to

168
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:11,340
just experience the leaf as a weave not the concept in your head not the oh this Leaf this is a bad leaf

169
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:18,120
it's all twisted it's too curly whatever I'm not able to experience it as itself

170
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:24,179
if I'm doing that and just like that we're not able to experience our experiences

171
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:30,360
if we're constantly harshing on them judging them comparing them

172
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:35,640
to last week's experience or the person next to me's experience

173
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:40,820
right so

174
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:47,940
no right or wrong Leaf no right or wrong thought experiment experience for the

175
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:53,059
purpose of mindfulness meditation they're just

176
00:19:53,059 --> 00:20:00,960
arising and falling happening and going away all in real time right

177
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,260
okay so indulge me here we're going to do one last total thing

178
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:13,020
why don't you check out the space between the leaves

179
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:20,039
take a look at it notice how your eyes might shift Focus just a tiny bit

180
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:24,440
looking at the space between the waves

181
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,860
and maybe maybe notice the space between you and

182
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:37,220
all of the weaves between where you're sitting

183
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:41,539
in the space in the room

184
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:52,919
so this this is a little bit like sometimes in

185
00:20:52,919 --> 00:21:00,240
meditation we can notice the space between sensation thoughts

186
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,280
sounds breath

187
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:12,000
emotions and that can be a really helpful shift it's not that it's bad to notice the

188
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,780
leaves the objects the experiences that's totally fine and if we're starting to get snarled up

189
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:23,779
in them sometimes it's really helpful to look for the space in between

190
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:30,960
right sometimes meditation open awareness meditation can get

191
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:38,659
spacious that way where we start the mind starts getting more interested in the space in between than the actual

192
00:21:38,659 --> 00:21:45,059
objects of our attention Leaf breath sound sensation whatever

193
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:50,760
and that can be beautiful but isn't necessarily any better or worse than

194
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:57,900
noticing Leaf sound object thought

195
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:03,960
the really it's helpful to notice the difference the really important capacity

196
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:10,860
we're developing and it's like a workout in the gym it takes time usually can't lift everything right away

197
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:17,539
we're developing the capacity to be aware on purpose

198
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:23,460
and so that's the last little part of this silly experiment is

199
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:29,220
notice that you're knowing these leaves

200
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:35,460
this instruction this moment notice that you're aware that you're

201
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:40,559
here that you're present was that hard to do

202
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:46,080
anybody but knowledge no not hard

203
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,480
so that simple noticing that's mindfulness that's awareness mindful

204
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:58,980
awareness there's another word for the ancient Buddhist term for mindful awareness

205
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:06,000
another translation which is to remember what's harder for most of us is to

206
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,120
remember to do it over and over so part of what we're training

207
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:18,059
is like we remember anything else we want to remember anything else we do it over and over and over again

208
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:23,340
and it gets easier until it's practically natural

209
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:29,840
becomes a treat so

210
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:39,240
for the purpose of the meditation that we're going to do tonight eat Leaf each experience is simply

211
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:45,539
itself not the concept it's not the comparison right

212
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:50,539
and it's also really helpful

213
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:05,539
you know I think you might just stopped my battery just went out

214
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,740
um

215
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:33,260
I'm now tethered can you hear me okay

216
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:41,760
how's this a little bit better I'm actually going to hold it a little close because I don't want to change the configuration

217
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:47,539
from your face so tonight

218
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:53,159
the kind of meditation we'll be doing as I mentioned is called open awareness or

219
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:59,659
choiceless attention and it can be really helpful

220
00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:07,679
to give our minds something to do to stay in contact with whatever is

221
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:13,679
coming up in the present moment so in the earlier weeks we were focused on mostly

222
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:20,039
paying attention to say breath and letting everything else in the background or emotion and letting

223
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:25,320
everything else be in the background this week we're going to ask you to

224
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:31,200
settle into meditation using whatever anchor of attention feels

225
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,720
most comfortable to you given the other weeks you've been doing this

226
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:45,120
and then the invitation is going to be to open up to whatever arises whatever is most dominant in the present moment

227
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:51,059
at that point and when it becomes less obvious

228
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:57,900
to return to the anchor and then eventually just to kind of float and experience for a few minutes and let

229
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:04,080
things move through sound sensation thought mood whatever

230
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:10,260
it can be really helpful to use the technique that we introduced a few weeks ago

231
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:16,919
where you very softly Inside the Mind silently say a single word or a label

232
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:23,880
like thinking imagining

233
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:31,620
feeling breathing whatever it is just to name it and that

234
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:38,120
helps the awareness sharpen just a little

235
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:44,039
so let's give it a try I'm gonna switch

236
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:47,960
mics before I give it a try

237
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:17,179
okay can you all hear me okay great

238
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:25,140
so settling into a comfortable posture feet flat on the ground

239
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:29,000
seat grounded in the chair

240
00:27:32,059 --> 00:27:39,320
softening your eyes softening your tongue

241
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:46,279
and if you're comfortable closing your eyes closing them

242
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:56,299
perhaps taking two or three intentional breaths

243
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,779
really attuning tuning in to the sensations

244
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:11,159
of your body breathing maybe feeling the belly rising and

245
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:13,640
falling

246
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:26,299
feeling the chest expanding or Contracting a bit

247
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:35,640
or perhaps feeling the breath coming in at the nose or mouth

248
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,140
gentle Sensations

249
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,419
and allowing your attention to settle in your body

250
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:51,679
your life's breath

251
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:14,658
resting on the flow of in and out

252
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,840
steadying the attention

253
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:26,419
perhaps in part

254
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:33,360
by making a gentle soft mental label

255
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:39,500
breathing in breathing out

256
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:46,039
or Rising falling

257
00:29:53,059 --> 00:30:00,679
inviting inviting the body to soften and relax

258
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:08,720
The Head and the face

259
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:16,100
the neck and the shoulders

260
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,100
the arms and the hands

261
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:41,360
allowing the breath to massage the chest and the belly from the inside

262
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:47,299
softening and warming the Torso

263
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:08,460
feeling the grounding the weight of your hips and buttocks on

264
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,658
the chair or cushion

265
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:21,919
and allowing the tension to drain out of the thighs and calves

266
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:29,299
shins and ankles down through your feet and outwards

267
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:04,940
and opening the awareness to the whole body

268
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:15,799
and to the experiences arising in the moment hearing

269
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,820
thinking feeling

270
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,860
and as it feels right using a soft note

271
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:48,200
whatever's arising sound tension

272
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:55,980
warmth relaxation

273
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:07,700
noticing what arise as an experience

274
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:13,220
letting it flow through

275
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,820
from time to time

276
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:07,220
maybe noticing the space between the sound and another sound

277
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:12,440
or a breath and another breath

278
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:21,379
or any experience at all as it flows through this moment

279
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:18,800
noticing are you aware

280
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:32,720
what's obvious

281
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:40,920
receiving experience

282
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:33,599
foreign

283
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:18,020
as if you're sitting in a simple room a one-room house

284
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:26,059
the windows and doors all open

285
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:35,119
and you're in a comfortable chair the only piece of furniture in the house

286
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,660
letting all experience

287
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:50,539
move across the windows maybe even come in the door and stay awhile and leave

288
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:58,880
but nothing stays because you are in the one seat

289
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:07,079
s allowing experience to flow through the

290
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:14,180
heart the body of the Mind just like that

291
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:57,769
[Music]

292
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,559
foreign

293
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:13,820
thank you for your practice

294
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:24,079
thank you for the meditation

295
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:33,300
so we have another time for question comment sharing questions

296
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:38,300
and yeah great you want to grab

297
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:45,060
okay I'm sorry to hear that it's helpful I'm speaking of hearing if you um you

298
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:51,180
don't need to do it for that you were just saying you couldn't hear but to use a microphone

299
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:57,480
um were other people having a hard time hearing song

300
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:03,380
there's the hearing aids yeah yeah or the assistant yeah

301
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:11,280
this room also has a weird little dead spots sound wise in it I've discovered

302
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:18,619
in the past so you happen to have bad luck you might end up in one of those

303
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:27,420
was anyone able to kind of have that experience of a feeling that you were grounded in a

304
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:32,640
chair or on a you know sitting somewhere and letting things kind of come and go

305
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:38,220
were you able to have some degree of that experience in your meditation it's not

306
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:43,440
necessary not always so easy just wondering if that

307
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:48,900
um connected for you not for you

308
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:56,820
if you will not you want to go ahead go ahead did someone else sorry

309
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:02,160
I'm just gonna say that I think the um labeling that you mentioned like

310
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:09,300
labeling different thoughts was really helpful for me because sometimes like one thing just kind of waterfalls into a

311
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:17,400
bunch of other things and before I know it I'm like why am I thinking about this again so it was kind of nice to be like

312
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:23,280
oh okay I'm like imagining this and I'm wondering about this and I'm planning for this and I'm you know what I mean

313
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:29,160
and that really helped me like at least realize what I was doing in

314
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:35,280
that time yeah yeah great so identifying the different kinds of thought or the different

315
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,740
processes it sounds like was really helpful to kind of get a handle on that they were happening

316
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:46,740
great any other comments I think you you had one yeah yeah please I don't know if I

317
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:53,040
just did this this is not a very deep comment but just to say that when you when you

318
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:58,079
talked about um the muscle I think like I haven't sat

319
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:04,560
for quite a while and I was definitely sort of drifting off and it's just

320
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:10,980
interesting to observe that you know that that my muscle is a little bit out of practice and

321
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:18,540
um so yeah I'm feeling quite inspired to get back into it

322
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:25,200
yeah it's a great observation you're noticing that the conditions are different if we

323
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:30,900
don't practice for a while the conditions are different the muscles get a little deconditioned

324
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:37,760
and it's easier to wander and it's different from there's a difference between valuing something and actually

325
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:44,880
embodying those teachings and well said that's right

326
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:51,119
that's right very well said Tanya did you have one from YouTube yeah I do have a question from YouTube but I

327
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:57,619
I'm gonna answer it later because it works well with something I'm gonna address later

328
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:12,020
oh yes please Corey yeah I help each other with the mics guys if you can

329
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:23,280
uh I thought it was uh intriguing to focus on the spaces between sounds

330
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:28,500
because usually when I do practice mindfulness on sounds I'm

331
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:37,079
focusing on the things that pop in and uh generally they I notice uh

332
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:42,540
sounds pop me into the present moment but then also

333
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:47,940
evoke imagery as to what's causing the sound at the same time so and that gets

334
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:53,640
me spinning too so it's kind of does both things but focusing on the space between sounds

335
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:59,660
I noticed some sounds like train sounds

336
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:06,480
were long distances between sound and other sounds were very small apart so I

337
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:13,039
I thought it was a good I'm gonna try that more it's very nice

338
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:21,740
so did you find that focusing on the spaces helped you stay a little bit less in the discursive like oh that's a train

339
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:27,480
yeah I think that's what kind of appealed to me a little bit is that I

340
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:32,700
don't get caught up in the what's causing it and then get caught up

341
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:39,119
into it's more just the raw sound not

342
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:44,520
focused on you know who's walking who's driving or what's

343
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:49,560
you know yeah that's kind of yeah that's a good way to put it

344
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:52,640
your great observations

345
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:08,599
did anybody find it challenging hear about that too

346
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:17,339
yeah can you hear me uh hi everyone Brian yeah this is challenging for me

347
00:47:17,339 --> 00:47:23,220
um I think so for me it's the breath like focusing on the breath and if I'm not focused on

348
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:30,660
the breath then my mind just goes everywhere and then I can't before I know it I've spent

349
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:36,359
five six different thoughts and then I'm like oh that was a thought but it's been too long right so then I

350
00:47:36,359 --> 00:47:42,720
just get lost so then if I when I recognize it and then I come back to the breath

351
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:49,380
then it's fine but then I was like oh the whole point of this was to like watch the spaces

352
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:54,720
and then I lose it again so I have like three separate cycles of that

353
00:47:54,720 --> 00:48:01,200
or I just couldn't just be grounded it's like grounded for like a few

354
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,640
seconds and then gone again

355
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:14,960
um yeah I can respond you can read the question Don and um

356
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:25,079
I I think all what I want to point to Brian is you know what helps you anchor

357
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:30,839
your awareness which is the breath and that's a power right there that's a

358
00:48:30,839 --> 00:48:37,920
strength it's a skill it's really um lovely that you know that you can do

359
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:44,040
that right and um

360
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:49,140
you know sometimes that is like that no matter how much you're practicing or

361
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:55,400
whatever the mind is is just a bit of a choo-choo train

362
00:48:56,579 --> 00:49:04,619
um and what I'll kind of be talking about is mindfulness in daily life and there's

363
00:49:04,619 --> 00:49:12,599
this you know the idea of going to the gym gym and building the muscle right and

364
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:18,359
and it really is a matter of not not just the lovely idea of what meditation

365
00:49:18,359 --> 00:49:23,520
is which helps us even if we're not doing it it can because it can help us

366
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:29,220
remember but actually when we start to practice regularly

367
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:34,260
just like we start going to the gym regularly we actually do build up some

368
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:39,420
capacity a muscle the gym you know the capacity

369
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:44,359
to be aware and mindfulness and

370
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:51,000
and then what we can do as well is we don't just have to meditate we don't

371
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:58,500
just have to practice mindfulness on the cushion so it's not like we can only do grow that capacity on the

372
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:04,200
cushion but we actually can start to practice it in daily life

373
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:12,000
that you know we don't need weights we can just watch our thoughts we can notice our emotions we can feel

374
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:18,359
our body as we're walking and moving um you know I did a practice for a long

375
00:50:18,359 --> 00:50:23,460
time where I used every time I got up at my office and walked anywhere I used it

376
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:29,640
as a mindfulness practice and it really grew my connection to the

377
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:35,700
my whole chest my sense of breath and my body and it became something that was it went

378
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:43,980
with me everywhere so um I think the the encouragement is you

379
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:49,380
have you've already got some capacity which is to be able to tune into the breath

380
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:56,339
and keep experimenting and practicing more practice in more ways more times

381
00:50:56,339 --> 00:50:59,119
is that helpful

382
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:07,740
I'll just briefly add that the experience you described indicated to me that you were actually quite mindful of

383
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:14,880
going off and coming back and just give yourself credit for that because that is building that muscle in

384
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:21,900
a really powerful way because life isn't as simple as watching your breath right that's why we call it practice in

385
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:29,160
some ways it's all simpler when we're just sitting so this is a question from YouTube

386
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:34,980
when you say notice that you know it almost seems like you're asking me to be

387
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:42,300
aware of awareness and that seems impossible so could you please clarify

388
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:47,579
I'm happy to be I'm happy to clarify what I can there

389
00:51:47,579 --> 00:51:56,099
so um as Tanya was just talking about this is a process we don't start off immediately

390
00:51:56,099 --> 00:52:01,160
being able to notice that we're knowing or be aware of awareness itself

391
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:07,440
and it is the direction the practice goes as it matures

392
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:13,200
so the invitation in the little instructions I gave and then just for a

393
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:18,359
moment in the meditation was just to respond to the question

394
00:52:18,359 --> 00:52:25,520
if I ask you right now are you aware it's the answer

395
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:32,640
is anyone not aware it's kind of impossible not to be once

396
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:37,880
the question is asked right so the capacity to develop that

397
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:45,480
reflexive awareness the ability to know that we're knowing builds over time and part

398
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:53,520
by cultivating mindfulness of the breath mindfulness of the body awareness of the spaces in between

399
00:52:53,520 --> 00:53:01,200
but it's not something we can make happen I have found in my own practice asking

400
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:06,839
the question every now and then especially if I hook it to a daily life activity like Tanya talks about

401
00:53:06,839 --> 00:53:13,020
like I've gotten in the habit that every time I walk out my front door

402
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:20,099
the question I ask the question every time I'm walking back in to my apartment I ask the question every time I open my

403
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:27,660
car door and get in or get out asking the question and over months that built to now the

404
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:33,480
question doesn't happen anymore the awareness just comes because like

405
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:40,920
conditioning a muscle we can condition that capacity so it can't happen on demand for most people right away

406
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:46,260
but it can be developed I so play with it experiment with it some

407
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:51,359
people even put little um like reminders in their phone that pop

408
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:57,960
up like are you mindful right now you know comes up during the day a few

409
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:05,059
times it's a way of kind of hacking the phone to be more about bringing you into the present moment than what it usually does

410
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:13,020
so that's what I have for that I hope it was helpful great thank you Don

411
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:18,660
let's um let's go ahead and shift I want to talk about more about this thing

412
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:24,740
about daily life and mindfulness and daily life um you know

413
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:30,180
in the very first class one of the things that I talked about was

414
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:36,240
you know part of the gift of the practice is growing our capacity to

415
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:41,780
choose reducing our reactivity in life

416
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:48,300
increasing our ability to respond in life

417
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:53,400
that this is one of the huge Gifts of this practice and I I kind of think that

418
00:54:53,400 --> 00:55:01,500
um choice is a superpower you know and we grow that as we grow our

419
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:07,440
mindfulness you know the superpower so

420
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:12,780
we don't you know we can we we can talk about sitting and practicing every day

421
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:20,520
and five minutes ten minutes 20 minutes 30 minutes but when you finish a formal meditation

422
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:26,099
you don't have to stop your commitment to being aware

423
00:55:26,099 --> 00:55:33,300
you can you can keep it with you you can have a sense of

424
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:39,180
it's kind of good to be aware I like to have a choice I like to not feel like

425
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:47,660
I'm just reacting to life reacting to my thoughts being driven by my feelings

426
00:55:48,839 --> 00:55:55,619
so one of the ways we can you know kind of develop

427
00:55:55,619 --> 00:56:03,540
um or you know bring our practice into our daily life can be like Donna and I are both saying choosing an activity or

428
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:09,420
moments in our life so I'm going to invite you if you're willing

429
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:15,318
to do a little bit of play acting with me

430
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:25,200
and I'm going to ask you to do this three times three different ways so first is can you bring to mind and

431
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:30,420
you know something that you do every day for me I'm I'm going to focus on making

432
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:35,520
my coffee in the morning something that is a routine fairly

433
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:43,260
simple um but something that you really reliably know you do and

434
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:48,300
um you know so everybody got something in mind okay

435
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:54,240
so we're going to be mimes together if

436
00:56:54,240 --> 00:57:00,900
you're willing and so what I want to invite you to do is just first pass we're going to do the

437
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:06,240
same activity each time okay so I'd like you to imagine so you can

438
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:12,780
join me at any moment okay I'm pulling out my coffee machine so we're not narrating but I'm just

439
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:20,099
telling you to get you know and then I'm gonna stop talking and I'm going to show you essentially

440
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:25,920
what I'm doing right but we're not really going to be looking at each other just know that

441
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:32,400
because we're all going to be focusing on acting out our little routines so

442
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,859
join me anytime that you feel ready

443
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:20,540
okay finishing it up

444
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:30,420
okay so I mean did what you did now this time

445
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:38,058
as you do it try and be really really aware of

446
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:45,059
intentionally I'm moving my hand and pouring you so you'll do less

447
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:50,700
right just be very intentional in your own mind about okay I'm doing this and

448
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:55,859
feel it notice it just kind of bringing upping

449
00:58:55,859 --> 00:59:02,760
the mindfulness and upping a sense of experiencing your routine okay all right

450
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:05,359
here we go

451
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:52,920
okay finish up yeah okay

452
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:58,920
what did you notice was there a difference yeah

453
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:05,119
would you anybody you got the mic do you mind saying Alina what the difference was

454
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:16,460
it slowed down the process it slowed down the process and when you slowed down I was more

455
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:22,760
it's more mindful more aware more like each step

456
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:29,460
compared to doing it automatically yeah yeah kind of like mindful beautiful I

457
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:36,420
like it not so you know not not as automatically that's a great way anybody have another word or

458
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:40,760
anything that they would say about the difference yes

459
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:48,599
um yes I was making tea and on the second time I noticed that

460
01:00:48,599 --> 01:00:54,960
like I was feeling how it felt to like open the door handle the cameras Oh it's

461
01:00:54,960 --> 01:01:00,059
like a metal handle and then when I put the mug down it's like a granite

462
01:01:00,059 --> 01:01:06,780
countertop and that kind of makes a sound that I didn't do that the first time and how how often is it we don't

463
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:12,119
even notice what we're touching or hearing right because we're in automatic

464
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:18,180
or we're thinking all right so the third pass the third time

465
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:23,339
we've got the routine we've got increased mindfulness and now what I

466
01:01:23,339 --> 01:01:28,500
want you know this is about remember we're talking about a relationship to

467
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:35,339
our experience as well we've talked about the word this idea of it our inner posture right

468
01:01:35,339 --> 01:01:41,760
um I like also to think about it just wow we're relating to our experience in a particular way

469
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:48,059
there's an emotional or relational quality could be curiosity

470
01:01:48,059 --> 01:01:54,559
it could be hatred you know it could be you know

471
01:01:54,559 --> 01:02:00,000
idealizing what you know that we can bring these attitudes um

472
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:08,400
into even mindfulness right well let's invite in that relationship

473
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:15,020
that communicates Compassion or caring

474
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:20,880
like this matters I care

475
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:28,619
I care and maybe even hey I'm taking care of myself right now

476
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:36,359
I really I want to make my tea that is so such a sweet gift to myself

477
01:02:36,359 --> 01:02:42,780
I'm gonna make this tea to help me start my day so you ready

478
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:46,520
all right go for it

479
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:18,599
and finishing up gently compassionately taking your time don't

480
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:21,559
have to just drop

481
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:31,440
did you notice this time did anything change for you

482
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:38,760
I noticed myself and tasting kind of savoring maybe in a

483
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:45,420
way that I hadn't been like this idea of like oh yeah I really want to open my senses up

484
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:54,119
to receive and and you know feel the sense of you know what I'm doing and taking it in

485
01:04:54,119 --> 01:04:57,440
what did others notice

486
01:05:05,299 --> 01:05:13,619
I I notice a sense of gratefulness of like oh and thankful thanks for all to

487
01:05:13,619 --> 01:05:18,720
take care of myself kind of like it's a mundane routine

488
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:27,359
thing I do but I didn't see it as taking care of myself so I was like oh I'm

489
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:32,400
thankful for that beautiful do you mind bringing that back

490
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:38,579
to Chelan thanks

491
01:05:38,579 --> 01:05:44,880
okay so um I was brushing my teeth it's nice because that's what I do before I go to

492
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:50,819
bed and it's the one thing I can't stand not to do I like to get in bed with

493
01:05:50,819 --> 01:05:56,579
on brushed teeth and um but when we did the third part of the

494
01:05:56,579 --> 01:06:02,520
exercise and I was doing it as a treat to myself and it rather than something

495
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:09,059
that I had to do yeah I could really get into okay I love I

496
01:06:09,059 --> 01:06:14,700
love the feeling of really clean teeth and this I'm doing for myself you know I

497
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:21,599
can just enjoy it and so it was made the whole process very different beautiful

498
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:28,740
so this is this is a great illustration experientially of that the different

499
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:33,960
kind of relationships we can have with our inner experience

500
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:40,920
we did the same thing same task but the way we related to the task and

501
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:46,559
being aware of the task changed the way it impacted us

502
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:52,859
so this is what we've been trying to point to right is is that inner relationship

503
01:06:52,859 --> 01:06:59,780
to you know how are we being mindful how are we being mindful

504
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:09,599
yeah yeah just along that line um when you invited us to to

505
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:17,220
imagine that activity as an act of self-care yeah um I noticed that I also slowed down

506
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:24,960
yeah and um I also felt more emotion like it felt

507
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:30,059
like it allowed room for other emotions that I have to be felt like my

508
01:07:30,059 --> 01:07:35,880
father passed away about a month ago and I and I unexpectedly felt

509
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:42,000
sadness you know like I was allowing myself the space in that act of self-care to just be

510
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:49,700
present with with myself so beautiful rather than like a fast road kind of thing yeah yeah

511
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:55,920
so automatic pilot you know shifting out of automatic pilot into mindfulness

512
01:07:55,920 --> 01:08:02,400
right then we do become aware or available

513
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:08,099
to receive our actual experience and when we're on automatic pilot we

514
01:08:08,099 --> 01:08:13,440
don't really receive it it can't really be processed it can't really be felt

515
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:18,600
you know and it is in the receiving it and the feeling of it that allows it to

516
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:26,160
transform even it allows it to kind of move through us in a different kind of way

517
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:32,278
we end up carrying things around a lot because we don't actually let them be felt

518
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:41,420
you know or are we ruminate on them in a particular way that kind of keeps them locked in right

519
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:49,440
so now the question is where do you go from here

520
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:54,600
this is the end of the five-week series and

521
01:08:54,600 --> 01:09:01,679
you know I want to just invite you to reflect for a moment and

522
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:09,120
however many times you've been here for this series what are you more aware of

523
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,839
right now

524
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:31,500
another question for you is what do you want your practice to be

525
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:37,620
like what do you want it to look like like when you get in a relationship with somebody at some point you talk about

526
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:43,258
what kind of relationship you would like to have how much time you would like to spend together and what kinds of things

527
01:09:43,259 --> 01:09:51,600
you'd like to talk about you know like to start your day together end your day together right so what do

528
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:56,640
you want your relationship to be like with this practice

529
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:01,739
is it something that for you it's good enough to do it on the cushion one time

530
01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:07,620
a day and you know that feels like the gym enough of a gym for you or is it

531
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:12,980
like oh I actually think I'd like to intersperse it throughout my day or

532
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:18,060
you know like what what kind of relationship what do you want it to look

533
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:27,500
like and as you kind of Imagine That

534
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:38,360
what would help you create that relationship what would support making that happen

535
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:49,980
so if you're willing it would be nice to hear and to respond to you about you

536
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:55,320
know what what you would like it to look like or what you think would be supportive or helpful and then I can

537
01:10:55,320 --> 01:11:00,840
tailor some of what I talk about in terms of other things available other

538
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:07,500
practices um or I can just you know talk about them

539
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:15,860
but if anybody has any anything in particular they would like to share please find a mic

540
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:18,980
yeah great

541
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:26,520
um well I was just up visiting my grandchildren and

542
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:34,080
I wanted very much to be able to be coming from my center and being with

543
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:41,120
them in a really calm way and they are not calm

544
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:49,620
and so I I'm just I you know I what I what I did the few times where I was

545
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:55,739
just kind of like now what am I going to do what I did was I said what am I grateful

546
01:11:55,739 --> 01:12:01,140
for right now and then I you know and I could just say I'm I'm just so grateful

547
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:06,960
to be with them and that was kind of letting go of this other fantasy I had

548
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:12,600
of how we were going to hold you together not quite it wasn't quite there

549
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:18,360
but but it it helped it helped get me centered because I get out of myself

550
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:25,800
yeah and and I'm out there instead of yeah here so yeah beautiful and do you

551
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:32,340
have a sense of what would help you you know it sounds like you did a beautiful thing and what would support you and and

552
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:39,560
continuing to grow that capacity to come not be out there but to be in here

553
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:47,040
I I think that in addition to what I do which is

554
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:53,520
to sit in the morning it would be to give myself maybe

555
01:12:53,520 --> 01:13:00,900
a couple of times during the day where I just took back took myself back and and didn't get so

556
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:07,620
caught up out there and just just kind of settled back in great and I I you

557
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:13,580
know it's it's hard yeah so what you said is so lovely and I'm not sure everybody could hear because

558
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:20,580
I'm sorry but I didn't want to stop you because you were it was coming together for you right okay yeah

559
01:13:20,580 --> 01:13:26,280
but um so you you're thinking that it would be helpful to stop a couple times

560
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:34,860
during the day to kind of actually literally invite yourself to come back home yes yes yeah beautiful because I I

561
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:40,860
start off the day and then I'm gone right right at least with my

562
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:48,120
grandchildren are around and they're seven and five so what a precious thing yeah thank you for sharing anybody else

563
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:52,280
oh great I see somebody else getting a mic

564
01:14:00,179 --> 01:14:05,760
I didn't realize this was the last of the series is that right tonight is there another series coming up yeah

565
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:12,719
there'll be um yes so I can we can talk afterwards no no I'm going

566
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:19,980
to talk about that okay as part of but anybody else want to say anything about kind of yes great and then I'll

567
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:26,460
come back to your question okay because I also wanted to get tips of during the pandemic I got completely out of

568
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:32,460
meditation and I just I really have been for the last few weeks making I have to get back into it so I just came I

569
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:38,280
thought well this will get me going because it's open now and there's people here and I can't do zoom and listening

570
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:45,320
to things and sitting at home so great yeah I want some more ideas perfect

571
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:53,699
so I appreciate the question of what do you want it to look like because that invites a decision

572
01:14:53,699 --> 01:14:59,219
um and um I forget what else you asked but one of the things that I was just thinking

573
01:14:59,219 --> 01:15:04,560
or you asked what does it look like or um you know for and for me I'm just very

574
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:11,400
aware that there's a choice and there's a difference between how I

575
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:17,880
experience my inner life when I am meditating more regularly and when I'm not

576
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:22,980
and so something that would be really helpful for me would be to have a

577
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:29,600
regular Circle that I can come and sit with and you know regular talk that I can come to

578
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:35,880
at least once a week and I'm just arriving in Palo Alto so

579
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:41,880
um new to the area and hoping to find that so great

580
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:47,400
okay so I think I'll um I'm running over my time a little bit

581
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:54,140
but I'm gonna I need to say a few more things and I think it's important so

582
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:59,640
so at at IMC we have a number of different things different options I'll

583
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:06,000
start with just Thursday night because you're all here right and you're available on Thursday nights so next

584
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:12,480
week the net for the next three weeks um just in person I won't be streaming

585
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:17,699
on YouTube but um I'll be talking about establishing a practice and and so and

586
01:16:17,699 --> 01:16:23,640
I'll be here I'm kind of really wanting to respond to whatever questions and I have lots of material to share but I

587
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:29,820
also will make myself very available to what what's going on how it's going questions about the center or things

588
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:36,840
like that so um and Don and I will both be here next Thursday and so

589
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:43,800
um so that's one place to continue this conversation right sort of to learn more

590
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:51,120
um there's also um like Monday nights there's in person with a Dharma talk and a

591
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:57,080
I think it's a 45-minute meditation and then there's Sunday mornings here

592
01:16:57,080 --> 01:17:03,300
which is a Dharma talk or a like a 35 40 minute meditation and a Dharma talk

593
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:08,400
afterwards and sometimes on Sundays there's tea social tea and sometimes

594
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:15,000
there's potlucks sometimes there's occasionally there's like a community meeting so that's

595
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:22,380
another opportunity um let's see there's also I know not for

596
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:27,780
you but there's happy hour which is every night during the week at 6 PM it's

597
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:33,960
a loving kindness practice on Zoom from six to seven which is lovely it's one of

598
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:39,719
my favorite things and it's a you know combination of a guided loving-kindness

599
01:17:39,719 --> 01:17:46,380
practice and then small group breakouts so you get to talk to people from all over the world who

600
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:54,080
have been coming really for a long time to this little Sangha of meta loving kindness

601
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:59,940
and that's a lovely support that's there and then every morning Gill on YouTube

602
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:05,460
or whoever's covering for him does morning meditation with a

603
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:12,360
um like a I think it's is it is it a half hour guided meditation and then a

with Diana Clark in uh March thank you on the five hindrances

621
01:19:57,780 --> 01:20:03,300
and the five hindrances are the five things that tend to interfere with our meditation practice

622
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:09,600
so and we'll be using the Wizard of Oz as a reference point and so it will be

623
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:17,520
very fun I'm very excited and then in April I'll be doing this class again so so that's

624
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:24,239
some things that are going to be coming your way can I interject here yeah especially for all of you are most

625
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:31,260
welcome and especially for those of you who are constrained to YouTube I'll also be offering an introductory series on

626
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:36,480
loving kindness meditation starting March 11th it's a five-week series it's

627
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:42,000
much like this except that the focus is on meta kindness and compassion

628
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:48,620
cultivation so and that'll be on Zoom or YouTube that will be on YouTube and um

629
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:54,360
actually I know for a fact it'll be on Zoom I think it'll only be on YouTube after the fact

630
01:20:54,360 --> 01:21:01,380
so if you want the interaction with people you can register by looking at the IMC

631
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:06,780
calendar there'll be a link on a set on Saturday it's on Saturdays starting

632
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:13,080
March 11th and it's from 9 30 a.m to 11 A.M five Saturdays and then the

633
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:18,540
following Saturday I'm doing a half day so there's a lot of stuff happening a

634
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:23,960
lot of stuff going on um so

635
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:29,159
there was a question on YouTube which is how do we decide which meditation

636
01:21:29,159 --> 01:21:35,699
technique to use and I think the simplest the funnest way

637
01:21:35,699 --> 01:21:42,360
to answer that is to share a story about another teacher in our tradition named Natalie Goldberg and she also is a Zen

638
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:47,400
practitioner and she was sitting with tick not Han many of you know tignan Han

639
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:54,840
and she asked him how he kept his practice alive you know for all those years and he he

640
01:21:54,840 --> 01:22:01,800
smiled the rice sweet smile she says and he said to her so you want to know my secret

641
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:08,699
she nodded eagerly I do whatever works and change when it no longer works

642
01:22:08,699 --> 01:22:14,699
so the idea of what do we how do we decide what kind of practice what to be

643
01:22:14,699 --> 01:22:20,040
doing you know we've taught you a lot this was a smorgasm board of you know

644
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:26,760
meditation practices and I always like to say start with what's easiest

645
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:32,640
right you encounter the least resistance you get your momentum going so start

646
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:39,360
where it's easiest start what calls to you start what feels right and there's a lot of research on change

647
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:45,060
and it shows that you know smaller commitments smaller bites is much easier

648
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:51,659
to sustain and feel motivated instead of getting discouraged so

649
01:22:51,659 --> 01:22:58,020
um so with that we'll open up for a few more questions

650
01:22:58,020 --> 01:23:05,719
before we close yep grab the mic and

651
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:12,239
there's yeah I just wanted to say that I find it

652
01:23:12,239 --> 01:23:17,580
really helpful to tune in to the morning

653
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:23,940
fit and then the Dharma really short Dharma talk and it starts at seven

654
01:23:23,940 --> 01:23:30,120
o'clock if you want to be on time but it'll it it's on YouTube the rest of the

655
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:38,460
day and actually if you miss a day you can go back and catch up on that day and so I I think it's it's so available that

656
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:45,739
it doesn't mean that you have to be up at 7 A.M yeah that's what I wanted to say thank you

657
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:52,400

659
01:23:58,460 --> 01:24:04,260
how this has been for you if you've been coming to the quest anything you want to share about that

661
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:15,840
yeah she has a question um

662
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:21,420
I this is my first time doing this class and I attended the four noble truths

663
01:24:21,420 --> 01:24:27,000
class as well last year um and I feel like I really enjoy the

664
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:32,820
interactive aspect of it a lot um like something that I think happened a few times in the four noble truths was

665
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:39,840
actually like small breakout groups when there were enough people um and I feel like that was it was just

666
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:45,960
so nice to talk to people and share what we were going through and so so we'll be

667
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:51,760
doing that the next three weeks and the four hindrances class awesome yeah I just really I love five entrances

668
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:57,540
[Laughter] yes I'm glad to hear that they're really helpful to me I really love offering

669
01:24:57,540 --> 01:25:04,340
that so good hopefully you'll be here definitely great

670
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:13,140
I just wanted to thank both you Dawn and you Tanya this has been a really good uh

671
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:21,600
five-week class although we missed last week and we are starting to invoke

672
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:26,699
more mindfulness in our daily life it just yesterday we were at the airport

673
01:25:26,699 --> 01:25:32,159
and um situation got a little stressful I

674
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:37,440
remembered that it was a good time to practice

675
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:42,480
mindfulness and then that was that was very helpful

676
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:49,739
so I can remember another time I was um I used when I was driving more I had a

677
01:25:49,739 --> 01:25:56,159
practice of being at Red stop lights and using that as a moment to practice mindfulness

678
01:25:56,159 --> 01:26:02,639
because normally you're in a mindset where you have to be

679
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:09,620
somewhere and this red light is preventing you darn it so yeah

680
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:15,540
uh yeah so I really you asked the question of where I where I want to take

681
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:22,679
this practice and for me um as far as it will go and there's

682
01:26:22,679 --> 01:26:29,880
there's so much I'm learning that and so much unknown that I feel like it really

683
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:35,520
I don't know where it's gonna take me right now so I don't know what it looks

684
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:42,120
like I can't imagine it right so that's great wonderful yeah living on the edge

685
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:45,139
of the mystery

686
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:04,639
is that it more comments and questions

687
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:11,280
it's great it's been fun to be here with you guys it's really really nice and very fun to

688
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:16,620
teach with Don yes yeah totally fun this is our first time teaching together yeah

689
01:27:16,620 --> 01:27:23,100
and Sally's our Lifesaver and Richard our amazing recorder

690
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:29,460
who's also the great you know helper with sitting posture and encouraging you

691
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:37,500
talk to him afterwards he'll encourage you along just keep going he'll tell you so it's a team we're a team here

692
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:45,920
glad you're a part of it so um so let's see

693
01:27:46,679 --> 01:27:53,580
I'm just just a reminder that at IMC you know this place exists because of

694
01:27:53,580 --> 01:28:01,380
volunteers it's an all volunteer kind of Sangha the building was bought

695
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:06,600
by people's donations to the song God it's not you know there's nobody here

696
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:13,440
that gets paid for anything it's all all the teaching all everything so

697
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:19,800
um and member there's no membership other than your desire to you know

698
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:28,940
have a mind that's present in a heart that's available to this world so in ourselves

699
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:34,620
so to me that's a very inspiring thing and you're here and you can keep coming

700
01:28:34,620 --> 01:28:40,980
as much as you want and if you want to become more involved in the center there's lots of opportunities for

701
01:28:40,980 --> 01:28:47,639
volunteering so that was helpful for me when I came here I liked having a

702
01:28:47,639 --> 01:28:55,440
I don't know it made me comfortable to have a job right and like I felt like a little bit more like I belonged so

703
01:28:55,440 --> 01:29:01,440
so let's um I have one practice of dedication of Merit I think we have time to share with

704
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:06,960
you all which is the dedication of Merit this idea is that you know everything we're

705
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:12,300
doing we're doing it for the benefit of ourselves for the benefit others and

706
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:17,340
both so without exception all beings

707
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:23,159
and that's a big topic right a big idea of all beings everywhere

708
01:29:23,159 --> 01:29:30,600
so I'd like to invite anyone who's interested to maybe name a group of people that

709
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:36,300
that are thinking about right now that they have um that they want to invoke us to think

710
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:41,699
about some people one person um said all the people in in cages

711
01:29:41,699 --> 01:29:50,820
meaning people in prison you know he wanted us to think about them and um so is there any group of people

712
01:29:50,820 --> 01:29:57,239
or any beings that you would like us to bring to mind as we dedicate our Merit

713
01:29:57,239 --> 01:30:03,900
here's the mic right there yeah the rohingya beakapo in Myanmar

714
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:11,100

01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:17,100

716
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:25,340
don't you people don't need to speak into it just hand it around if anybody wants to say something great

717
01:30:28,380 --> 01:30:33,900
and YouTube you can type in there if you want the name something

718
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:38,940
um I guess people who this is like a vague term but just

719
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:44,040
people who dedicate their lives to helping others in a very real way and

720
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:49,739
maybe not expecting a lot in return to beautiful

721
01:30:49,739 --> 01:30:52,340
beautiful

722
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:05,940
all these beings that have been named and everyone we didn't name may all beings benefit from our practice

723
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:11,960
including ourselves right without exception

724
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:24,139
