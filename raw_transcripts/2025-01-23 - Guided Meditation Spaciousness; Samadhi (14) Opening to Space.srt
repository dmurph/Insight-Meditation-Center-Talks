1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:09,719
so I start again welcoming you all here and to say that the journey the

2
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:16,000
meditation Journey um is a lot easier if you understand it as a journey that's

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,840
leading to a profound capacity to be in the world in a new way and it's a it's a

4
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:29,359
journey that takes us inward in a certain way um deep inward almost like we could

5
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:35,360
imagine to the the source and there we in a sense turn

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,879
ourselves inside out and then we can return to the world in a new

7
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:48,840
way and um and one way we return is it's as if

8
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:57,640
the world begins with ourselves begins in our hearts begins deep inside and how we are

9
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:04,360
as we come out of our depths shapes the world certainly the world that we see

10
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:11,159
but in a certain profound way shapes the world around us and we want to have that

11
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:18,759
shaping that remaking of the world come from a place of profound goodness

12
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:24,320
profound Health profound love or care a

13
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,640
care for everyone no one left out of our hearts

14
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,799
but to do this we have to kind of be to know that that's the journey and then to be able

15
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:42,600
to uh put aside for the time being the preoccupations we have about

16
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:50,240
the world the future the past what's happening now not to ignore it or

17
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,840
abandon it but to be able to come back in a better way and um and so

18
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:02,479
willingness to suspend the usual preoccupation of the mind for a better

19
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:08,080
cause for a really good thing and

20
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:15,480
um and so for today the so Monday I said samadi is

21
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:21,560
Simplicity and then samadi is subtleness then samadi is

22
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,840
steadiness today I'd like to contribute to this list that samadi is

23
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,800
spaciousness that we're going in word in a sense and for those of you who

24
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,000
following along here to use the breathing as the primary anchor or

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:48,120
settling movement that settles us inside to the settling place as we do that at the same time uh

26
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:54,159
we're opening up to a spaciousness that's the context that's the

27
00:02:54,159 --> 00:03:00,319
atmosphere that's the uh that uh surrounds the experience

28
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,360
of breathing and so and this opening to a

29
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:14,319
spaciousness it's almost like the peripheral awareness isare aware of the space and the primary focus is aware of

30
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:21,040
um this um settle place within with the breathing and it is being involved in

31
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,959
two things at once but we do this often in our life that uh we go through a

32
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:34,720
space that's either crowded or a space that's very open and we're primarily doing our task walking perhaps but we're

33
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,280
very aware that uh the that it's crowded with people are very aware that there's

34
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:46,080
space to walk in and it either one it affects us and we might not be doing it

35
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,879
so consciously that the focusing on the people or the space but it sets the mood

36
00:03:51,879 --> 00:04:00,280
it sets kind of a condition for how we're going to follow our way so in meditation also we can be attuned to to

37
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,959
the spaces around the breathing and that contributes to a

38
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:11,959
sense eventually that um the mind doesn't move when we

39
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:17,359
meditate uh when there's a lot of thinking going on uh and a lot of

40
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:25,160
concerns and preoccupations it's very reasonable people say their mind moves I lo my mind wandered away it got it uh

41
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,560
got distracted it got caught up in um something and then we bring it back we

42
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:38,320
bring it back um but as the mind gets more and more settled the idea of bringing the Mind back the idea that

43
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,280
mind goes anywhere is just a metaphor the mind never goes anywhere and as we

44
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:50,919
settle and feel the spaciousness it gives us the kind of the relief oh the mind doesn't have to work so

45
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:57,600
much and the awareness seems to be to

46
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:04,880
be arising out of the spaciousness or penetrate or or kind of in the

47
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:13,120
spaciousness itself having qualities of spaciousness light open almost

48
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,360
insubstantial so to assume a meditation uh

49
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:24,039
practice and um assume meditation

50
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:29,080
posture gently close your eyes

51
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,840
and to settle into here you might Begin by taking some long

52
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:43,479
slow deep breaths

53
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,440
relaxing in the body as you

54
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:57,560
exhale relaxing in a settling way so you're

55
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,639
settling your body

56
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,680
in letting the breathing return to normal and continue for a few

57
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:29,840
breaths to feel your body on you inhale and relax the body on the exhale

58
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:36,039
maybe relaxing different parts of the body in different

59
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,879
breaths and similarly as you exhale to soften the

60
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:08,000
thinking mind if you can feel the sensations

61
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,360
associated with thinking mind some pressure

62
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,680
tightness weight

63
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:28,840
contraction or some agitation activation of some part of

64
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:36,240
your head as you think G gently softly soften the

65
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,200
thinking mind as if you are

66
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:48,080
[Music] allowing the waves on a lake to settle

67
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:56,879
and quiet down or if you drop a pebble into a lake

68
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:04,759
waves Ripple out but further they go the smaller they become until they

69
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:12,639
disappear letting the mind the waves of the Mind Ripple

70
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,000
out and

71
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:32,399
quiet and then to settle

72
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,560
in to your breathing and if you have found a

73
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:44,600
settling Place deep in the experience of

74
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:53,720
breathing at the end of the exhale where the inhale begins

75
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:09,120
a place from which the breathing arises in breath arises and

76
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:16,880
expands and where the sensations of breathing end the end of the

77
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:33,880
exhale and not searching for that or feeling for that from the control

78
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:46,600
tower almost like having your mind deep in your

79
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:55,800
torso where awareness arises together with the

80
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,680
inhale together with the exhale

81
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:28,320
settling and then having a steadiness through the

82
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,839
inhale a steady companionship for the whole

83
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,519
length of the

84
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:47,000
inhale and a continuous

85
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,120
attending to the exhale from the beginning to end

86
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,360
and here's where you might steady your

87
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,639
mind steady your

88
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:24,160
attention so you can continuously follow one inhale one

89
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,160
exhale

90
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,440
and as You Follow the

91
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,760
inhale notice how it arises it appears it

92
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:57,279
begins grows and comes to its end

93
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:06,000
and the exhale begins

94
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,160
continues and comes to an

95
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:31,160
end and as the exhale comes to an end allow your thinking to become

96
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:43,120
quiet and into whatever quiet there is allow the inhale to arise

97
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,680
a gentle steadiness with the

98
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:14,560
breathing then become aware with your peripheral awareness any sense of

99
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,440
spaciousness any sense

100
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:27,800
of just be on the edges of breathing the edges of how you experience

101
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:33,839
breathing is the beginning of a kind of space or

102
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:42,040
openness or maybe a kind of quiet or that kind of

103
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:49,440
Stillness to whatever degree you can be aware of spaciousness

104
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,639
Stillness while you're with your breathing

105
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:05,600
it's almost as if the weather is

106
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,720
spaciousness through which breathing

107
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,079
travels e

108
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:13,120
and whatever feeling of spaciousness you have around the sensations of

109
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,000
breathing will support

110
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,600
you to not fixate on the

111
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:30,320
breathing but have a softness an openness

112
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:41,879
that more like allows yourself to be aware breathing in and breathing

113
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
out

114
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

115
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,880
for for

116
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:53,600
if you sense space around the breathing around

117
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,559
you if thoughts arise

118
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:09,559
don't be troubled by them or involved in them let them Drift Away into the

119
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,039
space and

120
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:26,039
you settled on breathing that's in the middle of all

121
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
things

122
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
for

123
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

124
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
for

125
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
for

126
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,600
for for

127
00:21:54,440 --> 00:22:00,120
perhaps rather than trying to be aware

128
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:08,480
you're more like not trying and

129
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,158
allowing there's an R to not

130
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:21,440
trying that brings forth a deep awareness spacious

131
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,600
awareness almost as if it's always there waiting for you

132
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:36,639
and that breathing is at the center of

133
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
it

134
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
for

135
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
for

136
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
for

137
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,360
for for

138
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,960
and then as we come to the end of this

139
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,480
sitting any idea of beginning an

140
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:53,559
end exists in the midst of a wide field of

141
00:25:53,559 --> 00:26:01,639
spaciousness openness Beyond the Edge es of the word

142
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:08,880
and Beyond the edges of any word any

143
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:21,679
idea in the space and the quiet between one sentence in the mind and the

144
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,880
next between one image and the next

145
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:35,159
there can be a silence a

146
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:38,520
Stillness a

147
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:48,679
spaciousness that can exist together with the noise in the

148
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:53,760
mind the activities of the Mind

149
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,360
and perhaps to sense and

150
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:10,600
feel the breathing room that spaciousness provides breathing room for

151
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:17,440
all things can be left alone just to

152
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:23,880
be and as we end this sitting perhaps we can do that that to

153
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:30,158
other for other people give them space

154
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:38,760
give them breathing room so they can just be as they are

155
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:46,039
without our judgments and desires wants

156
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:53,360
expectations the gift of allowing people space to be

157
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:59,360
themselves maybe so they can see it more clearly Maybe maybe so there can be a

158
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:07,480
different way of responding may it be that this practice

159
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,799
that we

160
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:20,200
do helps us to contribute a respectful space attention

161
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:25,320
awareness for all the people we see in our

162
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:33,519
lives as spaciousness may all

163
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:39,760
beings be happy may all [Music]

164
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:46,760
beings be safe may all beings be

165
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:51,679
peaceful and may all beings be

166
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:58,880
free and may are holding people in spacious

167
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:04,760
in his spaciousness support that

168
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:10,510
[Music]

169
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,080
possibility e

170
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:25,200
so hello and welcome to this next talk on

171
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:34,960
samadi and um one of the things to appreciate is samadi is not a practice per se it's a

172
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,000
state the practice as we do of of um

173
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,640
steuding the Mind focusing the mind being attentive to breathing letting go

174
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:51,399
of thoughts there's a lot of things we might be doing but that

175
00:30:51,399 --> 00:31:00,159
um uh that's not the samade that's the practice to enter into samade and samade

176
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:06,720
is a state it's actually a variety of different kinds of states of Mind of

177
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:14,399
Heart of body the wholeness that we can experience and um uh and then it's

178
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:20,159
important to appreciate that the practice the instructions for

179
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:26,000
meditation uh it can be State specific there's a strong orientation

180
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,159
for people to um um use as their reference point Me

181
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:38,960
Myself and mind how I am now what how this is benefiting me what's how it's good for me or if I like this or not or

182
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:45,480
if this works for me or not and there's a value in that to some degree but we

183
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:51,559
can get stuck in that kind of orientation as well and uh meditation

184
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:56,799
practice is meant to be something that helps kind of step out of that excessive

185
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:02,080
self-orientation self- referencing and one way to do that is to

186
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:07,120
appreciate that we have to when we practice Sadi

187
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:14,360
practice meditation we have to adjust of our um our

188
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:22,880
um our practice according to the states that we're in and as we go through these this

189
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,919
teachings about somebody uh in a way uh as we get further and further

190
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:34,639
along um it's I'll be talking about things that probably are not immediately

191
00:32:34,639 --> 00:32:39,840
relevant for many of you um and uh and it's appropriate for

192
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:49,159
you if you're aware of yourself to practice in an earlier phase of the instructions here uh and often uh we're

193
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:54,799
we you know the the right place to be is as a beginner or you have your own

194
00:32:54,799 --> 00:33:00,960
practice of how to get settled and and uh get started started in meditation you're welcome to go back and use that

195
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:08,320
as well um because we're often it's it's kind of like a pyramid as we practice

196
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:13,519
and we spend a lot of time at the creating the foundation and even very

197
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:18,960
experienced meditators uh start at the beginning laying on the foundation and

198
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,440
then slowly over time the building of that pyramid maybe goes faster and

199
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:30,720
faster um or quicker or something but um but we don't spend a lot of time in the

200
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:39,000
higher states of somat but so just be aware that you have to adapt yourself to how I'm teaching

201
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,080
here and um but also to participate with your

202
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,360
imagination if it's not directly what you're experiencing uh maybe it's evocative

203
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:54,519
enough for evocative enough for you to imagine uh in a sense because what

204
00:33:54,519 --> 00:34:00,559
you're what be offering is um the landmarks that will become available as

205
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:07,200
we keep practicing and you might be able to better see the landmarks in the distance having receiving these

206
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:15,599
teachings you're familiar with what's coming you're ready to recognize what is useful to take in and where the path is

207
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:21,280
rather than just being in a big territory not knowing not seeing the path um and just kind of wandering

208
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,520
around even though it might be beautiful terrain you're still maybe wondering

209
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:32,280
maybe wondering in circles so today uh I was

210
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:40,520
offering opening up to something I think very important for the deepening of somebody or the expand expansion of

211
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:47,638
somebody and that is spaciousness and um and uh I'll try to

212
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:55,560
explain this a little bit better the um that um we have an amazing

213
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:01,560
capacity as human beings for space IAL awareness and I'm sure that there's a

214
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:07,880
range of how much that capacity exists in different people to some degree it's

215
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:15,359
a capacity that can be developed and um and some people haven't spent much time developing it but it's

216
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:23,240
possible for examp for example to close one's eyes when we're in a room and then

217
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:28,599
with the uh imagination imagine

218
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:34,520
the the size of the room imagine the distance to the walls or if you're

219
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:40,560
sitting Outdoors you can imagine the close your eyes you imagine how

220
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:47,560
expansive the outdoors is if you're standing sitting on top of a hill or a mountain and close your eyes you can

221
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:53,760
still remember something about how expansive the whole Vista is and um in

222
00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:03,520
the mind and um and um so um so this idea of the mind

223
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:09,920
has spatial awareness we have a sense of what's to the left to the right maybe even behind us a little bit uh we can

224
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:16,960
have a sense of distance between us and other people some of that is a deep functioning of the mind if you're going

225
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:24,839
to toss a bean bag to a friend um some calculation goes on deep in the mind of

226
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:30,800
how of of how strongly to throw that bean bag how

227
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:39,680
high to throw it how fast how you know the angle the Direction all this uh is

228
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:44,880
incorporating a sense of the space and distance and and uh things that goes

229
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:50,359
into into our spatial awareness and so sometimes we can close

230
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:57,760
our eyes and have a sense of some kind of spaciousness around us in very

231
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:03,880
meditation sometimes people have this the sense of uh Infinite Space that

232
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:09,839
they're uh that the space that they're sitting in has no edges has no limits uh

233
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:17,079
because edges are uh a concept the Mind makes of this kind of thing of space and

234
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:22,480
so you can sit and be aware of you know with the eyes closed Imagining the room

235
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:30,079
you're in and there's a limit to that the walls but if you're sitting on top of a a mountain uh the limit of it it

236
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:37,079
maybe there is no limit going upwards out into space and so that sense of

237
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:42,880
limitlessness is um sometimes is breathtaking or inspiring or it just

238
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:48,400
kind of opens something up wide if we're in a claustrophobic space it tends to

239
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:54,079
support kind of a claustrophobic kind of preoccupation with ourselves our thoughts our

240
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:59,520
concerns and um so in sitting with medit ation with the eyes closed when we're

241
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:07,640
settled enough when we're still enough when we're um steady enough uh simple

242
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:14,400
enough there might be a time when we can start feeling the space spaciousness in

243
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:22,520
the mind spaciousness in the body a sense of kind of like there's there's a room for things and um because the mind

244
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:28,760
is not filled with thinking it's not because thinking and desires and verion

245
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:33,839
according to the Buddha is what creates the limitations and the the smallness of

246
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:41,160
the mind and the mind becomes uh expansive the mind of

247
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:47,880
awareness uh without those limitations of thoughts and concerns and preoccupations desires and

248
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:56,800
aversions so as we get more settled to begin to become aware of the spaciousness that's here uh

249
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:04,079
so that we're not not riding riding the breath uh like latching on or kind of

250
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:10,480
zeroing in in a tight laser focus but rather uh there's the awareness itself

251
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,680
starts becoming um uh um integrated or

252
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:21,000
integral to that spaciousness and the mind itself now the

253
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,960
awareness itself feels as part of the spaciousness almost and so as the

254
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:33,760
breathing comes and goes sensations of breathing come and go it feels like they're coming and going within the

255
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:39,800
atmosphere the weather the context of

256
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:45,280
spaciousness and the kind of awareness this uh uh one way of understanding this

257
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:52,200
kind of spacious awareness it's not something you can fixate your mind on if you look at the

258
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:58,839
space in the room you're in if you're in a room or Outdoors um and try to really you know

259
00:39:58,839 --> 00:40:05,240
like stare down uh the space in the room like really focus and really zero in at the

260
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:11,560
heart of it and you're really going to you know let the space know that you see

261
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:17,160
it that kind of one point of focus um that you would have maybe for someone

262
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:23,720
you're angry with and you're just letting them know through your stare it doesn't work with um with the

263
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:28,920
space around you that it's almost like you're better off not trying to look at

264
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:34,760
the space as a point as a for the central focus of the eyes you more like

265
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:40,560
you have to relax some people when they're looking at the space in in any place at all the

266
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:46,920
natural tendency of the mind is to the eyes Roam and in the roaming the movement

267
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:52,760
gentle soft moving this is where we have some kind of inner sense with peripheral

268
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:59,000
awareness maybe of the space in the room so rather than having a central

269
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:05,400
Focus we have this peripheral focus of awareness and like the like eyesight

270
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:10,560
there's uh kind of central focus and the peripheral awareness and the peripheral

271
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:15,800
awareness is always there but it it's hard to focus on it in the way we can

272
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:21,280
when we zero in on the central Focus so the same thing as we sit and meditate

273
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:28,839
the kind of the center of attention could be the breathing but the same time we're aware

274
00:41:28,839 --> 00:41:35,480
of this peripheral space around it both are going on at the same time there's

275
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:41,680
two different almost systems of awareness operating and they both can be mutually supportive operating at the

276
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:49,440
same time but in order to do this the mind has to be quiet enough still enough

277
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,880
settled enough and that's the work of getting

278
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:01,400
developing the subtleness and that allows the spaciousness to start to come

279
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:09,400
the Buddha sometimes called this an expansive mind Maha the expansive uh because the mind

280
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:16,560
itself feels like it's starting to lots of room for the Mind rather the Mind caught and preoccupied by something the

281
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:24,559
mind the mind that's not caught opens up and relaxes and expensive and this spacious awareness

282
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:32,480
peripheral awareness as we do subtle and steady on the breathing uh makes

283
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:39,480
possible uh the state of some that are going to arise and that's will be the

284
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:45,119
focus for to oh not that exactly thing but tomorrow I'll talk a little bit

285
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:52,800
about um what begins to become possible with uh this settling and focus on

286
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,520
breathing that becomes possible as we begin opening to the spacious

287
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:05,240
in the meantime until tomorrow I'd encourage you uh to look

288
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:12,720
for occasions where you can settle back to appreciate the spaciousness the space

289
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:19,559
the wide space around you probably it works better Outdoors U but you know some places like

290
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:25,839
here at IMC there's a really high ceiling and uh and that and so just looking up toward the space you're

291
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:31,240
ceiling that itself does something to the Mind see if you can appreciate take

292
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:38,079
time have tea look around open to the spaciousness if you're lucky enough to live in a place where it's wide open

293
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:43,119
space of some maybe a city park or a

294
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:48,880
Hilltop or something uh spend the day

295
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:54,079
specializing on on uh becoming aware of open space

296
00:43:54,079 --> 00:44:02,119
all around you so that that might help you to find that in meditation as

297
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:09,119
well so thank you very much and um we'll continue tomorrow and tomorrow we'll do

298
