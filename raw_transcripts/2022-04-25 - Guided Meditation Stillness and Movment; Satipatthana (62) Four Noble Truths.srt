1
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,240
and good morning everyone and

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,960
i'm uh warmed by

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:20,480
your greetings on the chat thank you so

4
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:27,279
today this week we're doing the final of the

5
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,160
exercises

6
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,559
the discourse on establishing awareness ways of

7
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:44,640
establishing awareness and the last exercise is

8
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,879
one of the most famous of the teachings of the buddha

9
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:57,480
the noble truths the four noble truths four truths

10
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,840
so for the meditation today the entry point to the four noble truths the

11
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:13,119
really deep one of course is our suffering and i'll talk more about that later

12
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:20,960
but the way to experience suffering the way to experience life weight experience

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:27,000
is to be able to observe it

14
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,159
and observe its changing nature not to hold on to anything

15
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:40,560
not to get fixated in our mind with thoughts ideas judgments fears about how

16
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,920
things are but to be able to be quiet and still

17
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,320
observing the change changing nature of phenomenon

18
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,840
and for those of us who meditate

19
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:04,320
doing especially sitting meditation or any kind of meditation where we're stationary

20
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,520
it's possible to use the stillness that's here to highlight the change in fact that's

21
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,040
one of the values of sitting quietly

22
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,520
is that we establish some modicum of stillness and then we see

23
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,800
what is not still for someone maybe who has

24
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,920
led a busy life caught up in activities that

25
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,040
they they might be surprised to sit down and be still

26
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,599
to realize how much agitation there is in their mind and their hearts and their body how much of spinning and momentum

27
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,599
there is going on and on and on

28
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,040
and and then as we get quieter as things

29
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,959
settle down we're moving towards greater stillness not frozen

30
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:09,519
not holding ourselves still but the kind of delightful stillness of when the wind

31
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,640
quiets down or the waves on the ocean

32
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,879
or the lake become still and quiet you can see into the bottom of the lake

33
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:30,000
so this delightful stillness soft gentle malleable pliable

34
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:37,360
that highlights things it's kind of like the fog has cleared and now we can see

35
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:44,400
clearly and the more still our system becomes

36
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:51,760
the more we can observe that things are changing in more and more subtle ways

37
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,200
eventually we become aware of how thinking changes all the time

38
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,439
our preoccupation with our thoughts or ideas might mask that escalate thoughts come

39
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:09,360
and go there the dime a dozen maybe even cheaper

40
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:16,799
that uh you know and i'm a diamond million they're just they they come on and on

41
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:23,280
and on and but the moment each one might seem important but they're just another one in the endless cycle of thoughts

42
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,960
that come and they go and at some point we've we've gotten still enough and

43
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,720
observed thinking enough that we're no longer caught in its grip no longer

44
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,080
seduced by its authority like this thought so important

45
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,479
and there can be a disengagement maybe even a disenchantment with this endless cycles

46
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:52,720
of thinking and we're finally willing to step back settle back into that still place

47
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,840
where we just see the thoughts are changing all the time

48
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,199
and we find a refuge in that awareness which is not caught in

49
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:11,840
thought which is not not involved in discursive thinking

50
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,080
so to settle back be still to highlight what is changing

51
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:24,479
so begin by assuming a posture meditation

52
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:30,080
posture that allows you to keep your body

53
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,960
somewhat still

54
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:42,080
stiller quieter than how you usually usually are an activity of life

55
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:52,918
some of us our eyes are very active looking searching

56
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:01,039
and to let your eyes rest by lowering them 45 degrees to the floor

57
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:06,880
so the eyes begin to be quiet still

58
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,319
not looking at anything in particular loose open focus

59
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,000
and then to

60
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,120
gently close your eyes if that's comfortable

61
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:35,120
taking a few long slow deep breaths and exhale deeply

62
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:42,400
into the stillness of the body maybe a stillness that feels deep

63
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,880
within him

64
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,840
and then letting your breathing return to normal

65
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,960
with whatever degree of stillness of the body you have

66
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:17,280
a global awareness of your body notice if there's any tensions in your body

67
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,638
tightness contracted muscles

68
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:30,720
and if there is as you exhale

69
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,319
relax and let go

70
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,198
letting go into the stillness of the body

71
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,000
the stillness that maybe feels soft

72
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:45,279
and appreciating whatever degree of stillness there is in your body

73
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,560
remembering that

74
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:05,120
remembering that the stillness will highlight movement

75
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,320
not to worry about the movements of your body

76
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:20,800
but appreciate the way movement and stillness can

77
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,839
highlight each other

78
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:45,560
and one of those movements is the movement of breathing in the body

79
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:15,440
as you exhale gently quiet your mind

80
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,760
let your mind also move to a stillness

81
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,279
becoming stiller

82
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,639
if it's if it is comfortable to do so

83
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:55,120
see if you can breathe in a restful way

84
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:06,160
maybe you find that by

85
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:13,240
resting for an instant at the end of the exhale

86
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:27,160
and allowing a restful inhale to begin

87
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,959
some forms of stillness involved

88
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:09,199
involves holding on holding on tight clenching tightening

89
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,839
resisting

90
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:24,880
if there is such a stillness in you let that be massaged by

91
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:31,360
what is moving and changing maybe with the breathing

92
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,600
movements of the body as it breathes massages

93
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,759
clinging holding on tightness

94
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:54,560
as you move to a deeper soft

95
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,759
comfortable stillness

96
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:21,840
in meditation one of the things that begins to stand

97
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:27,760
out and highlight is where we're stuck

98
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,679
where awareness thinking is stuck on things where we're attached holding on

99
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:41,000
resisting and it's a kind of stillness

100
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:48,960
which is debilitating which is draining

101
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:56,960
to see that more clearly holding on

102
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:06,080
is part of the function of meditation it's not a mistake

103
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:13,200
but it allows us to then breathe with it to observe it

104
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:19,200
from a quiet place until we see

105
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,960
that even the ways we hold on and freeze

106
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,360
are part of the changing world

107
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:42,000
and we relax and just let everything change let everything flow by

108
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,640
flow through us

109
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:07,039
settling back in the knowing that all things change

110
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,679
sooner or later

111
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:25,679
observing watching being in the place that knows change

112
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,080
the stillness

113
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,559
and then we come to the end of the sitting

114
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,399
and we know that there are many kinds of love

115
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:29,919
some loves are agitated with desire and wanting

116
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:35,919
longing and some loves are

117
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:47,120
content settled at ease a gentle warmth that needs nothing

118
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:55,120
but cares for everything

119
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:08,559
a warmth a tenderness a gentleness

120
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,640
a kindness that maybe is associated that place

121
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:21,440
within which is delightfully still

122
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,919
quiet

123
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:37,520
the place that is free of wanting and aversion

124
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:50,158
that contented love or care kindness

125
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:02,519
it's very simple ideally we would realize it's ordinary

126
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:09,760
but more often the active love the wanting love the doing love

127
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:22,799
eclipses this quieter softer and sometimes powerful kind of love that

128
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,679
flows from stillness

129
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:38,480
and may it be that our ability to become quiet and still

130
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,080
calm and settled

131
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:51,760
our ability to see more clearly may all this support our ability to gaze

132
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,880
upon the world kindly

133
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,960
caringly

134
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,278
inspired that our practice

135
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:18,320
motivates us to live and act for the welfare and happiness of others

136
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:25,000
may all beings be happy

137
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,159
may all beings be safe

138
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:36,000
may all beings be peaceful

139
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,840
may all beings be free

140
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:58,260
[Music]

141
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,240
thank you

142
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:29,840
so for this week the topic is the buddha's noble truths the four

143
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:36,720
truths and these

144
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:43,200
are uh often seen as the

145
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,960
pinnacle of

146
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,840
the insights the core insight of the dharma

147
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,240
excuse me

148
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:15,840
and now the way they're worded is that one understands one knows

149
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:23,360
dukkha as it as it really is

150
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:29,360
one knows the arising of dukkha as it really is

151
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:35,279
one knows the cessation of dukkha as it really is and one knows

152
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:41,519
the practice leading to the cessation of ducam

153
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:46,720
and um these are uh the insight that these represent

154
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:53,279
are not one two three four insights that are separate like first you know one then the other than the other

155
00:32:53,279 --> 00:33:01,279
the way the tradition offers them uh the ancient tradition is that these all happen together in an inst in an instant

156
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:07,679
they um they somehow uh uh there's a maybe you can see the singular

157
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:14,399
understanding singular insight that that then can be

158
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:19,200
kind of explained or

159
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:26,960
parsed out in these four different ways and sometimes it said that this occurs

160
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:33,200
like lightning just boom there wow now i understand something

161
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,720
some people find it very inspiring that this is one of the central

162
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:45,039
teachings of the buddha that the emphasis is on suffering some people find finally someone's talking

163
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:51,120
about suffering and stopping and taking good luck and willing to address it directly

164
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:57,200
rather than covering it over ignoring it or something

165
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:04,840
but it's not just a teaching it is an insight it's meant to be something to experience deeply for

166
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:10,720
oneself and and that might be not see seems so

167
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:16,320
interesting when you to experience duke god intimately and fully so that we could

168
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,358
know it's a rising is ceasing in the way to its ending

169
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:28,158
the and what we're seeing here is uh well

170
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:34,000
these four noble truths down through the centuries have been explained many ways it seems like

171
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,280
they're a wonderful template for all kinds of teachings and

172
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:45,358
and all kinds of ways of perceiving or understanding our our human life and that's part of the part of the

173
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:52,079
richness of them is their adaptability and uh and um and so we find if you you

174
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:59,119
probably just you find modern books in english on the four noble truths um people who talk about them and start

175
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:04,240
comparing how they say it with how they explain it and you see very quickly that

176
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:10,240
people have little different different nuances and different ways of teaching it thereby buddhists will teach it

177
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:16,400
differently than zen buddhists and buddhists differently tibetan buddhists more traditional

178
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:22,160
tarabad and buddhists from thailand might teach differently than than

179
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:28,480
teachers in the west and you see this there it's it's changeable malleable and i kind of trust

180
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:35,520
that everyone is speaking from some idea or some experience of what is most helpful for

181
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:41,520
them and then they present it that way the

182
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:46,560
the in this ancient buddhist tradition

183
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:52,640
or say this way there are two primary interpretations or understanding of the four noble truths that i think are the

184
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:59,200
most useful one is that it talks about the cause of suffering

185
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:05,040
their suffering the cause of suffering the cessation of suffering and the way

186
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:10,240
the other is that it's uh it's knowing there

187
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:16,320
has to do with the changing impermanent inconstant nature of dukkha suffering

188
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:22,079
and so we see it arise we see it cease and we see it cease in a definitive way

189
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:29,760
in such an important way that something shifts and change there's a deep kind of change in the psyche in

190
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:37,040
seeing the whole world of dukkha somehow crumble down somehow dissolve

191
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:42,400
drop away temporarily and then we know something that

192
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:49,920
is very powerful some people in the ancient world felt that the buddhist path only begins

193
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:55,359
when there's been this deep insight into deep enough insight into

194
00:36:55,359 --> 00:37:00,640
the four noble truths then when now one really knows what the path is about

195
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:06,880
because one has the personal experience of where it's going albeit a temporary experience but no one

196
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:14,960
knows and so now now we can oh now i'm on the course now i know the practice leads someplace it leads to this

197
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:21,440
this cessation of of dukkha of suffering so both of these seeing the cause seeing

198
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:28,160
the inconstant nature of it are quite powerful for people and so i'll talk a little bit about both

199
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:34,560
of them this week and but today i want to say a little

200
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:40,720
more or say something about the first noble truth and the first one is

201
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:47,680
understanding as it really is and what is dukkha

202
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:53,520
it's often we say suffering in english some people find that troublesome because

203
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:59,520
they only use the word suffering for huge traumas huge

204
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,800
catastrophizing difficulties

205
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:11,280
in the buddhist term uh the the um the literal meaning of dukkha is pain

206
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:17,359
and and sometimes it's a lot easier to understand what buddhists are talking about it if we understand be pain or

207
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:22,800
painful so for example the classic description

208
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:28,960
of what dukkha is in the first noble truth is that

209
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:35,200
birth is painful it's an adjective the reducer so birth is painful

210
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:41,599
sickness is is painful aging is painful death is painful

211
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:48,560
um uh associating with what is uh

212
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:54,000
uh unloved unlovable uh associating with what is not liked

213
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,359
is painful associating with what we love uh not being able to social what we love

214
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:05,599
is painful not getting what we want is painful in short

215
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:12,000
clinging clinging to the aggregates that we've talked about some weeks ago is painful

216
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,960
so here's a statement about all these things are painful it's not saying that it's always painful

217
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:25,040
um but uh they're so so commonly painful that i think most people if you say birth is

218
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:32,160
painful um most mothers will say yeah it was painful but that's not all it was

219
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:37,359
some people die and it's not necessarily painful to die but

220
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:42,880
but to say it's painful seems like oh yeah that's often the case or there's something painful about it

221
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:49,040
aging doesn't have to be painful but i think most people who get started getting older will discover that there's

222
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:55,440
pain involved with getting older and this very human thing of being with

223
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:00,560
what is uh we don't like being with something that is unpleasant

224
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:06,319
is painful and being with what we love and what we are close to

225
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:12,160
not being able to be close to it not being with our loved ones can be painful

226
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:17,520
and and so it's just naming a series of things

227
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:24,400
that in this human condition i think what they're trying to do is to lay out the full range of where

228
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:30,960
people experience pain emotional pain oh there's one more i didn't list

229
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:40,079
anguish lamentation pain depression despair is painful

230
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:46,079
all these things are painful so if that's all we do is to name it

231
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:52,560
then it's depressing then we can have anguish lamentation pain depression and

232
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:57,838
distress despair but

233
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,400
this is an honest a look at an appreciation and recognition that

234
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,440
this is part of the human condition and it's there's something about this

235
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:15,520
that is not that is optional it's not necessary to be caught in this in some aspect of

236
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:22,319
this pain and there's some way of freedom stepping outside of the

237
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:28,640
outside of the game of what is pain and painful there is an alternative

238
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:34,160
and that alternative involves seeing the changing nature

239
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:39,680
the inconstancy of this pain and now in constancy that it means it comes

240
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:46,000
and goes maybe it is not good news it means it's going to come back but what it does it allows us to some

241
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:53,200
point for the mind to find a place of letting go someplace where it's not

242
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:59,040
part of the game not part of the cycles of pain and

243
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:04,160
that keeps appearing and appearing it finds a place of rest or freedom or

244
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:09,440
openness or expansiveness or some other game in town

245
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:15,599
that changes the whole perspective because what this four noble truth is leading to

246
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:22,319
is a life that is free of this kind of certain kind of pain certain kind of dukkha or

247
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:28,079
suffering that comes from how we relate to or live in

248
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:34,079
this world of suffering and in a certain kind of way we stop living in it

249
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:39,839
the mind the awareness has found a place of refuge a face of place of safety

250
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:44,880
that is not separate from it all but not identified with it

251
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:50,000
and and but rather if if identified with

252
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,440
anything it's identified with freedom it's identified with peace

253
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:01,359
with happiness and so we start by

254
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:07,119
a willingness to to look clearly

255
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:13,839
at dukkha and the text says one sees as it really is

256
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:21,040
and whenever the text says as it really is what it means is we're seeing the inconstancy the changing nature of it

257
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:27,040
that's the key thing that's what makes it a noble truth not that we see suffering and suffer

258
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:32,560
more but we see suffering and somehow we're able to

259
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:39,119
have the stillness the focus the clarity of mind to see it as part of the inconstant flow

260
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:44,240
of changing river of our experience so

261
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:50,160
if this makes sense to you you might try today as you go through your day

262
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:55,760
to um observe

263
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:05,280
the ways in which your dukkha comes and goes appears and disappears

264
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:11,119
that the rises and falls surges and recedes

265
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:18,400
that if chances are your dukkha is not constant if it is constant then chances are

266
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:24,800
you're holding on to something and what are you holding on to i'm not saying that dealing with

267
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,839
suffering is easy but uh can you begin looking at it

268
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:35,520
through a different lens a different perspective than your usual one

269
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:41,680
and can you step outside of the yourself almost to be able to look at

270
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:49,359
dukkha as something that's flowing changing and constant part of the stream of perceptions

271
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:55,359
that are constantly shifting and changing that sometimes comes back to dukkha

272
00:44:55,359 --> 00:45:02,720
but then flits away and

273
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:07,920
to begin kind of breaking up the solidity of everything

274
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:13,760
and into the flow the stream of experience and

275
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:21,280
so um if that if looking at dukkha today is too much for you of course you can stop don't don't

276
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:27,280
do it too much but if to understand what we're going to do the

277
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:33,599
next for the rest of the week this very important topic you might see if you can

278
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:40,400
gaze upon your duke in a new way and see what happens

279
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:47,839
so thank you and very much and i look forward to meeting here again tomorrow
