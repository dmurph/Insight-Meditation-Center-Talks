1
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:15,380
so good morning and um

2
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:21,200
the um foreign

3
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:28,560
for the dark little Dharma talks this week is loving kindness is Mehta

4
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:35,220
and I thought I would offer you a guided meditation on meta that Maybe

5
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:41,339
brought you in to one way to do it the practice

6
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:46,620
and it's meant to be a very simple practice it's meant to be um

7
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:53,839
what I want to offer and it's best not to try too hard

8
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:59,720
to relax and and to um

9
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:08,220
and to uh just kind of feel

10
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:18,600
the tenderness inside so to take a meditation posture

11
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,500
and

12
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,279
gently close your eyes

13
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:47,640
and perhaps there's a way that you can gentle your insights

14
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,860
gentle yourself into your body

15
00:11:53,459 --> 00:12:00,540
if you're agitated if you have a lot of energy or concerns

16
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:07,680
no worry perhaps take a moment to feel

17
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:16,140
your body against whatever surface it's resting on your cushion your chair your bed on the

18
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:23,120
floor and feel the solidity of that contact

19
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:46,860
and taking a few long slow deep breaths and as you exhale

20
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:52,860
see if you can Release Yourself to the pull of gravity

21
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:59,240
in those places where the body is touching a surface

22
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:07,160
if you're sitting upright stay upright

23
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:13,079
but settle firmly into the place where you

24
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:17,000
are in contact with the surface

25
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,500
so there's a kind of definitiveness to being here

26
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:36,200
and this place you are recognizing that you are here

27
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:44,180
and then letting your breathing return to normal

28
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:59,220
and on the inhale recognize that you're here now at this

29
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:05,100
time then an inhale only happens in the

30
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,759
present moment

31
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:21,660
establishing yourself here at this time where this valuable important function

32
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:28,100
of breathing is occurring

33
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:46,220
and rather than having the mind there and then

34
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:54,079
to begin to settle the mind Here and Now

35
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:11,000
now as you breathe in here as you exhale

36
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,699
in here as you exhale to relax your body

37
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:30,420
to go through the body and relax the face the shoulders

38
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,220
the chest and the belly

39
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:21,120
and as you continue to feel any the energy of your mind any agitation

40
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,339
pressure tension

41
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:32,240
pulling or tightening associated with the mind

42
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:39,779
and as you exhale perhaps you can relax and soften the

43
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:46,800
mind maybe imagining it's like a wave

44
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:52,560
that Smooths out to the

45
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:59,759
mind becomes a wide flat surface of a peaceful Lake

46
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:05,179
and the waves of thinking become quieter

47
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:33,020
and then to search inside yourself

48
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:38,640
for some place where you feel in inner warmth

49
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:47,840
or an inner tenderness may be associated with a heart area

50
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:55,340
a place where things are gentle and peaceful

51
00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:02,539
maybe it's also a place that feels a bit vulnerable

52
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:16,080
maybe it's a place where you associate with love or compassion kindness

53
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:22,380
not as an idea but when it's strong for you the place

54
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:28,940
in your body that it vibrates or is activated

55
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:39,500
and feeling that place that it might be tender or warm

56
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:45,259
as you breathe breathe through it

57
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,039
breathe with it

58
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:11,660
breathing in now with this warm tender place

59
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:21,980
breathing out through it or with it here and in this place

60
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:30,900
and if you feel no warmth or tenderness now that's fine

61
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:38,419
but you might see if you can remember a time in your life well you did feel that

62
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:46,940
or think about a person or a being it's easy for you to feel

63
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:54,799
great appreciation or Delight love

64
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:06,240
and then is there a place in your body that somehow is associated

65
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,039
with how you feel in this way

66
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:26,120
and perhaps from this tender place or soft warm place

67
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:37,500
you can appreciate yourself and how it might be possible to have

68
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:46,279
this warmth love or kindness spread through your body

69
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:52,880
even though if it doesn't do that just the idea that it could

70
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,640
it's a potential can be inspiring and

71
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:07,679
inspiring for you to stay close intimate with this place of warmth and

72
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,519
tenderness inside

73
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:22,679
and maybe you can feel some inner capacity however simple and

74
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:28,940
slight it might be for kindness

75
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:37,940
for maybe a gentle kindness or a warm kindness

76
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:42,799
or a sense of good will

77
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:49,399
ingness for a few moments to suspend

78
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,159
other attitudes ideas

79
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,580
for these moments

80
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:09,960
to connect to what's inside that has a quality of Good Will or

81
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:18,080
kindness breathe with it

82
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:32,659
and as you exhale imagine that that good will

83
00:23:32,659 --> 00:23:40,100
radiates outwards like a light bulb shining in all directions

84
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,659
and as it shines and radiates it passes

85
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:52,940
outwards through your whole body

86
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,760
like a light is turned on or

87
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:05,179
a wonderful warmth is turned on

88
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,260
and spreads through your body

89
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:47,039
and perhaps as you exhale imagine that this radiance spreads out

90
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:51,679
from you out into the world

91
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:15,260
almost as if your breathing begins in the place of warmth or kindness

92
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:24,840
expands as you breathe in in spreads outwards

93
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:30,620
as you exhale

94
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:50,960
allowing the thinking mind to become quieter and stellar

95
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,299
so you can better feel and sense and imagine

96
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:07,559
your good will your kindness encompassing more and more of the world

97
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:15,440
radiating outwards in all directions radiating spreading

98
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,539
being transmitted out

99
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,760
on the gentle waves of exhale

100
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:35,340
you might think of having a small half smile

101
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:40,279
turning up the corners of your mouth just a teeny bit

102
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:48,960
and if there's any slight Delight or joy that comes with

103
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,600
doing that or slight pleasure

104
00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:01,740
maybe let that Mingle with your kindness your good will

105
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:08,580
your meta that radiates out from you in all

106
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,880
directions

107
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:26,720
imagining that you are you're warmth your kindness as it spreads

108
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,580
brings a sense of peace and warmth and love

109
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:36,860
to every being touches

110
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:43,460
like the morning sun that when it shines

111
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:50,539
begins to warm up the creatures that feel its rays

112
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:47,820
and if it helps the thinking mind be quieter and if it helps you to stay more in this

113
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:54,600
meditation on the exhale you can very gently softly

114
00:29:54,600 --> 00:30:02,159
say a word like love or meta

115
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,179
or kindness

116
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,658
with a word being kind of a pointer or fuel

117
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:20,720
for the sense of Good Will that radiates from you

118
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:26,480
from the tenderness Within

119
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:20,820
as you breathe in to open and expand the place of warmth

120
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,360
Within

121
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:33,320
and as you exhale to let that open warmth

122
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:41,480
bread and radiate outwards through your body into the world

123
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:49,460
an abundance of Love spilling out in all directions

124
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,920
breathing in and breathing out

125
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:20,059
radiating whatever sense of

126
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:25,320
care appreciation

127
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:31,700
you have for this world of beings for others

128
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:38,579
putting aside for now any other more complicated relationships

129
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:44,720
to people just for the Simplicity of now

130
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:54,200
your own good will your own love is so precious so valuable

131
00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:03,680
give yourself a chance to feel it and be with it breathe with it

132
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:50,359
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

133
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:58,940
take a few moments to reflect

134
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:05,180
on how this meditation has been for you

135
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:13,578
and how it might suggest or Inspire or

136
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:19,440
a way to enter the world with greater

137
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:25,880
kindness Greater Love or good will

138
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:31,880
and how as you get up and go about your day

139
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:41,660
how you might enact in small ways and big ways

140
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:48,240
greater expressions and have kindness and good will

141
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:53,640
care meta

142
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:01,460
for the people around you for the world around you

143
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:10,280
not just leaving it to chance that you'll be a kind person today

144
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:18,500
but to think about small or big ways that you might actually do this today

145
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:39,960
and then to wish that this be so

146
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:44,180
and may we live in such a way

147
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:50,880
that we contribute to the welfare and happiness of all beings

148
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:58,640
may all beings be happy may all beings

149
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:07,940
be safe and healthy may all beings everywhere be free

150
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:20,949
foreign [Music]

151
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:34,320
teachings of the Buddha there's a record of a conversation of someone

152
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:41,040
coming to the Buddha and with a great enthusiasm for mindfulness

153
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:46,619
and said that um when people practice mindfulness then

154
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:52,800
everything goes better for them everything is works out well for people who are mindful

155
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,500
and the Buddha said actually it's a little different

156
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:04,380
it's when people have mindfulness and loving kindness that everything goes

157
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:10,460
well that everything is is good in a certain way

158
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:18,240
and so it's remarkable that the Buddha to emphasize so much mindfulness really brought in loving kindness as a

159
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:26,640
companion as a partner to a mindfulness and it's a experience of many uh

160
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:32,480
certainly I've heard this from teachers fellow teachers and my own experience that

161
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:39,599
as mindfulness gets stronger or as loving kindness gets stronger they

162
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:45,540
kind of merge that's uh with the well-developed mindfulness

163
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:51,560
loving kindness seems to come along with it and with very strong developed

164
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:59,000
loving-kindness mindfulness comes along with it and maybe with mind throwing mindfulness

165
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:06,900
it kind of opens up and releases all the places were held back closed and so the

166
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:13,260
natural tenderness can be there that from which care and good will and love can radiate

167
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:18,599
and as as loving kindness gets stronger and stronger when more and more in the

168
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:24,260
present moment uh we're not thinking about other things it's so compelling to be here and now

169
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:30,660
when uh Meto is strong that mindfulness comes along with that

170
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:37,020
so the two can be seen as partners um and some people find they don't need to

171
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:42,500
practice loving-kindness in order to have it grow with loving kindness

172
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:49,800
but there's also prac the practice of loving-kindness and some people will intentionally do practice do meditations

173
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:56,760
and loving-kindness um or even go and met a Retreats or the whole Retreats where the primary thing

174
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:02,099
they're cultivating is this loving kindness or meta this warmth

175
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:07,500
and um it is um uh quite something

176
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:14,040
to have the primary activity focus of the Mind be

177
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:19,800
love be kindness and that just like you

178
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:24,900
would maybe if you're focusing on the breathing and you can get really concentrated and feel you're right there

179
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:30,420
with every breath and it feels so delightful to kind of be finally in the present moment and the mind is not

180
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:37,200
scattered and distracted and just really present so in the same way one can do that with

181
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:43,140
this with the practice of loving kindness and rather than

182
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:48,780
the primary characteristics of the mind is preoccupation or Neurosis or anger or

183
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:54,020
resentment or hurry or fear or

184
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:59,099
wanting to get things and get things done and I mean all the kind of things

185
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:05,700
that often can preoccupy a person that's go through the daily life rather than the mind being preoccupied

186
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:12,839
that way the mind is occupied with loving kindness with metha as the

187
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:18,780
primary focus the primary characteristic of what we think what we feel what we

188
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:25,859
experience in the body and what we're motivated by and kind of a gathering together just this this unification this

189
00:43:25,859 --> 00:43:31,800
Oneness with just loving kindness and it's a phenomenal thing to have it

190
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:38,520
become strong and the predominant kind of way of being is one then that's

191
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:44,400
saturated filled with this kind of Good Will and love and um

192
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:50,180
you know I I so it's just a great thing and

193
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:56,819
and um it's a way of experiencing a deep peace

194
00:43:56,819 --> 00:44:04,260
for some people the practice of and kindness is phenomenally healing that um as they get strong and begins to

195
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:10,680
kind of uh be a medicine almost for the places inside that are wounded or hurt

196
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:16,440
or afraid or closed and it's warmth hence it kind of kind of settle things

197
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:24,200
and relax things and open things for us the Buddha gave this kind of

198
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:31,920
visualization he said imagine there that there is an easily accessed

199
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:39,599
pond with clear delightful refreshing cool water if a tired parched and thirsty hot

200
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:47,160
person scorched and exhausted by the hot weather came across the pond the water would be

201
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:53,760
used to quench both the person's thirst and the hot weather fever

202
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,859
it is the same for a person who becomes a practitioner and after learning the

203
00:44:58,859 --> 00:45:03,900
Buddha's teachings cultivates loving kindness

204
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:10,859
for this person gains inner peace and because of this inner peace cultivates

205
00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:18,140
what is appropriate for the path of liberation

206
00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:23,400
so here the loving kindness can provide this cool reflection guide we

207
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:30,300
um kind of sense of peace to a person you know it's maybe a little bit uh point out that you know in the that

208
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:37,859
guided meditation I just did I emphasized warmth and here in this example the Buddha gave

209
00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:43,280
he talks about coolness and this might represent the difference between

210
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:48,380
two different cultures that English was kind of

211
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:55,740
evolved in a cold England where warmth it was really the

212
00:45:55,740 --> 00:46:02,400
nice thing in India being a very hot country at times that coolness is really

213
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:08,940
valued there so either way and uh so this practice of loving

214
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:17,339
kindness can meditation and loving kindness can be developed and the idea that one would have a designated time to

215
00:46:17,339 --> 00:46:23,880
really develop or grow or expand or I like to use the word release the care

216
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:30,839
The Good Will that's within us you know and that person would spend time doing that is a great gift to the

217
00:46:30,839 --> 00:46:35,940
world to really let this precious resource something the Buddha called a wealth

218
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:40,980
inner wealth that loving-kindness or love or Good Will and let that actually

219
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:47,400
become strong not to leave it to an accident not to leave it to just oh it'll just

220
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:53,700
appear when it does and and uh and um you know here some days

221
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:58,800
and other days is not here but to actually take time to cultivate develop

222
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:05,099
it make it strong make it easily accessible easily called upon in a way

223
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:12,200
that's sincere and it's authentic and um so

224
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:19,440
um here's one description of a state of meditation

225
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:25,619
that a very strong state of meditation so it's what maybe what's possible

226
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:31,260
um and hopefully it's inspiring to know this is a human possibility to have the

227
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:37,920
feeling of this meta be this strong as is this description describes so the first half of it is describe someone

228
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:44,400
getting um um kind of for this this situation

229
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:51,240
preparing oneself to have very strong loving-kindness and meditation

230
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:57,359
Delight is born when one sees oneself purified and freed

231
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:03,020
of greed ill will anger Revenge contempt

232
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:10,140
bossiness Envy deceit and wrong View

233
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:15,300
so isn't that kind of great the light is born when one sees and once that one is

234
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:21,540
purified and freed from greed ill will anger Revenge contempt and so forth

235
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:30,180
when delighted Joy is born when joyful the body becomes tranquil

236
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:36,240
someone whose body is tranquil feels happy for someone whose body is tranquil the

237
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:42,000
Mind becomes concentrated now with this concentrated mind

238
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,520
this is a description of very strong state of loving-kindness

239
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:53,460
one abides pervading the east with a mind accompanied with

240
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:58,880
loving-kindness and likewise the South the west and the North

241
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:06,420
above below and all around everywhere and all over when pervades the whole

242
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:14,579
world with a mind accompanied with loving-kindness extensive expanded Limitless

243
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:21,599
free from hatred and ill will even if it was just a mind that was free

244
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:28,020
of hatred and ill will ill will it be pretty good and wonderful since those are so painful and

245
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:33,839
for this world of ours but to actually cultivate the sense the

246
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:39,420
radiance the the the the fullness of loving-kindness that it feels like it

247
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:46,800
radiates and spreads from us in all directions um the east south west north and all

248
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:53,099
around everywhere kind of filling us filling the field of our awareness

249
00:49:53,099 --> 00:50:01,020
filling what seems like the whole world with it it's that strong it's not pervasive it's like a wonder you know we

250
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:07,920
say sometimes if someone has whose anger has a cloud hanging over them you kind of feel this Radiance of of maybe anger

251
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:13,260
or hostility from them it's possible to feel a Radiance of love

252
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:21,000
and kindness in oneself it kind of radiates and spreads outward it's phenomenal that we have this capacity to

253
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:27,119
get so centered and so focused and so absorbed into these beautiful beautiful

254
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:33,359
States and uh some people say no it can't be true or

255
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:39,540
it's too artificial or it's too sweet or you can't be safe in those States

256
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:45,540
um well it's we're talking about meditation state so

257
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:51,660
um we're talking about a meditation State and so what we do when we come out of

258
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:56,760
meditation is it may be different um but it's said that loving-kindness is

259
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:04,160
one of the ways to create tremendous safety for ourselves to be kind and friendly in this world

260
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:11,040
um and uh some people will feel that practicing

261
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:17,520
this way is kind of selfish or self-absorbed or just doing something for everyone's own pleasure

262
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:24,059
um but I would say that it's the opposite that we benefit certainly from it but it really allows us to go into

263
00:51:24,059 --> 00:51:29,640
the world to benefit the world to be better citizens helpful people do not

264
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:35,640
cause harm in the world to actually care about other people in a profound way

265
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:40,740
and um and this is what I hope we can have is a world where we care about each

266
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:47,119
other and live together and with Good Will and kindness and support

267
00:51:47,819 --> 00:51:49,880
um

268
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:56,539
so um

269
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:08,700
so the practice of loving kindness and um and what I offer you today is sometimes called a practice of radiating

270
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:15,540
loving kindness that's very different from the more classic way of practicing a loving-kindness which is to use

271
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:20,880
phrases and to progressively kind of do it for different categories with oneself

272
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:27,119
a benefactor a neutral person an enemy and to spread it out from there

273
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:33,480
and um both are great practices but some people find it simpler and less

274
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:39,599
complicated so you just do the radiance and and this seems to be how the Buddha taught it because the Buddha gave no

275
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:44,880
instructions for this uh you know the different categories and using words to

276
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:51,839
cultivate loving kindness so um [Music]

277
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:58,260
someone asked for a citation I read a few different things but one of them is from the middle length discourses

278
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:06,420
discourse number 40. so um I hope that you will give some

279
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:14,579
reflection today and about loving kindness and and Care Goodwill and maybe

280
00:53:14,579 --> 00:53:21,660
you can even have conversations with people about what their experience is with Goodwill and how they evoke it and

281
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:28,500
how they practice it how they spread it what the value they see in it and experiment a little bit and see if you

282
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:33,660
can go about the day with a experimenting with practicing a bit more

283
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:42,480
Goodwill than you would have been if you hadn't uh heard this suggestion

284
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:48,420
so thank you very much and uh wonderful to be here with you and and we'll finish

285
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:55,140
this series on meta tomorrow with the topic of meta and liberation

286
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:57,740
thank you
