1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,359
good morning and

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:14,040
welcome nice to be back after being gone for a

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:20,340
while so

4
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:26,420
most recently I was at Spirit Rock teaching a week-long retreat

5
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:33,500
and I'll be here this week and then I'm going off to teach another Retreat next Sunday

6
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:40,079
so it is uh poignant for me to be back I appreciate so much the opportunity to do

7
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:46,200
this teaching and to be with all of you on YouTube and see your names in the chat thank you

8
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:53,460
very much so

9
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,219
during this week I'd like to generally continue with the topic of compassion that I've

10
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:06,420
done the last few weeks that I've been here and as we begin today for guided

11
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:12,299
meditation I would like to suggest a way of beginning

12
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:19,979
that may come a bit as a bit of a surprise to mindfulness practitioners

13
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:26,759
and that is to begin by thinking rather than putting your thinking aside

14
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:32,360
and not giving it any role for this practice

15
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,439
begin with uh thinking for just maybe a minute or two

16
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:44,000
to think about how you are right now

17
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,920
not just uh you know how are you but to think about it you know what what is it

18
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,979
really and how is it and what might be a wise way

19
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:04,759
of being with yourself the Way You Are what might be a useful way to practice

20
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:12,420
given how you are what might be a useful

21
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:20,160
um what might be a useful posture to be in for meditation

22
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,260
if you're tense Maybe a more relaxed posture if you're tired

23
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,540
maybe a more alert upright posture

24
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,900
if you're aware of how you are feeling emotionally

25
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,000
what would be a useful attitude to have as you meditate

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,920
so these are all questions you can ask yourself questions that

27
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:58,200
attune yourself to what's happening for you and how to meet it in practice how

28
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:05,040
to include it or how to maybe even what to ignore at times because it's not really to the point

29
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,280
maybe if you're mostly concerned about menus dinner menus for the rest of the

30
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,000
week maybe you don't have to spend meditation thinking about those menus

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,879
but maybe there's some anxiety underneath those thoughts sort of think about and recognize What's Happening

32
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:29,420
Here and if there is anxiety what would be useful

33
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:35,940
so we'll spend so I encourage you to spending about two minutes now just thinking about

34
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:43,560
what's happening how to be with it as a way of attuning yourself dialing in

35
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,120
in preparation for meditation

36
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:40,919
and then if you are concerned with some challenge in your

37
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:47,580
life and you're thinking about it

38
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:56,400
is the thinking somehow identified or entangled with the story the events the

39
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:03,000
situation are there stories though that are self-critical or

40
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,100
involves self-pity feeling sorry for yourself

41
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:16,139
kind of thoughts do you have if you're aware consider concerned with

42
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:18,680
some challenge

43
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,000
and then see if you can step away a little bit

44
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,539
and look upon what's happening with the challenge your thoughts and take a minute or so to think about

45
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:42,680
it as an objective Observer

46
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:50,100
not identified not critical not wanting anything or not wanting

47
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:55,139
anything just thinking about it looking upon it

48
00:06:55,139 --> 00:07:02,160
objectively thinking about given that this is going on what's a

49
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:09,720
useful way to practice with it was a useful way to meditate

50
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:15,120
maybe to put it aside for now and return to it later when you're

51
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,139
more centered

52
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:57,479
and now having to spend some time thinking

53
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:04,939
let the thinking mind rest let it relax

54
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:10,860
it's done its job and me now it does not need it so much

55
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:21,680
and now it takes some long slow deep breaths and as you exhale to relax into the body

56
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:49,459
letting your breathing return to normal and again as in the exhale

57
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:54,740
softening relaxing the tensions in the body

58
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:50,360
as you exhale calming the thinking mind

59
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:14,180
as you exhale letting the Mind rest in the body

60
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:22,160
the Mind does not have to work so much let it rest in the body

61
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:33,000
with awareness centered in the breathing

62
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,620
the rhythm of breathing

63
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:36,380
so then as we come to the end of the sitting

64
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:50,340
let yourself think again freely about

65
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:56,840
whatever benefit that has come from this minute sitting meditating

66
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,360
are you more self-aware

67
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:06,799
are you calmer

68
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:17,299
are you more centered more grounded

69
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:23,539
is your heart more open

70
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:34,860
maybe you're not so aware of specifics

71
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:39,620
but you appreciate the opportunity to meditate

72
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:48,360
and imagine what it'd be like think about what it'd be like

73
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,880
to live in the world with those benefits

74
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:58,880
as you go about your daily life today

75
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,220
how might those personal benefits

76
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,778
be shared with others

77
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:19,100
so they can benefit as well

78
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:27,059
may it be to this practice that we do

79
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:32,580
benefits the world those close to us

80
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:39,500
those not so close those people we don't know

81
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:47,360
all beings may all beings

82
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:55,340
be happy may all beings

83
00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:04,520
be safe may all beings

84
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:13,799
be peaceful may all beings be free from all

85
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:21,500
suffering May beings be free of Oppression

86
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:28,340
War starvation poverty

87
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:35,778
and may it be how we live this life of ours

88
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:43,440
that we support these possibilities

89
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,080
may all beings be happy

90
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,768
[Music]

91
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:27,260
so thank you all and while I take a moment to

92
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:34,260
drink my water I'd be curious if some of you would put in the chat

93
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:39,480
what was beneficial or what was it like to spend the first few minutes of the meditation

94
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:46,799
thinking in the way that I suggested I'd like to maybe read a range of how it

95
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,980
was

96
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:58,140
so thank you for that those of you who put chats and I read a good amount of

97
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:05,100
them but I'll when we finish I'll read them all I appreciate it

98
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:12,600
so now to give some context for that so this week I'm going to continue with

99
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:17,760
the topic of General topic of compassion that I've done the last number of weeks

100
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:24,899
that I've been here and kind of fill in some of the gaps

101
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:29,899
from before so I did

102
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:36,360
um some weeks ago I talked about five building blocks

103
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:41,399
for compassion and that all the building blocks ideally

104
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:46,559
would be there when we act in the world compassionately or when we feel

105
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:53,220
compassion and so those are uh you know five A's

106
00:33:53,220 --> 00:34:00,080
so awareness Attunement appreciation

107
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:05,220
aspiration and action and

108
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:10,320
I did spend earlier the week before all that a whole week on awareness

109
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,540
different ways of being aware in preparation for looking at compassion

110
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:21,960
today I'd like to talk about the second building block which is Attunement

111
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:27,358
and um and as an introduction to this topic of

112
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:32,580
compassion and Attunement I'd like to repeat something I've tried to say

113
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:37,980
before is that if we have just one mode of

114
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:43,080
being compassionate it's easy to be overwhelmed it's easy easy for that mode

115
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:49,740
to not be the the appropriate mode for some situations we find ourselves in

116
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:55,679
some people have never kind of considered what compassion is never considered

117
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:01,680
um different modes and ways of being with suffering some people have only one mode of being

118
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:10,079
with suffering they're suffering in oneself suffering in others and it's overwhelming or it just kind of awakens

119
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:17,280
all kinds of feelings of soreness of overwhelm of of life is difficult or I'm

120
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,320
a victim you know it's so hard for me I don't know what to do and this is too much I don't feel safe

121
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:28,140
there's many kind of ways that people can be impacted by the presence of suffering

122
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:33,540
some people rush to fix it sometimes they rush to fix the suffering

123
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:39,000
in the world suffering of others is not really caring for others as it is

124
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,700
trying to stop being uncomfortable oneself they're trying to fix oneself by

125
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:51,180
fixing others and so there's many ways in which we can find ourselves in relationship to

126
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:56,339
suffering some of them are not very healthy and some of them are

127
00:35:56,339 --> 00:36:01,380
some of them we identify too much with the suffering or we receive it or take

128
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:07,980
it in in such a way that we feel challenged by it or feel like now we

129
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:14,820
have even more suffering of Our Own especially if empathy is understood to be a plain and simple feeling what other

130
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:21,960
people feel then and it somehow ties into some previous suffering that we carry with

131
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:27,060
ourselves feeling the suffering of others can trigger our own background and just

132
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:33,480
cause everything to be so much more difficult so the idea in understanding the

133
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:41,160
different building blocks of compassion the different qual aspects of compassion is start having some agency in working

134
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:47,099
with our minds our hearts in such a way that we can be with suffering in a

135
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:54,780
useful way in a healthy way for ourselves and for others and one of those ways is Attunement

136
00:36:54,780 --> 00:37:02,160
to take time to attune ourselves to the suffering that we're encountering suffering in ourselves or suffering at

137
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:08,040
others and as soon as we have the notion of we're doing something Attunement

138
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:13,200
there's a number of things that can happen one is what is Attunement

139
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,780
the other is now we're bringing some ideas some practice

140
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:24,599
to Bear to address to meet the suffering which is just not just feeling the

141
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:30,240
suffering uh in some kind of unmitigated way or

142
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:36,420
feeling of suffering in the old way in which we identify strongly with it or the suffering touches our own wounds

143
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:42,180
that we may be carrying now we're beginning to engage in agency

144
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:47,460
that oh I have some ability to do something here to question to wonder to

145
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:53,520
look at and this kind of arising to the occasion Rising kind of rising to the

146
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:59,720
occasion to meet it we start bringing I kind of um

147
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:05,180
kind of personal that keep using the word agency personal

148
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:12,839
wherewithal a personal involvement that's something different than just being impacted by the suffering

149
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:18,839
or fixing the suffering so just asking the question what is Attunement

150
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:24,780
so for this week I'd like to offer five different aspects of that I think are

151
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:30,960
important for this Attunement coming into harmony with the suffering coming into a healthy balance in relationship

152
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:37,920
to the suffering and I have the acronym for a touch for

153
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:44,640
this and it begins with thinking and then

154
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:49,859
openness to suffering and then

155
00:38:49,859 --> 00:38:56,280
um uprightness in relationship to suffering

156
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:03,060
and then um communicating that actually talking and communicating

157
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:10,859
is extremely important part of Attunement and then the last one is helping to you

158
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:17,220
know that part of Attunement is to figure out how it can be helpful or how we can serve the situation the best we

159
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:23,460
can and so the first one involves thinking

160
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:30,240
um so again this use of agency like okay here's I'm encountering suffering

161
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:36,060
maybe I feel it deep deeply maybe I Feel It In A moderate way or aware of it some way

162
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:43,560
now let me think about a little bit how is this impacting me what's a useful stance to be present for

163
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:50,700
it what background do I have that influences how I experience it and how I

164
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:57,420
think I should address it and do something with it maybe I carry with me a sense of responsibility for everyone in my family

165
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:04,200
or everyone in my neighborhood and so when I encounter difficulty it automatically means I have to do

166
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:10,920
something to fix it I have to solve the problem and to begin thinking about this this is

167
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:17,280
this really the case is there another way of being with us is there another way of experiencing it or

168
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:24,200
understanding it and what like for example I'd like to propose that

169
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:32,160
compassion has a very different it can have a very different quality if if we read about suffering in the

170
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:38,160
news or hear about suffering from the news where it's far away unconnected to us

171
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:43,740
versus being present for someone close to us who's suffering in some way we can

172
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:50,940
feel and read them and know what's going on know the context in the situation in the news we know so little about the

173
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:56,359
context we know so little about it all that there's a rush to

174
00:40:56,359 --> 00:41:01,859
relying on our thinking mind of what it means and and what the

175
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:06,960
opinions we have and the imagination about what this affects people and and

176
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:13,680
so it's a kind of cognitive uh explosion

177
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:19,140
that might not be the best source for compassion it might be the best source

178
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:25,560
for alarm it might be a best source for anger for distress

179
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:31,920
but and and those emotions can then get confused for Compassion or feel like of

180
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:38,579
course this is part of compassion to have those but to to spend some time not just being

181
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:45,740
mindful of the impact and how we're feeling but to actually think it out

182
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:52,920
that because in our mindfulness tradition we don't talk much about actively thinking having critical

183
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:58,980
thinking skills that's easy to imagine that this practice of ours does not

184
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:04,680
involve wise thinking there's there's wise mindfulness this

185
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:11,400
wise concentration that often isn't presented as a letting go of the

186
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:16,800
thinking mind and that can be do us a disservice if we

187
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,839
think that we're not supposed to think or we don't kind of we become kind of

188
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:28,560
lazy with the thinking mind thinking is a rich part of our life it

189
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:34,260
gets us in trouble into big trouble at times but thinking also is very

190
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:41,099
helpful if we can think out what does it mean to be attuned here what is a certain kind of balanced way

191
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:46,200
of being present for suffering what is the way of being in harmony with it

192
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:52,400
rushing to judgment is not Harmony rushing to fixing is not Harmony

193
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,480
uh immediately kind of feeling and getting

194
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:05,640
it preoccupied with the impact that the suffering has on us is not really in harmony so what is what

195
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:11,040
is it to be harmonious even just that question begins creating space

196
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:17,579
create a little bit of healthy distance Maybe and healthy receptivity

197
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:23,119
and um and so partly the part of this kind of ability to think about

198
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:29,760
situations where suffering is involved is to think about the common responses

199
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:37,980
that we have think question them is this really the best way is this really wise is this really coming from some place of

200
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:44,880
love or care or is it um is it appropriate for the situation

201
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:50,700
to think about a situation where they're suffering is to think about what's the

202
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:55,800
context of this suffering what's my role in it and what's the role of other

203
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:03,960
people given the context given the people who are suffering do I understand them well

204
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:09,660
or am I projecting my own assumptions on them I've sometimes have compassion for

205
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:15,839
people suffering who were not suffering but I've been in similar situations they

206
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:22,560
were in and and so I I was kind of thinking of course they're going to have

207
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:30,240
the bad experiences one of the places I saw that was with my kids when I had challenges in elementary

208
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:37,380
school and um and uh often when I also I started a lot of

209
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:42,900
different schools Growing Up So changed schools a lot so kind of a new kid in the school and

210
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:49,200
and question for example being accepted or being bullied or different things that were kind of a concern

211
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:54,599
and so simplistically to say it like when my sons went into this in the I

212
00:44:54,599 --> 00:45:00,839
mean I knew they were going to go into the playground I had this concern for their well-being oh they're certainly going to suffer they're going to get the

213
00:45:00,839 --> 00:45:06,000
same experience and so I tried to wanted to intervene or say something

214
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:13,859
but it was all based on my own history my own idea there was no compassion needed uh some of the situations where I

215
00:45:13,859 --> 00:45:20,040
was so concerned and it was more kind of legacy of my own challenges

216
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:26,579
so there's something about using the thinking mind to think out some people like to journal Journal out and really

217
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:34,140
think what's going on here in some deeper Fuller way that might not happen if we simply allow

218
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:41,940
simply rely on our capacity to be mindful to be aware just oh let's just be aware here let me be aware that's it

219
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:48,420
so to be attuned the first element of Attunement is thinking

220
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:54,060
don't overthink but don't under think so what I'd like to suggest for you is

221
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:59,160
that you experiment today with this thinking aspect of Attunement

222
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:05,000
if you find yourself in a situation where there's some suffering your own or others or something of challenge

223
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:13,200
don't rush to do something don't shut down but go get a cup of coffee go get a cup

224
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:19,859
of tea or water or um you know go for a little walk sit quietly for if you can excuse yourself

225
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:27,720
to go to the bathroom to breathe for a little bit and think it out what's going on here and what just happened and and

226
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:34,079
what are some of the elements contexts and what does it mean to be attuned here

227
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:39,839
if um and one one reference point for this Attunement how to be attuned is ask

228
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:46,880
yourself kind of the exercise how would you like other people to be attuned to you

229
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:52,020
maybe then you can get some sense of what Attunement means what you can bring

230
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:58,140
to others and then have conversations with people today about what is Attunement for you

231
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:05,099
it's not a common word so maybe you're discovering together what is it to be attuned

232
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:12,260
to the suffering we encounter so thank you very much
