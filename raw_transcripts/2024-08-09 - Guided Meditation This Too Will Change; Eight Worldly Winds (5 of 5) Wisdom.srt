1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:09,440
hello everyone and welcome and welcome to a

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,600
practice that is meant to place Us in the middle of our

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:21,279
lives and to see it through eyes of

4
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:27,800
wisdom place it in the middle of our life and to see things clearly as they

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,440
are and so there's a kind of in that call for seeing things as they are is a

6
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,840
call for a certain kind of realism certain kind of honesty and

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,680
truth about what's actually happening here and now and the emphasis to over

8
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,359
well for much of what wi Buddhism has to teach is

9
00:00:52,359 --> 00:01:00,440
to become wise about what we're experiencing here and now at this time

10
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,720
the city of wisdom and the word PA the poly word for

11
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,560
wisdom sometimes I think the way it's described and understood it could uh

12
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:18,600
maybe better be translated by the English word Insight in that it's about seeing or

13
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,640
understanding something that's right here certainly there can be AB abstract

14
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:30,960
wisdom but that kind of encompasses many things and we carry with us but Insight

15
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:39,119
is something we do here now there was a story I heard many years

16
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:45,439
ago about a Sufi story about a person who goes to a Sufi master and says I

17
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,719
have this ring and can you engrave a piece of wisdom that's always going to

18
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:56,200
be useful for me on the ring and the Sufi Master says okay come

19
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,640
back next week and the following in week the Sufi

20
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:07,520
Master had the ring ready and on it it said this

21
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:15,959
too will pass this too will pass in Buddhism it's a little

22
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:21,920
different but it's related to that this too will

23
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:28,200
change anything that is a experience that touches our senses that is

24
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:37,360
something we can think and any thinking any thought any this too will change and so these

25
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:44,120
eight worldly winds this too will

26
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:50,640
change and there's something meant to be very profound about keeping this in mind

27
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:58,200
the Buddha emphasizes this over and over again a wise person knows this too will change

28
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:03,360
and if

29
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:12,000
uh there are certain places in the world where I learned not to worry too much

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,640
about the weather when I lived in Hawaii because it changed quite

31
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,280
quickly there' be torrential downpours over it last a

32
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:31,640
minute or two and then it would be 80Â° outside and sunny this too will

33
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:37,280
change when I lived in Tennessee they said if you don't like the weather just

34
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,560
wait five minutes this too will

35
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:50,799
change and the question is not whether you believe it or like that piece of wisdom but the real Wise Way of relating

36
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,640
to this piece of wisdom is how does this wisdom how does

37
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:03,120
this understanding that this two will change how is it beneficial for you how does it

38
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:11,360
support you how does it benefit you how is it nice for you how does it

39
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,400
free you this too will change

40
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,479
so so the assum a meditation

41
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:35,080
posture and to to take some

42
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:42,560
time to notice what changes for you as you assume the meditation

43
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:51,639
posture as you tune into it and maybe make small adjustments Here and Now

44
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:09,680
to be a to tune into your body the position your body is

45
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,000
in adjusting

46
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,440
it is a way of developing and entering

47
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,840
into a living awareness

48
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,319
of here and

49
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,800
now and gently not too much just

50
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:50,520
right take some deeper breaths so that you feel in the inhale the expansion of the rib cage

51
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,560
maybe the swelling filling of the

52
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,720
belly maybe the lifting of the shoulders

53
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:39,440
and then relaxing on the exhale and if you maybe if it's

54
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:45,199
comfortable to allow yourself to Exhale more longer than

55
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,800
usual in the part that's longer than usual there's some way

56
00:06:51,800 --> 00:07:02,919
to drop deep inside the body for a deeper relaxation of the body

57
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:39,199
and then [Music] to let your breathing return to

58
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:47,759
normal and and then notice what a a simple ordinary breath is for

59
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:54,319
you and if you're controlling the breath in any way or doesn't feel comfortable

60
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,879
that's okay the emphasis is on knowing how it

61
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:05,080
is you're breathing with an open

62
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:12,560
mind almost like with a little bit curiosity

63
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,560
not judging it or needing it to be any particular

64
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,560
way

65
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:38,959
continuing for a few breaths with relaxing on the

66
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:48,680
exhale settling different parts of your body

67
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,399
releasing e

68
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,959
and then gently

69
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:46,800
notice as the body breathes it's a continual flow of

70
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,800
change changing movements changing Sensations

71
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:23,800
relaxing the thinking mind relaxing the mind that strains to pay

72
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:31,079
attention instead

73
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,240
allow the changing sensations of

74
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,200
breathing allow them to be

75
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:51,320
sensed where there's no separation between sensing and

76
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:58,120
sensation where it's the body's experience of breathing

77
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:07,600
more than an mental exercise of looking or

78
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:15,480
knowing resting with a changing flow of breathing

79
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:43,839
and whatever happens during the meditation

80
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:48,839
gently understand that this too will

81
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:58,000
change where that understanding is a way of helping you

82
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:09,120
relax around what is happening be less reactive or caught

83
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:17,720
or resistant this too with ch will

84
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:26,519
change allowing whatever is there permission to be

85
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:31,360
there so in its own time it can

86
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
change

87
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
for

88
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
e

89
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
for

90
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
for

91
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
for

92
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
for

93
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

94
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,880
for e

95
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:54,240
if you find yourself involved caught

96
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:05,559
reactive in a loving way caring way remind yourself this too will

97
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:11,360
change where the purpose of saying that remembering

98
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:20,679
that is to relax around What's

99
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:26,880
Happening Here and Now relax the

100
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,679
reactivity relax the whole holding or the

101
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
resistance

102
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
for

103
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

104
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

105
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

106
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

107
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
for

108
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

109
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

110
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

111
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

112
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
for

113
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
for

114
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

115
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,278
for e

116
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:49,559
and then as we come to the end of the sitting to understand that the

117
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:58,880
wisdom that this too will change is not meant to pass judgment or

118
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:06,120
just to see the world in a particular way but rather to help

119
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:12,960
us not cling or resist or hold on to

120
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:19,480
anything to allow us to shift our relationship from one that can be

121
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:25,279
understood as reactive to one that is

122
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:31,039
responsive from some of the wisest places

123
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:39,559
within and one way to respond to this changing

124
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:48,240
world changing world of our experience is to meet it with

125
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,799
love the different all the different flavors of

126
00:27:53,799 --> 00:28:00,360
love so if what changes is difficult difficult for people for

127
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:05,559
yourself to meet it with Compassion

128
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:15,480
Care if what changes is is a positive thing to meet it with appreciative

129
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:24,559
Joy appreciation if what happens in the

130
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:33,039
world is near neither suffering nor great but just something

131
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:38,960
happening love can take the form of being friendly

132
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:46,799
kindness Good Will and if what happens in the world

133
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:52,080
is difficult for us and we cannot intervene or do

134
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:58,600
something about it but we have to against all our preferences there has

135
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:05,440
to be some acceptance of it or some not getting caught in it love can

136
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,799
take the form of

137
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:17,279
equinity where there's a love for others and ourselves we don't allow ourselves to

138
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:24,480
get worked up or caught or reactive in a way that interferes with

139
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:31,600
the flow of open love care

140
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,640
compassion this too will

141
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:44,880
change and in this changing world may it be that this wisdom

142
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:52,919
supports us to enter the world with kind

143
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:59,519
heart with a friendly gaze with a Caring Heart

144
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:06,519
may we go through the world not with hate but with love may

145
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:14,320
all beings be happy may all beings be

146
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:19,559
safe may all beings be

147
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:26,399
peaceful may all beings everywhere be free

148
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,609
[Music]

149
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:45,399
thank

150
00:30:56,919 --> 00:30:59,919
you

151
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:30,880
for e

152
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:14,679
so hello everyone and welcome to this last talk on the the eight worldly winds

153
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:23,840
and this is a kind of a summary talk or concluding talk about it and um the uh in the in the Buddhist

154
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:30,799
teachings the word wins is actually not in in how he calls this uh he calls it

155
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:36,519
the eight worldly Damas dharmas which in this context I like to

156
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:43,679
translate it as the eight worldly forces eight worldly processes that and

157
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:51,960
he says in describing this that these eight worldly forces turn the

158
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:59,559
world and that the world he repeats then the World Turns on these eight

159
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:06,200
forces and um and so what we're talking about here is the human world and

160
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:12,039
primarily in this human world uh if we read the newspaper if we look out across

161
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:19,399
the globe and history and what people are doing we see that uh that uh a lot

162
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:28,360
of the preoccupation a lot of the reactivity and involvement people have in the world can be uh caught up in gain

163
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:36,440
Greed for more and and loss and the despair over uh you know losing wealth

164
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:42,200
and losing our things and not succeeding to become um you

165
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:49,200
know wealthy you know sometimes at least around here Silicon

166
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,320
Valley and then um the the world roles

167
00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:02,840
revolves around uh Fame and disrepute and not a few people have had their

168
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:07,880
life uh destroyed in the this very

169
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:16,679
shallow Fame of social media and that is the rise and fall of Fame and Instagram

170
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:22,638
and friends and Facebook and um but politicians and

171
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:29,679
celebrities and all kinds of people the pursuit of Fame and despair

172
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:36,720
when it's lost and then there's praise and blame and some people live on that that they

173
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:43,839
their sense of self is based on what other people think and so praise and blame is the

174
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:52,800
pursuit and then there's uh Pleasure and Pain comfort and discomfort and um and uh forms of

175
00:34:52,800 --> 00:35:00,079
happiness and unhappiness so the involved in that

176
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:06,119
these are what turns the world the human world keeps it going keeps it

177
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:13,440
spinning and so the Buddha uh is talking about this the emphasis is not on that

178
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:19,359
these other worldly forces but rather is our relationship to it how do we relate

179
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:25,119
to it how do we live in these in these forces and these winds do we participate

180
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:30,800
them do we get involved in them are we caught in them and um and the particular thing that the

181
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:36,560
Buddha emphasizes is that a wise person knows

182
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:44,800
that these forces all the things that come with them that they are um

183
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:51,599
inconstant that they will perish that they're changing and so this idea of that is

184
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:57,040
knowing they're changing reminding ourselves so that when there is Gain No

185
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:02,440
this too will change and um and not a few people lose

186
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:07,480
their wealth not a few people what they thought what they had gained disappears

187
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:13,000
and as tragic or difficult as that is there's something about knowing that

188
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,839
that world is perishable it's changeable that we don't put all our bask all our eggs in that basket so our happiness is

189
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:28,319
100% dependent on on what we've gained you know so a house that burns down

190
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:35,240
a stock market that crashes a wealth that is stolen as tragic as

191
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:40,960
those is there's a way of reminding oneself oh this is changeable this is

192
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:46,880
perishable so that they're not quite surprised by it the point being not to

193
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:53,160
have a judgment or a view about it but what is the what is the wisdom that

194
00:36:53,160 --> 00:37:02,280
allows us to keep our peace to stay at ease to not get despairing or crushed or

195
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:07,960
so disappointing that we kind of just shrink away is there a way is there

196
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:16,319
wisdom that keeps us free is there wisdom that keeps us peaceful wisdom that keeps us calm and wise and and

197
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:22,599
loving and this is one of the ones the Buddha offers and so if you don't like it you don't have to use

198
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:28,960
it but in terms of these worldly forces uh to be reminded this two it will

199
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:35,000
change and um and then that does that allow us a healthier relationship to the

200
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,319
world a better relationship with the world a relationship where we are can

201
00:37:40,319 --> 00:37:46,480
enter into the next moment freely so to show up at your car and see

202
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:54,400
that that uh you have a flat tire or two flat tires um to oh this too tires

203
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:00,760
change this too is perishable and uh and now I've encountered this part of our

204
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:06,119
world now how do I relate to this to be remind a little bit of that do that take

205
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:13,359
a little bit the edge off the reactivity the the surprise the sense of Injustice

206
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:22,680
or that the world now is out against me um and uh is there a way of

207
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:31,119
staying with a degree of ease or peace or what wellbeing or calm in the face of

208
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:36,720
all the changing Natures of this world especially for these eight

209
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:43,640
worldly forces that are so much what people get caught in so that's the the

210
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:50,560
um the kind of the overview of these of these some people have uh some of their

211
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:56,280
lists sometimes of these eight worldly of uh forces instead of calling the

212
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:01,359
first one gain and loss will call it success and failure and this is another

213
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:06,400
one that people often get caught in in the need for success and maybe in a

214
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:14,599
competitive world or need for success and where our identity is tied to being a successful person and that if we fail

215
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:22,000
that somehow we're somehow less than and I love as myself stories of

216
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,800
people who conventionally or you know in some ways fail but it doesn't uh stop

217
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:33,720
them they continue with what they're doing I love the story of people who

218
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:38,760
have success but they don't kind of hold on to the excess or wear it you know as

219
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:44,200
a kind of a medallion to show people they're happy with succeeding and then

220
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:50,480
they go on to the next thing to do they just love doing they love being engaged and the idea of holding on to something

221
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:58,319
even success um it's just doesn't have quite the the um the interest than it is

222
00:39:58,319 --> 00:40:03,960
to engage and step into the world for the next thing in a full and open and clear

223
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:11,520
way so praise and blame there's these are not necessarily bad things uh that

224
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:18,640
people appreciate us not bad things that people point out are faults and our mistakes so is there a different way of

225
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:24,040
relating to them that all praise is you know that we don't have to push it away

226
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:31,040
but we don't have to hold on to it we can new way of Rel relating is to be open and allowing and make room for what

227
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:40,000
is healthy and to ignore what is unhealthy and not be involved in it gain and loss is not a wrong thing to

228
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,760
have um that we can appreciate the gain and we can be wise about the loss and um

229
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:55,040
but the idea is to find our freedom and this is the central theme I'd like I tried to get across this week that um of

230
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:02,319
these eight worldly forces there are better ways of living than

231
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:10,760
tiing our life to these things and the Buddhist practice hopefully is showing us a better way of living of being alive

232
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:18,599
that we have a a very satisfying feeling of peace or calm or Joy or happiness or

233
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:25,720
Freedom lightness uh that um that is it

234
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:31,640
alternative to these is being caught or involved or depending on these eight

235
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:39,040
worldly forces and so that it's not a matter of judging them or or having

236
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:45,880
critical of them or but rather it's a matter of not losing what's better not

237
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:51,880
sacrificing the what's wiser and a Freer and more loving more caring way of being

238
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:58,720
in the world because we know that we've learned that and so even though Everything

239
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:05,400
Changes in some way uh it doesn't mean that things are chaotic and random or

240
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:12,160
that we are without preferences and there are things to have preferences for

241
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:18,400
and preference without attachment to peace preference without attachment to a

242
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:25,559
sense of well-being and joy preference without attachment to being wise and

243
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:33,400
caring preference without attachment to being um grounded and settled here at

244
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:39,599
this moment so we can be present for this world not reactive to

245
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:46,519
it and um and so to know that there's something

246
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:52,359
better so one of the wisdom pieces that I've offered recently the idea of don't

247
00:42:52,359 --> 00:42:58,880
make it worse at least don't make it worse but if you know what's

248
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:09,000
better perhaps it's easier to avoid making it worse so thank you and uh I

249
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:15,000
um appreciate that the chance to teach these teachings and I'll be back here on

250
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,319
Monday and some of you might be interested in coming with me on Sunday

251

evening at 6 six o'clock in California time I'm going to be be on Zoom at

252
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:32,200
Spirit Rock to talk about my new book a little bit the everything is practice

253
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:37,800

254
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:43,640
Retreats at our retreat center and uh so I'm going to use part of that evening uh

255

great things that Spirit Rock does is offer a month-long Retreat and I'll talk a little bit about that monthlong

257
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:02,599
Retreat and and how wonderful it is I taught it for many years and uh sometimes I say that for

258
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:08,160
people who are inside practitioners that um like for a Muslim

259
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:13,400
once a lifetime they're supposed to go to Mecca I'd like to say that for inside

260
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:19,559
practitioners once a lifetime uh to do a month-long Retreat Insight

261
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:25,240
Retreat so um so you'll find the information about
