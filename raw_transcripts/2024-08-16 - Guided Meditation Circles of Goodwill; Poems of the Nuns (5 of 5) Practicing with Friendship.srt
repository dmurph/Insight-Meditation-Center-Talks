1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,919
so hello everyone and welcome to this meditation on

2
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:14,719
Friday and um there's a little story from the ancient text with

3
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,400
the teachings of the Buddha where the Buddha talks about his own experience of

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,199
going to off to practice on Retreat before he was enlightened and there were

5
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:34,000
no retreat centers back then so he was going into the forest and um at the end of this teaching he

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,399
says um he still goes into the forest to practice even now that he's uh fully

7
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,760
awakened and some people might think that uh the Buddha does so because in fact he's not awakened fully and he's

8
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:53,480
going to keep he needs to keep practicing but it's not that way he is fully awakened but he goes into the

9
00:00:53,480 --> 00:01:01,120
forest to practice going retre for two reasons for his own ease and well well

10
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,200
beinging and for uh uh to be an example

11
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:15,159
to be an encouragement or he says actually what he says is out of uh Compassion or care for future

12
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:22,720
generations and this idea that the Buddha would go and meditate because he wants future generations to

13
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:30,840
meditate meaning us we're in that and to to a great extent and we're

14
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,119
uh continuing something the Buddha started without the Buddha starting his

15
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:44,799
teaching starting his own practice becoming awakened and teaching uh there would be no Buddhism and this particular

16
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:51,079
Gathering and teachings that we have and people would not exist in the way we know it

17
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:58,320
now and uh and we have it survives down through the generations because from time to time

18
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,399
there are people like the Buddha who would love the who who out of their

19
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:10,399
love their care their friendship their companionship are

20
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:17,720
saying meditate it's good to meditate it's for your own benefit and

21
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:23,879
the benefit of the world to meditate go and Retreat go on a short

22
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:31,040
Retreat the short Retreat right now from your home on YouTube

23
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:39,959
and uh and this idea that there are people in the world who are their warmth their friendship their care their um

24
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:45,159
maybe not thinking about each of you individually they don't know you maybe

25
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:51,239
but they're there in the around you and extended with this wish for others

26
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:57,800
including you to yes we pre please

27
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:04,280
meditate it's good we were and so the the call the instructions the

28
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:12,000
suggestion the thing that strikes me is that it's being offered with friendship with the friendliness

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,360
with good will not assertion not demand not expectation but just out of a

30
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,799
genuine kindness and Care compassion

31
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:29,480
warmth a warmth perhaps in sharing our common humanity and the challenges of it

32
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:34,720
and and how to meet those challenges here

33
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,319

e e

91
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,039
so then as we come to the end of this

92
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:16,440
sitting to imagine if you will that from the point of view from

93
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:26,320
the perspective of sitting quietly and calmly that you can gaze upon the

94
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,240
world kindly

95
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:39,360
that you can gaze upon the world with Good Will and that for these few

96
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:43,519
minutes if you

97
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:52,320
can not be troubled by the world because you have something

98
00:26:52,320 --> 00:27:00,240
phenomenally wonderful to offer something very much needed in this troubled world

99
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:05,919
to offer our your kindness your good will your

100
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:12,559
care to be able to accompany the world with good

101
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:20,600
will maybe so that it spreads into the world and into

102
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:30,960
future Generations the human capacity for meta for kindness for

103
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,520
care may all

104
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:48,480
beings know that others wish them to be happy may all

105
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:54,398
beings know that others wish them to be

106
00:27:54,519 --> 00:28:02,440
safe may all beings know that are people people who wish them

107
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:12,799
peace may all beings know that there are people who wish them

108
00:28:13,399 --> 00:28:20,640
freedom and may those people be us may we go into the world wishing happiness

109
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:27,320
and safety Peace and Freedom and may we contribute to that

110
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,120
possibility

111
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:59,519
thank you all and thank you for maybe your

112
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:04,960
patience or with the various uh technical difficulties we have with all

113
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:11,480
the electronics we have here but I think now we're set for the rest of the

114
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,080
morning e

115
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:16,840
so in this fifth talk I'm finishing the series on uh the poems of the Elder nuns

116
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:22,039
the uh poems of that are preserved that are

117
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:27,399
attributed to the first generations and they say it in plural because it's often

118
00:30:27,399 --> 00:30:32,600
said to be the first generation of Disciples of the Buddha female

119
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:39,159
disciples um but rather I think it's they probably composed over a longer period of time maybe several hundred

120
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:46,240
years so those first generations and uh and um I want to

121
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:52,120
today Begin by reading a little bit more from the introductory words I've written about these poems that I've

122
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:59,440
translated and then I'll read uh some of the poems that uh for me uh touches the

123
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:07,200
warmth and friendliness and support with which uh the ancient nuns provided

124
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:13,440
themselves or experience that allowed them to do their practice

125
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,000
um so

126
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:27,200
um the enlightened women who are featured in the terata represent the first generations

127
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,880
of female Buddhists who contributed to establishing the spiritual foundation

128
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:39,279
for succeeding generations of Buddhists of all genders with few other surviving records

129
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:45,279
of the first Buddhist women the ter Gata provides an invaluable window into the

130
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:53,000
lives and religious experience of these Pioneers prior to becoming nuns many had

131
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:00,080
been wives and mothers some were widows some the mothers of had children and one

132
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:06,440
was a widow had lost both her children pachara a few of the nuns had been

133
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:11,480
prostitutes and cortis some had been poor others had been wealthy Daughters

134
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:16,960
of royalty and high ranking families some were old and weak others were young

135
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,600
in the prime of their lives two had already been contemplative

136
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:28,279
uh renunciant before encountering the Buddhist teachings

137
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:34,120
no matter what their background most of these women attained the ultimate goal of the

138
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:41,919
Buddhist path in fact the attainment of full spiritual Liberation is a predominant theme of the Terry

139
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:50,159
Gata the importance of this experience popularly known in English as Enlightenment is EV evidenced by the 40

140
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:56,080
different synonyms and descriptive words used to describe it the most frequently

141
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:02,159
used words uh having to do with the most frequently used used are words having to

142
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:08,200
do with freedom that is words that can be translated into English as being

143
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:15,360
freed well freed released liberated fully released

144
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:22,360
emancipated set free attaining Liberation and being untied

145
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:28,480
unfettered so it's remarkable this whole uh

146
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,039
these these

147
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:43,000
texts and then for many of the women in the terata being a nun included valued

148
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,919
connections with other nuns um they had more senior nuns as

149
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:56,440
their teachers to receive teachings venerable Utama and an unnamed none approach a

150
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:02,039
none they Trust venerable via when she had no control of

151
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:07,200
her mind respectfully questioned a fellow nun for

152
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:15,520
teachings um Venable Chanda refers to the kindness of veneral pachara allowing

153
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:21,200
her to go forth as a nun 30 nuns who seem to be a group practicing together

154
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:26,440
Express their lifelong honoring respect to venerable pachara for her liberating

155
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:35,240
teachings Vel sundari refers to her monastic teacher as the light of the sa states

156
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:41,878
that she has attained Awakening in dependence on her teacher having left domestic and family

157
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:47,079
life Behind These none had Community with each

158
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:52,200
other so this idea of this warmth and kindness and mutual respect of

159
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:58,240
practicing together is um is uh

160
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:06,079
uh one of the characteristics that I read when I read these texts and this stands out most prominently in the first

161
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:12,280
chapter uh the the uh book is organized in chapters with increasingly long uh

162
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:20,440
longer verses and the or poems and the first uh chapter is um is uh poems that

163
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:29,400
are of one verse and uh one of the characteristic of these poems is that um uh uh some of

164
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:36,480
these is that the N the the meaning of the name of the nun is there's a word

165
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:42,240
play in the verse itself in that poem that uh kind of plays with that or

166
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:49,839
revokes it and brings it forth again and uh but through these uh

167
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:55,480
literally in the poem The Woman is addressed directly in the second person

168
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:02,960
you know uh but the question is who's addressing the nun and um uh the most

169
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:09,119
common theory is she's speaking to herself in the second person and um and

170
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:14,440
in um another uh theory is that it's actually the Buddha speaking to her and

171
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:19,480
the third theory is that it's a fellow nun who's teaching her encouraging her

172
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:25,319
or some way but whatever it is to me there's a feeling of this warmth and

173
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:31,319
care and kindness that comes through it and U it starts from the first verse

174
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:38,119
with a woman a um a Elder nun who has attained peace

175
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:45,119
from all passion from all lust and um and then uh she's

176
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:51,200
told sleep at ease dear Elder wrapped in

177
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:57,880
the robe you made so just kind of you know just encourage me sleep well now you done

178
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:02,920
your work you become free so now sleep at

179
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:09,319
ease um very simple ordinary but expression of warmth and

180
00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:18,119
kindness the second poem is uh addresses muta which uh her name means

181
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:25,520
freed muta be freed from bondage as the Moon from an

182
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:33,240
eclipse with a mindset setree enjoy your food debt free the idea of eating

183
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:40,040
enjoying your food debt free for a monastic is that they receive uh arms they only eat what's given to them by

184
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:46,680
the Ley and so they're a little bit in depth they have something to return to them and what they return to them is

185
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:52,440
their practice and they practice to the point of uh Enlightenment at which case

186
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:59,040
you um we um we can enjoy death free

187
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:08,319
and then there's punna which means full Puna be full of good

188
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:17,200
States like the moon on a full moon night full with Insight shatter the mass

189
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:22,480
of Darkness so practice please practice but there's for me there's this warmth

190
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:29,440
that's playing with her name your your name is freed be freed please

191
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:40,560
here is one whose name is ma ma means friend

192
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:48,400
M having gone forth out of Faith Delight in Friends by cultivating skillful

193
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,880
States attain peace from bondage from

194
00:38:53,880 --> 00:39:01,280
attachment so this idea again here is explicit the light and friends the spiritual friendships that we have that

195
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,920
you can have and here This Woman's name is badra

196
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:14,400
and that means blessing badra having gone forth out of Faith

197
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:20,280
Delight in Blessings by cultivating skillful States

198
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:25,560
attain UNS surpass peace from

199
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:32,800
bondage here's another one whose name is a mutah freed and now she's speaking directly

200
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:40,960
for herself well freed very well freed I am

201
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:48,400
freed from three crooked things for Mortar pesle and crooked

202
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:55,720
husband I am freed from birth and death what leads to becoming has been pulled

203
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:01,280
out marriage and family life being a wife and mother was not necessarily a

204
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:08,440
good thing in the ancient world it was a lot of work and sometimes it was kind of like servitude uh very different from

205
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:15,119
our our understanding of marriage and maybe in the modern modern world and so

206
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:20,240
she's celebrating being freed from maybe a very difficult

207
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:26,480
husband um here's one her name this one doesn't

208
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:33,359
necessarily directly have a word player with her name but utara meaning

209
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:40,599
Supreme controlled in body speech and mind having pulled out craving at its

210
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:45,700
root I've become calm released

211
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,750
[Music]

212
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:58,680
quenched and This Woman's name is dma so the

213
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:05,079
Dharma weak leaning on a stick wandering for

214
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:12,680
arms limbs trembling so you know there was no again there was no medicine that we have today

215
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:18,680
Social Security retirement homes um you know that people who are monastics maybe

216
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:27,440
had a monastery to live in but they still had to go out and get food every day and so week leaning on a stick

217
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:35,599
wandering for arms limbs trembling I fell to the ground right

218
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:43,800
here in seeing the drawbacks of the body my mind was

219
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:49,560
liberated so here old age challenges weak not all strong enough to stand up

220
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:55,599
for herself something about falling she could let go maybe not depend on the

221
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:01,560
body maybe find an alternative even in her old age and something in her mind

222
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,920
got

223
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:16,880
liberated and this one is another one woman who

224
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:23,400
um maybe I'll skip it uh and uh but here

225
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:29,040
for the sake of time here's another woman who

226
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:38,800
um similar is actually it's almost the same there's two verses now we're in this chapter 2 and um and so uh it's a

227
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:44,160
little bit like the earlier one her name is chitt and chitt in this context means

228
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:49,559
shining bright or beautiful and it has in it the idea

229
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:57,200
she's a monastic turning over her bowl and now the it seems to refer to the idea

230
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:03,400
that a monastic can go out uh with their bowl for food but if they turn over

231
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:08,760
their bowl like this they can't re receive any offerings it's like refusing

232
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:15,160
something no more of that and uh in 2007 when uh in one of the times that the

233
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:21,640
monastics in Burma stood up against the government they walked through the streets where their bowls turned up so

234
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:27,599
that uh people the government officials the military couldn't make Merit by

235
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:32,800
making offerings to the monks it was their protest so she refers to this in her

236
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:38,559
poem perhaps as a kind of um as a metaphor a number of these

237
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:44,599
things might be metaphor in this poem she also talks about ascending the mountain and I don't know in the ancient

238
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:51,680
world but in some later Buddhism um that ascending the mountain is also kind of U

239
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:58,200
uh going up on the path of practice to the top um

240
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:08,240
though quite emancipated uh quite emaciated sick and weak I walking

241
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:17,000
leaning on a stick have ascended the mountain having laid down my upper robe

242
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,640
turning over my bowl and resting on a rock the mass of

243
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:30,960
Darkness shattered so here turning o over the bow I think

244
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:36,160
it it's a metaphor here for no longer uh

245
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:43,240
taking in the bait of the world The Temptations of the world no longer uh

246
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:49,079
maybe taking in receiving her own attachments her own clinging her own

247
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:54,200
delusions no more something inside of her turned over and some people

248
00:44:54,200 --> 00:45:00,280
experience Enlightenment with a kind of feeling like something something flips in the mind something switches very

249
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:05,640
quickly and um going to turn over and then life is different from then on or

250
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:10,760
something maybe turns over the bowl and the mind turns over and all the

251
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:16,200
attachments drain out and

252
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:25,440
um and so there's one more here time to stop uh her name is Sama meaning

253
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:33,000
peaceful not that attaining mental peace so her name is peaceful but not attaining mental peace and with no

254
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:41,960
control of my mind four five times I left my Hut but then eight nights ago

255
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:47,880
craving was abolished by being devoted to vigilance

256
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:56,079
in regard to all suffering states by being mindful of all suffering States I

257
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:01,960
reached the destru ction of craving and accomplished the Buddha's

258
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:09,720
teachings accomplished the Buddha's teachings so these poems over and over again show that these women in the

259
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:17,000
ancient world could accomplish what the Buddha taught you can

260
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:23,760
also you can also practice and um and you have the warmth

261
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:29,480
of community even the ones you don't know you the the nuns of the ancient

262
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:36,800
world they practiced for you as well and they're there the ancient nun teachers

263
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:44,280
are still here their momentum their memory through these ancient texts their

264
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:49,760
what survives of them the through these verses that uh they're saying you can do

265
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:55,839
it practice and come and rest at ease find your peace find your

266
00:46:55,839 --> 00:47:02,599
freedom so thank you very much and then one announcement is that
