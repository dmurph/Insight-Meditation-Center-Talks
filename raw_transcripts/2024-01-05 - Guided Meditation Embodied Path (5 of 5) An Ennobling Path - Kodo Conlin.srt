00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:09,400
greetings hello wonderful to be with you again

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:15,840
it's been four mornings on the four noble truths and we've arrived

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:21,920
at Friday the fifth day and my My Hope for the morning for

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,240
the day wherever you are is

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,240
um that we remember to bring the whole body and the whole being

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:44,200
along as we walk this eight-fold path so let's begin with um begin with a

7
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,920
meditation a simple meditation of

8
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,680
embodiment and the the instructions in brief will

9
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:04,878
be uh first let's establish mindfulness here with this this

10
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:12,240
body and then whenever awareness seems to get a little

11
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,000
small shrink then bring the awareness back to

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,159
the entire body so we're aware aware as best we can of the whole body at

13
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,840
once so let's begin

14
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,680
taking our

15
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,840
places

16
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,959
really taking our

17
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:28,760
time to connect with the body as it is right

18
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,760
here

19
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,799
I would suggest making any adjustments that you

20
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,760
need to the posture

21
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:09,080
such that the the breathing can flow easily and

22
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,959
deeply and if uh free and easy breathing is not

23
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,440
available no

24
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:38,360
problem perhaps in that case instead of feeling the body from the inside

25
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,200
out you can try sensing the body from the outside

26
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,959
in almost from its

27
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,680
perimeter

28
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,039
bringing the whole body Along on this

29
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,160
path now is a good time to check in with all

30
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:12,720
of the senses if there's any

31
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,800
tension say in the eyes relaxing the

32
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,720
eyes any tension linked to the ears relax the

33
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:35,319
ears just so with the

34
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,160
nose even the tongue and the mouth and the

35
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,479
gums

36
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,080
and gently with the whole

37
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
body

38
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
for

39
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,400
and applying now just enough

40
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:36,159
energy to bring awareness as best we

41
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,518
can to the whole

42
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:56,279
body holding the whole body in our

43
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:04,720
awareness so it can be be seen in one glance sensed in one

44
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:19,440
glance the whole width of the

45
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:26,320
shoulders the

46
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
distance

47
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,240
the front of the body to the back of the

48
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:53,040
body and from the scalp to the

49
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
toes

50
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:58,440
with our eyes closed sensing this whole dancing field

51
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,040
of sensation

52
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
St

53
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:16,680
and if after some time you notice the awareness

54
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,120
is growing

55
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:30,600
smaller to gently invite

56
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,920
the entire

57
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
body

58
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
for

59
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
e

60
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
now

61
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:21,240
sensing the entire

62
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:29,520
body bringing the entire body along

63
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,919
walking this eight-fold

64
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:43,200
path no part of our being left

65
00:27:54,440 --> 00:28:01,398
behind and in the last minute of this

66
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,398
sitting i' invite you

67
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:18,200
to relax any effort in the

68
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:26,120
meditation and if it's available to breathe

69
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:31,399
breathe and a touch of gratitude into this

70
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:35,320
body offered to the

71
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:49,700
body it's by the body that we're aware by the body we walk the

72
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:56,000
[Music] path and the mind and body

73
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,760
together that we wake

74
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:18,159
up may all beings be free from

75
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,320
suffering

76
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:48,079
[Music]

77
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:27,890
so welcome again the Four Noble Truths

78
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:33,279
[Music] the Noble Truth of

79
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:39,159
suffering the noble truth of the arising or origin of

80
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:46,360
suffering the third Noble Truth of the cessation of suffering and the fourth Noble Truth of the way the path the

81
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:51,919
practice leading to the cessation of suffering and I'm wanting to emphasize

82
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:59,000
this morning bringing the whole body along as we said at the end of the sitting it's the it's the body and the

83
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:05,720
mind together through which we awaken so I have this metaphor that

84
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:13,480
helps me remember that the whole body is involved in this eight-fold path and that's likening each factor to

85
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:19,320
a part of the body this is totally my idea so um let it let it go if it

86
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:26,159
doesn't land for you so um Right View is like the eyes

87
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:34,639
that sense that Orient us to our Direction on the path I liken right intention to the head that I associate

88
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:39,960
with impulses thoughts and choices right speech for obvious

89
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:45,799
reasons right action and right livelihood like the left and the right

90
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:53,039
hand together so action and livelihood not so not so

91
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:58,720
distinguished right effort associate with the belly this um there there are

92
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,480
associations of of power in the stomach um motive Force so right effort

93
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,960
in the belly right mindfulness I link to the the entire

94
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:16,320
sensing body this whole body's mindfulness and then right concentration

95
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:22,679
the heart and the association with the heart is uh

96
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:29,760
actually influenced by the teachings of the T Forest tradition that a heart and the what they say the the

97
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:36,360
chit um the mind they locate in the chest and they say when when one becomes

98
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:43,919
concentrated what happens is the it's the chitta that's becoming concentrated the chitta that's collecting so I love

99
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:49,399
to think of the heart becoming collected in the center of the

100
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:55,960
being so this metaphor helps uh helps remind me that this whole body comes

101
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:03,440
along so yesterday we spoke about five factors of the eight the Noble eight-fold Path

102
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:09,039
we we touched on Right View right intention right speech right action and

103
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:16,200
right livelihood uh and I divided those factors in a way to emphasize Right View

104
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:22,039
holding up right View and then holding up the other four in a sort of creative category I called

105
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:27,960
conduct usually the path is divided into three divisions

106
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:36,320
uh the division of wisdom that includes Right View and right intention the division of uh Sila virtue or ethics

107
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:41,399
that includes speech action and livelihood and then this third division

108
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:47,279
which will be the focus this morning which is samadi

109
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:52,399
concentration uh that this includes three factors also right effort right

110
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:58,960
mindfulness and right concentration

111
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:05,480
so these three factors again I want to I want to emphasize that right view uh is

112
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:11,200
not left behind no matter where we go on the path we're orienting to uh the next

113
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:19,760
step on the path and the the goal at whatever distance so uh there's this beautiful

114
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:27,118
suta um middle length discourse is 117 that is called the Great 40 and there's

115
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:35,599
this there's this description in it over and over and over again about how uh Right View mindfulness and right effort

116
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:42,919
all Circle and run around each other I love the the uh Dynamic aspect of uh

117
00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:48,118
thinking of these factors of the eight-fold path running and circling around each other and that right View

118
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:55,520
and right mindfulness and right effort are all working together um so part of that

119
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:02,079
teaching it explains what each of these factors is so in this in this teaching

120
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:09,440
Right View uh right views Incorporated the effort that's involved

121
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:15,839
is to abandon an unwise View and to enter into

122
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:23,040
Right View and the mindfulness that's involved is that which keeps us attentive we have

123
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:29,200
to be able to recognize Right View and recognize some effort that's the that's

124
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:36,560
the mindfulness so maybe in other words we could say that right view orients US

125
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:42,119
skillfully effort is the effort to align with Right View that we

126
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:49,280
see uh and then the mindfulness is that attentiveness which allows this process to

127
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:56,319
happen so right view Right View stays with us um Right View stays with us as

128
00:35:56,319 --> 00:36:02,839
we as we we move into the this samade section right effort right mindfulness

129
00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:09,720
right concentration let's see in relationship

130
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:15,160
to the eight-fold path right effort uh is that effort that it takes to enter

131
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:22,440
into each one of the factors of the eight-fold path as we were just saying the effort it takes to enter into Right

132
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:28,240
View and let go of its opposite and then that effort it takes to to enter into

133
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:35,000
wise intentions and let go of the opposite same with speech same with action same with

134
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,359
livelihood now in meditation the art of finding the right

135
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:47,319
amount of effort is often the main question and that effort uh is is

136
00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:52,560
likened to tuning a stringed instrument maybe you've heard this teaching before

137
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:58,160
of U the Buddha meeting Sona is having a having a tough time in

138
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:03,400
his meditation he's seems to be doing everything right but it's not going well for him and the Buddha asks him a

139
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:11,760
question about his effort and in explaining how the the art of finding the right amount of effort Likens um the

140
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:19,680
application of energy to tuning a stringed instrument if it's too loose the the string won't play if it's

141
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:25,839
too tight the instruments Out Of Tune so you have to tune the effort tuning the

142
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:32,359
effort so circling around with right effort of

143
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:38,040
course Right View and right mindfulness so right

144
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:43,640
mindfulness uh there's a there's a contemporary teacher who says that to be

145
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:50,480
mindful is easy to be mindful is easy what is difficult is to remember to be

146
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:57,839
mindful I appreciate that um maybe maybe we could say that um

147
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:03,520
right mindfulness is is a sort of comfort zone in our tradition we talk about it a lot we study it a lot we

148
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,960
practice it regularly um might say we do this with some

149
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:18,240
energy um and though it's our comfort zone so to speak it takes Vigor uh we see this in the the um Sati

150
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:23,359
patana suta that uh there's there's a degree of tincy involved in our right

151
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:28,520
view and clear seeing in our practice of mindfulness

152
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:34,000
and it's a wonder it it it's just a wonder that the the power of sustained

153
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,560
clear awareness clear mindfulness is able to develop what's beautiful in us

154
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:47,079
and to support us to abandon what's harmful can you hear the right effort that that comes along with right

155
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:53,920
mindfulness helps us to grow and the beneficial also part of the part of the

156
00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:01,400
power of mindfulness is the Simplicity of the message method it's so easy to describe that what we're doing in

157
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:08,599
mindfulness is to clearly know the body this body as

158
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:15,319
body uh these feeling tones as feeling tones this mind as this mind and

159
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:21,440
qualities as qualities just as they're Rising not as we wish they were not as

160
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,720
we wish they weren't but just as they are and doing this putting aside greed

161
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:33,599
and distress in reference to the world it said the Simplicity is just

162
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:41,040
amazing so let's right effort right mindfulness and this brings us to right concentration why is concentration or as

163
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,920
Gil Gil has been teaching recently complete

164
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:53,319
concentration so in a way this eighth factor of the eight-fold path is like the culmination of the eight-fold path

165
00:39:53,319 --> 00:39:58,920
in that uh in one Reckoning it arises at at the end and it's been conditioned and

166
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:05,359
supported by the entire path before it again in this teaching the great 40

167
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:12,520
uh right concentration is uh is explained as that sort of concentration that's invested

168
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:19,800
with all of the other factors of the eight-fold path another classic

169
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:26,960
understanding is that uh wise concentration is related to these four deep states of unification

170
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:34,359
of the mind and heart called Janna and what I why I want to bring them up is because the images that are

171
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:39,400
used to teach most of them are associated with water why is that

172
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:44,720
significant uh you might when thinking about concentration you might think oh laser

173
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:51,440
beam oh clamp uh I need to I will sternly demand that my awareness be in

174
00:40:51,440 --> 00:41:00,079
one place something like that so rather than the laser beam or clamp metaphor thinking about water the uh the first

175
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:06,480
the first of the four metaphors being like um sprinkling sprinkling water on

176
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:11,520
Bath powder or maybe in modern terms sprinkling water on bread dough and

177
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:18,280
kneading it so that this dough is Unified and there's water suffused throughout it nothing

178
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:24,680
extra and in the same way in this in this state the the body is filled with

179
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:32,119
Rapture and pleasure then the uh the second just as another

180
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:38,079
example is a a state of state of uh concentration collectedness of the Mind

181
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:45,640
where a Springfed lake is welling up from within and that's liken to the pervading

182
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:51,359
of Cool Waters throughout the

183
00:41:52,640 --> 00:42:00,400
body [Music] so right effort right mindfulness right

184
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:06,000
concentration these are the um maybe we could say these are

185
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:13,160
meditation contribution to the noble Eightfold Path it's been quite a delight this

186
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:21,319
first week of 2024 that uh we've returned to the Buddha's traditional First teaching on the first Noble

187
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:27,240
Truth and in uh to summarize we've we've reflected we've reflected on this path

188
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:32,440
of practice that is to be cultivated that's to be developed in order to

189
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:39,640
realize freedom from suffering uh with some gratitude to the

190
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:45,680
Buddha the great physician it's based on his understanding of Dua his understanding of this human

191
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:53,359
predicament and its causes these are the four noble

192
00:42:53,480 --> 00:43:00,720
truths and in closing I want to say that the truths are noble uh in part because they are in

193
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:06,440
nobling therefore in nobling truths so the in the Buddhist time of

194
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:13,040
course uh nobility was something that one was born into but this was not so for the Buddha a noble one instead was

195
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:18,839
one who had realized a degree of freedom of heart free of greed free of hatred free of

196
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:24,559
delusion and I'd like to encourage us as we as we close and as we move forward on this path

197
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:30,559
together um to appreciate and be nourished by all of those Noble moments

198
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:37,599
when the heart is free of greed hatred and delusion and I'm so inspired by this

199
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:42,640
that U that each moment that's free of greed hatred and delusion is a noble

200
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:48,599
moment that we're bringing nobility into the world in a in a direct material

201
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:55,839
actual way with every every step we take in this world that's free of greed free of

202
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,680
hatred free of

203
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:07,839
