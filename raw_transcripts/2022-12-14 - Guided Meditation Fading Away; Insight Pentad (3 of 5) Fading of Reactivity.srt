1
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:11,099
incredible hello and good morning good day

2
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:16,440
and to um

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,900
say a few introductory words for the meditation

4
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:30,380
there's a fascinating the use of attention awareness

5
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:36,000
in meditation especially and I say meditation by the time when we

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,879
can kind of give ourselves over to the exercise the experiment the discovery

7
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:50,100
process of what we can what happens when we're really aware and that is to be aware of some

8
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:57,739
psychological thing Within thinking some emotion

9
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:05,518
and um and hold it gently carefully fully

10
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,920
in the Gaze of awareness and if you do that

11
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,520
what you what you're doing is um if it's really ju only aware of it

12
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,159
uh what we're doing in that and being aware of it we're in itself awareness

13
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,619
does not interfere or doesn't judge or doesn't react React to what we're aware

14
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:33,720
of and so if we're fully invested and

15
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:40,680
caught up in something being aware is a process of beginning to step away from it to know it to see it without being

16
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,960
caught in it without fueling it without adding to it participating in it but

17
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,360
just knowing it as we know it more and more that way we start seeings

18
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:59,220
eventually we might see how we're participating how we're fueling it how we're repeating the same thought pattern

19
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:08,340
ideas Desires in order to keep certain things going and um and so we keep kind of opening or

20
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:16,140
developing that awareness to non-reactive non-judgmental just to see it we see what we contribute

21
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:21,959
and or we stop feeding it we stop you know this

22
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:29,760
kind of re-newing it all the time and then we see it begin to fade

23
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,220
baby fade and and fade away it becomes less intense it weakens

24
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:42,120
more often than not it's hard to see sometimes if they are participation in it our reactivity to it

25
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,459
is subconscious it's deeply embodied and habit made or something

26
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:53,340
so we have to be careful with making too many conclusions around this but uh but

27
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,379
this idea of just gazing upon something long enough

28
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:04,980
to watch it begin to fade to weaken this is a fascinating process

29
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:10,080
and and a lot of things will fade quicker than we realize surprisingly

30
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,840
fast there's some studies about how quickly an emotion will last by itself and it's

31
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,560
you know at a minute or 90 seconds or something that's how long emotions last unless

32
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:29,239
there's something in our psychophysical system that's renewing it feeding it building it up

33
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:34,440
so to be with a breathing also the

34
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,780
breathing if the if the breathing is a neutral place where we're not controlling

35
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:47,700
reacting to this is another way in which we are shifting the direction of our

36
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:54,599
the mental fuel mental renewal process so that we're renewing and fueling

37
00:03:54,599 --> 00:04:01,560
attention to breathing not to our thinking not to our reactivity not to certain emotions

38
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:07,440
reactive emotions so

39
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:13,080
um taking a meditation posture assuming a posture entering into a

40
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,539
posture and

41
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:25,280
and slowing down

42
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:32,699
slowing down and maybe twisting and swaying your body in a slow

43
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:41,580
way to kind of begin process of mindfulness of the body

44
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:47,940
aware from the body's point of view how we can find a balanced aligned

45
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,479
posture

46
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:02,880
maybe twisting a little bit from side to side the upper torso around the

47
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,520
shoulders is a way of maybe helping the shoulders kind of

48
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,160
come alive and maybe settle a little bit

49
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,580
lowering the Gaze

50
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,740
gently closing your eyes

51
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:42,440
taking a moment to Simply know how you are in the most obvious way

52
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:50,220
no it didn't the most non-reactive way that you know how

53
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:57,080
just know how you are in some simple General way

54
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:06,660
where what's important is not what you not how you are

55
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,280
but the way you know it

56
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:44,479
and then on the exhale relaxing your body

57
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:51,780
a kind of relaxation is not forced or expecting much

58
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,819
almost allowing the body space and room

59
00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:00,199
to release itself

60
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,940
shoulders

61
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,940
the belly

62
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:40,520
and then connecting more fully to your breathing taking three breaths

63
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:49,500
just three breaths three breath Journey of settling in being here just with your

64
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,880
breathing three times

65
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:18,000
and then once you've done three four three breaths ordinary simple breaths

66
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,979
that you attend to carefully

67
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:30,479
you're very quite aware of the count the breath the really connected it

68
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:36,060
then do it again and again

69
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:41,060
give yourself over to three breaths at a time

70
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:49,080
a relatively small goal to stay present for three breaths

71
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,740
and then to renew that practice

72
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:46,380
remembering to do the three breaths just fully present for three breaths

73
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:54,140
the inhales the exhales the transition between

74
00:11:54,140 --> 00:12:00,379
inhaling exhaling exhaling inhaling

75
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:08,699
coming back to doing three full breaths remembering

76
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,899
to stay with three breaths again and again

77
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,060
thank you

78
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,199
all right

79
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,880
foreign

80
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:17,280
if you're able to stay with the repetition of three breaths at a time

81
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:23,240
great and if you can't

82
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,919
what is it that's pulling you away

83
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:36,660
not the content of your thoughts but is it thinking is it feeling

84
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:43,919
emotions recognize clearly

85
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:50,700
what it is that grabs your attention so you forget

86
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,019
to be with your breathing

87
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:41,400
and now let go of breathing focusing on breathing

88
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:49,860
bring your attention to the process of thinking

89
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:53,059
or to some

90
00:21:54,980 --> 00:22:02,240
emotion that is difficult or

91
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:14,280
engage upon it carefully non-reactively just watch and see

92
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:22,559
step back let it be what it is but live in The Knowing of it

93
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,240
not in it

94
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:36,320
you might even use the name the note thinking

95
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,500
feeling

96
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:10,799
allow whatever is there to be there but don't participate in it

97
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:16,799
just step back and gaze upon it non-reactively

98
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:16,760
and if there is desires or aversion wanting or not wanting

99
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:25,280
gaze upon that with non-reactive awareness

100
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:34,340
recognizing it as wanting not wanting and see what happens under that gaze

101
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,039
foreign

102
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:03,299
foreign

103
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:24,440
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

104
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:32,580
there is a way to gaze upon the world non-reactively

105
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:39,480
that is at the same time kindly

106
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:48,200
kindness friendliness love

107
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:55,860
is not necessarily A reactive way of being but rather is the

108
00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:00,799
closer to just flows from the Open Heart

109
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:10,039
and to gaze upon the world with kind eyes

110
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:19,400
without wanting anything or not wanting just kind eyes

111
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:28,940
a kind of kindness that carries with it

112
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:36,020
the the wish and the Delights and the appreciation of others

113
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:39,740
wishing them well

114
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:47,960
May from these eyes of mine

115
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:53,940
May there flow well-wishing

116
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,480
wishing for the welfare and happiness of others

117
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:08,000
May flowing for me May there come

118
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:14,360
the wishes carried in these words

119
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,679
May others be happy

120
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:24,980
May others be safe

121
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,100
May others be peaceful

122
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:36,140
May others be free

123
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:45,740
and may we contribute to that possibility

124
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:59,259
[Music]

125
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:06,320
thank you

126
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:57,419
foreign foreign

127
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:08,100
so this is the third talk on the Insight pen pad

128
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:15,659
which is um the five qualities of practice five

129
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:22,320
aspects of how we change and grow that has a flow to it there's a kind of

130
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:29,460
evolution there's a kind of a natural growth from one to the other of course it doesn't always work in this

131
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:37,080
linear way but uh another way of understanding this is that there's a five qualities that

132
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:43,020
work together they support each other and guide each other and feed into each other

133
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:49,980
and sometimes maybe it goes in reverse order and but the classic way is this order which

134
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:56,299
I'm presenting them to you so it begins with having insight

135
00:31:56,299 --> 00:32:05,340
described as seeing things as they are and then from that comes disenchantment

136
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:11,520
breaking the spell of our desires and our projections onto things that

137
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:17,460
are not so helpful and then today we'll talk about

138
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:23,460
something called fading away sometimes translated as dispassion and

139
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:29,340
I'll talk about the two choices and then there's Liberation and then there's this interesting we'll talk on

140
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:37,200
Friday the knowledge of Liberation the and um but today the topic is uh B Raga

141
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:46,260
fading away and um and this is uh as we uh see things as

142
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:53,000
they are as we really well let me back up a little bit further uh this Insight

143
00:32:53,000 --> 00:33:00,720
pentad Builds on the gladness pentatonin and one of the great Treasures maybe the

144
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:09,240
phenomenal forms of wealth that we can have is uh inner well-being some sense of

145
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:15,000
inner contentment Happiness gladness joy some kind of feeling of well-being

146
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,720
Within it's not easy to come to necessarily but I think it's fair to say that most

147
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:28,380
people live a life without availing themselves of what is available

148
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:35,960
that if we slow down or take the time to really allow the inner life to settle and open

149
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:41,640
chances are there's more well-being there than most people allow for

150
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:47,519
but it's a treasure we want to stay close to and and build and know how to

151
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:53,159
support and and protect because what this does when we sit down

152
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:58,500
to meditate with this inner sense of well-being then we have a reference point

153
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:04,919
for what takes us away from that and what keeps Us close to it

154
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:11,220
and so when we then are settled enough then to begin seeing things as they are

155
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:16,800
um we can see that the ways that we are caught in them Enchanted in them

156
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:23,638
preoccupied with them is takes us away from that well-being diminishes it

157
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:29,099
and um and so of course it doesn't feel good to do it and that seeing that

158
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:34,618
distinction that this one feels like it's I feel more contracted I feel more

159
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:39,780
tight I feel more caught up in my my

160
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:46,800
despair depression upset resentments whatever that doesn't really feel good it takes it's a it's a diminishment of

161
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:52,800
some modicum of well-being that's just being here can feel like

162
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:59,339
then it begins to be easier to question the value of the projections the

163
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:05,760
interpretations the ideas the desires that keeps us hooked and fixated and

164
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:11,760
caught up in something and so there starts to be a process of disenchantment

165
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:20,040
these things are changing constantly moving constantly impermanent arising and passing these things are you know

166
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:26,220
they're suffering that them caught in there's it's cause causing more pain to be caught up in things

167
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:33,300
and there's something about being these things that I'm caught in that are not useful to Define Myself by

168
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:40,320
to measure Myself by and so a process of disenchantment as I

169
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:47,700
talked about yesterday as we get disenchanted in the projections we have

170
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:52,920
then the the strength of the projection the strength of the desires

171
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:58,680
the wanting and not wanting that's behind those projections that enchantment

172
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:06,980
um is begins to diminish and it begins to fade away and this fading away is supported by

173
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:12,240
non-reactive awareness as we become non-reactively aware of

174
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:17,520
what's Happening Here and Now that's a for many people it's a very

175
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:24,599
different way of being than business as usual business as usual as you go about our life is to have a reaction and to be

176
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:30,660
living in the reaction and living in response to the reaction participating in a little bit

177
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:38,180
or a lot or a lot in a way that feeds it and keeps it going and keeps the fire going but we can keep putting

178
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:44,640
logs into the fire it keeps burning and so our anger will not persist as

179
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:50,220
long as it does unless we are putting more fuel in it maybe repeating the

180
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:56,940
story and to ourselves over and over again and um and so the non-reactive awareness is

181
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:04,440
doing something very different it's uh ceasing putting logs on the fire it's leaving

182
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:10,980
things alone and we can watch the fire whatever it might be but a watched fire

183
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:16,380
which we don't put logs back onto it uh you know in a little log little uh

184
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:22,980
fireplace fire or something a campfire will fade away by its would just die out

185
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:28,560
and you can if you have enough time one evening watching a campfire not being

186
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,660
fed you can watch the whole process kind of until it fades away and and the

187
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:39,780
Flames disappear the hot coals cool down and so they can do the same thing within

188
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:47,220
that as we become we see things as they are as we become disenchanted with them

189
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:53,579
disenchanted with their promise and then how they're going they're going to bring us happiness which is a future happiness

190
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:58,800
that's unreliable compared to the inner happiness we know for develop through

191
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:07,079
meditation then the interest in those Fades away the the desires and the aversions that

192
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:14,820
go into those projections begin to fade away and um and that fading away is stronger

193
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:21,660
in the non-reactive awareness that doesn't put fuel in the fire and it's fascinating to watch that

194
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:27,780
process of fading away and some things will fade away quite quickly under the Gaze of non-reactive

195
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:33,720
awareness so I'm thinking you know people sometimes struggle with thoughts and let

196
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:40,320
go the thoughts come back to the breath let go of their thoughts go back okay keep getting caught up until they are

197
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:46,619
told just let yourself think but bring careful gaze look carefully on

198
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:54,720
the fact that you're thinking really see it and some people are so surprised by this new exercise because their thinking

199
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,960
stops some something under the Gaze of attention thinking doesn't have the fuel

200
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,900
that it needs which is often done uh kind of out of sight

201
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:12,720
but to re to have the main fuel be seeing which is no fuel at all for some

202
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:19,859
of these fires things fade away sometimes his fading away is very slow

203
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:25,920
maybe days weeks months maybe years for some things that are quite powerful habits Within

204
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:32,280
and some things can fade remarkably fast at the the speed by which things fade

205
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:38,420
has a lot to do with how much concentration we have together with the

206
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:43,440
non-reactive awareness it's almost as if the more more concentrated we are to

207
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:52,500
some degree um the more open space we have for things to kind of unwind and and

208
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:58,859
dissipate under that gaze of non-reactive awareness

209
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:04,079
and so part of this process of insight inside practice

210
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:09,240
is to allow recognize and allow for the disenchantment

211
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:14,400
they they're no longer enchanted with the things we used to kind of want and

212
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:20,820
think was all about what we had to fix or get and to allow for this fading away this

213
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:25,859
fading away is very important whether it's fading away or the tensions in our bodies

214
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:31,859
and some of the tensions we can relax but someone takes a long time it's just a it's a remarkable what a deep Body

215
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:36,900
Work Can Happen by regular meditation and sitting in a good posture and things

216
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:42,839
begin to relax and relax in a deeper and deeper way and um

217
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:49,920
and then uh things reactive emotions fade away reactive thinking Fades away

218
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:56,099
and I use the word reactive because some emotional states moods that we have are

219
00:40:56,099 --> 00:41:02,760
not reactive and and those don't necessarily fade away the same way they

220
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:10,079
sometimes actually get bigger and stronger because there's more room for them to flow into they don't come from

221
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:18,480
reactivity they don't they're not states that are being fed by the fuels by the by the logs and the fire

222
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:26,060
um it's more like um rather than the light of the fires lights up the darkness uh there's some

223
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:32,520
emotional states Like Loving kindness and that is more like um the dawn where

224
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:37,619
the sun rises and it fills everything and um and it'll be there for the day it's

225
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:44,060
not going to fade away quickly so um

226
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:50,160
so this enchantment what are so what are you disenchanted

227
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:56,839
with what projections what investment of belief and value have you put in things

228
00:41:56,839 --> 00:42:03,839
consciously or unconsciously a lot of this is uh you know happened subconsciously

229
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:10,020
um that we think somehow it's so important what do you invest yourself in that

230
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:15,540
doesn't really serve you that takes you away from this place of well-being

231
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:22,140
trust the inner well-being and then allow for the fading away

232
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:30,960
and so the homework if you'd like for this next day is to spend some time some high quality

233
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:39,380
minutes during the day through the day maybe having tea maybe looking out the window maybe going for a very nice

234
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:44,960
stroll maybe meditating a second time or a third time today

235
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:51,720
and and see if you can uh in the forgiving room and space a little bit to

236
00:42:51,720 --> 00:43:00,599
you know some minutes of a Sabbath some minutes of sacred pauses and see if you do that what fades away

237
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:06,720
if you give time that allows for fading away what fades away from you if you're

238
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:13,800
relaxed and taking a break from the usual being caught upness and engagement

239
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:20,520
take breaks through the day and observe what's happening in you

240
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:26,280
to see if you can see what fades away and how is that good what's the goodness

241
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:34,380
what's the value what's the benefit you get you get from this fading away

242
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:41,760
so thank you for going along here in this Insight journey and we'll continue tomorrow

243
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,420
thank you
