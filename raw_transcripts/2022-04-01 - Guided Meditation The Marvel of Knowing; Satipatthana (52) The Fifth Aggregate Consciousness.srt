1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,960
so hello everyone and welcome to our meditation session

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,080
and we are coming to the end of the week where we're focusing on

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,960
the teachings on the five groupings areas that we tend to cling to

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,080
some ideas some people say these are the five five ways of grouping the ways humans

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,279
cling what humans cling to and um

6
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:37,040
which is a fascinating idea and the last one is people cling to

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,480
consciousness at least that's the english way of translating vinyana

8
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,000
the pali word and for now i want to say two things about

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,399
it as we meditate one is the highlight the miracle

10
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,719
of being conscious miracle of being of knowing what's happening in the present

11
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,080
moment it's possible to know something that we

12
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,118
are remembering and we can be lost in the memory

13
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:20,000
but to really know oh this is memory to really know this is thinking

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,600
to really know this is a feeling this is a sensation this is a thought

15
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,880
to know it with some clarity it's a miracle

16
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:42,640
how did we you know evolution lead us to this kind of clear kind of capacity to know something

17
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,720
and in mindfulness practice what we know is what is obvious

18
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:55,280
to be searching and clinging searching and stretching and analyzing for what's

19
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,439
what's really happening is not the path of mindfulness the path of mindfulness is

20
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,360
to appreciate the simple capacity to know what's obvious

21
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,480
it's almost like the capacity to know that happens

22
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,959
independent of our volition

23
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:26,560
if we are relaxed at ease if we're stable and centered here and

24
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,400
now what a phenomenal thing to be conscious to be knowing what's

25
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,239
happening and to watch the arising of that knowing in the present moment

26
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,640
happen in a certain kind of way effortlessly

27
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,959
it's a wonderful thing and then for that knowing

28
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:55,680
to be wise to that knowing to see clearly what's there

29
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:03,280
and not be fooled by it into clinging to it holding on to it an ancient analogy is

30
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:10,080
someone has a counterfeit coin is made and someone has the and

31
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,319
so someone someone tries to give a counterfeit coin to pay for something and the merchant

32
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:23,519
sees it as you know recognizes that the coin really sees it as a coin but sees it as a counterfeit coin

33
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,360
this is not you know real this is not to be accepted and um

34
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:36,640
so it isn't that things are not real but but the the the clear cognizance

35
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,480
that oh this is not something to cling to

36
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,319
so it's a kind of higher order uh concept understanding recognition of

37
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,439
what's happening that involves some clarity

38
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,840
oh it's kind of like it's aware of itself it's knowing

39
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,200
that knows that it's knowing

40
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,680
and it's knowing that might that has enough wisdom in it

41
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:18,560
to either cling to what we're knowing not enough wisdom so it clings

42
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,160
or wisdom so it doesn't cling so how is it for you to

43
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,479
be knowing your experience can it be obvious the obvious can it be

44
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:37,280
simple relaxed and in the knowing can there be a sense of feeling

45
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,759
intuition that that in the present you're knowing this is knowing

46
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:50,000
whatever it is you know you you kind of know this is knowing like you're walking

47
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,680
and you know this i'm walking now

48
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:03,440
and then is there wisdom or lack of wisdom in that knowing the lack of wisdom is that which

49
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:10,240
when knowing is reactive with wisdom it's knowing which

50
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,360
doesn't react doesn't cling it doesn't resist just knows

51
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:22,680
knows better than to cling so

52
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,960
taking a long deep breath

53
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:40,479
and maybe in deep inhale and as you exhale maybe a audible ah

54
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,639
here you are

55
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,320
[Music]

56
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,240
gently close your eyes

57
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,199
and feel the sensations of your body

58
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,680
each sensation you experience is evidence of life

59
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:20,280
evidence of the animated force of life by vitality

60
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,639
and here you are maybe the whole field of the body

61
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:33,520
feeling it for a few moments the whole vitality as it appears a whole

62
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:40,638
shimmering vibrating pulsing body

63
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:53,400
knowing the animated quality of the body

64
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:14,000
as you exhale to relax the shoulders

65
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,840
soften into the torso

66
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,120
relaxing the hands and the arms the fingers

67
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:49,440
relaxing the belly settling in the whole lower torso

68
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,039
releasing

69
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,400
on the exhale softening in the face

70
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,479
the eyes cheeks the jaw

71
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,080
as if their muscles

72
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:35,080
can relax away from the skull and gently be held by this sack of skin

73
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,959
and relaxing the thinking mind maybe first by

74
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,279
thinking more slowly calmly

75
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:11,640
and maybe also by relaxing any tension pressure in the thinking mind

76
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,839
and then to

77
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,680
find something in your body that's relatively neutral to be aware of since

78
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,160
some sensation like breathing or anything else

79
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:13,760
and feel it know it in the obvious way

80
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:23,920
no need to analyze it or figure it out just the simplest knowing

81
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,760
of breathing of sensation

82
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,440
and maybe little maybe just lightly a marveling

83
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,800
at the capacity to know

84
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:13,720
and as you know the breathing really know it

85
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,200
can you also know

86
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:26,160
that it's not something to cling to to grasp at to be

87
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:32,640
reactive to it just can be known

88
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:47,920
where there's no effort to know it's that simple it's more like attention

89
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:56,880
opens a window in the mind in the direction of

90
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,959
breathing and the breathing

91
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,200
is evident

92
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:28,399
if your mind wanders off in thought when you first wonder off

93
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,879
when you first notice that you're wandered off

94
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,279
be content to know it obviously

95
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:45,360
this is thinking and marvel at the capacity to know

96
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:55,839
the marvel before reacting or clinging

97
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,839
judging just knowing

98
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,160
and then open the curtains in the mind

99
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,240
to allow yourself to experience breathing again

100
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:28,720
and what is the obvious experience of breathing which the mind knows

101
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,399
where the knowing is not effortful

102
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:49,839
but there's a marvel at the fact that there is knowing

103
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:36,120
the moments of knowing come and go

104
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:55,839
we know one thing and then we know it's next thing and then something else

105
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:06,399
we know one thing and then we find ourselves knowing it again a second time and a third time

106
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:15,040
a relaxed mind that's present knows

107
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:22,199
very simple maybe the simplest knowing possible

108
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,759
and we know that we know

109
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,840
the simple knowing of what's happening

110
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:43,919
can be kind of like beginning to slip as you walk across the floor

111
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:50,799
and then you catch yourself maybe a wet spot and you

112
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:58,400
not a dramatic slip but just enough you catch yourself so you find yourself slipping into thoughts

113
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:04,640
and reactions and the knowing is the catching oneself

114
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,080
oh this is what's happening

115
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:19,760
without then getting involved in knowing or adding to the knowing

116
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,200
just the simplest knowing

117
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,919
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

118
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,000
how simple can you allow there to be a moment of

119
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,480
knowing if you don't need don't need to know

120
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:45,279
anything in particular what's happening what's the direct experience of the moment now what's

121
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:52,640
really present that you can know and very simply

122
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,720
not being for or against it

123
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,559
without needing to think about it

124
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,760
just know

125
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:19,520
and can that knowing that simplicity of knowing

126
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,840
be a medium for knowing another person

127
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,600
where another person is allowed to be who they are

128
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:41,799
our knowing does not interfere with them does not

129
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:48,240
see them through the filter of our history or memory or

130
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:55,000
ideas just the simplest knowing of a person

131
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,279
it can be a gift to know

132
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:08,640
without interfering with others without judging them or needing them to be

133
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:16,000
different without fearing them just knowing

134
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,960
the gift is the gift of allowing them to be who they are

135
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:30,000
it's a kind of a gift of freedom of peace

136
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:38,640
maybe people will not recognize the gift

137
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:47,760
but you will may it be that this practice we do

138
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:54,320
is a practice that allows us to give the gift of kindness

139
00:30:54,320 --> 00:31:01,360
freedom peace safety to others

140
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:10,000
may all beings be happy may all beings

141
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,519
be safe may all beings

142
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:22,080
be peaceful and may all beings be free

143
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:30,490
and may this practice of ours contribute to the welfare and happiness of others

144
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:43,100
[Music]

145
00:31:55,279 --> 00:32:01,679
so hello and we come to the fifth and final talk on the five

146
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:08,000
groupings the five kandas aggregates

147
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:15,360
and um so this is the an exercise in the

148
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:22,000
discourse on the four foundations for awareness for cultivating a kind of lucid clear

149
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,640
present moment awareness and um

150
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:34,720
we come the last one is conscious is usually translated into english as consciousness

151
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:41,200
and uh it's very likely that that is not the best choice as an english translation

152
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:48,799
uh partly because i think very few people either know what consciousness is

153
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:53,919
or people who study consciousness can agree on i think there's so many different

154
00:32:53,919 --> 00:33:00,240
opinions and ideas and efforts to try to pin down what consciousness is

155
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,440
interestingly enough it was not a task of people

156
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,480
it's only for the last probably for only the last 200 years or so

157
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:17,120
the way the modern usage of the word consciousness is relatively recent

158
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:22,399
and and so and then around that concept has

159
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:29,039
gathered these different ideas or associations the pali word is vinyana

160
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:35,120
and it's a word that existed in india before the buddha but it seems to have under have meant

161
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:42,640
things like these many translators of the ancient hindu upanishadic texts will translate as understanding

162
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,840
even sometimes as intellect the

163
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:54,640
buddha very rarely defines it and it's possible that the um

164
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,760
the the word vignana is used in different ways in different contexts which makes

165
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,640
it a little bit more difficult to pin it down to what it is

166
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:10,320
the um in the these five kandas five aggregates

167
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:16,480
it seems to be a um a um ability

168
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,520
to differentiate knowing that differentiates

169
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:28,000
so to know you know if you're looking down at a

170
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,520
bowl full of mixed beans red beans black beans white beans

171
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:39,440
pinto beans all kinds of things the ability to recognize

172
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:45,599
the distinct kinds of beans from each other to separate out rather than one big blur

173
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:50,638
of beans separate out this this this so the buddha was talked about being

174
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:56,398
able to differentiate between consciousness is what differentiates between salty and not salty

175
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:03,200
bitter and sweet this does not very satisfying for modern english audience that has a

176
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,640
little more grand idea of what consciousness is but it seems to be

177
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,839
a kind of heightened knowing clear knowing

178
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:20,960
of direct experience and now it's it's related to the third

179
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:27,599
grouping the sanya or recognition consent the concept we have it's related

180
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:33,760
to that but maybe it's either can be more primitive prior to the concepts we had on top of

181
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:39,200
things and um or and it kind of heightened clarity

182
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,240
uh where we know more more with with understanding what's happening

183
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,720
so the ancient analogy that um

184
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:55,680
someone might a child might be given a counterfeit coin and simply recognize it as a coin

185
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:02,079
not realize it's counterfeit a merchant who's expert on how people counterfeit coins will immediately

186
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:07,119
recognize that's a counterfeit coin and so the recognition that it's a coin is

187
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:14,560
there but it's a heightened with clarity of knowing to not this is not real or this is not what we do

188
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:19,839
so the buddha talked about there's these six kinds of consciousness

189
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:27,359
there is the consciousness which is the knowing uh that we happens when we see so so see knowing

190
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:34,720
through seeing knowing through ear hearing knowing through smelling tasting knowing through the tactile experience of the body

191
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:40,480
and knowing what's going in the mind and rather than calling them all-knowing

192
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:49,599
it's so it's a six distinct kind of knowing the six consciousness or six spinanas

193
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:58,079
and now this is in contrast to what some meditators some people

194
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:05,599
some even some spiritual traditions will emphasize what consciousness is as a kind of a

195
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:10,880
continuous unitary field of knowing

196
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:17,920
that they did we're always consciousness always there everything is coming and going everything impermanent but it's

197
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:25,280
all occurring on this kind of screen of um oh that's always there or like you know

198
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,880
the consciousness is like if it was like the ocean then everything else is just the

199
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:37,440
the rain falling on the ocean temporarily there it's um the waves coming and going on the

200
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:45,040
ocean but the ocean itself is always there and just under the surface is vast and still and quiet

201
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:51,599
um the um the buddha seems not to have

202
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:58,079
emphasized this kind of consciousness whatsoever and in fact the more i think the

203
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:04,160
the um i believe more the kind of buddhist kind of at least the theravadin buddhists their early buddhist

204
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:10,400
understanding of with this would be that um the mind there is a con the mind is a

205
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:17,440
constructing activity and whatever this consciousness is that is emphasized in the fifth

206
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:23,440
aggregate is part of this constructed activity it's not innate it's not inherent it's

207
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:30,079
not always there it doesn't go from one life to it to another it is something also that comes and goes

208
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:35,599
arises and passes and and in its arising it's partly a

209
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:40,800
construct of mental functioning it's a condition of mental functioning as

210
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:46,880
opposed to something which is independent of the vagaries and changing nature of the mind

211
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:54,560
itself and certainly in this fifth exercise of sati patana of of the aggregates

212
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:01,040
what the meditator is meant to see is that this consciousness or this kind of

213
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:06,079
knowing appears and disappears

214
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:12,000
appears and passes away and so what we're looking at it is something that's changeable and

215
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,240
impermanent and constant and so what kind of consciousness is that way

216
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:24,800
and what kind of knowing and how is that different from you know recognition

217
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,839
and uh so i've suggested in the meditation that it's a very simple

218
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:34,880
very very simple but very clear so that there's a knowing

219
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:40,079
it's what knows all the other aggregates it knows there's a sensation it knows

220
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:46,400
there's a feeling tone it knows that there's a recognition happening at this moment it

221
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:52,880
knows that there's mental constructs happening and it knows that it knows

222
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:58,079
and you can do kind of can get caught up in influen infinite regress of knowing

223
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:05,359
knowing that i know that i know but don't bother with that just kind of very simple relaxed

224
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:12,240
and then that kind of knowing a sound arises there's a knowing of a sound that arises with the sound

225
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:18,079
when the sound goes maybe the knowing goes or maybe if the knowing goes faster if we get distracted

226
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:23,200
by something else there's uh we see something we hear it

227
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:29,760
we taste something we touch something we think something we feel something and with each of that there's a knowing

228
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:36,319
that arises a simple knowing that's and and the important aspect is not exactly

229
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:42,079
what consciousness is what exactly all this is but rather

230
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:47,280
whatever way in which we know there's a recognition that it comes and

231
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:53,440
goes that it's not constant it's not permanent and as we start seeing it's

232
00:40:53,440 --> 00:41:00,240
in constant nature then we will not cling to it that's the hope that's the direction we're going

233
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:06,400
and so consciousness also can be an object of clinging and sometimes people can

234
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:13,359
easily let go of all things except consciousness if they're strongly identified with consciousness as being their true self

235
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:19,839
as this is who i am and this is how i survive this is how i uh you know will always exist or

236
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:25,760
something and um and uh the deeper the pasta practice

237
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:31,520
goes the less we less we can recognize or find

238
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:37,119
this kind of continuous ever-present field of

239
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:43,680
consciousness because everything is seen is just in its in its momentary aspect coming and

240
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:49,440
going and um and um

241
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:55,440
and whether there is a consciousness which is persists and over time in a sense that's not so very

242
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:02,560
interesting for early buddhism to specify um whether it is or not what's important is

243
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:08,800
in our direct experience as we practice deeper and deeper we won't find it

244
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:14,240
that does not mean we have to decide there is none it just means we don't find it and the purpose for not finding

245
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:20,000
it is so that we will let go of clinging to it and we're trying to let go of all

246
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,960
clinging and so the functional aspect of this practice is all about the end of clinging not to

247
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:33,359
come to philosophical conclusion about what consciousness is or isn't

248
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,480
so so that just in terms of what consciousness is or isn't

249
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:45,599
what i'm talking about today just just barely scratches the surface of a fascinating concept but i hope that it

250
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:50,640
gives you just enough information ideas of practicing to

251
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:57,520
somehow begin appreciating um the miracle of knowing

252
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:03,520
in the simple ways knowing hearing seeing tasting touching

253
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:09,520
um smelling and then the mind knowing the mind knowing things and then seeing how when

254
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:15,599
objects or experiences arise in these six cent stores they come and they go and the knowing of

255
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:22,160
it comes and goes sometimes the knowing comes and goes faster than the object

256
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:27,280
and that knowing can be very relaxed easeful just being with what's obvious

257
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:33,520
and free of all the self-referencing where we get tripped up where we slip

258
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:39,520
where we get caught where we suffer

259
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:46,720
and uh we're pointing here to a simplicity of being with our all our senses all our

260
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:54,200
experience but very very simple and uh and free

261
00:43:54,240 --> 00:44:00,480
so thank you and uh we'll continue we have three more

262
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:06,319
exercises to do before we finish this uh the four foundations of mindfulness

263
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:11,760
and um and uh so next week we'll do the

264
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:17,920
uh the six sense bases and the fetters the knots that get formed around them

265
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,559
so thank you
