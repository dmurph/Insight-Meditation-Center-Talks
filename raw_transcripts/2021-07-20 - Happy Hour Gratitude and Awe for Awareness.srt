4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,760
on friday and it was so um rich so

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:32,238
rich that there was a sense i felt in the sangha that oh yeah let's continue with this there are many many more

6
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:37,680
explorations and a few of you free of you said that so so we will

7
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,040
explore we'll continue with the exploration of gratitude

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:51,840
in pali those who like the pali words and in happy hour for those

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:59,280
who've been listening for a while and coming for a while you know that we each time we try to take a slightly

10
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:06,400
different new perspective on these practices and explore as a scientist of our own

11
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,520
mind to discover something new something slightly different

12
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,439
with a spirit of curiosity as an experiment and an experiment is always successful

13
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:23,200
because you learn something you learn about what works for you what doesn't work etc you learn something about

14
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,400
the practice as well as this as well as cultivation there's always

15
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,479
cultivation happening so so the perspective that we'll

16
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:42,720
take tonight with gratitude is one of simplicity of the moment

17
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,680
so as always we'll start by settling the mind and heart with a few minutes of

18
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:57,439
of calm abiding calming the mind and then starting with just simplicity

19
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:04,240
with the simplicity of gratitude or appreciation for

20
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:12,720
this mystery called life and the invitation the invitation to

21
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,760
play around with is to imagine you are a young

22
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:26,800
child if you have been around young children lately or ever for especially if they're

23
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:33,040

24
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:39,760

26
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,519
the mystery of being alive being here i had the

27
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:58,560
privilege to be around a year and a half old this weekend and

28
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:06,640
it was lovely to to observe the way this little girl was eating up the world

29
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:14,239
the waves of the ocean dipping her waves in the cold waves and just wow this is fun it's cold i'm totally

30
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,519
wet i'm shivering and yet this is interesting the sense of

31
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:26,159
awe wonder oh wonder and with that sense of appreciation

32
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:32,560

33
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,840
impermanent life that is ours

34
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:45,040

35
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,959

all our worries and fears and trepidations and

37
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:02,159
insecurities and want this don't have that greed hatred and delusion

38
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:10,799

39

as we till the soil and prepare

74
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:49,839
for our next practice

75
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,320
as each breath is breathed in

76
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:17,839
to the abdomen the lower part of your body

77
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,839
noticing

78
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:41,040
noticing sense of immediacy

79
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,399
the freshness

80
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:59,839
what can be called the now-ness the now-ness

81
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:13,680
fleeting nowness

82
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,120
as if your awareness

83
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:27,839
is standing at a revolving door

84
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,720
awareness

85
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:41,839
not going through the door past present staying at the revolving door

86
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,880
as the new experiences keep arriving

87
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:57,600

88
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:06,240
like a wave rising falling always

89
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,480
awareness

90
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:23,839
fresh standing at this revolving door

91
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:37,839
the point the point of view of nowness

92
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:51,839
even if the mind can stabilize then this viewpoint for a moment

93
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:01,759
or if it can simply set up an easy chair and just rest here

94
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,839
hanging out

95
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:33,840
knowing observing experience as it arises and passes away

96
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,400
almost feels like a miracle

97
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:01,840
this knowing is awareness

98
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:15,840
and whatever experience is coming through the revolving door coming and going

99
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:29,840

100
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:47,200
sensation or sensations so many of them

101
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,720

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:11,840
chest the whole body

103
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,160
whatever else is arising

104
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:54,720
this revolving door of experience being known

105
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:59,039
in this nowness

106
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,840
other sensations in the body

107
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,840
quite miraculous

108
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,320

109
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,840

so welcome back

175
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,560
so before i open

176
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,839
the floor for reflection and to ask you for a moment

177
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:06,078
to look around your space just look around the room you're in

178
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:15,280
with fresh eyes there's any new appreciation with fresh eyes really take your time

179
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:25,359
maybe look at one object either the process of looking or the object itself

180
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,720
with fresh eyes

181
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:38,240
of appreciation of just seeing the object being seen

182
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:48,839
before turning your gaze back so so we have a few minutes for

183
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:57,200
reflections questions comments what you discovered complaints it's all welcome

184
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:02,560
for the benefit of the sangha what did you discover

185
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:10,880
what a rows for you questions are okay too and if you type them in chat if they're

186
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:18,160
typed just to me i won't say your name i'll just read the reflection privately if it's typed to everyone then

187
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:23,410
i'll read it all publicly you can also raise your zoom hand

188
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:30,240
[Music] and i'll have you a new

189
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,440
question coming do you feel a somatic difference in your body between feeling meta and

190
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:41,760
feeling gratitude um yes

191
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:47,200
i do that's a good question how about you the person who's asked

192
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:52,720
this question i wonder if you like to comment um if you'd like to say more you're

193
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:58,400
welcome to unmute yourself now and if not it's okay

194
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:05,760
you can or you can also ask me to elaborate okay yeah so yeah for me there is a

195
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,200
difference um maybe

196
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,240
where do you feel it ah um

197
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:25,040
all right so it's interesting i've never been asked this question so let me tune in so so

198
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:32,480
with gratitude what i sense um is is

199
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:39,680
um you know it's gratitude and joy i think yeah gratitude they're they're

200
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:46,160
nuances of joy when when i when i practice gratitude there is

201
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:52,880
whereas meta can can have gladness can but it's more

202
00:39:52,880 --> 00:40:00,240
turned towards towards others towards myself so there's friendliness but but

203
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:05,920
gratitude has has more joy in it has more brightness in it

204
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:12,560
that's the best i can describe it right now but then again don't take my word for it see what works for you and i would be

205
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:17,119
curious about your your report

206
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:26,720
bill says it's hard to stay still in front of the revolving door yes that is true it is it's a it's a

207
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:32,480
practice exactly but as long as we if you're able to even stay for a moment it can be

208
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:38,000
so amazing um to even try to stay there and be there for

209
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,760
a little bit nicholas says today was a lovely opportunity to sit with discomfort and unpleasant

210
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:50,880
sensations in the body ah i love how you put that nicholas a lovely opportunity to sit with

211
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,640
discomfort and unpleasant sensations in the body and nicholas you're welcome to raise

212
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:02,480
your hand if you i would love to hear you explore expand a little more

213
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:08,640
if you would with that the sitting with those sensations and this kind of so i'm

214
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:15,040
going to ask mark uh tell you what now actually i'll ask nicholas to continue with that and then i'll go to mario christine so

215
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:22,560
nicholas you're up yeah the the chest

216
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:28,800
was was not aligned very well and so there was just a lot of tightness and sharpness and it was

217
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:34,000
moving around and uh it was

218
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,760
yeah i felt the the the push to try to meta it away it's

219
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:46,079
like oh there's some aversion here oh there's some like why is it contracted it's like oh maybe meta will push it away and

220
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:51,200
there's a few minutes of that and then they kind of yeah there was this this nice moment of

221
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:57,440
oh it's uncomfortable to be in this body right now oh like what is that like

222
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:03,839
and it kind of yeah it just shifted the discomfort didn't go away for the whole set it was an uncomfortable sit but

223
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:09,200
there was that kind of falling back into being annoyed and hoping it goes away and then

224
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:15,520
coming back and recognizing that a version is there and just kind of feeling the the

225
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:22,160
back and forth um and yeah it was it was lovely in its own way

226
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:27,200
yeah thank you nicholas this is fantastic and i want to highlight what you said

227
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:33,920
um for for benefit of the sangha because what you described was so and so

228
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:39,839
beautifully you mindfully observed in your practice that there's this desire to meta it away

229
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:44,960
we often do that like okay so there's aversions like okay i'm going to

230
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:50,640
meta this thing away this unpleasantness whereas when when that falls away and you fell

231
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:58,240
into like the revolving door this is what's showing up right now this this this unpleasant weight enough

232
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:03,680
feeling tone and ex this is what's showing up oh

233
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:10,400
this is this and that too can feel amazing and incredible and

234
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:17,119
just mysterious and it's which you're smiling so i think it

235
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:23,680
sounds like you got a taste of that yeah yeah yes it's

236
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:30,880
there's there's an ease that holds the unpleasantness it's still unpleasant but there's a sense of it's not the maybe the

237
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:36,880
urgency of like needing it to go away somehow that thirst kind of settles down i don't

238
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:44,240
it's hard to describe it's hard to describe but that's it there's the ease that holds the unplug it's it's it it's the ease that holds it

239
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:49,280
it's it's it's still here it's not gone away but it's held with ease

240
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:56,800
that's exactly it that's an important insight remember this nicholas

241
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:09,838
thank you for sharing thank you awesome mari christine please

242
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:17,599
oops wait you're still muted you're still muted my christine there okay for me meta is something that

243
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:23,119
happened happens outwardly from me to the outside world whereas gratitude is what

244
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:29,680
comes in i don't know if that makes sense of course it does absolutely yeah thank

245
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:34,720
you for describing how it shows up for you that's lovely yeah thank you

246
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:40,640
yeah yeah great now there's one more example of that of of and this

247
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:46,800
is an invitation for all of you to now explore this this beautiful question that came through

248
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:52,800
yeah nice yeah and i think this uh this reflection i

249
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:58,160
think from here was meant for everyone uh came to me it is wondrous to sit alone in my sanctuary

250
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:05,760
with all of you worldwide sangha well that's beautiful thank you it's lovely so glad you're joining us

251
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:12,720
and eric make this the last reflection before we turn to small groups

252
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:18,960
i had this experience when i was sick the last time i was asking myself like what if this

253
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:25,119
were to continue forever uh would i be okay with this is there a way i could be okay with this

254
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:32,000
and i didn't know i was like i don't know it seems pretty bad

255
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,920
i kind of had a similar experience today

256
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:44,960
yeah so so help me understand so

257
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:52,240
yeah i guess i just wasn't able to tap into like a gratitude nicholas was saying

258
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:57,280
like how he found like an ease around the unpleasantness yeah yeah yeah i just wasn't able to

259
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:02,480
find that yeah so you're saying there was some discomfort in the body

260
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:10,640
is that oh yes so there was some discomfort in the body and and then did the question come up

261
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:16,079
that what if this continues and there wasn't ease with it there was a sense of overwhelms

262
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:22,319
some helped me connect the dots eric yeah i felt uh

263
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:29,200
i couldn't find gratitude for it yeah yeah yeah yeah so

264
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:36,079
and that's okay that's perfectly fine it's you know the insights don't always arise

265
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:42,720
so so one way to work towards that the invitation it would be

266
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:48,199
this would be to [Music]

267
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:55,839
pull back first into calm into spaciousness and breathe

268
00:46:55,839 --> 00:47:01,359
around the difficulty and see if there can be breathing

269
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:09,359
around this pain this difficulty kind of breathing around it right not breathing it away and not

270
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:16,640
making it all okay but just kind of like it can it be here and can i breathe around it can i breathe around

271
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:21,680
it can i breathe peace around it that would that could be a way

272
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:28,720
to gently you know build a little yellow blick brick road using a

273
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:35,280
different uh metaphor towards it does that make sense what i'm talking about breathing

274
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:41,839
peace and space around the difficulty it does it does yeah so that would be my

275
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:48,240
invitation eric if that arises again yeah thank you for that really appreciate you

276

bringing that up yeah so dear ones

277
00:47:54,720 --> 00:48:02,240

278

six seven minutes and the invitation today is we will start with um

279
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:16,079
15 seconds of uh silent meta when we go into the small

280
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:24,800
rooms of three or four and then after the let's say 15 seconds of meta

281
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:30,559
then sharing as little or as much as you like with each other about your practice your insights and

282
