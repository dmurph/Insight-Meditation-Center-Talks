00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:09,159
uh to continue with the practice of compassion it's it's

29
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:15,079
a challenging time in the world and uh whether we are having personal

30
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:23,919
challenges also um and also caring for others in

31
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:30,039
our lives in our hearts in our minds you can never have enough compassion the practice of compassion of course with

32
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:35,440
stability with equinity with the stable base of care so I like to continue with

33
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:41,800
the practice of compassion um it just it feels appropriate to me

34
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,039
so so let's let's practice together let's

35
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:51,280
shift into our meditation

36
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:06,000
posture arriving arriving arriving in our

37
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:10,720
bodies arriving in this moment in

38
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,520
time softening relaxing the

39
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,479
body

40
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:40,639
taking a moment of Refuge taking this time for

41
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:51,440
Refuge away from the busyness and the demands of the

42
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,479
world first to settle first and foremost to

43
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,479
settle

44
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,800
feeling our feet grounded on the earth as if we were a

45
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:30,520
well-rooted tree

46
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:36,240
feeling ourselves well rooted connected to the

47
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
Earth

48
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:10,960
and we put down in this moment let go of worries concerns just to

49
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,240
become more

50
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:23,800
available connecting with the breath the INB breath the out breath the sensations

51
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:29,039
of the body this moment of being alive however

52
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:37,160
it's showing up for us as if it were last moment on the

53
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:44,400
earth so precious not taking it for granted not just another moment of being

54
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,080
alive in the midst of many moments but appreciating the gravity of being

55
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,720
alive in this

56
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:03,280
moment and really inhabiting inhabiting our body inhabiting

57
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,039
our our Humanity our

58
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:15,879
fullness not the same patterns over and over but really taking our

59
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,560
seat and I take my seat in this

60
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,640
moment relax into it and yet really take my

61
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,480
seat as if my life really matters because it

62
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
does

63
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:39,279
taking a few minutes simply connect with each INB breath and out

64
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:46,000
breath with the entire INB breath and out

65
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,120
breath coming fully present

66
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:44,880
and we settle in settle in more with more gravity with more

67
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,880
gravity feeling our body's

68
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,680
weight presence sitting here in this moment and

69
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,959
time

70
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:48,360
I like to invite us to experiment with a different way of practicing

71
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:56,160
compassion it's related to radiating compassion but a little

72
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
different

73
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:13,600
so let's begin with is the practice of radiating and we

74
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:20,759
find our way into this other way as if your

75
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:24,920
body reverberating

76
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,600
radiating care

77
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,199
through the entire

78
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:52,440
world care that touches you first as it's

79
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:01,839
radiated and as it radiates reverberates throughout the world World in unseen

80
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:08,040
ways it impacts whever it comes to contact

81
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:13,720
with with your goodwi and good wishes with your care especially if

82
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:19,109
they're suffering having [Music]

83
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,519
challenges and brings sucker Comfort

84
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:33,399
ease and again in this

85
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:38,519
practice it's not about magical powers it's about

86
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:44,279
cultivating our own heart our own Good

87
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:56,600
Will and instead of feeling hopeless and helpless we turn towards care

88
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:02,120
compassion instead of Turning Away away from the problems of the world and

89
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:09,038
the problems of our life we turn towards them with

90
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
care

91
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:16,880
and I'd like to invite you to consider the same way that in Einstein's

92
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:25,760
relativity Theory every Mass every

93
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:32,080
object bends the space around it bends the

94
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:41,440
space that's how gravity is shaped and formed every Mass shapes

95
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:47,039
turns the space around it these gravitational

96
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:56,799
forces this is how they're shaped and now imagine that your presence in the world

97
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:03,919
matters through the power of your care your compassion your

98
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:16,120
engagement space of humanity curves it shifts it changes around

99
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:23,200
you and the more caring people in the world there are the

100
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,679
more this shift this curving of the space of

101
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:35,400
humanity happens and your presence isn't for

102
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:44,039
not it makes a difference trust that it makes a

103
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:56,720
difference the gravitational force of compassion

104
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:04,559
shifting a space of humanity simply by your presence simply

105
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,840
by your good will there's nothing you need to

106
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:18,720
do simply have embody the moral

107
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,709
Gravity the moral [Music]

108
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:31,120
gravity of Good Will and compassion ody it that's

109
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,120
all embodied with each

110
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,360
breath resting that it makes a

111
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
difference

112
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:17,679
it helps to add the phrases of compassion please do so by all

113
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:29,880
means may I may all beings everywhere

114
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:39,559
be free from suffering from sorrow from Pain have ease in the midst of

115
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:55,120
it I

116
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,600
care where your

117
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,320
pain I care for your

118
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:25,240
suffering I wish you ease or I wish myself ease wish all of us

119
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:34,600
ease all all of us be free from sorrow from

120
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
pain

121
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:46,559
we move to bring this sitting period to

122
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:54,640
close can we trust that are caring compassionate

123
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:01,200
presence in the world makes a

124
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:16,600
difference by having this trust we can actuate more change in the

125
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:23,720
world instead of feeling helpless taking compassionate

126
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:30,200
action for ourselves for others may all beings

127
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:38,360
everywhere be free from suffering from sorrow may all beings everywhere be free

128
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,840
including

129
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:59,320
ourselves everyone thanks for your practice

130
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:06,600
may all beings be free from suffering and sorrow including

131
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:12,559
ourselves so this practice today we

132
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:20,159
started with settling in the body with the breath and then we turn to the practice

133
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:26,840
of radiating compassion which is something that we've discussed before you might be

134
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:34,240
familiar with and then returned to this idea of

135
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:42,720
of how the same way in in Einstein's relativity relativity Theory where in

136
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:48,519
Mass shifts and changes the space around it it curves space that with our

137
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:54,679
presence with our moral weight of care compassion for ourselves and for

138
00:30:54,679 --> 00:31:03,240
others we curve we sh shift the space of humanity and and trusting that trusting

139
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:12,240
that and in this way it's also not so attached to outcome it's not so so um

140
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:18,480
forceful sometimes the practice of compassion can feel if you're doing the phrases and really attached to them may

141
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:26,679
you be free from suffering may you be it can it can bring more anxiety and and this is a way of actually settling into

142
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:34,360
the moral Gravity the compassionate gravity of of of our being alive in this

143
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:39,720
time and caring caring and that can support and help taking compassionate

144
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:44,799
actions instead of feeling overwhelmed and um powerless so it

145
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:50,279
really it's a way of feeling into the stability the gravity of our

146
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:55,840
presence for more compassion and more compassionate action instead of veering

147
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:01,679
into empathetic distress so that's the wisdom of this practice this is what

148
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:09,960
it's supposed to bring up and again some practices might work for you some may not it's all good keep it if it works

149
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:16,519
for you and let it go if it doesn't so with that we have some time

150
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:23,120
for for engaging with each other in small groups uh in breakout groups and the

151
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:30,440
invitation I have for tonight is um Let's Go reverse alphabetical

152
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:37,240
order first name and the invitation to explore uh each person will offer a

153
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:44,519
nugget again exploring for your own sake the other two people are just holding you witness not not asking questions not

154
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:50,480
interfering not cross talk just holding compassionate witness as you explore

155
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,600
what does this mean to you this holding this this the feeling into your the

156
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:02,159
gravity of your own compass passion and presence um how can be how how was the

157
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:07,679
practice for you uh in this session how can you lean into it what was

158
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:13,399
challenging just exploring for yourself and the other two people will are holding you withness so it's basically

159
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:21,159
you're journaling out loud is you're journaling out loud and other people are not going to ask you questions or

160
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:27,360
interrupt just offering a nugget and somebody else will offer a nugget or maybe they say pass and then you go

161
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:32,399
round and round as much time as you have be kind with one another be

162
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:37,840
compassionate this is really a way to practice um the rubber meeting the road

163
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:45,639
in the small groups first we sit quietly on our own and now we engage it's not about educating impressing showing off

164
00:33:45,639 --> 00:33:52,080
showing up we're just supporting we're curving the space together in this

165
00:33:52,080 --> 00:34:00,559
caring space that we co-create together and it's also very fun so enjoy the the

166
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:08,638
space that you get to co-create with one another so I'm going to create the rooms

167
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:14,480
and I ask you to take care of yourself take care of each other be

168
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:21,720
kind and um okay I'm opening the rooms now here

169
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:28,878
we go

170
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:33,480
hello hello and welcome back so the rooms are closed everybody's back and uh

171
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:38,720
we have a few minutes for Reflections um comments

172
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:45,359
questions so what did you discover what did you discover in this practice and uh

173
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:51,559
yes the chat is open as well so you can raise your hand if especially if you haven't shared in community for a while

174
00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:56,920
um and you can also type in chat your questions and comments if you type them

175
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:03,400
to me um privately if you chat them privately I will read your reflection

176
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:08,880
not your name and if it's to everyone I'll read your name as well Ruth I see

177
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,160
your

178
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:20,200
hand um it was towards the end that we were talking and I realized I love

179
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:28,400
animals and it's so much easier for me to be compassionate with animals and I've seen some dogs um from Ukraine and

180
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:33,720
I just it breaks my heart um the unconditional love that we get from pets

181
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:42,280
is is so incredible and it's so much easier for me to have compassion for animals than people I hate to

182
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:47,400
say yeah yeah thanks for saying that and and I appreciate the courage that it

183
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:55,599
takes to actually say this and verbalize it and and it's great that you know and

184
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:03,280
and your heart has a way in um and for many people animals are easier because

185
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:08,400
we you know they don't talk back right it's it's there's a sense of ease you

186
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,760
know they don't have opinions they're just unconditionally loving they don't

187
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:20,760
you know um so and it's okay to start their Ruth it's perfectly fine to start

188
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:26,680
there and I ask you not to stop there and just to say that's it that's easy

189
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:32,800
I'm just going to start where it's easy and end where it's easy please start where it's easy you and everyone else

190
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:40,720
who might be listening say yeah me too um but don't end there let that prime your heart start

191
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:47,040
with with animals dogs pets start there and when your heart is primed then do

192
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:52,359
bait and switch this is how this practice works you you prime your heart

193
00:45:52,359 --> 00:45:57,440
with wherever it's easy and then you bring in someone who's a little harder

194
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:03,200
and then the fire of the heart we call it like dissipate and then you do it

195
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:08,640
again you bring where it's easy you the fire of yes meta compassion and then you

196
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:16,359
bring in so you keep doing that until it catches does that make sense is that clear yes I see you're nodding great so

197
00:46:16,359 --> 00:46:24,800
please do that this is great that you have a way in it's not a problem it's great yeah any other Reflections or

198
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:32,280
questions and me think about this perhaps unusual way of of feeling into compassion as

199
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:38,760
this the weight the moral weight and and relating it to uh Einstein's relativity

200
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:45,960
which has never been taught and will probably never be or what might be but anyway this is just creative ways of of

201
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:53,319
practicing compassion Mary I see your hand please thank you

202
00:46:53,319 --> 00:46:58,640
um what I experienced in our

203
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:04,760
time was especially toward the end when you talked about trust it was like that

204
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:09,920
that's tough we um and

205
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:17,839
then something else you said and so I'm checking this was shifted it for me in

206
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:28,599
that the way I understood or the way I experienced was the practice of to trust that to

207
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:35,160
practice compassion meditate on compassion extending

208
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:40,280
compassion that that creates a

209
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:45,680
stability that then allows the

210
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:52,400
expression of compassion in in different circumstances and whether they be small

211
00:47:52,400 --> 00:48:00,839
you know like um the clerk at the grocery store or they turn out larger that that is

212
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:06,559
less important it is the cultivation of the

213
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:12,800
stability am I on how does that yeah yeah yeah yeah I appreciate the way

214
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:20,359
you're you're putting it I think um you're you're articulating something that I was trying to bring in which is

215
00:48:20,359 --> 00:48:26,680
compassion together with stability and stability is another word for equ imity

216
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:34,200
because compassion needs to have equinity as a part of it this A sense of so let's call it stability right now

217
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:39,760
stability equinity this presence the sense of presence conviction gravity

218
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:48,119
that helps it not get overwhelmed not get reactive not get oh poor me I have

219
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:54,040
no control there's a sense of stability and weight in it that's what I was trying to bring

220
00:48:54,040 --> 00:49:00,839
in and that's what what I hear you picked up and that's the sense of yeah it doesn't matter how little or how

221
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:07,599
small it is but the sense of stability of it helps it grow instead of feeling small and

222
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:13,960
Powerless thank you I hadn't thought of it connected at all with with equinity

223
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:19,799
so that that's another good place yeah thank you

224
00:49:19,799 --> 00:49:26,280
great thank you Mary yeah Jerry says we discussed recent work showing that the

225
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:31,599
more one has been doing daily mindfulness meditation that uh more one

226
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:36,720
can enter into compassion even for those suffering a great deal and think of how

227
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:45,040
one might help them great I appreciate that Jerry thank you for that reflection rich I see your

228
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:51,400
hand I forget do you go by Rich or Richard either way okay uh I just wanted

229
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:59,480
to thank you for bringing up relativity uh because I so often hear people talk about quantum mechanics and

230
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:07,880
I just feel that I'm lost in a SE a delusion when I start hearing about spooky

231
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:17,640
particles oh that's funny yeah yeah tell you what I might have mentioned this

232
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:25,520
before um but if you want a good resource actually a great book I might have mentioned the book hell goand h e l

233
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:30,760
l g o l a n d hello Land by Carlo relli

234
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:38,880
who's a um renowned um Quantum physicist actually and he speaks beautifully about

235
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:45,640
quantum physics and how it connects with emptiness in Buddhism and U naran's

236
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:52,799
Theory so if you want a an um a treatment of a topic that's not filled

237
00:50:52,799 --> 00:51:00,079
with BS then then I suggest that that book Richard thank you you're

238
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:07,200
welcome PMA yeah hi thank you Niki um so I might

239
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:14,079
my comment might be bit somewhat controversial but um you know the whole

240
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:19,319
compassionate and the equinity it really helps for me it helped me thank you to

241
00:51:19,319 --> 00:51:26,319
you all um you know in giving the compassion to the slightly challenged and even the most difficult one but I

242
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:31,440
think um like today I was a little frustrated because I don't think just

243
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:37,000
having the compassion helps the world that's suffering right um so I feel like

244
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:45,720
it's just for me being compassionate and it's like okay you know um be at peace kind of a thing so um yeah I don't know

245
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:52,480
if we have something to say but yeah yeah so so what you're raising

246
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:58,000
is this concern that oh is is my my practice of compassion is it just for me

247
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:04,760
to become calm and and um uh stable and

248
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:10,720
and and is it desensitizing me even I'm I'm just going to make it even more controversial than than you made it it

249
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:19,359
actually desensitizing me from the the suffering of the world just because I'm becoming calm and it's all good so I

250
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:25,599
think it is important that we don't stop uh practicing with practicing passion

251
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:31,760
with ourselves that's where we start and we need to have that it's so important to have that otherwise we're like a

252
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:38,079
headless chicken like ah I don't know what to do like that is the first place P that's so important so thank you for

253
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:44,599
doing that for the sake of everyone because if you are stressed out and um

254
00:52:44,599 --> 00:52:49,760
and not compassionate to yourself that doesn't make anyone it's not good for

255
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:55,839
you it's not good for anyone around you so it's not a compassionate move it's it's it's not helpful for the world and

256
00:52:55,839 --> 00:53:02,040
yet don't stop there similar to what I was saying earlier don't stop there when you are

257
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:08,280
practicing compassion for yourself being calm and and stable spend a minute or

258
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:16,400
two bringing someone else who's who's having a challenging time or you're having challenges with to bring it into

259
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:24,520
the space of compassion expand your heart don't be content with just where it is stretch stretch a little bit do

260
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:31,559
that was that make sense um yes but um but I was more referring

261
00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:37,200
to how is that going to help um the conflicts and the world that's

262
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:43,799
suffering ah how is that going great great question how is that going to so

263
00:53:43,799 --> 00:53:51,799
you know um if you actually do that part of bringing people who are say let's say

264
00:53:51,799 --> 00:53:57,240
you practice compassion for yourself and and then uh after you have spaciousness

265
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:02,760
in your mind and heart you bring people who are suffering in the world and you imagine them suffering and still your

266
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:08,559
heart has the stability to wish them well to wish them well then compare that

267
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:14,720
to you being a headless chicken and not even having the space to think about them to bring them into your

268
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:20,799
Consciousness right so in one case you're turning towards them in another case you're not turning when you're

269
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:30,200
turning towards them there's more likely and compassion includes the motivation and the the and responding to

270
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:36,119
to suffering so maybe you will actually call your presentative maybe you'll sign a petition instead of just saying oh

271
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:41,280
this is too much I'm just not even going there so it's a stepping stone it's not

272
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:46,119
where you stop but it's the stepping stone to taking

273
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:53,400
action thank you thanks for your question Fernand says in happy AR metal

274
00:54:53,400 --> 00:55:00,200
practice feels gentle to me but in Daily life I resort to it as a quick fix for discomfort making me question if I'm

275
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:08,440
misusing it how can I keep its gentle Essence in Daily situations tell me how if you wouldn't

276
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:14,520
mind because it's I don't want to put you on the spot either and yet it helps me under to answer that question what do

277
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:22,799
you mean if you resort to it as a quick fix for discomfort um if you uh if if you would

278
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:28,160
either put in chat or raise your hand and just create put a little more context because I'm not quite sure what

279
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:33,880
you mean what what that actually means whether actually you are misusing it or

280
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:39,440
not I don't know need a little more information more data

281
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:46,920
here and here I'm GNA ask you to unmute if you want to you don't have to

282
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:54,240
but yeah sorry I couldn't figure out how to okay thank you um I think I mean that

283
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:59,440
I sort of I noticed a an uncomfortable thought or a negative thought towards a

284
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:04,559
situation or someone else and I immediately feel like my mind is running

285
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:10,640
to the breath or to um meta phrases and

286
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:19,440
it feels like there's a little bit of distress in how quickly my mind is running to it got it yeah thank you yes

287
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:26,079
thanks for adding more um Nuance to it so so trust what you just said what you

288
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:32,440
just shared about oh yeah it seems like there's there's a little bit of a distress and just I'm running into to

289
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:39,880
using uh calming myself through meta like a hammer I'm just like hammering out the uncomfortable situation like ah

290
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:48,079
I can't be comfortable can't and um so so trust that so trust so so it's

291
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:55,000
okay so you so my invitation is to um allow yourself to become comfortable

292
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:01,240
able with being uncomfortable can you grow sense of comfort with

293
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:09,000
discomfort um and and be with it really enter it instead of pushing it away um

294
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:14,520
and and it can it actually it's a way to stretch ourselves instead of it's a way

295
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:21,039
of so the way you're describing it again I so appreciate your wisdom like yeah I'm kind of suppressing my negative

296
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:28,760
emotions like I'm not GNA go there I'm just gonna like yeah yeah patch it over with with meta and it is very healthy

297
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:35,119
and and actually it's um it produces more insight if you feel comfortable

298
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:41,119
going into it doesn't mean you cond you don't condone it and you don't act out of it I'll give you an example a few

299
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:46,319
days ago I noticed I was really agitated and and there was this this sense of

300
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:52,640
anger that's coming up and I usually don't feel anger so it's not a very comfortable or or familiar feeling for

301
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:58,720
me so and there was a sense of wonder notic I like I am not quite going in there it's like no no no I don't want to

302
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:04,359
feel angry no no wait sweetheart let's let's check this out let's go into it
