1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:05,800
well good morning

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:15,400
welcome it seems that overnight uh the year changed Happy New

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:22,359
Year I feel uh I feel very very happy to be joining you for the the first session

4
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:28,960
of these 7 A.M sittings in 2024 May our practice this year be

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,440
fruitful I'm joining you now from Insight Retreat Center so I'm on the west coast

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,680
and the the dawn is just starting to break I'm starting to see the Grays and

7
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:48,120
blues over the Treetops wishing you all an eful

8
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,840
morning so we will start this year as um

9
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,719
I understand is the custom at IMC by returning to one of the central

10
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:07,799
Frameworks in the buddh teaching returning to the root we might

11
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,960
say and the teaching we will look at for this week is the four noble

12
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,000
truths let's spend some time setting up the meditation then we'll we'll enter

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,840
into silence together so for this med this

14
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,119
meditation to welcome ourselves into it you can

15
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:40,720
first imagine that you're walking in

16
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,960
forest and say this Forest has grown dense thick with

17
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:53,520
leaves thick with trees and brush and shrubs and grasses

18
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,320
and the density increases to the point that you you're

19
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:05,680
not sure how to proceed you don't know where to take the next

20
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,920
step so the best thing is to be

21
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:23,920
still still with senses open still and

22
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:33,680
attentive and somehow in that Stillness oh a Way Forward

23
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:40,959
emerges you could say we're rediscovering the path a path that's been there all

24
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,480
along now that we've seen the path we can walk confidently

25
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,519
on so I'm imagining some of us perhaps in 2023

26
00:02:53,519 --> 00:03:00,360
became full of concerns and preoccupations maybe the the trees and

27
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,280
shrubs of Our Lives became dense maybe to the extent that we could

28
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,480
benefit from a Paws Stillness and

29
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:17,680
observation so that we can sense our way forward and ReDiscover what path it is

30
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,920
we're

31
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,000
walking so to to hold two Reflections in our mind during this Retreat one or this

32
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,760
sitting one is now that we've turned over a new

33
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:41,120
year what is asking to be released

34
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,920
relaxed or even let

35
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,360
go and then later in the sitting from that space of Stillness not from the

36
00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:01,680
head but from the senses and the Heart sensing sensing our way into what's next for us

37
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,640
let's start there so let's find our way into the

38
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,040
sitting

39
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,600
posture

40
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,000
settling our weight on our

41
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,160
support spine growing

42
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,560
long

43
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,240
we so aligning that maybe the shoulders roll

44
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:35,639
back and welcoming some deep

45
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,479
breaths

46
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,960
already what is asking to be

47
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,960
released perhaps there's some extra muscle

48
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,759
tension but the scale of the

49
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,918
forehead backs of the

50
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
hands

51
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,320
here with

52
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,240
Simplicity present for this moment of an

53
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,120
experience what is asking to be released

54
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,360
here the body

55
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,680
breathing what it is asking to be released

56
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:41,880
and then as it fades as it is

57
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:51,720
released what's the quality of the

58
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,079
absence left

59
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
behind

60
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,120
release and

61
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:01,200
absense what is the co quality of this

62
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:16,399
absence a space where something new May

63
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,840
emerge in its own

64
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:30,159
time no hurry

65
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,000
and in the last minutes of this

66
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:24,840
sitting what is asking to be released

67
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,520
relaxed let go

68
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:36,760
opening the hand that

69
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,360
grips and then

70
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:49,480
sensing the quality of the

71
00:27:55,519 --> 00:28:03,398
absence the quality of the absence and what has become

72
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,440
possible

73
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:18,039
than

74
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,320
you

75
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:12,440
so welcome again seems to be the first day of

76
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:19,399
2024 wishing you a joyful and dharmic New

77
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:28,440
Year and uh as I mentioned it's the custom at IMC uh I've seen Gil give uh the first I

78
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:34,720
think Sunday Talk of the year is on the four noble truths so

79
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:43,039
inspired by that we'll take up that same topic this week in the context of the the teaching

80
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:48,279
lineages of Buddhist mindfulness the formable truths of course hold a central

81
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:56,240
place um the tradition holds that the the formable truths were the content of the Buddha's first teaching after his

82
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,440
Awakening um one helpful thing for us is that the

83
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:07,320
for Noble Truths can be a sort of summary of so much of the teaching or

84
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:14,600
they can serve as a framework that con connects so many parts of the teaching so there's that really big

85
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:20,960
scope and then there's also um I find that the for Noble Truths have this

86
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:26,440
impressive degree of application they can be applied uh as an

87
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:32,600
understanding that's so helpful in a wide variety of um the circumstances of

88
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,840
our

89
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:43,840
life so maybe with the four noble truths in the background um one of Gill's

90
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:49,880
slogans is that if you want to be free study where you get

91
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:56,240
stuck so that means we will have to study where we get stuck and that's that's exactly what the for noble truths

92
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:03,480
are asking of us [Music] um so to start understanding the fornal

93
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:11,480
truths one helpful thing to know is that the um the Buddha the Buddha was one of

94
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:16,639
his names one of his um one of the ways he was referred to as the great

95
00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:22,080
physician and the formable truths are set up uh seemingly to follow in that

96
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:29,080
medical model of his time so four parts you've got the ailment

97
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:35,200
you have the second which is the basis or the condition or the cause the third is the

98
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,840
prognosis and the fourth is the treatment medical model so let's

99
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:45,919
correlate these with the four noal truths the first the first the ailment Dua

100
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:51,440
suffering uh stress we're going to get to Know This Much More

101
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:57,120
Today second Nal Truth uh correlates with the basis the C

102
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:05,960
cause the sometimes the cause the condition this is the arising of Dua and in uh in the dharmic terms we

103
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:13,200
say it's the craving that leads to further becoming and we'll unpack that somewh

104
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:19,080
tomorrow third Noble Truth correlates with the prognosis and that is this

105
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:25,120
wonderful fact that the cessation of suffering is possible the cessation of

106
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:30,519
that same craving that leads to further coming it can end that's

107
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:35,880
amazing and then the fourth Noble Truth correlates to the the course of

108
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:41,720
treatment so the path of practice that leads to the cessation of suffering so

109
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:47,639
you can pretty easily see the the correlation with the the ancient medical model

110
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:55,440
here something that's very interesting and makes the formable truths not just not just an AB abstract set of ideas but

111
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:01,000
locates them in our lives is this fact that each of the four noble

112
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,080
truths has an Associated task or a Duty

113
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:12,480
or a practice and uh as we go throughout the

114
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:19,118
week uh we'll talk each day about one of the truths and its Associated task and

115
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:28,878
today we're looking at the first Noble Truth and its Associated task is to understand or to comprehend suffering

116
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:37,200
so let's zoom in a bit on this first Noble Truth so the task of the first Noble

117
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:42,520
Truth being to understand Dua suffering and

118
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:49,000
stress uh it Bears mentioning here that that it is it's a it's the nature of the

119
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,638
path that our understanding will be partial all the way along until full

120
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:01,040
Awakening it said that if we fully understand in its depths Dua to its

121
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:08,119
bottom then uh that that is um that precipitates

122
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:13,520
Awakening so I mention this now that our understanding will be partial as

123
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:19,160
actually a bit of encouragement that let's not be too hard on hard on ourselves for having a

124
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:24,720
partial understanding we're all doing our best with the understanding we

125
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:31,280
have so to talk about how we might develop in in terms of understanding Dua I want to borrow an

126
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:38,240
analogy and that is uh the Appalachian Trail and I'm going to use this to uh to

127
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:44,119
point to three different modes of developing an understanding so say say you wanted to

128
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:49,480
hike the Appalachian Trail first uh first layer would be

129
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:54,839
um of course it would be great to read about it number one uh you might find

130
00:35:54,839 --> 00:36:02,319
out that the Appalachian Trail is X X miles or kilometers long or that it has these certain

131
00:36:02,319 --> 00:36:07,760
features the second second mode of developing an understanding would be

132
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,839
reflection reflection on what you learn uh you could reflect on the features of

133
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:19,760
the trail you might reflect on your own capacities as a hiker uh and see that this Trail is

134
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:25,160
appropriate for you for right now in your level of skill and this this does something

135
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:30,920
really important which is uh gives us the confidence that yes I

136
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:36,680
can do this so that it's this reflection that really gets to know what you've learned

137
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:44,640
and then gives you some confidence and then the third mode of developing understanding is to walk the

138
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:50,400
path for yourself and this is the sort of cultivated wisdom that only comes by uh

139
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:56,000
let's say getting your boots dirty so similarly in developing an

140
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:03,280
understanding of the Dharma and for today developing an understanding of the first noral truth you can start in this first mode

141
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:10,560
by reading or in this case listening to the teachings um in such a way that begin to

142
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:16,160
understand oh this is what this is what the Buddha meant when he talked about suffering and stress this is what all of

143
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:23,920
these centuries of teachers have been talking about this is it then the second mode would would look

144
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:29,359
like a certain reflection on what you learn in terms of your own

145
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:34,839
experience uh one of the one of the things that this opens up this mode of

146
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:40,319
reflection is this realization that oh the Dharma is right here the Dharma is

147
00:37:40,319 --> 00:37:47,280
right here in my life not somewhere else this is where I can learn reflect and practice it's this actual suffering it's

148
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:53,119
not some suffering in the abstract and then that opens the way for

149
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:59,240
the third mode of developing understanding that is to practice directly walk the

150
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:05,160
path for ourselves the one teacher put this concisely and beautifully that uh it's

151
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:12,200
our problems actually that are our meditation Hall it's our problems actually that are

152
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:17,920
our meditation H so let's go just a little bit further

153
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:23,280
into each of these three this first mode of understanding in terms of the first

154
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:29,160
Noble Truth is to uh hear and learn the teaching so this is a moment when I'll I'll pull

155
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:36,359
straight from the texts one of the definitions of duka suffering and stress this is from uh for those who

156
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:44,640
like the Sut references middle length discourses 141 the Buddha says what uh now what is

157
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:51,400
the Noble Truth of stress birth is stressful aging is stressful death is

158
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:57,160
stressful sorrow lamentation pain distress and despair are stressful

159
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:03,880
ful not getting what is wanted is stressful in short the five Aggregates

160
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:10,839
the five clinging Aggregates are stressful for today I'm really interested in highlighting one of these

161
00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:17,079
and that is not getting what one wants is stressful this is a this is a sort of

162
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:23,079
first Noble truth that it so visible applicable now who of us cannot relate

163
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:28,920
to not getting what we want from time to time and here again we see this

164
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:34,319
characteristic of the Buddhist teaching that it's this it's this duka that's evident and applicable and visible and

165
00:39:34,319 --> 00:39:41,359
understandable just right right here in our lives in in my understanding to broaden

166
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:50,000
this teaching a bit by duka suffering and stress the Buddha means the entire array of suffering and stress from very

167
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:58,880
obvious physical pain or emotional distress all the way to existential fear

168
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:04,680
to death itself and to very subtle perhaps

169
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:10,119
pervasive disease it's this whole spectrum of

170
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:15,200
experiences this might sound this might sound like a pessimistic start to a very

171
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:22,000
important teaching but uh let's remember that um it's right here in our problems

172
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:30,240
that the Dharma unfolds and the Buddha didn't didn't teach suffering just suffering but

173
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:35,800
taught a a path and a an assurance that

174
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,720
its ending is

175
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:46,920
possible so this second mode of understanding reflection I want to highlight especially not getting what

176
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:54,400
one wants and tell you just a brief story um and as I get into the story

177
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:02,040
um yeah maybe a moment just to reflect for yourself if there's been a recent time that um you didn't in fact get what

178
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:10,119
you wanted and then how that went how was that how was that for you my story went something like this

179
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:15,400
and it was about two weeks ago I I traveled to my home state to visit family for the

180
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:21,599
holiday I had all kinds of expectations this these uh Visions visions of days in

181
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:26,960
the kitchen with my my uh family and visits with my siblings and there

182
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:34,319
spouses um it wasn't long after I got there that expectation met

183
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:39,839
reality and they didn't match but presumably on the plane despite um

184
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:45,599
despite my care um uh I got sick a few

185
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:53,040
days after after the arrival I found I was quite sick and had to spend most of the holiday um without my

186
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:59,119
family uh not what I expected expectation met reality and they did not

187
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:04,520
match it meant that I I couldn't be in the same home as my vulnerable parents

188
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:09,760
in all of this vision and expectation these things that I'd been looking forward to they became

189
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:15,880
impossible I wasn't getting what I wanted now right here right here if we

190
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:21,359
really want to pile dooka upon duka this is our opportunity to compound our

191
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:26,760
Misfortune uh so we um uh we could we could

192
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:33,280
um sort of double down on our expectations and make our make our uh

193
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:41,040
desires into demands maybe this is a place where we can see any underlying underlying Tendencies of aversion not

194
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:48,839
getting not getting what we want and just like trying to assert uh that aversion will will annihilate this

195
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:56,359
reality that I'm experiencing or maybe the underlying tendency is to ignore these are all possibilities but

196
00:42:56,359 --> 00:43:01,599
right here right here where we're not getting what we want this is so precious

197
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:07,400
because it can reveal to us oh what's happening underneath the surface and because of the power of our

198
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:13,599
mindfulness practice we know that that bringing a balanced open wise

199
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:19,800
attention to all of the circumstances of life helps to grow the

200
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:27,480
beautiful interestingly what um what's expected

201
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:34,960
and what arises when they don't match actually there doesn't have to be suffering there that's an amazing power

202
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:41,280
of mindfulness that can grow our confidence and this is exactly how we go from the second mode of understanding to

203
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:48,160
the third mode of understanding by stud studying our suffering right here in the specifics of

204
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:53,800
our life right here

205
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:59,160
and we can learn from we can learn from the Dua itself the suffering and stress

206
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:06,520
itself we can learn when the Dua actually doesn't arise when we expected it to arise or we can uh we can learn

207
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:12,400
from that process of being with Duca understanding it seeing it

208
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:18,640
observing it reflecting on it and then watching it fade and let go it won't be

209
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:23,760
here with us forever

210
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:29,040
so uh to conclude briefly the task of the first Noble Truth is to understand

211
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:36,160
Dua and we can practice it in these three modes hearing and learning reflecting and cultivating and

212
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:42,000
developing this is the beginning of an ennobling path of the four noble truths

213
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,599
and we'll talk more as we carry on tomorrow with a second Noble

214
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:52,599
Truth take care wishing you a happy New

215
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:56,359
