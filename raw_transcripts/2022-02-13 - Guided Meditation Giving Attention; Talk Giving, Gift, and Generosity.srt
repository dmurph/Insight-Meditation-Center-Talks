1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:08,080
so one of the with the central

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:15,440
aspect of doing mindfulness practice practicing meditation

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,680
is attention and there's a wonderful verb activity

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,840
associated with attention that i just really love that we use in kind of common english

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,880
we say sometimes giving attention we give attention to something

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:42,000
and so i think that for much of my life i just took that word that expression

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,039
to mean you know the same as pay attention which seems like a strange word concept

8
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:55,760
to me but to give attention has the idea of giving of generosity

9
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,520
an offering that we make and what if your attention

10
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,640
was a worthy gift what if attention is a

11
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:13,680
is a an act of generosity that we do with attention to ourselves

12
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,640
that attention is so precious so so valuable that when we offer it to ourselves offer

13
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,759
it to the world it has some of the wonderful rebound effects of generosity

14
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:33,759
that when we're generous when you're a host for someone

15
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:40,479
that was part of the delight of it is

16
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:46,320
the kind of delightful giving away or giving putting aside some kind of

17
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,439
self-preoccupation self-concern if the

18
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,560
dalai lama came to your house for tea and you knew he was coming you would

19
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,880
probably try to be a good host and if you had a favorite chair that's your chair

20
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,360
you would probably let the dalai lama sit in that chair and if you had

21
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,560
just the last tea that your favorite tea

22
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,720
that you want to keep for a special occasion for yourself but dalai lama comes here i have my best tea

23
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,920
and there's certain kind of putting aside self-concern self-preoccupation

24
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,360
at the same time as asserting oneself in a certain wonderful way

25
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,800
in giving in an act of generosity when we bring attention

26
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,160
to ourselves or bring attention to anything so perhaps for today when we sit to

27
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,800
meditate you might want to consider a way of

28
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,360
engaging your attention that feels more like a gift

29
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:02,239
than a debt that you're paying for paying attention more like a gener act of generosity

30
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:10,319
that's freeing and the giving here have this and it just feels so good to

31
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,560
let go to open up just here have this here have this attention

32
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,239
and then see what happens then do it again and do it again

33
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,319
generous with your attention so sitting

34
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:34,159
in a alert posture

35
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,840
and perhaps with your eyes closed or not

36
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,360
you can allow for a gentling of your inner life

37
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,159
a calming of your body

38
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,000
a calming of your mind

39
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:38,080
and every moment that you are attentive

40
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:45,919
for anything you're doing while you're meditating the attention part of it

41
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:53,840
see if that can be a giving a generosity

42
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,639
so in attending to taking a few deep breaths at the

43
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,919
beginning an act of generosity to yourself

44
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,160
to feel be present for those deep breaths

45
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:21,280
if you relax on the exhale being present for the relaxation is the

46
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,280
gift

47
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,240
um

48
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,479
letting your breathing return to normal

49
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,840
and continuing to maybe relax on the exhale

50
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,960
where the attention given to relax and the attention given

51
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:32,199
to feel the relaxation are gifts you give yourself

52
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,440
and then to settle into your breathing

53
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:20,720
settle into the breathing body your body that's breathing

54
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,280
and in what way can you let it be a gift

55
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,639
an act of generosity to offer attention

56
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:43,440
to this body that's breathing the breathing body has

57
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,240
been serving you for years and years

58
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:58,199
keeping you alive and now you offer your attention back

59
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,479
a generosity that can't be a duty can't be a strain

60
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:13,160
can't be a forceful or aggressive

61
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,160
and attention that feels

62
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:26,039
generous open allowing respectful

63
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:36,800
giving attention offering attention moment by moment

64
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,760
just now to what's here

65
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,920
you

66
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,920
you

67
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,679
uh

68
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,080
uh

69
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,840
so

70
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,120
alright

71
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,080
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

72
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,880
to consider to imagine different ways to

73
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:40,000
offer your attention to others to give the gift of attention to other

74
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,640
people where your attention

75
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:57,840
is attentive not demanding or expecting

76
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:04,640
where your attention is available

77
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:12,480
not assertive where attention is

78
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:19,240
friendly not mistrustful

79
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:28,960
where we begin the default is with a generous attention

80
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:37,158
an offering to be present for people as they are

81
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:45,760
carrying with it a feeling of being generous trusting available

82
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,720
to discover what is here

83
00:33:52,880 --> 00:34:00,240
and in doing so may we see people more fully

84
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:07,440
see them in ways that engender our good will

85
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,000
our care maybe even our love

86
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,520
and may it be that this practice of mindfulness that we do

87
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,240
supports us

88
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:29,358
and offering the gifts of goodwill safety

89
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:35,358
peace and freedom to others

90
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:42,240
may all beings be happy may all beings

91
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:47,760
be safe may all beings

92
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:53,679
be peaceful and may all beings

93
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,399
be free

94
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,640
so

95
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:54,000
so good morning everyone and i'm gonna ask first is it loud enough

96
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,320
here for you people in here and at imc and i wonder if it's loud enough for people

97
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:07,760
on the volumes high enough for people online and uh

98
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:15,040
for those of you who came in person thank you i'm hoping that this is a beginning of

99
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:20,960
uh now of a direction that we start feeling and we can be more open and come

100
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,640
together in community more often and it's a wonderful thing to practice together

101
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:32,160
so it looks like the sound is good loud enough online thank you

102
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:42,160
so today i'd like to talk about one of the core virtues or core

103
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:49,680
practices and attitudes and kind of realizations of buddhism

104
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:55,280
and that is generosity and in talking about generosity i would

105
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,960
like to talk about in three areas

106
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:09,040
that of giving that of gift and that of generosity

107
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:17,920
and if we begin by giving there's many ways of giving and we can give freely and we can give

108
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:23,839
expectingly or demandingly or obligatory there's a whole range of giving

109
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:29,040
but giving in and it's all its forms

110
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:34,640
is really integral to what human beings how they are and how we live

111
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:40,079
and our societies our communities our families often are

112
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:45,680
are held together in a network of giving that without people giving of themselves

113
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:52,960
giving supporting they're probably very little real community and connection

114
00:37:52,960 --> 00:38:00,240
anywhere we go i was really struck as i was raising children here in redwood city

115
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:06,320
that my kids participated in all kinds of uh

116
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:13,119
sports soccer and baseball mostly basketball and uh there was a whole bunch of

117
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:19,520
parents who volunteered their times to be coaches to be managers to the teams and

118
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:25,200
to set things up and all kinds of things and i was struck that this was a really

119
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,400
important part and valuable part of my shield thrilled his upbringing my children's upbringing to be able to be

120
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:36,480
part of the community in this way both both be able to play and have fun and be with other kids

121
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:41,680
but also they felt connected to the redwood city community of parents and

122
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:47,839
you know wider community like they're a part of something bigger than just our family and it wouldn't have happened i

123
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:54,320
think it was if unless it was all these adults who volunteered their time they gave of themselves and they knitted

124
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,240
the community in certain ways together

125
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:06,800
sometimes occasionally it happens as it ha it did happen to me when i started being a new parent

126
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:15,078
i had the thought what my parents did this for me

127
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:21,200
my parents you know you know sacrificed this much or gave so

128
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:26,240
much of themselves you know it's for me that i had no idea that that cloud worked

129
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:31,520
i never thought about it i just kind of took my parents for granted and i don't have memories of when i was a baby so i

130
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:37,280
just you know i didn't think about it but i as a new parent

131
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:42,640
uh you know certainly it was a lot of work a lot of demands and you know up up

132
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:48,079
all night sometimes with the kids waking up in the night and feeding and this and that

133
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:53,280
and when they were could do when they were babies and could do almost nothing of themselves

134
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,960
it just felt for the most part just very natural to give time and effort and all this

135
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:06,160
and uh and i didn't think of myself as being generous but i did feel you know when i when i

136
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:12,960
wasn't too tired it just felt that the light and part of the delight was the way in

137
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:20,240
which uh uh i became in a certain i would say i hope

138
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:25,760
to hopefully healthy way my needs became unimportant

139
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:32,960
and so it didn't matter if uh you know i was sleepy or the next day or tired it didn't matter if i wasn't thinking about

140
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,640
you know that you know the fact that i hadn't showered in three days

141
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:44,079
that anybody would care the fact that uh

142
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:50,400
you know that i was still in my pajamas at 1 pm because there hadn't been any time to do anything else and

143
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:57,200
someone came to the door or something you know all these things that maybe ordinarily i would have been self-conscious about or had ideas about

144
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:02,720
or something they fell away and in the early period of

145
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:08,079
you know babyhood it felt really freeing to have this sense of self-concern drop

146
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:14,240
away so fully and completely and then as the children could do more for themselves then it felt natural

147
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,720
enough and to become more important again if my my situation became something to care for

148
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:26,079
and take care of and and that grew over and now they're not even home anymore so

149
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:31,359
you know just then it's you know a whole different story of how to be

150
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:37,359
and uh but without that to kind of someone giving themselves to babies

151
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:43,040
babies don't grow up very well but the feeling that there's people there caring attending to them is

152
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:48,160
formative even if they don't remember their babyhood there's all kinds of ways in which if it

153
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:54,319
goes well they feel safe in this world they feel belonging in this world that they're not going to feel if they

154
00:41:54,319 --> 00:42:02,480
feel you know repeatedly abandoned and no one was there to care for them and so this healthy growth of people i

155
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:08,640
mean depends a lot on you know it's something you could almost not pay someone enough to do

156
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:15,440
because it's uh maybe because it's there has to be this more than just a job i think it has to be a love

157
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,000
a care that's infused in the giving

158
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,599
it's an epic so the society is kind of kind of to the greatest the extent

159
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:31,359
depend on it here in the united states there's a culture of non-profit giving

160
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:37,200
maybe it arises out of the church religious scene here in this country

161
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:42,400
that where there's a kind of a understood way that of

162
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,760
giving to nonprofits to churches to causes all kinds of things

163
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:55,200
that is kind of absent in europe and you people in europe are certainly generous but they don't have the same

164
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:00,480
relationship to organizations like this partly because maybe the government fills in and

165
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:06,079
there's the governments there take care of people in a much different way more extensive way than

166
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:11,440
here in this country so here's often we have to do it then because the government is not

167
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,079
filling in or not expected to do certain things

168
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:21,200
and uh so uh

169
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:27,440
so the society of giving many years ago i uh

170
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:33,200
in the early 70s i read a study at the biological study of

171
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:39,520
some people's community tribe or something in the philippines that lived somewhat

172
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:45,359
removed from modern society

173
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:51,359
and they were a dream culture apparently one of the central features of their community was

174
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:56,960
focusing on dreams and they would wake up in the morning and tell their family about their dreams they had

175
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:02,079
and uh so dreams were kind of central and but one of the customs they had was

176
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:07,440
that if someone had a bad had a dream about a bad dream or a dream that where

177
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,880
someone in the village in the town uh was somehow the relationship was

178
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:18,480
strained or difficult or there was some kind of challenge there

179
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,599
in the dream when they woke up in the morning they would go give that person in the village

180
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:29,119
a gift what a phenomenal thing to do you know to i don't know what the

181
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:34,160
unconscious is doing you know when it shows a difficult relationship in a dream

182
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:39,920
but uh but the fact that they would respond to that with a gift oh you know what does that do to this

183
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:45,599
community what does that do about the relationships and how people relate to each other

184
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,079
i recently talked to someone who had a very difficult landlord

185
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:58,160
seemed to the landlord was just kind of unreasonable and demands and expectations and all kinds of things

186
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:03,520
and so what should i do when i go back to you know i've been away for a while

187
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:09,520
and i didn't know what to say exactly except the one thing that is kind of a buddhist thing to say

188
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:14,640
i said when you go back bring a gift for your landlord and the person was kind of a little bit

189
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:19,680
shocked like what this person person's so difficult but yeah bring a gift and

190
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:26,160
maybe bake some cookies or buy something or do you know before you go and just bring it and say you know i was

191
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:31,359
thinking about you and my retreat and i just wanted to bring you a gift or something

192
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:38,000
and uh and i've known i've offered this advice to other people who had like difficult in-laws

193
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,280
and uh and it it turns out that it's a kind of a leavening a kind of a

194
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:49,680
tenderizing something changes when we bring gifts that sometimes can't happen if we don't it's people's go they lower

195
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:55,119
their guard somehow or they soften there's no guarantee of course

196
00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:01,760
but the emphasis i want to make here is that giving is a huge part of our lives and

197
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:07,440
for me at least i think i under-appreciated growing up i didn't understand the extent of it

198
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:13,200
so then if giving is kind of in the network of our human connections

199
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:18,960
uh one of the features of that is the gift the gift that's given

200
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:24,240
and there's many gifts that can be given there's a giving of our time a giving of our

201
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:30,720
services giving of material goods giving of money there's all these things

202
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:37,280
that are given given of smiles just you know giving smiles is a wonderful thing to do

203
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:43,040
and that's a little hard with these masks on and uh

204
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:49,200
sometimes i want people to see me smile because i just want them to feel my appreciation delight and seeing them

205
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:55,040
being with them and and i realized you know what a wonderful thing it is to communicate the light and

206
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:00,880
appreciation that's harder with these masks on it and i don't think there too i thought

207
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:06,720
about it too much i just kind of was smiling and just because i was happy and and now i want to

208
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:13,839
be able to it's almost like a communication that's being gifted or something

209
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:20,480
what's interesting about uh the gift in buddhism in indian buddhism

210
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:26,079
is that it's one of the word for gift and ad forgiving

211
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:31,200
is donna uh d-a-n-a and uh

212
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:37,440
and some of the ways the buddha used the word donna were somewhat equivalent but different

213
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:44,079
from their early indian idea of sacrifice which is a different word it say

214
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:51,280
and but he kind of used it in similar ways and so i'll give you one example

215
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:58,000
one of the things that uh in in some of the religions of his time they would make

216
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:05,280
sacrifices to the gods that was a big part of the sacrifice was for the gods and so some of the gods was brahma one

217
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:11,119
of the great gods and uh and the buddha said

218
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:17,839
that your parents and your family especially your parents

219
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:25,040
are brahma so here he's redefining what you know what a god is from some invisible god up

220
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:30,559
in the heavens to people who are tangible in this world people you know your parents

221
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:38,000
they're your brahma they're your god and then he said give gifts to them

222
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:44,880
so rather than giving a gift the offering the sacrifice to brahma in heaven the buddha is redefining the notion of

223
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:50,480
giving to what's happening in our immediate experienced world our social world here

224
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:55,839
now we might not think that very much of this but i think in the ancient world

225
00:48:55,839 --> 00:49:01,680
there was a big change from where the central focus of some people's religious

226
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:07,359
life was all these elaborate rituals of sacrifice for the gods

227
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:13,119
and the buddha was changing it where the religious giving was not the sacrifice to invisible gods

228
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:19,839
but a giving of generously to people who were known and here in their society

229
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:26,480
and so the word dhana has this religious quality in buddhism it's a gift which is somehow

230
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:33,359
carry spirituality in it and exactly how it carries spirituality each of us can find out for ourselves

231
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:38,480
but it's uh it has a heightened value the gift of dawn of the other words

232
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:44,079
forgiving and pali in the early in buddhist language then then donna but

233
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:52,000
often like like the sacrifice were religious in nature donna also has a religious nature to it

234
00:49:52,000 --> 00:50:00,079
and we see that in some of the lists of things that you can give you can give uh ethics your virtue you

235
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:06,960
can like live living by the precepts is the gift of of ethics or virtue a gift of safety

236
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:14,000
you can give your kindness you can give material goods

237
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,920
possessions you can give the gift of fearlessness that the people

238
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:27,680
don't fear have any reason to fear you and uh so these different kind of things

239
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:34,318
that you can give are pointing back to some quality that we have inside

240
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:40,319
and so uh to give and then there's and then so there's uh

241
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:46,800
the giving and there's a gift and and then the the different gifts have different

242
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,839
values and this is where it gets a little bit complicated and often uh challenging for

243
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:59,920
people in the modern west to appreciate some of the logic that's used in buddhism for for valuing

244
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:05,359
having value on gifts and part of the idea of the value of

245
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:12,880
gift giving the gift where you give a gift what you give is because gifts have an impact on the

246
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:19,599
giver we like to think i think often we're kind of kind of be altruistic we just

247
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:26,880
give without any concern for ourselves to have any concern for ourselves that can we benefit from the giving may be a selfish

248
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:33,680
it can be selfish that we have to be on the guard for that i hope but self-regard and self-care doesn't

249
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:38,800
have to be selfish and so one of the things that buddha talked

250
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:45,599
about was give gifts that bring you joy bring gifts that are uplifting that

251
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:52,800
inspire you and uh because you benefited as well so the

252
00:51:52,800 --> 00:52:00,880
gift just goes in both directions you're both gifting someone else but you're benefiting from your own gift

253
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:06,319
so it's kind of a gift to yourself as well so for one of the things he said it was

254
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:13,520
for example he encouraged people remember it's an ancient world 2 500 years in the bronx era age

255
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:19,280
he said give with your hands give directly

256
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:25,520
and uh you know we should stop you know please don't stop donating to organizations you know

257
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:30,800
online or whatever way you do for sure but uh but something different happens

258
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:37,280
when we give in person the i know someone who uh like to uh

259
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:43,440
they used i don't know if it's still the hair but there's this thing somebody called a free cycle and you would post your things you have

260
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:49,200
available someone come to your home and you would give it to them personally and the person said i could go and give

261
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:54,960
it to the good will but then it's impersonal and when i give it to someone directly

262
00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:01,440
who can use it it just feels so much more inspiring and nicer and afterwards i feel and remember

263
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:06,960
this thing oh this is a good thing that's very different than just giving to the goodwill

264
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:14,800
if uh if you give for example ten dollars to someone who clearly seems destitute and

265
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:20,079
challenged in all kinds of ways and then you find out that the person

266
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:25,839
uses that to buy alcohol well maybe it was still useful because a person

267
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:31,760
felt someone cared for them and that's a little memory that someone cared it was attentive to them and they weren't

268
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:39,040
abandoned completely so maybe it had some benefit but but then you gave 10 to someone else

269
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:46,160
you know some teenager for example who's quite poor but with that ten dollars they could buy uh you know maybe they

270
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:53,040
were able to buy maybe this is the old world now but paper and pen

271
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:58,559
so they could write their college essay to get it applied for college

272
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:04,000
and with that essay they got into college and they came to you and said you know that later said you know by the

273
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:10,319
way you you gave me the ten dollars what i did was i bought this paper bought these pens i was able to go and

274
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:15,440
just kind of in my free time keep writing and writing that essay with that block of paper i didn't have any paper

275
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:20,480
at home this was phenomenal that and you helped me get into college without it i don't think i would have

276
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:26,000
gotten to college so there's different value in where we

277
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:32,078
give in in terms of our happiness and our inspiration our delight

278
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:40,240
i think some people really dislike this idea of putting value like that because then sometimes there's a feeling well

279
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:47,359
some poor people don't deserve our gifts and we should just give the places where it's really wonderful to give

280
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:52,640
and you see this in some buddhist cultures in asia i saw it maybe here too in this country

281
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:58,880
where some buddhist centers temples were clearly over the top wealthy

282
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:04,079
and people would come with gifts to the temple and on the street on the sidewalk

283
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:10,880
outside or just you know they've been living nearby are people who are really destitute really impoverished

284
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:17,359
and people would just walk right by them and uh and give to the temple

285
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:25,200
there is value in giving to people who are poor and have a great need

286
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:30,319
so how do we how do we see do we just how do we decide where to give how do we

287
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:37,040
decide what gifts to give is part of the i think part of a considered life

288
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:43,440
reflective life i don't think there's any clear and obvious answers to the

289
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:48,640
question but the buddha's idea that you give somewhat personally so it's

290
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:53,680
you're giving part of yourself from the process and also that you're giving it away that

291
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:59,920
inspires you that brings you delight and joy he also said the buddha said

292
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:05,200
don't give harming others or harming yourself

293
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:11,599
that's also a very interesting guideline for this don't give in a way that harms yourself

294
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:19,280
or sometimes you can harm other people through giving so this is not a call for you know some

295
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:26,559
kind of uh harmful self-sacrifice just give at all costs but to do it the way that you get it you

296
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:32,640
get the you benefit from it and if you give in a miserly way you

297
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:37,839
there's maybe not so much benefit but if you give it a generously way

298
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:43,920
then there's a lot of benefit and then there's uh for yourself and then if you then we go to the third

299
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:49,680
thing today generosity giving gift and generosity

300
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:55,920
that generosity you can give without it really being generous

301
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:02,720
but it's also possible to give with generosity and generosity is this beautiful quality

302
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:07,839
where things are given that are not obligated to give

303
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:13,680
you can give and it's when it's obligated to give and it's just an obligation but generosity can never be

304
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:20,160
obligatory it's always giving more than is expected and more than is

305
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:28,960
called for and uh and so it's a kind of opening up to something that's given from us freely

306
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:35,920
a kind of an inspiration a delight a opening up letting go

307
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:42,720
to give in a nice way from a good heart from a good mind a healthy mind a good mind i want to do this this is great

308
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:49,359
this doesn't harm me this maybe benefits the person or brings joy or delight

309
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:54,720
and it just feels so warm-hearted and delightful to do this thing oh yeah

310
00:57:54,720 --> 00:58:01,119
give there was a time in when i was young where i was younger when i

311
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:09,599
started to do the practice of generosity and giving that i kind of would give not miserly exactly

312
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:15,760
but i would give but i was a little bit tight and closed because

313
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:20,880
i didn't feel like i should enjoy it i didn't feel like i should kind of

314
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:28,000
like like that i should be somehow if i if i felt kind of all good for doing it

315
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:34,640
that somehow that diminished the giving but i've learned since then that this is actually the opposite

316
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:41,119
that the the more delight i have in giving uh the more it seems like other people can

317
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:47,280
feel it's really given freely and generously and i've certainly felt it that way i've

318
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:53,520
i've i've uh received things from people where i felt that you know they were kind of

319
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:58,799
they wanted to do it but there also was a challenge for them and struggled for them and then it was a struggle for me

320
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:05,440
to really appreciate it but then i've had people just kind of wow just like wow that's so easy for

321
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:10,960
that person it's like so fully just clearly offered and then i have a whole different

322
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:16,559
feeling for it oh that's as good then i can enjoy it more and take it in

323
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:22,640
and so uh one of the features of this word dhana

324
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:28,880
in buddhism that in the buddhist sense of the word that's kind of a religious giving spiritual

325
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:35,119
giving as i said there's other words in pali for just other kinds of giving

326
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:40,880
but the tendency is for donna to have a spiritual or religious quality to it

327
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:47,200
and one of the qualities of it is that it's freely given and maybe that's what generosity means

328
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:55,440
but uh it's freely offered with kind of kind of with no expectations of an exchange

329
00:59:55,440 --> 01:00:00,960
but perhaps with an expectation that this is healthy and good for

330
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:08,640
everyone involved including oneself that some we benefit from it ourselves

331
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:14,480
and uh that somehow it it feeds the good qualities it nurtures the best qualities

332
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:19,760
of our heart you know to to

333
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:25,599
be generous supports generosity in ourselves and if generosity feels like a

334
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:30,880
warm-hearted kind of offering and opening and letting go

335
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:37,119
then uh you know we benefit and we see this little bit with the the

336
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:42,319
pali word for generosity it's uh

337
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:48,640
paulie word is chaga c-a-g-a and uh

338
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:56,559
the uh first meaning in the dictionary is not generosity but it's uh letting go

339
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:03,280
or and then the second definition has to do with generosity

340
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:09,440
but it makes some sense when you give something you're also letting it go

341
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:15,920
and uh so rather than calling it letting go uh we could use the languages like giving

342
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:22,160
up giving over because then it has the word giving in it which since the chaga has both that

343
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:29,359
meaning remains to renounce something and jim being generous and how this becomes beautiful is that

344
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:36,400
uh is it when the letting go when the giving up is so freely and

345
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:42,000
and unrestrainedly given that it just feeds a lightness an

346
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:48,000
openness a a softness a warmth

347
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,040
to of to ourselves like our heart begins to sing because of in the letting go and

348
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:59,680
the freedom letting go is not supposed to diminish us but to enhance beautiful qualities

349
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:05,039
within it there's a story from the

350
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:11,760
two stories from the ancient indian tradition of uh uh you know there's a in buddhism

351
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:18,000
traditionally there's all these ideas that you make a lot of merit make good karma for yourself if you give

352
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:24,400
and there are these two people who uh were friends and they wanted to acquire lots of good merit for themselves build

353
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:31,520
up their store of merit so they decided why don't we just give back and forth

354
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:37,760
i'll give you something then you give it to me and i'll give it to you

355
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:47,720
and um and so when they died they got reborn as poisoned wells

356
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:54,079
they were kind of poisoning each other doing that rather than doing something really good it's

357
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:59,520
and then there's a story of a of a monk who had been given a golden

358
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:05,359
begging bowl and uh and he was going to go to sleep one time

359
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:11,440
in a grove of trees and he noticed a thief was lurking behind the trees seemingly to wait for

360
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:16,880
him to fall asleep so he could come and pick up the bowl and steal it so

361
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:24,559
the mug sat up and said hey come over here and he handed him the bowl here this is for you you can have it

362
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:30,240
and the guy was so happy he got the golden ball he ran off and you know didn't have to steal it he was

363
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:36,400
given and then he came back the next morning he came back into the monk and said

364
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:42,319
uh i've never known anyone to give so freely and not be attached to what they

365
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:49,039
have and you were so open-handed in how you gave it to me and without attachment to this wealth this thing

366
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:54,559
how did you manage to do that and then the thief became the hmong student

367
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:59,680
and then they ever lived they lived happily ever after i guess

368
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:05,440
and uh so these are fables but uh they point to something

369
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:11,440
and so this month being able to give so generously uh was inspiring for the thief

370
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:18,799
but the way that the buddhism understands the ecology of the heart of the mind

371
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:25,119
the book was also benefiting from that something was opening and freeing and being supported

372
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:30,240
in the person who'd benefit who was giving as well and one of the ways that this is

373
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:35,440
discussed in the ancient tradition or you know in buddhism is that

374
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:41,520
one of the purposes of giving when it's done well generously maybe in a certain kind of

375
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:48,559
selfless way uh is that it beautifies the mind

376
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:55,200
isn't it so giving that beautifies your mind so isn't that great if you're it's kind of

377
01:04:55,200 --> 01:05:00,720
great if you're kind of selfish but you realize you can't be selfish so you give up your selfishness

378
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:07,440
so you can so that you can give freely so you can get this benefit of getting a

379
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:13,280
beautiful mind it's a strange logic right but sorry

380
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:19,280
but uh this idea that uh you know that's if you give cleanly and openly and

381
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:26,799
freely it does something for us and the reason to emphasize that

382
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:32,799
is that it's good to be available for the

383
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:40,160
nourishment the support the benefit that comes internally when we do good things

384
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:47,440
we count we're important as well and allowing ourselves to benefit to grow in

385
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:54,000
the dharma to grow in good qualities and skillful qualities grow in wholesomeness

386
01:05:54,000 --> 01:06:01,119
is one of the great things to do human life it's how we can mature as a as an adult as a practitioner

387
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:07,039
and you mature more if you allow yourself to feel

388
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:12,720
to be present for the the benefits

389
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:18,319
present for how things shift internally in a good direction

390
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:24,400
so if your generosity is such that uh you

391
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:30,160
uh you know if you do it miserably then maybe

392
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:36,880
there's not that warmth that nourishment and wholesomeness inside but if you give freely and openly you

393
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:42,558
learn that way then something inside benefits

394
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:49,839
and that's kind so what makes it spiritual in buddhism i propose

395
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:56,160
is that its generosity is offered freely and openly

396
01:06:56,160 --> 01:07:02,480
it's offered wisely with some some attention to the consequence of giving and who you're

397
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:08,960
giving to and why and where it's inspiring and it's giving that also supports the

398
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:16,000
growth of wholesome beneficial beautiful qualities of mind of heart

399
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:22,960
for yourself and for others and the protection that provides from

400
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:30,240
selfishness when you're concerned with beautifying your mind is that selfishness is

401
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:35,359
if i'm allowed to use this maybe you'll forgive me or you'll reword it uh

402
01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:40,839
uglifies the mind you know it it sullies the mind to be

403
01:07:40,839 --> 01:07:47,760
selfish and so as we kind of get a sense of this beautiful open clarity

404
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:54,480
luminosity of the heart the mind the warmth the glow you'll feel that the selfishness

405
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:59,760
contracts it clouds it over

406
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:06,319
and so there's this wonderful way that attending to the beauty of your own inner life

407
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:14,240
supports greater and greater freedom and so when you're going to sleep in a

408
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:19,600
grove of trees with your golden bull next to you

409
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:25,359
and someone clearly wants it maybe it's easy for you

410
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:32,318
to let them have it to give it to them and one of the gifts of that

411
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:37,440
is that they um the person doesn't get the bad karma of

412
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:44,798
stealing you save them from that karma by giving it first

413
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:53,838
so giving gift and generosity

414
01:08:53,920 --> 01:09:00,480
the word for generosity also means to let go to renounce and it's a very special

415
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:07,838
meaning in buddhism very special kind of part of the let it deep letting go of of liberation

416
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:15,678
so finally i like to say that this

417
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:21,679
idea of giving is also a practice in buddhism

418
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:28,560
and what that means is that sometimes it's useful to give even when you don't feel like it

419
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:35,359
because it begins to be it can be a mirror to understand ourselves better

420
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:42,000
to understand where we're holding on where we're afraid where we're uh where we're calculating

421
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:48,480
in all kinds of ways about why we should give and how we should give and you know all this you know

422
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:54,159
and to give where it feels difficult to stretch in order to learn more about ourselves

423
01:09:54,159 --> 01:10:00,840
and to learn what it's like to let go and to trust what we're what we're doing

424
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:08,480
so for example there's all kinds of ways we can practice jet practice generosity

425
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:14,880
you can practice generosity driving a car where you always give someone your practice is no matter what you

426
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:21,040
always give the other person the right of way it's kind of generosity you never force yourself

427
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:26,880
even if it seems like you know it's your right or something but you kind of practice it could be that

428
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:33,280
you uh you know you see that the

429
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:40,320
you're in the store and there's the question is in the supermarket which line checkout line do you stand in

430
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:45,840
and normally you might calculate you know where's the one that's going to go fastest the shortest for me

431
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:52,880
and you see one up ahead you see someone else is heading there too you're slightly ahead so you clearly you

432
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:59,280
can get there first and you get it what's that generous thing to do most people are eager to get through

433
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:04,480
those lines you have it you hold back and let the

434
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:10,080
person have it and find another one these are simple things to do maybe but you do it as a practice

435
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:15,920
means you do it so you can study yourself and learn what's going on and stretch something and

436
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:22,159
discover how you're challenged by it and and see is it really necessary what you're holding on to and you're holding

437
01:11:22,159 --> 01:11:28,239
on to more than just you know who knows what you're holding on to discover

438
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:33,840
another nice practice is to take i don't know if it wasn't again these things don't work so well anymore our

439
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:39,679
society is changing so much maybe but uh worked better before when uh

440
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:45,600
to carry with you some significant amount of cash when people weren't so it was much more

441
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:51,679
of a cash economy i guess and uh and i don't know what's a lot money but

442
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:58,560
20 or 50 cash or something and then uh you have the practice of looking at

443
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:05,760
studying as you go through your days of uh of someone you can give it to

444
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:11,679
that you don't know something you can give it to that just seems like okay this person i think i'll

445
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:18,000
give it to and uh and then see what comes up and maybe you never give it but the lot

446
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:23,040
came up and you learned a lot about yourself in the process or maybe you do and

447
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:31,280
and then you learn some things and maybe you learn that well that was a mistake but uh it is a practice to do as well

448
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:36,880
and uh and it's a practice that supports the exploration

449
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:42,960
of the beautiful possibilities of giving of gift

450
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:48,719
of beautifying the mind and the most profound reason in buddhism to give

451
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:55,920
is to discover how to be free not to be clinging to anything

452
01:12:57,199 --> 01:13:02,320
so giving gift and generosity

453
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:08,000
are three topics that are well worth reflecting on living with

454
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:14,960
focusing on as part of the wider world of practicing mindfulness

455
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:21,520
so thank you and uh

456
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:26,560
and then coincidentally uh

457
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:32,640
nancy came up to me before this talk and and was just mentioned there's an opportunity for some people to do

458
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:39,280
something generous here at imc and she was going to ask for some volunteers and do you want to ask

459
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:45,520
do you need to use the mic or maybe maybe let's get them let's get the mic and that way at least the people

460
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:50,000
online can also hear otherwise they're going to be curious

461
01:13:52,159 --> 01:14:00,760
thank you thank you if i could get five or six people to help

462
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:09,280
i think the battery is low is the green light on

463
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:14,880
to help outside to pick up trash and sweep and do a little weeding

464
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:21,520
for like 15 minutes i think we could get a lot done so they can meet you just out in the

465
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:27,120
hallway there in that bigger hole actually if you can meet me out in the parking lot just out the back

466
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:35,040
door would be great when you get your shoes on i also have gloves for picking up trash

467
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:40,760
great so thank you all and uh

468
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:49,360
wish you all well and that the world where we giver and gift

469
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:56,640
and receiver maybe are all interpenetrating each other all mutual

470
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:03,440
and all kind of disappear in each other can we really can we really tell what is the gift what is the gift and

471
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:11,400
what is the receiver so thank you
