00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,820
clouds greetings to you wherever in the world you are dear Sangha it's lovely to

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:34,260
see you um on the chat joining happy making

6
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:40,379
so so we're going to continue our exploration today we've been exploring

7
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:48,239
the theme of life as Improv and uh today the theme we're going to

8
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:55,140
explore is the theme of non-attachment to outcome non-attachment

9
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:02,340
to outcome a very um um Buddhist

10
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:10,200
um frame which also shows up in in improv too so so as we explore it in our

11
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:18,600
meditation here is the invitation to consider because often we think of non-attachment to outcome in our life

12
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:25,140
as a teaching but what if we actually bring it into the frame of our

13
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:31,320
moment-to-moment experience moment to moment training uh as we train ourselves

14
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:39,020
in meditation and sometimes it can be confusing for for people when we when we talk about

15
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:45,659
non-attachment to outcome when we're meditating um the question comes out well do I just

16
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:54,299
sit willy-nilly let anything come up no not exactly we have a particular

17
00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:01,259
perspective we have a particular way attitude way uh a bigger container but

18
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,780
in the small ways whatever arises we have flexibility we are not attached to

19
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,239
okay I want a deep state of concentration now and needs to happen and if it doesn't happen if thoughts

20
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:18,200
arise then we're destroyed and and angry at ourselves at

21
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:25,980
circumstances but there is flexibility of oh okay this is what's arising right now how can I skillfully work with this

22
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:32,580
what what kind of a gift what gift does this quote-unquote distracting thought have

23
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,739
in this moment to teach me something to teach me to train me how to work with it

24
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:45,720
so non-attachment to outcome within a larger framework of of our heart having

25
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,720
an aspiration having an aspiration having an intention but

26
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:57,360
not attachment to moment-to-moment outcome having flexibility within that

27
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,720
so the bigger container and the moment to moment so so with that

28
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,760
let's practice together let's meditate together and all relate it and then I'll

29
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,800
look at this through the frame of improvising our life from that frame and

30
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,220
relate and connect the two together may be of service

31
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:24,560
so let us arrive let us arrive

32
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:30,319
with the aspiration with the intention

33
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:42,260
of connecting connecting to ourselves

34
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:51,019
connecting to goodness cultivating goodness

35
00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:04,459
cultivating wise choices wisdom kindness in this moment

36
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:15,860
with the aspiration for service for peace for freedom

37
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:26,419
aspirations for not suffering and not causing others suffering

38
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:35,520
as much as possible aspiration for flexibility

39
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:42,020
for ease for gentleness

40
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,160
and any personal aspirations you have In This Moment In Time

41
00:04:53,160 --> 00:05:00,259
for your life please add them bring them in them

42
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,000
and let these intentions aspirations

43
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:43,580
imbue your heart space of our mind in this practice

44
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:56,240
aspirations not expectations expectations can be tight

45
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:14,100
then aspirations there's a lot of room for gentleness and wisdom

46
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:23,160
expectations are demanding and give rise to self-judgment

47
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:28,520
so let there be aspiration in every moment

48
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:35,720
connecting with the breath with the body

49
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:41,360
receiving whatever arises In This Moment

50
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,459
reconnecting with aspiration

51
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:14,180
letting aspiration be nourishing calming

52
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,040
enlivening

53
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:34,699
Let There Be aspiration without a fixed detachment

54
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,519
in your heart your mind be like water

55
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:53,180
flexible

56
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:20,660
finding other ways to be wise sort of budding budding heads with

57
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:26,300
challenges of finding ways to be wise

58
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,800
kind to yourself

59
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,399
foreign

60
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:18,240
what if we dropped in aspiration for not suffering but be more daring aspiration for

61
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,700
happiness the Patel was known as the happy one

62
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:30,839
operations for happiness for joy without attachment to outcome that we

63
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:38,000
need to have Joy by just dropping it in it's an aspiration

118
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:07,799
um is uh life as Improv Buddhist teachings that actually they

119
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:13,500
are are infused in in the practice of

120
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:18,720
improv comedy as as a practice not just as a as

121
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:24,960
you know it can look like an explosion of of hilarity and fun which it can be

122
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:33,260
it is but yet it's it's a it's an internal practice um to to really make that happen

123
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:39,240
to The Observer to the eye of the Observer and we we've talked about the

124
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:47,760
first day we talked about the attitude of this this this sense of lightness the the bringing of of emptiness with

125
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:54,480
fullness this sense of life as infinite game as an infinite play the slightness

126
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:01,740
of co-creating yesterday we talked about yes and yes

127
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:10,220
and this meeting meeting the moment was yes and and adding to it instead of no

128
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:16,980
blocking blocking life blocking energy and being in conflict with what is which

129
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:21,920
never helps and today

130
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:29,220
as introduced in our practice the idea of having an aspiration having a sense a

131
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:34,440
frame and a non-attachment non-attachment to outcome in the moment

132
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:42,000
because attachment to outcome of wanting things to be a particular way in a particular moment is this this tightness

133
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,520
can can make our time our hearts really tied our our hearts heavy our bodies

134
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:52,680
heavy there's a sense of heaviness instead of oh finding possibility

135
00:35:52,680 --> 00:36:00,000
finding like like being like water our hearts and Minds being like water finding possibilities

136
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,820
um that oh okay my my aspiration is is this and yet in this moment okay this is

137
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:12,480
what's arising um instead of being in conflict with it what can I can I

138
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:19,079
um accept what is can I accept what is still keeping with the aspiration but

139
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:24,300
not attaching to a particular outcome in this in in the way I imagined it to be

140
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:30,780
so okay so this is the Buddhist frame and now let me switch for a moment to The Improv

141
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:36,000
frame so that we look at it from a slightly different frame for a moment especially because improv is really

142
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,400
relational mindfulness that's how I see it it's relational mindfulness it

143
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:46,619
um it it's how we really interact with others with the sense of lightness and

144
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:52,440
all these other um aspirations so

145
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:58,740
so the the the word that

146
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:07,440
uh Keith Johnstone who's a seminal um teacher in in improv and the author

147
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:15,359
of the um the book empro uh the way that one one many many

148
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:21,839
Concepts really many beautiful Concepts that are related and this concept the way he brings it in the word he uses is

149
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:29,520
chivalry chivalry and chivalry is really non-attachment to ideas in relational uh

150
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,579
improver relational mindfulness so this is how he defines it

151
00:37:34,579 --> 00:37:41,820
chivalry means not clinging to your own ideas your own status because in different

152
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:49,020
games you know people assume a status you know maybe their higher status or lower status that's another concept from

153
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:56,160
from um improv or even your own life as a character you know so basically Cheryl

154
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:03,060
Remains Not clinging to your own ideas chivalry is daring to give up control

155
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:09,599
players should allow themselves to be changed by other players be happy to be

156
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:15,960
forced to change and change such an interesting concept right in in

157
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:21,839
this relational uh way of being in this really improv or

158
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:28,140
relational mindfulness so so the way this shows up is say if you are an

159
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:33,540
improviser and again we're all improvisers in our lives we improvise everything

160
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:38,940
um but saying in in an improv scene if two improvisers show up and one

161
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:48,359
improviser has this idea of okay this scene is going to go in this direction so they say something like oh I'm I

162
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:54,839
don't know I'm tired today and then expecting something else from the other person like oh yeah this is what this

163
00:38:54,839 --> 00:39:03,660
scene is going to be about person a has that idea but person B has maybe a different idea so if person B says oh

164
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:08,880
um oh I'm sorry you're tired let's let's you know go and rest I'll put this

165
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:16,800
person a had a different idea I thought maybe this person B would say oh let's go and then play anyway the point being

166
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,920
um if we if we stick to our idea idea if we are not chivalrous if if we are if we

167
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:29,339
cling to the way a scene needs to be then there is a block and this person is pulling this way this person is pulling

168
00:39:29,339 --> 00:39:36,240
that way it's like ah life is pulling that way this person is pulling that way uh there's a lot of conflict what if

169
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:42,720
like what if and the invitation is say okay well that's the idea I had but ah

170
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:50,599
not attachment to outcome chivalry in the Big Frame the Big Frame the aspiration here is is

171
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:55,800
lightness a co-creation it's a co-creation with kindness with chivalry

172
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:01,140
is the bigger frame so without attaching with my idea that yes we're definitely

173
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:08,760
going to go and play but oh no the scene is going to be about something else okay let me be changed let me open up to what

174
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:14,760
this invitation is and see how within the frame of my aspiration aspiration

175
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:20,339
and the scene how this can how can I be changed and shifted and then the other

176
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:28,020
person with the same idea will be shifted and changed so if both people are willing to be shifted and changed

177
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:34,200
and play and co-create together it becomes beautiful in improv the scene

178
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:41,700
becomes fun watchable it becomes joyous whereas if the two people are stuck in

179
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:47,520
there like they're pulling it to go this way and this other person is pulling it to go this way and budding is like Ugh

180
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,680
it's torture to witness it's really torture to witness and also feels

181
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:57,839
torturous um internally he's like you just keep putting this like attachment this is the

182
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:04,740
way this is the idea I had just ah chivalry so so again now back to

183
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:10,980
the end of course this is all within still the Buddhist dream the Buddhist teachings of

184
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:18,960
non-attachment and and within within our practice especially relationally as both

185
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:26,839
as we relate to a moment so we have this aspiration for waking up for for causing

186
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:32,460
causing as little harm as possible causing no harm uh Letting Go a hair as

187
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:39,000
as little as possible freedom and and we have these ideas and and especially

188
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:46,079
relationally we have some ideas as to how something's going to go and then oh it's not going to go that way okay so

189
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:51,900
how instead of instead of digging our heels in like this is the idea I had

190
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:57,140
this is what I thought we were going to do today like can we be flexible okay

191
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:02,240
all right begin within the frame it doesn't mean that we're going to to

192
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:09,000
compromise our integrity it's not compromising our integrity in any way at

193
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,940
all but within that frame can we be flexible can there be flexibility

194
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:20,820
both relationally and in our minds and actually that it's flexibility and

195
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:27,780
finding ways to to work with challenges with the

196
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:34,980
hindrances with our suffering instead of digging our heels in it's not going the way I wanted it to go it's not the way I

197
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:41,640
want it to be a different way we get stuck we get more and more stuck in our suffering

198
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:47,579
um can we say yes yes and okay yes this is what's being offered in this moment

199
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:52,980
it's not exactly what I had in mind um I I wasn't planning on getting sick

200
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:59,099
and or having body aches or this or that or I don't know the storm happening yeah

201
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:05,700
like this is not exactly but yes and okay this is what's happening and what is the wise way to open to it

202
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:11,700
wholeheartedly to wholeheartedly with wisdom kindness with integrity and

203
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:19,500
without attachment to outcome with aspiration keeping the aspiration but without this fixed view that things have

204
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:25,560
to be in a particular way so so I'll give one quick final example say not

205
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:31,140
just relationally but say in your practice say a hindrance or Rises okay hindrance

206
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:38,579
of sleepiness arises if you have a stance of no it's like oh

207
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:46,079
sleepy sleepiness I hate it I'm a bad meditator it's as terrible this is awful I'm awful

208
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:51,839
nurses another way to work with sleepiness is yes and okay yes this is a

209
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:59,280
different state of mind okay sleepiness is here it doesn't mean succumbing to it but it means okay how can I wisely work

210
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,619
with this so one can actually study sleepiness it can still be here but one

211
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:09,720
can say yes and let me study what is happening in my body what's happening in

212
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:15,599
my mind what is this like can I be aware and and

213
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:21,180
um have awareness kind awareness in every moment and actually you might fall

214
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:26,700
asleep for a millisecond if you're aware and it will be a very deep restful sleep

215
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:33,740
in the middle of your meditation then you wake up completely refreshed um and you'll be you you would have

216
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:40,020
cultivated this this this ability to be with the hypnagogic state

217
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:46,500
mindfulness instead of resisting it resisting it resisting it and res and finishing your meditation feeling

218
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:53,280
terrible exhausted and and angry so there is this yes and can be such a

219
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:59,700
helpful stance internally with that with whatever is arising internally as well

220
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:07,339
as relationally in in improv in in improvising Our Lives

221
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:12,540
so thank you all for your practice for your

222
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:20,160
attention for showing up supporting yourself and being open to to exploring this this these different Con well

223
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:25,319
similar and slightly different concepts of to bring in some freshness some

224
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:30,599
freshness some different perspective as to how to improvise Our Lives internally

225
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:36,960
externally with the perspective with the aspiration for cultivating kindness and

226

228
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:59,280
um in relational whenever you have a relational um relational so internally can you have

229
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,619
chivalry can you have non-attachment to ideas aspiration Integrity but not

230
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:11,220
attachment can you find ways to be flexible and see how that feels internally versus digging your heels and

231
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:17,780
it's got to be this way I don't like the way it is um so
