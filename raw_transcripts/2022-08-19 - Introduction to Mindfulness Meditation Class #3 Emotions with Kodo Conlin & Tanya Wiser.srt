00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,720
welcome back and welcome for the first time david

2
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,239
come on in make yourself comfortable um

3
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:40,320
so hello youtube people out there welcome

4
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:48,800
if you have questions along the way feel free to place them in the chat and we'll be checking in that periodically

5
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:58,359
so how was your practice this week

6
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,400
invited you to you know continue to sit

7
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:11,119
every day right um let's see there was an invitation to

8
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:16,560
spend a couple hours with your body being aware of your body as you were

9
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,280
engaging

10
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,960
what else were you invited to do anybody remember my homework assignments

11
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:36,079
mindful eating have a meal mindfully great so i'm jogging your memory and then i'll

12
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:43,840
also sort of summarize a few of the key things that we focused on last week in the class

13
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,200
at least they were key to me and one was

14
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,040
that sensations are the language of the body and feeling

15
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,840
them is the way that the body is heard right so tuning into them

16
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,000
and and doing it in a ideally trying to meet those sensations

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,000
without a lot of mental interpretation protection projections

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,560
but more like in the raw data kind of way of listening

19
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,400
and we talked about how the body is a gateway to the present moment

20
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,480
that when we connect with the body in the present moment and the sensations

21
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,519
and the breath these things are only happening right here

22
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,120
right in this moment so it's a nice way for us to help bring our

23
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,360
awareness into the present moment yeah

24
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:58,319
we also talked about um pain and the conditions cotto talked about

25
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:04,720
the conditions of that creep pain or like the conditions that create the formations of different

26
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,000
clouds right so different conditions come together and like clouds

27
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,440
they also keep shifting and changing and the pain sensations can we be with them

28
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:23,599
in a way that is tracking and noticing the change the changing nature of the experience

29
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:30,280
instead of as a fixed unmoving thing

30
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:40,159
so with those prompts i'm wondering if anybody has any reflections questions

31
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,959
anything they'd like to share from their practice this week

32
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,400
and there's a sveta has a microphone so if you can speak into it that would be

33
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,159
very helpful for everyone's sake

34
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:07,120
maybe richard will come get the microphone and help hand it around assuming we have somebody willing to

35
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,360
to share

36
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,080
and hold it close to your mask thanks um so i have

37
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:32,000
more of a question which may be helpful as a kind of bridging point between this last meeting and today but

38
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,680
how can you stay present and aware and not get involved with um

39
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:44,560
i guess like mental narratives with bodily sensations that are closely also tied up in emotions so

40
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,880
say like i don't know like kind of difficulty breathing or tightness like well the solar plexus like

41
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,560
in my experience at least when i tried to like be with it it like launches me right into the like emotional part of

42
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,800
things

43
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,759
so as you remember that experience

44
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:18,880
how can you describe the physical sensations that you experienced are there words that you have

45
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,520
um so i guess just like um tightness or constraints it kind of like

46
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:32,400
like clearly like impeded breathing activity um tightness con constriction and i didn't

47
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,639
get that other word i guess like um an impeded like breathing

48
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:46,880
if that makes sense what's the word impeded impeded impeded yeah impeded great okay

49
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,820
yeah so that's all descriptive language

50
00:05:53,820 --> 00:06:00,240
[Music] so

51
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,080
meaning there it's pointing to an experience a feeling the one that's maybe a little bit more mentally

52
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,120
complicated is impeded right

53
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:21,520
pressure pressure can you notice the pressure

54
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,039
and be with it or and notice if it's changes with the inhale and exhale

55
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:33,360
you're able to do that yeah so

56
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:41,039
and then so you're able to say all these things but you find that the mind then wants to go into the emotional content

57
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:47,039
and uh maybe explain why you're feeling this way or

58
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,319
yeah yeah yeah and you

59
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:59,039
clearly saw that was happening and then you would bring yourself back to the sensations

60
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:05,199
i definitely tried um but yeah i found myself kind of flowing right into the kind of

61
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,319
like i don't know there's no like better word for it than just like ah sensation of

62
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:17,680
like this does not feel good this does not go right yeah so um this is where then the you

63
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:25,840
did the vedana like naming unpleasant so having some of these key simple words

64
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,280
to realign can be really helpful unpleasant this is unpleasant

65
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,800
right there's neutral unpleasant and pleasant so this is great and then what else

66
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,400
happened um i found myself like sticking with that kind of like emotional feeling of

67
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,919
it like you you gotta get closer i can't hear you yeah sorry um i find myself

68
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:53,599
like kind of leaning into the emotional experience instead of the the bodily one which is where i felt like i was like

69
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,840
getting off track great but you you can you just described it beautifully i found myself leaning into the emotional

70
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,599
experience right it's more compelling right yeah

71
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:11,280
so it sounds like you know you were practicing with difficult emotions trying to bring awareness back to the

72
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,479
body and describing what it feels like to have the

73
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:22,479
experience of difficult emotions which are quite powerful right they can be quite powerful

74
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:29,199
and it is a beautiful lead-in to today's topic

75
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,839
yeah and so i'll save you know saying more about working with the

76
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:43,039
emotions themselves but i really do want to highlight all the things that you were able to describe right and this is this is the

77
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:50,399
practice we're cultivating you know and it's beautiful you clearly were trying to okay i know but let me try and stay

78
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,600
with the body that's what i'm trying to do this week which is building this capacity so that's

79
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:02,640
going back to the sort of the way the class is structured is it really does build

80
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,760
one week concentric circles starting with that breath awareness

81
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:14,240
and then we add to that the body based sensations and this week we're going to add to that

82
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:20,000
the emotions and then you'll find pretty quickly we're going to what's next

83
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,720
they're going to show up there too those thoughts those little buggers yeah so

84
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:34,160
um just you know doing our best to try and help ourselves notice just even noticing how entangled

85
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:40,160
and difficult it is to resist is beautiful

86
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:47,040
yeah do you want to add anything cardo i don't think quite yet i think uh i think that was the perfect

87
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:54,399
segue into week number three thank you why don't you go ahead and shift sure

88
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,959
sure yeah so we'll come back everyone

89
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:06,320
as tanya was just saying uh the way the class is structured beginning with the breathing

90
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,560
including the body with the basis of the breathing in the body awareness of emotions

91
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:18,880
with the basis of awareness of breathing body and emotions then we develop our skills with thinking

92
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,640
and then open even more broadly

93
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,320
and the arc here what we're doing is we're cultivating this very simple

94
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,839
faculty of attention cultivating this very simple faculty of

95
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:41,440
attention in order to be more free

96
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,959
with all aspects of our experience nothing left out

97
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:53,200
so we develop our facility in a simple place first with the body running or with the breathing right in the core and

98
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:59,839
then we work our way but throughout something we're practicing is maintaining a simple

99
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:06,560
relationship to experience so to go back to the breathing

100
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:12,079
the practice with the breathing has been to direct the attention to the sensations of breathing

101
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:18,800
a felt sense of breathing through the body experiencing the experience in the breathing almost from the inside

102
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:25,279
out and by basing ourselves there basing ourselves in that felt sense

103
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:31,920
we have a more simple relationship to the experience can easily become complicated by

104
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,519
drawing out a story in the past or the future about the breathing but just here

105
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:43,600
just the felt sense of breathing so simple so simple

106
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,120
so we're using our attention to go more deeply into our own experience

107
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:55,000
and to discover something about how attention can be free

108
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,480
something we cultivated while working with the breathing in the body was

109
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,680
based on a recognition many of us have seen over these weeks

110
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:15,519
probably the mind keeps generating thoughts keeps generating emotions through the

111
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:22,639
body so we're developing a skill knowing that of foreground attention

112
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:28,240
and background attention if we're meditating on the breathing

113
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,600
keeping those sensations of the breathing in the foreground and if a thought comes up it can just

114
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:39,279
pass right through it doesn't have to take all of our attention but it doesn't have to

115
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:44,320
interfere either so sustaining contact with the breathing

116
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,440
body in this way just more and more of our experience gets revealed

117
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:55,600
we notice details of the breathing notice details of the body

118
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,120
they shift they change and then something else arises

119
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:09,839
so the practice has been to focus on the breathing and then when something else uh becomes compelling when something

120
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:16,399
else an experience becomes compelling maybe a strong thought so far we've been focusing on

121
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:22,240
if a body sensation becomes compelling and compelling enough to interfere so to

122
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:28,639
speak to draw our attention away from the breathing compelling enough to draw our attention

123
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:35,920
then the practice is to turn more fully toward that and get to know that sensation and once that uh once that has run its

124
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,839
course to come back to the breathing i'm reiterating all this in part because

125
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:49,320
this is the basis for what we're about to expand into which is practice with emotion

126
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:58,160
i'd like to say by way of preface practicing with mindfulness of the body

127
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:05,360
can facilitate a very long awakening of the body it can be a it can be a sustained

128
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,880
process i think it's really fruitful to spend a lot of time with mindfulness of the body to develop that

129
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:18,000
develop that skill and we'll see why as we turn to mindfulness of emotions

130
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:28,800
one of the things we come to learn about about through mindfulness of the body is how the body is big enough

131
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:35,440
metaphorically it's a big enough container to hold pleasant and unpleasant it's big enough for anything to pass

132
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,480
through whatever the experience

133
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:48,959
so let's turn more directly toward emotions first thing i'd like to say about

134
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:56,720
mindfulness of emotions emotions in general very important part of our human life

135
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:03,519
i actually like to say that it's it's um this mindfulness of emotions practice is

136
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,800
one of the most explicit invitations we have to bring our entire humanity

137
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:15,360
into the mindfulness practice there's welcome

138
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:22,560
there is for purposes of the practice there's no inappropriate emotion

139
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:28,800
if any emotion arises during mindfulness practice nothing inappropriate

140
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:35,440
it could be anything it may be uncomfortable and uh in fact the chances are pretty

141
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,440
high that we'll we will run into some discomfort as we practice with emotions

142
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:48,079
um but everyone's welcome everyone's welcome

143
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,399
practicing mindfulness of emotions i think it's also one of these areas where we really get to know how the

144
00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:02,560
practice takes time for an emotion to arise and to process through the body

145
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:09,120
it's a process that takes time and it's a process that works really well if we have trust

146
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,399
trust that the body can can hold the emotion and trust that the emotion will work its

147
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,639
way through

148
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:28,240
one of the most important principles of mindfulness of emotion is that our emotions

149
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:34,079
we recognize and experience through the body that's why mindful one of the key

150
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:40,880
reasons that we develop a skill and mindfulness of the body before we move on to mindfulness of emotions

151
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,240
you can even pause now and just think for yourself when i'm happy

152
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:54,000
how does it register in my body how do i know maybe there's a little lift or lift to the posture

153
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,240
maybe a little smile comes to your face maybe there's some bright metaphorically some bright energy in the body

154
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:06,640
how do you know sadness through the body how do you know it

155
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:14,720
how do we know anger or fear or appreciation gratitude

156
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,159
through the body the felt sense of the body

157
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,480
it's very easy for the the energy of an emotion as we were just talking

158
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,840
about to draw us into story fascinating how that happens it's like

159
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:37,520
that it's like emotions have their own gravity their own orbit they're just like we're gone

160
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:43,679
something that's very interesting to me in terms of mindfulness practice is that a story

161
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:49,520
can strengthen the sensation of emotion in the body and the sensation in the body could also

162
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,960
like if it's not observed given its time given its space can also reinforce the story

163
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:02,720
and it sort of loops it can kind of leap but with the practice of mindfulness

164
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,160
again the story can be there but we parse the commentary from the

165
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,919
felt sense of the body bring our awareness down into the body

166
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:19,200
and watch how does it play out how does it play out what do we notice

167
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,080
and give it its time

168
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,400
so in terms of the capacity of the body i want to mention

169
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,679
i grew up near a very broad river the brazos river valley

170
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:44,880
it runs sort of diagonal across texas it's one of these really really wide rivers you can imagine

171
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:51,440
these river banks with shrubs and trees and this like flat

172
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:58,960
flat still water at the end of the river they're 3 000 meters a second going out

173
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,480
into the ocean there's a lot of movement happening

174
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:12,480
here i imagine the body is like the riverbed so much passes through this river

175
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:19,200
so much passes through whether the water is moving quickly whether the water is moving slowly

176
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:26,160
the riverbed just holds it and allows it to pass through same with the body and emotions

177
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:33,120
if the body is like the riverbed and the emotions like the water sometimes they flow through quickly

178
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,240
sometimes they flow through slowly but all the while the body the body

179
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,799
holds it all

180
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:51,440
great timing i i have a um i have a i'm a type 1 diabetic and i have a

181
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:57,679
little beep so i'm actually going to pay attention to my body and care for this it'll take me about 30

182
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,679
seconds

183
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,760
richard it might be a little cool

184
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,880
so one of the things i'd like to call forward with the this image of the river this image of

185
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:41,360
the riverbed and the holding of water as it passes through is that change

186
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:48,720
is part of the process and change is totally fine sometimes sometimes these uh

187
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:56,000
big thunderstorms would roll through and fill the fill the river with a rush of water and sticks and you can

188
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,600
imagine waves and whatnot water might be cloudy and rough

189
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:08,480
but still the riverbed was right there other times we wouldn't have rain for months and this riverbed would be so

190
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:16,480
still so still any variety of emotion can pass right through the body

191
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:22,799
one thing i also want to draw out from this from this image of the river is we also want to take care of

192
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:28,159
ourselves not to be an overwhelm when we're practicing with mindfulness of emotions you can imagine

193
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:35,360
say there's too much flow or there's a flood in the river that can actually like harm the banks or we start eroding

194
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:43,320
from the edges so taking care with yourself taking care of yourself

195
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,960
i think one more idea about mindfulness mindfulness of emotions is

196
00:21:52,960 --> 00:22:00,480
that in terms of in terms of mindfulness we're not condemning and we're not condoning any emotion at all

197
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,840
this is part of part of the fact that uh whatever object arises

198
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,200
it can it can be met with a clear attention in such a way that our mindfulness is strengthened even if it's

199
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,960
uncomfortable so all this pointing toward a simple

200
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:23,039
relationship with emotions as they arise so there's a story classic

201
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:28,320
classic story of the buddha he's with an assembly many of you have probably heard this

202
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:34,320
story before he says uh it was a pop quiz for the assembly

203
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:41,120
and he says monks suppose someone were struck with a dart would that hurt if someone were struck

204
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:47,280
with an arrow would that hurt and the monks were sharp and they said oh yes that would hurt

205
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:55,360
good now if someone were struck with a second arrow would that hurt all the more

206
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:01,039
yeah yes yes it would good good he says you're right

207
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,799
the first arrow is the discomfort the pain

208
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:11,840
the suffering that is part of this human life

209
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,919
a function of having a human body and in the second arrow

210
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:25,520
the third arrow the fourth arrow are the complicated relationships we stack on top

211
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:32,000
generalizing as far as emotions are concerned being with them simply

212
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,840
they run their course they've come and they've gone so much of how we suffer in relationship

213
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:45,120
to emotion is how we complicate it what we add the uh the stories of

214
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,240
say self-judgment or criticism or doubt or

215
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,600
they shouldn't have or i shouldn't have or on and on right we all have our own

216
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:02,960
variety uh gil has a hilarious i think anecdote

217
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:08,799
of walking along and stubbing his toe first arrow

218
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,080
pain of having a human body

219
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:19,760
then then he adds gil who's been teaching for 35 years gil

220
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:25,600
you're um you're a mindfulness teacher you're a buddhist teacher you should really be paying attention

221
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:31,360
second arrow second arrow a little self-judgment and then it gets worse

222
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,960
gil you are the worst walker the self-criticism intensifies third

223
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,080
arrow more complication and we could go on and on from there it

224
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,360
could it could go they really should not have put that sidewalk there

225
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:54,400
that curb really really shouldn't be there that is totally their fault fourth arrow and on it goes right fifth

226
00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:02,240
six seven eight nine and so on at some point we wake up and we realize oh 100 arrows

227
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:09,360
while we're emphasizing a simple relationship just that moment of waking up

228
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:15,440
you're you're right back here you're right back here it doesn't doesn't matter for the purposes of

229
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:23,559
mindfulness practice if you wake up at arrow 99 just that you're right back here

230
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,679
so we will stub our toes i imagine or hurt our fingers or

231
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:45,840
we will have an emotional life and the encouragement here is to

232
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:51,919
investigate for yourself what are the ways what are the ways in which i can have a simple relationship with the emotions

233
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:57,679
that are that are coming here what are the ways that that happens and then what are the ways that i complicate

234
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:03,120
it what are the ways that i magnify or multiply

235
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,840
the suffering

236
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:15,840
i think it's a good time for us to move a little deeper into this in a guided meditation

237
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:23,200
so we find ourselves in a upright

238
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,720
alert balanced posture

239
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,400
we're looking for

240
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:43,600
a posture that can express our attentiveness

241
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,320
awake yet relaxed

242
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:59,360
and before we move into the meditation very far

243
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:05,760
the invitation this exercise is to feel into whether there's any mood

244
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:12,400
present any emotion present for you now most always there's something there so

245
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:20,200
maybe give it a moment if it's not obvious some kind of state

246
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,159
what's there

247
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:03,720
so from here the invitation is to begin directing our attention to the breathing

248
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:10,240
it may help us settle in to take a few long slow deep breaths

249
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,960
just at your own pace

250
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:54,760
and then letting the breathing return to its natural rhythm

251
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,840
awakening this felt sense through the body

252
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:25,559
relaxing any places of obvious holding

253
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:35,360
a gentle relaxation maybe of the face

254
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,919
the eyes themselves

255
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,520
mouth and jaw

256
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,799
maybe the back of the head

257
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:08,440
shoulders down the back

258
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,158
inviting the front body to relax

259
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,080
the arms and hands

260
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:51,840
the hips seat

261
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,760
legs

262
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,278
and the feet

263
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,200
and now sensing into the breathing

264
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,398
taking just a little bit of priority

265
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:08,159
to notice any shift in your relationship to the breathing from simple

266
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,399
to complicated

267
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:24,200
and noting that returning to simplicity

268
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:22,880
now i would like to invite you to let go of the priority of breathing

269
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:30,240
of attention to breathing and turn your attention to

270
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:36,320
the prevailing mood or any emotion

271
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,320
state

272
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:53,480
sensing into that emotion through the body

273
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:32,760
where do you feel it and how

274
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:43,158
in the language of sensation the felt sense

275
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,599
as you attend to the emotion through the body

276
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:03,040
how are those sensations shifting changing

277
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,320
seeming to stay the same

278
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,359
if the emotion disappears

279
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,599
just notice what happens next

280
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:49,359
now having given some attention to the emotions i invite you to bring your

281
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:53,480
attention back to the breathing

282
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:39,720
and as this sitting comes to an end

283
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:49,200
just to take a few deep breaths

284
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,599
long breaths

285
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:04,320
welcoming yourself and when you're ready

286
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,119
you can open your eyes

287
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:43,199
so [Music]

288
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:57,440
so an introduction to mindfulness of emotions

289
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:07,680
how was that for you anything you'd like to share about

290
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:16,359
the meditation any questions about what we're practicing with so far

291
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,240
yes

292
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:47,680
i was wondering if um it matters if our attention naturally

293
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:53,359
wanders between breathing emotions

294
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:59,119
and sometimes thoughts and awareness of the body

295
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:05,839
or is the goal to ultimately also in meditation practice

296
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:12,000
to intentionally draw our attention to one or the other

297
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:19,200
sure sure great question sort of naturally comes up doesn't it um

298
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:25,760
yeah there's the they're these separate or different but interrelated modes of attention

299
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:32,240
directed attention and sort of receptive attention and sometimes sometimes our instructions

300
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:37,440
are to look at something particular and stay with it

301
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:43,680
and at other times it's to be sort of wide open over the course of the

302
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:48,960
the the five weeks together just speaking for this particular kind

303
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:54,800
of meditation we're gradually gradually moving to include more and more

304
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:00,800
in the experience and that would mean in the in the way that you stated it

305
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:06,560
the mind or the attention will move between breathing the body emotions and

306
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:12,079
thinking the question that remains is are we with it

307
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:18,319
are we a companion with the attention as it moves from thing to thing and we'll we'll talk more about that as we as we

308
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:25,119
go there's no um there's no ultimate right answer to your question actually

309
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:30,480
it uh to my mind if we're doing a sort of a mindfulness

310
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:35,680
meditation with these kind of parameters a lot of movement of attention can

311
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,960
happen if we're doing something that that emphasizes more

312
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:46,160
samadhi or concentration practice we may direct the attention more deliberately to one

313
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:52,000
thing so in some sense it depends on the practice you do but in this arc we're including more and

314
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:58,319
more and along the way it can be really useful to direct the attention to just

315
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:03,359
certain zones in the way that we're directing toward the body we're directing toward emotion

316
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:08,480
directly toward thinking is that does that address yeah thank you sure

317
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,720
sure

318
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,760
or if they're not printed oh there we go in the transition i was also going to

319
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:31,520
say if there are no particular questions but there's something you'd like to share from your sitting i'd be very curious to know how it went for you um

320
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:36,640
so i identified the emotion and i sat with it and

321
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:42,800
i started to feel just like tightness heaviness in my chest

322
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:48,079
right side not quite the heart so and that was interesting

323
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:54,480
and so i just paid attention and tried to breathe through it and

324
00:44:54,480 --> 00:45:00,560
eventually that sort of lifted but then it just kind of hovered over my fore front

325
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:07,519
and that's how it ended so nothing exciting just something i noticed

326
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:13,040
i appreciate the tracking very nice yeah yeah

327
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:17,079
that was my observation too

328
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,640
wow

329
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:56,720
okay uh hey everyone hi thank you

330
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:02,000
uh i just had a question about um what was when you see like a ball of like

331
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,440
energy like i saw like a white and then it just started changing colors i saw like green and purple

332
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:13,359
is that does that mean like low pressure does it doesn't mean like low blood

333
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:19,040
pressure or something i don't know i was like when we were meditating uh and i started like to relax more i

334
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:24,640
started seeing like uh just like a white thing and then it started like having colors around it oh i don't know what i

335
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:30,300
don't know what that means yeah interesting interesting yeah blood pressure i'm not a doctor

336
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:37,520
[Laughter] what's interesting to me here

337
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:43,599
as far as what it means we don't know we don't know what it means um

338
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:49,119
what is what's really interesting in terms of the mindfulness practice is that you had a very clear observation of

339
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:56,560
it yeah and how it changed over time yeah and then the that that's very direct

340
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:02,000
the sense of sight is very direct even behind closed eyes in a very clear sense what was happening

341
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:08,400
and then there's this extra layer that's maybe a little bit removed that's like the

342
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:14,319
what did that what does it mean which is even maybe separate from the impulse that is like curious right

343
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:21,119
there's like observation curiosity and then what does it mean up here maybe so yeah

344
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:27,440
i think the invitation would be to let the what does it mean hang out if it wants to be here in the

345
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:33,839
background and focus on the the direct sensate experience gotcha thank you

346
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:40,960
anything you'd like to add that was beautiful oh great yeah

347
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:51,040
yeah you guys want a little story

348
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:57,200
i feel like you know we're we're calm but emotions are not always so calm right

349
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:02,960
i was um watching uh 13 lives has anybody seen that

350
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:08,560
yeah remember the soccer team in thailand the the 13 boys and the coach

351
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:14,000
that got stuck in the cave so it's a really nice document it's a

352
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,760
movie but it's very much based on the story the facts

353
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:25,040
um they don't show a lot of the boys in the cave they show some of them

354
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:30,880
and the boys with the coach at the very like i don't know it was like two kilometers three kilometers into the

355
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:36,640
cave right there many crazy passages and these other

356
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:42,720
areas the cable open and tight and there's all these stag delights dropping down so these sharp

357
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:49,599
cones of rock coming from the ceiling and most of this is just completely filled with water it's just a monsoon

358
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:55,839
rain that that got them stuck and um so the kids it was one of the kids

359
00:48:55,839 --> 00:49:01,599
birthday that day they had practice they had played soccer and they were all like well let's go to the cave before we go

360
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:07,839
have your birthday dinner and so they're in this cave and and they get stuck

361
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:14,559
and it's a total of 18 days in there and at some point uh and it was probably

362
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:21,040
quite a while before they even got them any food they they were just in there and you know like in their shorts and

363
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:27,760
t-shirts and um they showed this moment

364
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:33,280
because the some divers finally made it all the way and

365
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:38,640
you know the kids turn on their flashlights when they hear the sound to see because they had some flashlights a

366
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:43,680
couple flashlights and they keep them off mostly for the battery but you know they see those

367
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:48,800
divers come in and um and then the divers have to leave and

368
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:54,240
they're like oh my gosh really we have to stay you know they can't take them back right and

369
00:49:54,240 --> 00:50:00,400
so then they're kind of trying to get settled again and and one of the kids um

370
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:05,680
starts to kind of be activated be afraid

371
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:12,720
and um sort of he's having trouble sitting still because they're all kind of like you know there's not not a lot of space

372
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:18,160
they're just kind of hanging out in this little spot so the coach

373
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:24,160
what a sweet coach this guy was apparently but he he went over to the kid and

374
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:31,839
he said okay so fear is here fears come in fears come into the body

375
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:38,800
that's what's what's happening here so okay everybody let's sit down and calm

376
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:45,599
our minds let's calm our minds and

377
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:53,040
this this must have been that they did this amen and that's what they talked about is he taught them how to meditate

378
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:58,880
to make it through this time and i think you know fear is like

379
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:04,240
lightning right it's so intense

380
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:10,480
and if you can imagine it in a small space with water and a little cave

381
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:15,760
fear coming into that how it would just spread

382
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:22,359
right just just ignite just just fill you up

383
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:30,160
and this is the practice what guides us and helps us is building

384
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:36,720
the awareness is building our capacity to be mindful with

385
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:42,079
emotions helps us sit down and be with it in a

386
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:49,880
way that it doesn't just blow up right

387
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:56,800
another analogy is it's like um if you think about lightning it's conducted by

388
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:04,400
water and things fear is conducted in our systems if we aren't mindful and

389
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:10,400
if you there was a recent story of three women um being hit by lightning near the white

390
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:17,200
house under a tree in a rainstorm one of them had on these doc martin high platform doc martin

391
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:22,720
shoes and she survived and

392
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:28,720
it's not that she wasn't affected by the lightning but the doc martin the rubber doesn't

393
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:34,400
conduct the lightning in the same way and to me this is a simile for what

394
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:42,160
awareness being mindful can do with emotions and emotions can't kill us but they can

395
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:48,319
make us very miserable and emotions without

396
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:53,119
a lot of doc martin awareness

397
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:59,839
can really move and undulate and impact us and kind of we can get in circles

398
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:05,440
caught in circles with our thinking and the even the feedback loops of just the emotion itself

399
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:13,280
each emotion if you measure it biochemically lasts about 60 to 90 seconds

400
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:19,440
that's how long the biochemical makeup of a particular emotion lasts

401
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:25,119
when they study it in the brain but what what why then does it feel like we have a

402
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:30,480
feeling or an emotion for hours or weeks we keep

403
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:36,880
reigniting it we keep feeding it so

404
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:43,839
this is uh i'm trying to bring a little life and to like connect us to this

405
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:49,040
facet of our life that is so impactful emotions

406
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:54,079
invite other comments questions reflections before we

407
00:53:54,079 --> 00:54:02,319
move into the next part you guys yeah great and the microphone

408
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:06,280
is coming your way

409
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:20,480
thank you hello good evening um i i just have a

410
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:26,240
you know with meditating and sitting with emotions i've just been having a

411
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:33,440
hard time differentiating between being self-aware and feeling self-conscious

412
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:38,720
and so i know one is rooted in negativity

413
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:45,520
but then it's like okay i know i'm feeling bad what do i do about it you know

414
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:50,640
i don't know i and then i've been trying to

415
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:56,480
shorten the 10-minute non or unguided meditations and

416
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:01,520
i just i haven't been i haven't been like

417
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:07,760
awake for them so i'm like oh my gosh and i want to be alert but

418
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:13,119
i guess i i guess i'm not really taking enough time to take care of myself and

419
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:20,079
so now i'm back to where i started feeling frustrated and measuring how i'm meditating and

420
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:26,079
comparing all this that all the sessions thinking oh this wasn't as successful as i wanted it

421
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:35,160
to be so now you're you're starting to see a pattern maybe in your mind

422
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:43,520
maybe you just described a pattern that's nothing more than a pattern

423
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:49,680
can you see can you like maybe so you know you you feel like oh i'm not

424
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:54,880
doing it right i'm not doing it well enough so

425
00:55:54,880 --> 00:56:00,480
how many arrows might might we you know

426
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:07,280
so the next thing is i'm just i'm not so do you hear what i'm saying you use tracking with me are you still so bought

427
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:13,519
up and and believing you're you're not doing it right you know so here we go

428
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:21,599
you're trying i feel like the arrows are so deeply lodged and i just enjoy

429
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:27,520
yeah really really bad because i know it catastrophize everything great great and

430
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:33,680
i just it's it but it's just something that i i i've done for many many

431
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:39,920
compelling it's compelling it's habit it's a pattern

432
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:46,240
right and you know um kodo used the word um that it's a

433
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:52,720
i don't know has energy magnetic energy emotions i often talk about um emotions

434
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:59,760
as their intention is to get you to do something

435
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:04,960
they're they're they you know what we all know what happens

436
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:10,720
what we do when we feel sad right we lose our energy we fall forward we might

437
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:16,400
cry there's a slumping energy this is what what we do right when we're happy

438
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:23,920
there's a different thing we do when we're angry so these emotions have energy in them

439
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:30,319
they come with this is why i like the lightning like there's a lot of energy in them

440
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:35,440
and so and now what you're describing too is like okay you have a little it sounds

441
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:41,280
like a little um spurt of self-criticism or doubt right

442
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:48,640
and so you get a little release of that that that that emotion and then that emotion triggers the same

443
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:56,400
but maybe stronger and then you know it just sort of has this perpetual kind of cyclical cycle

444
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:02,960
in it right is this familiar to you guys maybe your words are a little different

445
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:11,280
but can you look around you are not alone you are not alone what you are seeing is

446
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:17,280
it's so good you could name it right there here and do this right it and the fact that you can see

447
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:24,720
it is is amazing now we just need to get disenchanted

448
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:32,559
right to to learn how to when that so that energy that emotion comes up

449
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:41,440
it bumps up the energy right it like oh okay so can we just ride that 60 90

450
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:47,760
120 second emotion out okay okay and then you know watch it

451
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:53,440
fade the mind's going to want to grab it's one of going to want to go and offer

452
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:58,160
another arrow but can we just learn to

453
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:07,440
and then enjoy even 15 seconds before the next you know like we're just gonna try and stretch it out

454
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:13,040
make it less intense are you tracking me am i with you you with me we got it okay

455
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:20,480
everybody else you tracking this is our work the work is in not responding

456
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:26,160
not reacting not following the compulsion

457
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:33,838
and that's a lot of work it gets exhausting

458
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:40,240
and it's also freedom it brings us you know

459
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:46,240
this i don't know your name but you know you did a beautiful job describing how the feeling which didn't sound so

460
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:51,839
comfortable started in your chest and you watched it and you tracked it and it shifted and it moved and then it went

461
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:56,960
away and this is this is what we're learning how to do

462
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:04,240
to let it move through and the though those extra arrows we

463
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:11,520
start to see oh there's another one okay all right i don't you know like we lose interest in them

464
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:17,599
don't buy it it's not a fact and we'll get to thoughts next week

465
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:23,200
because this is this is you see we're leading we go into emotions and then we're going to we're going to find the

466
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:30,480
thinking because they're it's all connected but if we can try and see it energetically yeah

467
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:36,720
yeah so any clarifying question comment anything at all for you

468
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:40,839
no okay

469
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:46,558
yeah that would be nice

470
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:59,760
all right so i just want to double check before i start to move into just talking

471
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:05,200
a little bit more about emotions and then a practice to work with them i'm going

472
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:10,720
to offer you a practice but just before i do any other final

473
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:16,160
little comments or questions nope okay

474
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:22,079
so ordinary awareness when we're not mindful um

475
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:27,200
is you know with the experience of getting carried away in our thinking carried

476
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:33,680
down the river by our motions it's the ship that isn't anchored

477
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:39,200
right and so that's that's the untrained mind

478
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:44,880
that's the the mind without mindfulness without awareness

479
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:51,040
daniel goldman is a psychologist and researcher

480
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:57,760
and he studied a lot about emotional intent intelligence and emotions themselves

481
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:04,240
and here's a little teeny tiny quote from him he says self-awareness

482
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:09,920
is a neutral mode neutral mode a mode of being

483
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:17,200
so you were talking about self consciousness versus self-awareness so the self-awareness the mindfulness is

484
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:24,640
more of a neutral state it's not for and against right it's aware it's present

485
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:32,160
that maintains self-reflectiveness even in the midst of turbulent emotions

486
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:38,160
even in the midst of turbulent emotions so that's what we're wanting to grow

487
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:43,599
right and we really do have this innate it's

488
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:50,799
already happening it's in you there's an innate capacity to be aware in this way

489
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:57,280
it gets covered over by reactivity and our thoughts and our

490
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:03,839
all kinds of things but it's here it's right inside of you each one of you

491
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:13,280
and you know we may want to do spiritual bypassing around emotions

492
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:20,319
i don't get angry i'm not jealous right there's a lot of ways that

493
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:26,160
we want to maybe be that better person but you know emotions

494
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:32,640
we're humans we're humans and they're we're going to have all kinds of emotions and

495
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:38,559
you can't block the negative without blocking the positive

496
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:44,640
it's a flow thing so we got to learn how to be wise with

497
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:51,440
them we got to learn how to you know be that riverbed and

498
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:58,400
maybe we're not ready to be that big and wide of a riverbed but maybe we can be a small riverbed for

499
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:03,920
two minutes at a time to let it move and then we need to take a break and

500
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:11,119
then we come back two more minutes of letting it move okay okay you know and maybe that's what it's like for a while

501
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:18,000
but this is how in bit by bit this is how we grow our capacity

502
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,039
this is how we do it

503
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:43,760
okay i think i'm going to introduce a practice now [Music]

504
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:49,839
it's called raft and it has several steps to it it's on your

505
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:55,039
handout and so you don't have to try and

506
01:04:55,039 --> 01:05:00,240
you know memorize at all the handouts are on the stage and they're also

507
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:06,240
online with the talks and raft is

508
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:11,599
a wonderful word to think about because actually this is in a simile the buddha taught

509
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:16,720
he taught that growing mindfulness is like building a raft and that it carries

510
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:23,240
us from the shore of suffering to the shore of freedom

511
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:29,119
and you know he taught that you build this raft you have to bring the sticks and

512
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:35,440
the twigs and the things together and the rope and tie them together to create and build this

513
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:41,359
raft that carries you while you're kicking and paddling to get from one shore to

514
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:48,160
the other so this is this is that work we don't just float

515
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:54,079
we have to work to get to this other place this other shore

516
01:05:54,079 --> 01:06:01,119
and we're not going to be tying sticks together to build our raft but we are

517
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:07,039
building you know by using our mindfulness practice

518
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:12,319
our breath right all the things that we're learning

519
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:18,319
all become like the sticks that were kind of holding us up helping us cross

520
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:25,599
the river so the first part of building this raft

521
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:31,520
is to recognize the r r a f t t in my reversion raft with an

522
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:38,799
extra t recognizing is absolutely essential we need to recognize what's going on

523
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:44,960
recognize the looping recognize you know the that we're suffering the

524
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:50,880
emotion and it can be really simple oh i'm angry

525
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:56,400
just like that oh i'm frustrated

526
01:06:56,799 --> 01:07:02,400
oh i think i'm stupid oh i guess i'm being self-critical right just

527
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:10,078
this recognition a pure little simple seeing what's going on

528
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:18,000
this is the beginning this is this is necessary beginning

529
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:24,559
the next part of building the mindfulness with what's happening is the a

530
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:32,960
which is working to allow ourselves to be with what is

531
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:40,720
so allowing it allowing ourselves to be with what is means kind of being able to

532
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:47,200
ride that 60 120 second wave of the emotion

533
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:53,920
without trying to get rid of it or adding to it we've gotta we've got to work on this

534
01:07:53,920 --> 01:08:00,640
capacity of allowing because it's that capacity of being with that allows

535
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:07,680
things to move when we don't allow we're trying to block we're shutting down right we're

536
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:14,160
trying to we're closing something that should be moving

537
01:08:16,159 --> 01:08:22,080
it's different than endorsing allowing does not mean

538
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:28,159
you know i'm agreeing with sometimes there's things that are going on that we

539
01:08:28,159 --> 01:08:35,040
if we start to get complicated um it's not that we're allowing ourselves

540
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:41,359
to be abused or somebody else to be abused it's it's a working with an experience we're having in the present

541
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:47,278
moment does that make sense okay f

542
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:53,520
r a f we're going to the body we're going to feel it

543
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:59,040
we're helping ourself not just get carried into that emotional thought

544
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:05,679
stream that we've been talking about so we're going to slow it down we're going to find it and feel it in our

545
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:11,359
bodies so you've had some great examples of

546
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:18,880
people describing that finding feeling tracking right so that's it it's so simple

547
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:26,238
and not easy okay and then um the next part of the raft is

548
01:09:26,239 --> 01:09:31,600
to start to when so at some point you may

549
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:38,798
it may be so simple what's going on for you you've been that emotion that 60 seconds 120 seconds

550
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:43,920
it's over it's resolved there may be nothing more for you to do

551
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:49,520
but if it's a complicated situation or tends to get re-triggered

552
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:55,440
the next part is teasing apart and that's where we start to do

553
01:09:55,440 --> 01:10:00,800
we're gonna kind of start to see that thought pattern

554
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:06,800
and say oh this is a thought this is the judgment

555
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:14,560
right and and so okay here's the judgment and here's the feeling we're teasing apart these things oh and

556
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:21,360
here's a memory oh this is me when i was five and i was still having this issue

557
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:26,640
okay and so i like this image of having a large dining room table with lots of

558
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:32,000
chairs so that all the stuff that comes up i get i say you can sit down here right

559
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:37,280
here sweetheart this feeling this story this memory this belief

560
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:43,120
this thought just give them a place just invite them to have a seat and

561
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:49,760
you're creating all this room for these pieces to not be entangled with each other

562
01:10:50,239 --> 01:10:57,600
and the final part of it is t the second t is

563
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:04,080
trusting so koto mentioned earlier you know it's when we're working with

564
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:11,040
emotions it's really important to have a sense of trust a trust in our capacity

565
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:18,320
to be with the emotion to know the emotion won't kill us to know the emotions will move through

566
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:24,840
this finding what we can trust is incredibly important to help us with this letting go

567
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:31,198
and finding a sense of groundedness so

568
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:38,480
let's do a small practice with raft so find your posture your meditation

569
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:43,520
posture and i'm going to invite you to bring

570
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:51,040
something to mind to work with that is connected to emotions but i highly encourage you to choose

571
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:55,840
something you know you can be with

572
01:11:56,320 --> 01:12:01,198
so not choosing the hardest thing going on

573
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:11,360
so feeling your breath taking three maybe longer slower deeper breaths

574
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:26,640
feeling your feet thank you feet thank you body right here

575
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:32,960
right here giving your weight giving your weight to the chair

576
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:36,360
to the floor

577
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:44,880
taking a minute to resource yourself before you bring an emotional

578
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:49,880
event or memory forward

579
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:56,239
and when you're ready bring to mind

580
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:04,080
something that you feel you can be with and so we're using our imagination right

581
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:09,120
now so you're going to help yourself by

582
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:16,800
bringing forward some story and some images perhaps words

583
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:20,719
maybe remember what you were feeling

584
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:27,840
and then when you're ready just turn toward what you're aware of feeling right now

585
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:34,480
right here so you're practicing in the present moment with what you're feeling in the present

586
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:40,400
moment based on a memory or story

587
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:47,840
recognize simple naming okay

588
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:52,800
whatever emotion you can name right now

589
01:13:53,520 --> 01:14:00,320
can you just say okay this emotion is here right now

590
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:07,199
i see you and i sense you and then can i allow you

591
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:14,239
to exist with awareness can i allow this experience to happen

592
01:14:14,239 --> 01:14:21,440
right now and if there's a sense of yes

593
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:29,360
find and feel it in your body if there's a sense of no i can't allow

594
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:34,480
this then work with okay i can't allow not

595
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:40,640
allowing is happening and can you allow not allowing can you

596
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:46,960
allow resistance to be known and then find and feel a resistance

597
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:55,320
so taking a moment to scan the whole body

598
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:01,880
maybe noticing areas the body feels neutral and fine

599
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:19,120
and noticing where you're feeling the emotion and maybe noticing pleasant unpleasant

600
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:22,360
or neutral

601
01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:34,719
and let's time i'm going to give you uh 60 seconds to just see if you can ride

602
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:41,679
like a wave just ride simply the emotion that's present

603
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:46,440
before we move into the next phase

604
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:01,640
so

605
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:46,280
and now just noticing what's here now

606
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:54,719
maybe opening up around it creating that sense of spaciousness

607
01:16:55,040 --> 01:17:02,280
maybe imagining that giant round table

608
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:10,880
and are there things that you would like to invite to have a seat that are part of

609
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:16,880
this experience that you've been working with my mother

610
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:23,440
my boss my kid just what's there

611
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:28,960
can you kind of recognize and allow each

612
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:35,120
each part the memory

613
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:41,280
the story the belief the interpretation the reactivity

614
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:46,960
it all has its own place us

615
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:54,360
being generous and curious

616
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:10,520
nothing needs to happen right now just getting to know what all is present

617
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:23,880
you know it's possible to have tea with any one of these visitors

618
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:31,520
and it's possible that you might need some of them to wait a while before you're ready to sit down with them and

619
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:34,840
that's okay

620
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:47,199
so at this point in the meditation we're gonna shift when you're ready so

621
01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:53,840
there's enough room for you to finish up what you're doing and and then connect with what you can trust

622
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:56,158
here

623
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:06,159
trusting the dharma trusting the fact that you can be with these emotions that you

624
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:11,920
could do as well as you did with this practice however well that was

625
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:23,159
can you trust that giving spaciousness helps pausing helps

626
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:30,640
breathing helps being present helps

627
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:38,719
just take another minute with a space of trust cultivating

628
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:42,480
it by attending to it

629
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:49,320
resting in it

630
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:58,040
maybe noticing that you're okay

631
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:19,920
and we tend to want to move away quickly from what resources us

632
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:29,360
i want to invite you to linger here three to five conscious breaths

633
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:36,280
breathing with what we trust

634
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:21,960
so

635
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:39,440
so raft recognize allow

636
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:45,120
find and feel tease apart trust

637
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:50,480
so open to any response any reflection

638
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:56,159
i'll start by prompting around trust what did you trust what

639
01:21:56,159 --> 01:22:01,679
could you place your trust in anybody willing

640
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:07,320
to share i guess richard yeah this is for you

641
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:19,198
you all sat here so i know you found something to trust

642
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:25,600
um so i'm doing this practice as part of

643
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:32,560
like therapy um ifs and so um it's internal family systems and so i uh i

644
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:39,040
trust the lazy part of me great it's a sloth and so like

645
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:49,760
just wants to sleep and sit all day and so it's gonna this is perfect great beautiful so you have that resource

646
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:56,719
right there okay i can just rest with this i know how to be still beautiful

647
01:22:57,040 --> 01:23:02,320
anybody else and again wide open took any comments

648
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:08,960
and questions this is uh such a richness there's so much richness

649
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:12,480
in working with our emotions

650
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:21,600
yeah great richard i it was there was a lot it was like a dam

651
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:26,960
that was overflowing with you know at first i'm like okay i can deal with

652
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:32,000
a disappointment and then something else took over that was kind of masquerading

653
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:37,840
as what i thought i was going to want to think about and

654
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:43,120
and but i trusted myself and knowing that i could

655
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:49,760
have that awareness to be a small riverbed as kodo had mentioned it was

656
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:55,600
uh but it was still something that i had to you know

657
01:23:55,600 --> 01:24:02,400
sit with but no but when you had said after the 90 seconds because that's how long usually an emotion emotionless like

658
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:07,840
okay let me not get carried away with the same story that i tell myself but it's

659
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:14,000
i wish i had you in my head every now and then whenever i want to loop into that but i

660
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:20,719
know i could tell myself like that's right there was like a table of all those negative emotions and on the other

661
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:27,600
side was like faith and family and and i'm like you know they could have a seat at the table but

662
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:33,920
i don't have to keep serving or feeding the one thing that i choose to feed yes

663
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:40,840
you know yes choice beautiful beautiful

664
01:24:53,760 --> 01:25:00,638
um so kind of going off what she said joyce i

665
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:08,719
trusted that i could make space for this thing that i'm feeling or

666
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:14,480
whatever um you want to call it and it's not because

667
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:20,239
you had said like you can allow yourself to like confront it i

668
01:25:20,239 --> 01:25:26,800
don't you don't use the word confront but you can or not so i was like i see you but i'm not

669
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:32,320
gonna talk to you you can have a space here so it's the same thing as like you can sit down but i'm not gonna save you

670
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:38,400
anything or not ready yet so anyway you're not alone

671
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:44,880
beautiful it's so so helpful right to be able to be wise

672
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:51,360
and to sort of say okay i see you here and i know i can't quite dance with you right

673
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:57,380
now right it's okay have a seat maybe we'll tangle later

674
01:25:57,380 --> 01:26:05,400
[Laughter] yeah what else happened for you guys

675
01:26:34,239 --> 01:26:41,120
hi i'm learning great hold on richard can you bring him great

676
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:55,678
hello so um i'm just i'm just explaining why i went outside is uh i went into

677
01:26:55,920 --> 01:27:02,800
a memory that we brought about strong emotion

678
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:07,840
and usually how i deal with strong emotion is to exercise

679
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:13,199
so i just did some push-ups outside but

680
01:27:13,199 --> 01:27:19,600
typically i'm in like a yoga studio so when i do push-ups it's not a disturbance to others

681
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:24,719
um but i was just thinking i really need to lift weights right now so they can

682
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:31,120
uh you know get back to that kind of get the endorphins

683
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:37,120
in and all that stuff so but yeah it was a nice

684
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:46,560
setting to explore emotion beautiful um and uh it's

685
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:53,120
just strong emotion so i gotta beautiful that's so wise i'm so glad you gave yourself you know

686
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:58,880
permission to trust your wisdom right to trust what you know works for you and we all

687
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:04,880
i really want to commend you and thank you for taking care of yourself and doing that it's beautiful

688
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:09,198
all right well thank you yeah thank you

689
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:15,040
do you want this i think i'll just use this

690
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:27,040
we've just about come to uh another close breathing body emotions

691
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:35,280
i'd like to just mention a couple of suggested bits of homework

692
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:42,159
for the week as we've been saying all along um

693
01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:47,679
if you meditate between the sessions can really help prepare you for the next

694
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:54,560
for the next one if you only meditate while you're here i can't speak for tanya that's fine with

695
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:59,600
me just fine with me and it can really put you in a good

696
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:06,560
place to pick up the next bit of material if you have some practice with what we just did

697
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:12,320
so we will encourage you to this time lengthen your sessions to 25 minutes

698
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:18,880
daily um at least once during the week see if you

699
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:26,320
get an opportunity to ride out the emotion that tanya was talking about 60 90 120 seconds

700
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:32,639
when that emotion comes on if you feel up for it take a seat in your chair

701
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:37,760
or wherever you're comfortable and just say just for those

702
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:43,920
60 90 120 seconds i'm not going to get up i'm just going to stay right here and feel this out i'm

703
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:49,960
just going to ride it out and we'll see what happens

704
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:57,600
as we're working with emotions important to keep up resourcing

705
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:02,800
important to keep our resources full i'm glad we finished with trust

706
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:09,280
one of the ways that you can practice this throughout the week is that throughout the day see if you can tune

707
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:16,800
into any just even tiny sense or feeling of well-being or

708
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:22,639
contentment or even like little pleasant emotions throughout the day we can do quite a lot when we finish

709
01:30:22,639 --> 01:30:28,719
that that last exercise with three to five conscious breaths with resource that felt like way longer than i

710
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:36,080
typically spend with a resource right so we can dip into it throughout the day

711
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:38,560
and then

712
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:48,239
you can also give some some little bit of attention to something something akin to noticing

713
01:30:48,239 --> 01:30:53,600
patterns it's like what kind of emotions draw you into story most easily

714
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:59,440
and give some attention to that so simple

715
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:04,480
simple three other things i want to mention i

716
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:11,040
think we can do it in the last minute uh one is a lot of what we're covering here

717
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:16,239
and much much more is uh available in this bound book called the issue at hand

718
01:31:16,239 --> 01:31:22,080
that's right by the front door great essays on on this practice

719
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:29,120
so that may be it's a resource i go back to over and over for years
