1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:08,320
so i'm a little bit touched or to find a wonderful

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,519
resonance that last sunday i gave a talk about

3
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:20,720
martin luther king jr and this day i'll talk about

4
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:28,400
tiknot han and they knew each other and they influenced each other

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,800
martin luther king was influenced by tiknot han to be opposed to the vietnam war

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,520
a monumental change in the direction of his work that he did one that was controversial and

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:48,719
in retrospect was probably a wonderful and important change

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,800
and in return partly martin luther king but the whole

9
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,879
civil rights movement united states had a big impact on han and

10
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:07,200
he learned about it while he was staying here in this country in the early very early 1960s

11
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,560
and when he went back to vietnam it's inspired him to do those

12
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,640
the kind of service work and anti-war work and that

13
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,040
that he dedicated himself to until he

14
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,280
was exiled by the government so um

15
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,040
tikhnathan was a one of the great teachers of the 20th century

16
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,200
and had a huge influence on western buddhism as i said he was exiled i think around

17
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,720
1964 so from vietnam and then he settled in france

18
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:56,320
and and from there started slowly beginning to teach more and more

19
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,079
and i became aware of him in the early 1980s and he was

20
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:09,599
i was living at the san francisco zen center and um and he uh

21
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:15,040
he was contacted to support uh when the zen center went through tremendous turmoil around

22
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:21,440
the ethical challenges of its abbott at the time and he tried he was a consultant for

23
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:28,000
both the abbett and for the zen center as a whole and and then he came to zen center

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,360
and he had a big impact on the students at zen center and for a

25
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,360
variety of reasons one was that he included children

26
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,200
and he would give a dharma talk and he'd have the children come and sit up front and he would talk to them and then they

27
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,480
would leave and he'd give a talk for the adults and while this seems like a small thing

28
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:57,599
in the kind of a little bit more austere or strict model of japanese end that

29
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,800
samsung center inherited it that was not done that kind of

30
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,080
blending and so it kind of broke the mold and opened up to a whole different kind of

31
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:16,640
softness and and kindness he also gave a lot of emphasis on

32
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:23,120
lay practitioners and of course the samsung zen center had a lot of late practitioners but sikna

33
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:31,280
han kind of elevated the importance of lay practice and also elevated the importance of lay teachers

34
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,640
i don't think san francisco's end center had really any recognition of lay teachers at that time

35
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,239
and a number of the senior lay practitioners started uh spending time with technohan some going to france to

36
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,599
be with him and then became we're transmitted we're authorized to be

37
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:53,200
teachers in tiknon han's lineage and this idea that a lay person could be

38
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,319
become a buddhist teacher it was also kind of novel and kind of opened up the field

39
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:04,480
and appreciation for lay people in the in the scene

40
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,680
he also had a gentleness and a dedication to non-violence and kindness

41
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,879
and softness and to joy and happiness that also was

42
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:20,720
not quite the ethos of cybersex center he came and gave us meditation

43
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:28,000
instructions that included using phrases which was very different from the more silent just sitting practice that we did

44
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,960
and some of the phrases were things like breathing in i calm my body

45
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:42,400
breathing out i smile stepping i experience joy

46
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,440
stepping i feel home and so he had all these kind of phrases

47
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,479
that would incorporate into the meditation practice and i remember using them

48
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:58,000
back then and feeling all this joy and delight that that was and to feel that this was

49
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,960
permitted and part of the practice was somewhat novel in the mid-1980s for me and for some of the

50
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:11,440
other zen students at the time so he had a big influence on the local

51
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:18,000
buddhist communities that i was part of but he did that for much of the world and he traveled around the world and

52
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,440
taught all over and um the after meeting at iknothan at the san

53
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,560
francisco zen center the next time i met met him was

54
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,160
coincidentally i flew into i went back to norway to visit my relatives

55
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:41,039
and when i arrived at the airport there are all these people clearly buddhists waiting for something

56
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:48,000
special to happen and my relatives who were waiting for me were i was a zen priest by then was a

57
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,520
little bit what's going on here are they waiting for gil but when i came out of the into the arrival section i i had no importance

58
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:02,080
with people who are waiting uh tiknot han was flying flew in on the very next plane so they were there

59
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:08,880
waiting for him so knowing that tiknot han was going to be there i spent the weekend with him

60
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:15,360
in a in a school classroom where he was teaching a relatively small group of people and that was really special to

61
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,800
spend this time with him the um

62
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:27,600
han uh was a man of i think tremendous emotional depth emotional capacity

63
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,800
he suffered a lot and uh and he openly talked about it to

64
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:39,680
suffering and he wrote poems about it he was very creative he was a poet he was a storyteller

65
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:46,319
he was he had a rich imagination a rich use of language very evocative

66
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:53,039
he was innovative uh he was probably one of the more animated teachers especially monastic teachers of

67
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:59,680
the 20th century pushing the edge and changing things and doing innovative things with buddhism

68
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,680
itself it's a famous idea of him is that he was one of the first buddhist monks to ride

69
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,360
a bicycle and maybe it seems like a small thing but this was kind of really pushing the

70
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,639
boundaries into the modern world he started his own monastic order that

71
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:22,479
the order of inter-being in vietnam in the 1960s because he saw a need to kind of

72
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,680
emphasize a whole different ethos the old different approach to buddhism

73
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,599
he coined important terms he called the term engaged buddhism

74
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:40,080
which uh involved buddhism that was actively engaged in the social welfare of the world and

75
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,360
and uh which he was to the degree to to endanger to at the

76
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,800
risk of his own life in fact some of his of colleagues had worked with him

77
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,879
lost their lives during the vietnam war in their non-violent work and

78
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:03,919
that was misunderstood by both sides of the vietnam war because he wasn't supporting one side against the other he

79
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:10,560
was seen as belonging to the other and so both sides saw him that way so he was kind of in a risky middle

80
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,720
but he was dedicated to not having enemies to working for non-violence working for ending the war

81
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,000
they made him unpopular so eventually he became uh you know exiled

82
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,360
but uh you know this was part of parcel of his engaged buddhism this you act you work in the world

83
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,039
and maybe it's not a coincidence that is his name

84
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:41,360
tiknot han the tick part means that uh he's a

85
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:50,080
kind of means he's he's a child of the buddha he's in the clan of the buddha and the family in the buddha family

86
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,200
and many monks in thailand are called tik because of that once you ordain you join

87
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,640
your child of the buddha kind of

88
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,080
not means one and han means action so

89
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:12,959
he was a man of action to engage buddhism tremendous action and what the one refers to i don't know

90
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:19,600
it's a lot of symbolic value what one isn't but one thing it meant was that when i

91
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,959
knew him and i think other people the tremendous presence he had to just

92
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:31,360
do the thing he was doing whatever action he was doing that's what he did if he was drinking tea it was just

93
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,040
drinking tea if he was walking just walking and to be in his presence was to kind of

94
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,640
slow down and um and he kind of like brought you into the

95
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:49,040
present because he was so present and there was a kind of commanding his gentleness and his softness and his

96
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,480
slowness was kind of commanding to everyone slow down and

97
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,240
and and so you know it wasn't like fast action wasn't like he was in a hurry for

98
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,600
anything no hurry whatsoever one action you just do one thing at a

99
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,640
time but in that one thing at a time slowly calmly

100
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:16,240
he was able to do a phenomenal amount of things phenomenal teaching

101
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,760
action support innovation started monasteries or certainly he got

102
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:27,760
lots of help at some point but in the beginning you know him and his colleagues were able to really

103
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,760
foster a phenomenal movement of buddhist movement one of the great

104
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,519
movements of the modern world and

105
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:46,640
and he had a tremendous amount of wonderful teachings that he offered him we get a sense of his emotional depth

106
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:53,279
and the degree to which he suffered especially during the time of the vietnam war from some of the poetry he

107
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:58,480
wrote at that time and so i would like to read some of that

108
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,480
and this poem is titled for warmth

109
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,760
i hold my face in my two hands

110
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:18,079
no i am not crying i hold my face in my two hands

111
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:23,920
to keep the loneliness warm two hands protecting

112
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,920
two hands nourishing two hands preventing my soul

113
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,480
from leaving me in anger

114
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:43,360
and he talks about you know much of what he had to deal with and work with in during the vietnam war and

115
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,640
later the things that people did to each other left him angry

116
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:55,200
and [Music] but he he practiced with it and here's an example of how he practiced with it

117
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,959
and uh this idea of holding his face with his two hands the cupped hands over the face holding

118
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:08,880
his loneliness holding his anger i think it's a very tender and way of being mindful and present

119
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:15,279
um some of his uh uh fellow monks some of them some of

120
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:22,399
them he knew i don't know if he knew all of them but um

121
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:29,120
uh where the ones who uh uh uh burnt themselves in protest to the

122
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:36,480
war they sat in the streets and poured gasoline over themselves and there's photographs probably most of you have seen them of these monks sitting there

123
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,240
in meditation posture calmly sitting and meditating with the

124
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,279
engulfed in fire as they're burning until they died

125
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:52,399
and so here's one poem

126
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:58,560
the fire that burns in you burns my flesh

127
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:07,200
with such pain that all my tears are not enough to cool your sacred soul

128
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:13,200
deeply wounded i remain here keeping your hopes and promises for the

129
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,839
young i will not betray you are you

130
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:24,240
listening i remain here because your very heart

131
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,560
is now my heart so

132
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,320
he had these things pained him tremendously the loss the pain the suffering this is a

133
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,760
man who suffered a lot but he was not afraid to suffer

134
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:47,920
he was not crippled by a suffering he practiced with it he turned it around

135
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:55,199
he composted it he dedicated it to a different way of living

136
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,320
here's another poem

137
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:10,320
and this was printed in 1966 for the fellowship of reconciliation as a

138
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:17,120
christmas card life has left her footprints on my

139
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:24,240
forehead but i have become a child again this morning the smile seen through leaves and

140
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:30,880
flowers is back to smooth away the wrinkles as the rains wipe away footprints on the

141
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:37,760
beach again a cycle of birth and death begins

142
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:45,199
i walk on thorns but firmly as among flowers i keep my

143
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:54,639
head high rhymes bloom among the sounds of bombs and mortars

144
00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:00,160
the tears i shed yesterday have become rain

145
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:06,720
i feel calm hearing its sound on the thatched roof childhood my birthland

146
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,800
is calling me and the rains melt my despair

147
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:18,240
i am still here alive able to smile quietly

148
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,360
o sweet fruit brought forth by the tree of suffering

149
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,720
carrying the dead body of my brother i go across the rice fields in the

150
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,800
darkness earth will keep you tight within her arms my dear

151
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:40,079
so that tomorrow you will be reborn as flowers

152
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:46,639
those flowers smiling quietly in the morning field this moment

153
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:54,720
you weep no more my dear we have gone through too deep a night

154
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:01,759
this morning i kneel down on the grass when i notice your presence

155
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:09,519
flowers that carry the marvelous smile of ineffability speak to me in silence

156
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:16,079
the message the message of love and understanding

157
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:22,959
has indeed come to us so telling is a powerful poem to

158
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:29,440
describe his own despair his own suffering and the depth of it and probably it's true that he carried

159
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:36,720
his dead colleague fellow monk to be buried in mortars and bombs that were blowing

160
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,759
up around him and he was yet he was on the you know he was there working at the

161
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:48,560
not exactly at the forefront of the war but right there what was happening around him

162
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:54,000
and then to end with a message of love uh what a powerful thing

163
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,959
to do and then he um you know and then he he offered would

164
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:07,438
come to come to us to here in the west and he would do walking meditation with us he would do

165
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,720
team meditation with us and this you know to walk with technolon you know

166
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:20,959
outdoors on the ground slowly mindfully was quite a powerful experience

167
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:28,400
here's a poem called walking meditation take my hand

168
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,679
we will walk we will only walk

169
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:41,039
we will enjoy our walk without thinking of arriving anywhere

170
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:48,320
walk peacefully walk happily our walk is a peace walk

171
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,679
our walk is a happiness walk then we learn

172
00:17:53,679 --> 00:18:00,160
that there is no peace walk that peace is the walk

173
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:06,160
that there is no happiness walk that happiness is the walk

174
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:13,280
we walk for ourselves we walk for everyone always hand in hand

175
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:20,400
walk and touch peace every moment walk and touch happiness every moment

176
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,760
each step brings a fresh breeze each step makes a flower bloom under our

177
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:34,080
feet kiss the earth with your feet print on earth your love and happiness

178
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:41,280
earth will be safe when we feel in us enough safety

179
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,960
when we feel in us enough safety so to go from

180
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:54,240
the suffering of vietnam and the first poems and his dedication to be in the present moment and keep looking keeping present

181
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:02,400
and seeing what is here and to be fully with his suffering then fully with the flowers the next day

182
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:08,880
and to be fully with the suffering and ready to smile soon thereafter

183
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,400
to be fully present for this and and here we are walking

184
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:20,240
and the earth will be safe when we feel in us enough safety

185
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,720
what does it take to feel say have safety within us is that where safety is to be found

186
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,000
is the earth safe when we find in safety in us i think he would say yes to all those

187
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
questions that and so he dedicated himself to teaching

188
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,240
people the what he called the miracle of mindfulness to show up for this moment right here

189
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:50,840
but it wasn't just to show up for it he emphasized penetrating through to the depth of it

190
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:56,320
um seeing through to some kind of to the ultimate that was there

191
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,679
and um and so what i read the poem i read the gata i read

192
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:07,679
um beginning of the meditation i'll read it again the the chan zen tradition that he was

193
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:13,120
part of um classically they used a lot of gatas the four line verses

194
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,480
and when i was in japan we were given verses to recite when we washed our hands we

195
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:25,520
used the toilet and do all kinds of ordinary things so he had one here

196
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:32,400
i have arrived i and i am home so this again this emphasis of coming

197
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:39,520
home but here finding it in the present moment i have arrived i am home

198
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,880
in the here in the now i am solid i am free

199
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,400
in the ultimate i dwell

200
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:02,640
here's another poem with his anger angry in the ultimate dimension

201
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:09,360
i close my eyes and look deeply three hundred years from now

202
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:15,039
where will you be and where shall i be speaking to his anger anger

203
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:20,720
in 300 years from now where will you be and where shall i be

204
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,559
angry in the ultimate dimension then he wrote

205
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:33,360
when we are angry what do we usually do we shout scream and try to blame someone

206
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:39,360
else for our problems but looking at anger with the eyes of impermanence

207
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,799
we can stop and breathe angry at each other in the ultimate dimension

208
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:51,679
we close our eyes and look deeply we try to see 300 years into the future

209
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,880
what will you be like what will i be like where will you be

210
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:03,440
where will i be we need only to breathe in and out look at our future

211
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:09,120
and the other person's future we don't need to look as far as 300 years

212
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:15,600
it could be 50 or 60 years from now when we have both passed away

213
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:21,840
and so he kept emphasizing looking deeply

214
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:27,440
but for him looking deeply in with impermanence was also

215
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:33,760
kind of opened this rich multi-dimensional world that also used the imagination imagining

216
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,960
300 years in the future and he would look at the famous exercise

217
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,159
they gave was was to look at a piece of paper and basically imagine

218
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:51,760
that you see deeply with your mouth if you look see deeply with your imagination you see more than just the paper

219
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:57,520
you see the tree that grew that became the paper you see

220
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:05,200
the the rain that there there in the soil that nourished the tree to grow you saw the sun that's

221
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:11,200
shown its sunlight on it that allowed the tree to grow you see the person who cut the tree down the

222
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:18,720
the people who converted the paper the people who brought the paper to the store the storekeeper who sold it to you

223
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:25,840
and you see this rich world that included the ecology that we're in included the social world we live in and

224
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:32,480
to see all of it together in in some big way for him was part of uh waking up to this

225
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,840
world and it's partly maybe why he has such a strong social message

226
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:44,640
um that he saw us living in this what he called inter-being world an interdependent

227
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:52,240
world where we our our own being was no separate than the being of everyone else we enter our

228
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,400
is we enter our we we exist because someone else exists

229
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,080
um here he wrote to poem

230
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:12,080
the title interrelationship you are me

231
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:19,360
and i am you isn't it obvious that we enter are

232
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:25,200
you cultivate the flower in yourself so that i will be beautiful

233
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,840
i transform the garbage in myself so that you will not

234
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:37,919
suffer i support you you support me i am in this world to offer you peace

235
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:44,480
you are this you are in this world uh to being

236
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,840
to bring me joy

237
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:56,799
so enter our inter being and so he saw this at a social level at

238
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:01,840
an environmental level all kinds of levels so he kept emphasizing

239
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:09,919
uh you know this level in which we enter our and powerful teachings for him

240
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,960
the last week i read a passage by martin

241
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:25,279
luther king where he said that god is love so i don't know if uh

242
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:31,120
what degree that influenced dick not han but he had this wonderful uh

243
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,559
book i mean it's a more he's a anthology of different people writing it but this

244
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:42,480
but just a title it was inspiring for me and very meaningful when i first came out

245
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:49,600
the title is for a future to be possible commentaries on the five wonderful

246
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:56,400
precepts so the five precepts that we have he called wonderful precepts he always would put these adjectives in

247
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:02,240
front of things and you know that kind of superlatives but wonderful and wondrous

248
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:08,320
and things like that and so he's talking about the five ethical precepts

249
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:15,039
and but for a future to be possible and uh i think it's a powerful idea

250
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:21,440
isn't future going to come futures will always come but will we be there as a human race for the futures

251
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:27,440
what kind of future will we have and so and so ethics is part of that

252
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:34,640
and but he wrote

253
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:40,640
the five wonderful precepts are love itself

254
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:46,559
to love is to understand protect and bring well-being to the object of our

255
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:52,559
love the practice of the precepts accomplishes this we protect ourselves and we protect

256
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:58,960
others i am confident that our children and

257
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:05,760
their children will have an even better understanding of the five precepts and will obtain even deeper peace and

258
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:11,440
joy this hopeful message so he was looking into the future he was

259
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:18,880
looking into the past he was looking at this worldwide imagination creative imagination throughout the world

260
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:24,399
and he was saying just show up here when you walk just walk only walk

261
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:31,360
and um you know really drink your tea and just drink your tea so this guy he had this capacity he had to switch

262
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:36,880
orientations to understand and to grow and develop and open up and focus and be

263
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:43,520
here and work through his sorrow and his grief and find happiness and joy was phenomenal

264
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:49,360
the humanity of this man and to bring so much humanity into his buddhism his buddhist teachings

265
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:55,679
was kind of exceptional i think for any buddhist teacher and

266
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:05,039
so he died i think on thursday we say he died

267
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,840
and i suspect

268
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:16,480
if he said that for himself i died he would have followed it up by

269
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:22,640
there is no death and he talked about that sometimes there is

270
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:28,840
no death but this idea of no death no birth or no

271
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:35,120
death um that's to be it's not to be believed or understood logically

272
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:41,600
but it's to be discovered in really being present just here and now

273
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,720
free of our abstract ideas or proliferations free of our stories

274
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,799
free of our concepts and there's something about just being present

275
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:58,880
in the purity of simplicity of presence that shows a deathless realm shows that

276
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:05,919
birthless realm shows some aspect of attention of awareness that is free of concepts and ideas of

277
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:12,480
past and future free of anything but just here

278
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,840
and to and to find his freedom and peace and to

279
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:24,799
feel at home and to recognize this is the ultimate this is profound um this is a profanity which is always

280
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:31,840
here it's a dimension of that in a certain kind of way doesn't depend

281
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:38,320
on our concepts and ideas and our thoughts in a sense doesn't depend on our existence

282
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:45,120
and but it's the kind of a true home um and so in it there's no birth and death

283
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:52,559
there's just being present so to be fully present the moment of your death for that moment is to be in a

284
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:58,720
timeless deathless moment um and then afterwards well it continues

285
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:05,600
to be the same timeless moment and something there's freedom there that's the avenue for love for this richness

286
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,799
that he was so much about was inclusive of all this

287
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:17,600
so he has a kind of final

288
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:25,679
tribute to him and maybe in a way that he would appreciate and to quote him again

289
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:32,000
he was a teacher and he spent tremendous amount of time teaching

290
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,279
and the testimony of all his teaching is all the books that those produced something like

291
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,360
a hundred books in english

292
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:51,520
but he wrote or said teaching is not done by talking alone

293
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:58,880
it is done by how you live your life my life is my teaching

294
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,399
my life is my message

295
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,039
so my life is my message

296
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:22,159
and um that message continues

297
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:28,320
he's still alive and

298
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,600
his example lives in us in our memories and those of us he touched and those of

299
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:39,600
us who learn about him and uh and it's a teaching that points

300
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,640
back to ourselves and imagine how would you live

301
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,640
if your life was the message if your life was your teaching

302
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:59,840
and then maybe we would realize our true nature in the way that refers to such language he said

303
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:06,720
our true nature is the nature of no birth and no death

304
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:16,640
only when we touch our true nature can we transcend the fear of not existing the fear annihilation

305
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,960
so

306
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:36,159
i'm inspired by tiknot han i'm saddened by his passing i'm inspired by his

307
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:41,440
passing because his passing is just as much as message and

308
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:48,559
to not see his passing as part of his teachings part of his message is to miss his teachings miss hui what

309
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:55,519
he was about and so to hold both to hold this wide range of feelings we

310
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:00,720
have and not to get caught in the feelings and stuck in them but see them too as

311
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,919
part of this inter-being that is not ours alone

312
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:12,640
and that which by seeing and with the eyes of impermanence seeing with depth

313
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:19,039
we find our freedom and perhaps our smile in the midst of our sadness

314
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:24,600
may it be that thickness life

315
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,399
grows the smiles that can exist in this world the smiles of the children may the

316
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:38,240
children smile a lot and may we support that the smiles of our elders

317
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:45,600
may our lives be one that brings smiles to them so they experience smiles before they die

318
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:53,279
their smiles grow smiles for our neighbors smile for our colleagues smiles for our

319
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:59,200
family our friends maybe live a life that uh

320
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,320
spreads smiles throughout the world

321
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:10,800
smiles that can help us to hold kindly lovingly compassionately

322
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,839
