00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,719
hello everyone and welcome

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:22,720
and as an introduction to this meditation

3
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:32,640
we discover that often when we sit down to meditate that the mind is as other ideas

4
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,960
that we are concerned with things that we have a mental tendency to

5
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,640
fixate on certain certain kinds of thoughts ideas concerns that we have

6
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,559
and that the simple act of coming back to focus on the breathing

7
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:56,160
can be challenging because the mind has other ideas there's this strong tendency to

8
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,280
to be focused on the concerns or focus on the distractions or the fantasies or

9
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:07,600
whatever it might be and sometimes the mind when it's focused on its concerns

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,760
can be locked in sometimes there can be a strong force in that direction and

11
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:20,159
there's not the mind is not soft or in a receptive relaxed way because it's

12
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,520
concerned about something there's energy in it and so one of the things that happens in

13
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,360
meditation is softening of that kind of uh fixation of the mind or

14
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,560
preoccupation of the mind the energy that's so directed at our concerns

15
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:43,840
that sometimes is locked in and there's a softening that the yielding of that uh quieting of that

16
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,040
a stilling of it that happens and uh without that quieting and

17
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,119
softening of it meditation is a battle and uh to come back to the breath over and over again and

18
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,960
and sometimes it adds more tension sometimes because of uh

19
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,560
of uh you know the struggle between these two forces but if we understand that part of what

20
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:14,000
we're doing and returning to the breathing and even and focusing on the breathing is uh helping the mind begin to soften

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
the grip of those concerns often it's it's uh it's a tightness around

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,400
its energy it's it's kind of forceful directedness at certain concerns and preoccupations or even

23
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,520
uh even with the thinking itself

24
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:39,040
and then it might be more easier not to have this a battle but to find a kind of supportive way in a helpful way to

25
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,560
support that stilling softening of the mind so that we can stay more focused on the

26
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,680
breathing without that being fixated without that being tight

27
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,760
and so one of the ways to do this is to um of course the mind will wander off in

28
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,440
thought is to be very careful how you begin again with your breathing how you resume

29
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,280
the focus on the breathing it's important not to

30
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:14,560
jerk the mind back or forcefully put the mind back or or to be critical and upset with the

31
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:22,000
fact the mind wandered off in thought and is preoccupied but rather to find a way that

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,280
that's actually pleasant believe it or not a pleasant way of returning to the

33
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,040
breathing and being there that the very movement of returning or beginning again

34
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:40,000
or coming back to the breathing or letting the breathing come back into awareness it feels like a you know enjoyable

35
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,599
movement it's like a it's like a tai chi move that just feels so

36
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:51,040
beautiful or it feels like it's a very graceful

37
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:57,040
and so that even so much so we look forward to that movement of returning

38
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:03,040
and so that the very returning to the breathing then can contribute to the softening of

39
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,720
the thinking mind and then we come back and we do it over and

40
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:15,200
over again and slowly the thinking mind relaxes sometimes it relaxes because we relax

41
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,959
the thinking muscle sometimes we can actually quiet a little bit of thinking just to calm it down

42
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,840
just intentionally sometimes it just uh the fact that we're not reinforcing it but continually

43
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,440
pouring our mental attention into it our energy into it it uh it's not

44
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:40,479
doesn't get it stops being fed and so it quiets down sometimes with time our ability to stay

45
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:48,240
focused in the breathing improves not because it's a forceful attention but we've learned to have this kind of

46
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:55,600
steady committed attention to the breathing that where the interest now becomes stronger to stay there than

47
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,960
it is with the distractions so

48
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:07,440
so and the softening of the mind quieting

49
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,880
of the thinking mind and relaxing of it and settling of it

50
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:20,080
is uh brings us to a place where we can abide we can just dwell we kind of rest

51
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:26,160
with awareness rest and awareness rest with the experience of breathing or be stable in

52
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,919
it and that begins opening up new dimensions of mindfulness meditation

53
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:37,440
dimensions of the insight because we're not because we've kind of cleared out an

54
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:45,360
enough of the veils of thinking so we can be more subtle in the present moment with direct experience

55
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:52,479
so in this meditation maybe you can have some focus on

56
00:05:52,479 --> 00:06:00,000
this softening of the mind the thinking mind softening relaxing quieting stilling

57
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,600
and part of that is how you return to the breathing and maybe however you often you wonder off be

58
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,960
content that now you get to practice this returning starting over again

59
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:20,639
in a you know you know looking experimenting to how to find a nice way to do it

60
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:26,560
so assuming an upright meditation posture

61
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,120
and

62
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:40,000
and maybe a little bit if you sway back and forth twist your body a little bit just gently

63
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,600
as a way of physically connecting to your body

64
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:52,479
and maybe making small adjustments so that you are a little bit better

65
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,280
aligned in your body for meditation

66
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:06,400
and then letting the the body come to stillness and maybe appreciating that stillness

67
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,160
more because you moved a little bit

68
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:23,120
and feeling the experience of eyes how does your how does your eyes feel right now

69
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:31,520
and if you haven't closed your eyes gently close your eyes and feel how the eyes are different

70
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,720
with the eyes closed

71
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:47,440
and see if you can soften your eyes relax them maybe having the eyes rest in their

72
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:54,560
sockets particularly helpful if we are still

73
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,638
kind of searching with the eyes even with the eyes closed

74
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,000
and then gently taking a few long slow deep breaths

75
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:17,360
and as you exhale maybe there's some way that you can

76
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:24,639
relax the thinking muscle softening any tension

77
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,560
tightness associated with thinking

78
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,200
almost as you exhale the mind

79
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:41,839
settles into the torso down

80
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:53,279
as if the mind has a chance to settle into a nice soft chair and relax finally

81
00:08:53,360 --> 00:09:01,720
to relax after a long day of work a long life of working

82
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,480
letting your breathing return to normal

83
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,480
and still as you exhale to relax the body some more

84
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,839
the tensions of the mind are also often expressed in the body

85
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,760
soften the belly

86
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,399
soften in the shoulders

87
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,440
soften in the face

88
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,600
and then gently maybe lovingly

89
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,000
center your attention on the breathing

90
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:53,040
maybe with the idea that using your awareness

91
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:59,079
you will accompany your breathing

92
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:15,800
and every time you exhale let go of your thoughts

93
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:26,160
or if you can't let go of them see if you can quiet the thinking mind

94
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,240
bring greater calm do it

95
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:55,040
if you wonder often thought see if you can return to breathing

96
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,880
in an enjoyable way

97
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:08,839
and it might be enjoyable if you don't have a high

98
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:16,880
standard but be content with the best doing the best you can

99
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,079
over and over again sent settling into the breathing

100
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,839
accompanying the breathing with a

101
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,120
soft committed attention

102
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,959
one breath at a time

103
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,200
returning to your breathing

104
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:51,120
and with the mind as soft as as it possible

105
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:58,240
let your attention rest almost like the mind is resting

106
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,520
in the rhythm of breathing

107
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,480
as if the rhythm of breathing is like waves

108
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,919
moving across the ocean

109
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:30,240
awareness rides the waves up and down coming and going

110
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,759
floating on the breathing

111
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:21,398
as you exhale perhaps softening the mind

112
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,840
relaxing the thinking muscle

113
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:35,840
imagining the mind as a broad still quiet lake

114
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:44,240
cool peaceful

115
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,000
as you exhale letting go of your thinking

116
00:27:52,399 --> 00:28:00,360
letting them your thoughts float away off the surface of the peaceful lake

117
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,960
in whatever is not peaceful

118
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:20,080
can you for a few moments be aware of that peacefully

119
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,559
calmly

120
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:39,840
and then to turn your attention your calm attention

121
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:47,120
outward into the world to the people you'll encounter today in

122
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:52,880
your neighborhoods stores

123
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:03,679
colleagues family friends that

124
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,919
who you hold in your heart

125
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:15,919
and while you're resting the mind

126
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:26,600
the kind of without fixating on anything

127
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:36,159
be aware of the people of the world their joys and their sorrows

128
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:47,600
the ways in which they live in all kinds of challenging ways

129
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:59,279
and to look upon it all gaze upon it with the eyes of care of compassion

130
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,880
quietly peacefully

131
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,398
gazing upon the world kindly

132
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:23,720
offer your care to the world

133
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,919
maybe through these words

134
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:37,799
may i contribute to the welfare and happiness of everyone

135
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:42,880
may all beings be happy

136
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:51,720
may all beings be safe

137
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:57,120
may all beings be peaceful

138
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:04,278
and may all beings everywhere be free

139
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:16,769
[Music]

140
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:23,500
[Music]

141
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:43,120
so hello and so in our continued

142
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:49,120
discussion of the exploration of the sati patana sutta

143
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:56,000
we're spending time now with the refrain there are 13 exercises in sati satipat

144
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,360
and we're staying now with the first one which has to do with breathing

145
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,799
but as this practice of breathing becomes more focused more

146
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:13,519
awareness grows then that awareness is available for insight and that's what the refrains are

147
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:19,200
about so let me kind of repeat what i've said a number of times now

148
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:25,679
that the exercises are an engagement a way of practicing

149
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:31,200
that uh is meant to heightened our sense of awareness to click to bring

150
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,240
more clear awareness stable awareness into the present moment

151
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:42,640
and the in this case breathing is helping us establish

152
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:48,320
awareness in the present moment present moment awareness and

153
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:55,760
the practices of knowing of feeling of relaxing are all there to support our ability for awareness to

154
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:02,240
become stable in the present moment soft awareness open awareness

155
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:08,800
clear awareness and um and so when when that starts becoming

156
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:15,200
stable that our awareness our mindfulness and then uh the description and the way

157
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,560
we know we're kind of ready for the insights of the refrain

158
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:26,560
is when we're able to abide observing our experience

159
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:33,079
and so the language the the palis viharati v-i-h-a-r-a-a-t-i

160
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:41,118
and it's um it's uh it means to abide or to dwell

161
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:46,800
and it's used uh in this teachings of the buddha for um

162
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:53,440
kind of for uh when once once awareness is strong once our capacity to stay present is

163
00:34:53,440 --> 00:35:00,800
really stable and we then we can abide in different things we can abide in equanimity we can abide in calm

164
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:06,320
we can abide in deep concentration states we can abide in mindfulness we

165
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:12,079
can abide in awareness and um and so this word abide is actually a

166
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:18,800
very rich important word in the sutras and it's it's a kind of pointing us

167
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:25,599
it's kind of indicating where we're going with mindfulness practice we're not it's not only about being

168
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:31,440
mindful of our experience and seeing it clearly for what it is that's very important but it's also

169
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:39,680
about developing this capacity to have present moment awareness so we can abide in it

170
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:46,880
and we can abide in our experience and uh it goes along with observing

171
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:52,480
uh observing the experience and um and this observing as i've said

172
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,920
is an is a very spacious clear seeing that is not

173
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:03,119
interfering or judging or reacting or fixing our experience but we

174
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:09,280
just kind of settle back and just kind of see it clear that's now we can start seeing it clearly for what it is in a

175
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:15,359
clearer clearer way because by abiding we're not attacking by abiding we're not

176
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:20,720
reaching forward to grab or pulling away or doing stuff with our experience we're

177
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:26,720
just abiding with it and that allows us to come to this place of just perceiving things

178
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:32,160
in a very spacious relaxed way it's not easy to come there but this is

179
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:37,599
what the these the exercises the mindfulness exercises in this text are

180
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:44,320
supporting us and helping us to get there that way and you know it's sometimes takes

181
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:49,760
a long time to keep doing breath meditation and keep coming back and

182
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:56,720
it's so beneficial to do do this and then eventually we come to a place where the benefit starts uh

183
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:02,880
becoming that we could feel this abiding way of just being present

184
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:08,960
the reason why this is helpful and for the purposes of this path of liberation

185
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:14,240
is that it frees up the mind from being fixated on concepts and ideas

186
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:19,680
and stories and opinions imaginations that we have

187
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,880
and so for example

188
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:32,240
um to use my my example i've used a number of times of uh watching a river go by

189
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:37,920
just sitting on the banks of the river watching the river go by and then um

190
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,960
but then you know the mind starts thinking about the river and start thinking well this river is

191
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:49,200
not really flowing in the right location if it was a hundred yards further to the south

192
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,240
they're probably better there it's probably nicer to sit there and look at it get

193
00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:00,079
more sun during the day and and we start thinking about ruminating about this river and

194
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:05,440
as we think about the river we're thinking about the river but we're thinking about the concept of

195
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:10,640
the river we're no longer actually just watching and deeply absorbed and watching the river

196
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:16,800
in and of itself as we get absorbed in the concept of the river

197
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,920
the concept of river of the river is just a concept and that has a certain kind of

198
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:29,440
permanence to it the concept maybe doesn't change so much it's just the river

199
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:35,920
but if we kind of wake up from this rumination and sit back on the riverbank and and

200
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:41,599
back to the river itself and just see the directly with the river we see that the river is actually a

201
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:47,440
dynamic process of change it's moving and flowing and

202
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:54,400
all the time and and it's the moving as we sit back and rest it's the moving and flowing

203
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:01,200
that allows us to settle back and just rest and be soft and relaxed and sometimes letting go of our thoughts

204
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:07,599
and letting go of anything else just absorbed and watching it go by that we can to we cannot

205
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:13,520
rest back and be absorbed in a nice restful abiding way if we're caught up in the

206
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:21,520
thoughts about we have to move the river and how we're going to do this and how much it's going to cost and who do i write to to make this happen

207
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:27,680
the mind then is kind of active and maybe even a little bit straining it's work to have those thoughts

208
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:33,839
and so so as the mind softens and relaxes and the thinking mind

209
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:40,000
does stops becoming a priority that we have to figure out everything or

210
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,200
by our thoughts or think everything out but we start relaxing enough to start

211
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:52,240
being with not with concepts with the direct experience then we start watching

212
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:57,680
the changing nature of things so it's kind of like watching um

213
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:04,319
seeing a single fall leaf fall from a tree and then uh immediately thinking about

214
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:10,000
you know oh no now i have to sweep soon i've got to sweep my yard and it's gonna be a lot of work

215
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,839
and and um and uh maybe i need to buy a new rake and

216
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:22,160
and then i'm kind of caught up in a world that doesn't allow me to really appreciate the the wonderful

217
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:28,079
fl uh flowing down of the leaf and um and then as though maybe the wind

218
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:33,680
picks up or as fall gets stronger um a lot of leaves begin falling at the same

219
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:40,079
time and i and i can't just fixate on one leaf falling i just had to sit back

220
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:46,720
and just kind of watch in a very broad spacious receptive way all the leaves just falling and

221
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:52,880
falling like snow just coming down so these this is um

222
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:59,200
as we develop this practice it turns out that so much of our experience of the body or

223
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:05,440
direct experience of the body is more akin to the river flowing or the leaves falling

224
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:12,800
than it is to a fixed concept and often we live in the world of fixed concepts ideas and we're relating to

225
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:18,240
what's happening in our experience through the lens of these concepts and ideas

226
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:24,160
and even the concept of breathing inhale is a concept if we

227
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:30,000
if that's not if we're not fixating or focusing on that concept but rather experience the

228
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:37,359
inhale experience the exhale we see that the inhale is made up of many many different sensations that are

229
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:42,400
coming and going it's kind of like a river of sensations that flow through

230
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:48,640
us as we breathe in as we breathe out and we start seeing that actually

231
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:55,839
the uh uh you know i've sometimes had trouble with my breathing and meditation and i got so

232
00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:02,400
worked up about my breathing was wrong and i was you know like why can't i breathe better and

233
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:10,400
and what i learned to do was not to worry about these kinds of thoughts but rather to dip down into

234
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:15,680
the contracted breathing the tight breathing whatever difficulty i

235
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:21,440
had and just kind of start feeling it directly the experience itself

236
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:27,040
and the experience itself sooner or later you see it's actually made up of a lot of different

237
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:32,960
small sensations that are coming and going into existence they're there for a moment they pass away they come back in

238
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:38,560
a minute later the sensations of inhale are different in the sensations of exhale when the

239
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:46,240
inhale stops all the inhale sensations have passed away and the exhale sensations begin

240
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:52,640
and um and it might you know sound boring that you're just kind of being involved in these sensations

241
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:59,040
but it's uh not as you know it's just like watching a river and it's not to be relaxed and

242
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:06,560
it's absorbed in the beautiful flow of the process of the dynamic nature of experience

243
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:13,440
so in this refrain then as practice deepens then it says it

244
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,560
explains one abides observing

245
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:24,079
uh to use shorthand for today when abides observing the changing

246
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:29,200
experiences of the body one observes the arising and passing of

247
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:35,520
experiences in the body and um not that we're searching for it

248
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:41,520
and trying to look for change it's more like you know you're not the river looking you know trying to search for

249
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:46,560
how's the river changing how you know what's it's more like you settle back and relax

250
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:52,640
and you can watch it change so as mindfulness gets well established

251
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:58,640
as awareness is established and we can abide in in the present moment

252
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:05,119
in a way that just observes in a spacious relaxed way what we be what we now get tuned into

253
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:11,520
attuned to is the changing nature of sensations in the body

254
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:16,640
and and now the practice opens up in a different kind of way when we open up to

255
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:24,000
seeing this changing nature so we'll talk more about this because this is a probably this central insight

256
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:31,440
of insight meditation the insight into the changing nature the inconstant flow of sensations

257
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:38,720
and why it's so important and why it's so central and um and appreciate it so much

258
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:44,240
isn't probably not so obvious to people who are kind of uninitiated into this world

259
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:49,920
seems like there's much more important things to do in the world than look and see how things are changing in the body

260
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,960
and but i'll talk more about that tomorrow and go go a little bit further

261
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:00,319
into this particular section of the refrain which that says

262
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:06,079
abiding when observes the arising

263
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:11,359
experiences in the body one observes the passing away

264
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:17,520
experiences in the body and one observes the arising and passing the rising and

265
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:23,119
ceasing of experiences in the body so

266
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:30,200
that's for tomorrow so thank you very much
