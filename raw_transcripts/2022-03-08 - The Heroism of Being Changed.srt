00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,600
hello excuse me i kept my voice back here good evening

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:16,758
my name is maria stratman i'm really happy to be here it's good to see you all

3
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,039
this evening i want to talk to you

4
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:35,280
about the general topic of impermanence but recently i've been inspired by a

5
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:42,879
poem by amanda gorman you may remember her as the poet laureate

6
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:48,960
for uh who read her poem uh the hill we climb at the inauguration

7
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,520
the brilliant yellow coat that she wore and the verve that she delivered that that poem with

8
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,920
well she's written a book recently and it's called call us what we carry and in

9
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:09,119
that is this poem and one of the things that intrigues me is i'm just not sure why she chose the

10
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:16,560
title she did so tonight's topic

11
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,720
in response to the poem considers the intersection of impermanence

12
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,840
intentions and seeing clearly

13
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,479
what is true now and how can we be in the presence of what is true now

14
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,920
in the presence in this time of uncertainty how do we meet uncertainty and what does

15
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:49,200
it mean to meet uncertainty in the next place i've called my talk the heroism of being

16
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,640
changed so if i forget that as i ramble on please remind me

17
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:02,560
wave your hand and say wait a minute what were we going to talk about heroism and being changed

18
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:09,840
so let me start with the poem the poem is called closure closure

19
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:17,040
to begin again isn't to go backwards but to decide to go

20
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,360
to begin again isn't to go backwards but to decide to go

21
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:31,280
our story is not a circle carved but a spiral shed shaped spinning

22
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,400
shifting inward and outward odd infinitum like a lung

23
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,160
on the bank of speech breathe with us

24
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,400
we disembark both beside and beyond who we were who we are

25
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:55,760
it is a return and a departure we spiral on pushing up and out

26
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:04,000
like a growing thing making its form out of earth in a poem there's no end

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,920
just a place where the page glows wide and waking waiting

28
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:18,159
like a lifted hand poised and paused here is our bond unbordered by bone

29
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:24,159
perhaps love is how it feels to breathe the same air

30
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,760
all we have is time is now time takes us on

31
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,280
how we are moved says everything about what we are to each other

32
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,480
and what are we to each other if not everything

33
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,519
to begin again isn't to go backwards but to decide to go

34
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,840
it's the same as the meditation instruction when we find that our mind is wandered away we say just come back

35
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:02,159
to the breath and begin breathing again we don't spend a lot of time worrying about how we got there or what was the

36
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:08,480
the definition of the thoughts and what direction where they were going we just come back and we just

37
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:15,280
start breathing again we just come back to the breath it's the same instruction it's the same instruction for everything

38
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,600
we just come back and we take the next step

39
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,800
this poem invites us to show up in this moment

40
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,120
show up in this moment in these days in this month and this year

41
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,400
to show up with these conditions just as we are not as

42
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:45,440
the person we used to be not as the person we would like to be not as our ideal selves but as this

43
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,639
person this person that is weary

44
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,639
or excited this person these conditions

45
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,080
this room show up this way and then take a step

46
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:11,160
don't worry about how you got here or where you're going to go when you leave here but who is this person right here

47
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,520
our practice is to be aware to be aware of our state of mind to be

48
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,960
aware of this condition this experience this place

49
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:29,840
we do that in meditation and we do that in our lives this this place

50
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,520
and to notice i'm not the person i was yesterday i'm not the person i was just a few minutes

51
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:42,479
ago i'm this person to recognize

52
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:49,199
not so much how we've changed but that this is the person showing up for these conditions this is the person who has to

53
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,639
decide whether to sit here whether to leave whether to breathe whether to not breathe well that's usually not so

54
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,199
voluntary

55
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:06,560
so we want to apply this mindfulness of just how things are not only

56
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:13,520
in the meditation but when we get up from meditating and when we take the next step

57
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:20,240
and to see that what life is what experience is is not so much our changing what we're

58
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,440
going to do next but that we carry this this forward into the next moment

59
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,479
that what we decide in this moment what we do in this moment

60
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:36,319
what our intentions are in this moment condition the next moment

61
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,840
condition tomorrow condition what happens next

62
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,039
it doesn't determine it

63
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,520
we come here with our intentions some of those intentions are large

64
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,680
intentions some of them are small intentions some of them act like motivators and some of them get in our

65
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:08,479
way being aware of what our intentions are

66
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:14,400
occasionally asking ourselves what are my intentions here what is it that i'm doing

67
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,440
why am i doing this what is it that's showing up here in

68
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:26,720
this moment and keeping in mind how it is that we want to be in the moment not who we want

69
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:33,520
to be who we want to be this mythical self

70
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,120
is not the person who is here in this moment

71
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,560
you know i've always had as the overriding intention in my life

72
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,680
to be open-hearted this is this is how i want to be

73
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,199
and i realized that that begins with be open-hearted it doesn't say anything

74
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:03,120
about becoming open-hearted and that the beginning of that is be open

75
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:10,000
oh you know i always thought of being open-hearted as what the generosity that

76
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,759
i was going to bestow on others but the first thing i have to do is be open

77
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:21,680
that was an interesting realization that the the way that i am in this world with

78
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,840
you in this moment is what i'm working with

79
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,839
it's wise if i know what that is and how that fits the intentions that i have the

80
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,518
large intentions and the small intentions the everyday intentions

81
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,120
the practice is to show up with our intentions and what those mean

82
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,160
are intentions of kindness of wholesomeness of skillfulness

83
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:56,080
and to see is it here now am i ready am i ready for just this

84
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,600
oh i'm not ready okay i know i'm not ready well i'm kind of ready well i'm here

85
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,200
this is what i'm working with this is what i have these are the skills i have

86
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:16,640
what i cultivate come out of my intentions and what arises out of my actions now

87
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:23,839
that conditions the next moment that's the next set of conditions i have to worry about

88
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,240
so right now having just sat for 45 minutes i'm feeling fairly relaxed

89
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:38,000
pretty easy you know public speaking doesn't frighten me so that's okay i can just

90
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,360
i can just be here and so i have a certain amount of ease with that right okay

91
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,360
i've been kind of relaxed i've not been worrying

92
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,519
all right that's that's the condition i'm bringing into this but earlier today

93
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,399
uh that was not strict that was not necessarily true

94
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:10,880
i was out walking this afternoon and um there was a couple i i walk around this

95
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,560
pond in my neighborhood it's about a quarter mile around the pond to give you an idea of the size of it it's not very

96
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,800
large has lots of koi in it and a couple of ducks sometimes geese sometimes an

97
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,560
egret feeding on the fish and this afternoon a couple had their

98
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:35,200
dog and they were throwing balls out in the middle of the pond so that the dog could run in and chase the balls

99
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:41,200
now this is a protected pond and nobody's supposed to wade in it or get in it and not disturb the fish or the

100
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:48,399
ducks and so i'm watching this and i'm thinking i should go up and tell that person this is not acceptable

101
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,440
they can't be doing this they shouldn't be putting letting their dog in much less encouraging their dog and i'm

102
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,560
feeling all of this ill will and agitation building up in me

103
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:06,240
and i'm walking walking walking and i realized that there was outrage and

104
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,640
a sense of injustice that was getting really strong and i thought well now how can i

105
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:19,440
approach this person and the thoughts went to what's what's right speech which why speech here

106
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,040
and then i said well first i better check in and see who is this that's trying to decide this wise speech and i

107
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,160
decided part of what was happening was that there was this overwhelming feeling that

108
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:37,040
i've been carrying around with me for days around the war in ukraine and that the feeling of the injustice of

109
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:43,600
invasion and all of the experiences of frustration and helplessness that i've been having

110
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,839
had built up in me and i was about to take it out on this guy throwing his the ball into the water

111
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:55,120
in this pond recognizing that that was there that

112
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,240
that was the condition of how i've been walking around my anxiety and

113
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:07,680
sense of helplessness about war was really useful to see

114
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:14,320
so i checked and you know the fish had all moved away from that end of the pond the dog wasn't really aggressive nothing

115
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,360
was being hurt so maybe the appropriate thing for me

116
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:25,920
was not to think of the best thing to do but to be aware of this container i have

117
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,120
that includes my distress over the war in ukraine

118
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,720
and maybe time better spent thinking about what does that mean for me

119
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,000
how am i reacting to that what is what is that condition leading me to as

120
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,760
opposed to worrying about wise speech

121
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:56,880
definitely noticing the agitation the distress the lack of satisfaction

122
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:02,480
how do i meet that taking all that frustration and

123
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:08,560
releasing it in the direction of somebody else innocent or not innocent

124
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,240
just might not be the answer

125
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,800
at other times i notice the other day i noticed

126
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,320
i woke up after dreams i don't know if you dream i i tend to dream when i'm under stress or

127
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:32,720
whether or when something is really moving in me and i was having all the classic anxiety

128
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,320
things in my dreams you know like i miss my flight how can i get to japan

129
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:45,600
who knows why i wanted to go to japan but i needed to get there and and how was i going to do that or or i start you

130
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:52,720
know my cars i have a flat on my tire or i have to get under and and adjust something you know those kinds of dreams

131
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,160
dreams about helplessness and as i got out of bed i was aware of

132
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:04,240
that and i thought about ukraine and so i said okay yeah yeah yeah and then i noticed

133
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:11,839
that the feeling that i had was this closed-in feeling and very tight and

134
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,959
i actually had a feeling of smallness i don't know if you've

135
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:23,279
it's hard to talk about an attitude of mind like this but it has to do with a sense of space

136
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,560
and i realized i was compressing all of these things

137
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,600
and that what was needed was space i went outside

138
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,680
and allowed all those feelings that i was that just seemed like too much to just

139
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:46,240
be true where there was more space for them

140
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:53,600
just be true not chasing them away

141
00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:02,240
just giving them a little more space and in that space it was easy to see

142
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:09,839
easier to see ah i need to meet this how can i

143
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:17,760
affect something positive but when it was all compressed it wasn't possible for me

144
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:25,199
so being aware of the attitude that my mind the mind state

145
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:30,880
tells me something about this person in these conditions who's trying to

146
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:39,440
live life doesn't tell me what to do but it gives me information so that i see clearly

147
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:46,079
i see the campaigner the person who wants to do something

148
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:51,440
and rather than finding the place where i i have to fix something or i have to

149
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:58,800
take out the frustration there needs to be space to see ah this

150
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,399
is the person that's showing up now this is the person

151
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:11,279
this is what it feels like to be the person who is feeling frustration and

152
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:18,399
helplessness sadness and not start listening all the reasons that's true and all the all the

153
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:25,120
all the all the dictators in the world or whatever feeds into the story but

154
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:31,440
noticing this oh this is this is the effect this is this is the agitation that is

155
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,560
here and knowing the agitation that is here

156
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:45,560
it is it's the energy of just allowing what is true to be true

157
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:58,160
i don't know if any of you heard gil's talk from this morning but he actually he's talking about the sati patana suta

158
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:06,160
and this morning he talked about attitude of mind and that that was really his talk uh the the mind state

159
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,640
and and the the learning what the mind state is how

160
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,678
it feels is a practice

161
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,798
it's not automatic you know when i talk about the space seems small

162
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:28,558
sometimes that must feel strange to you it's only the way that i talk about it

163
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,600
the mind state is not a thing like a brain it's

164
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,799
it's more i i like to think of it as the container

165
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:45,440
in which my experience is taking place this this is this is the condition

166
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:51,440
part of the condition is the energy that i bring into the moment whether that energy is low energy

167
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:57,919
or high energy whether i'm feeling compressed or spacious

168
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:03,520
when things seem confused okay things seem confused

169
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:09,600
oh i don't like confusion i have to do something about confusion why am i confused let me get it all

170
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:17,360
organized i'm going to plan something notice the tendency of the mind to want to plan in the state of confusion

171
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,720
oh that's interesting what would it be like if i didn't do

172
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:29,280
that what if i didn't plan what if i didn't do that activity what would that what would be true what

173
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,799
would arise am i okay with not knowing what's going

174
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:42,760
to happen next what does that feel like

175
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:55,679
we cultivate this kind of mindfulness in meditation

176
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:01,039
and we think of it as mindfulness and stillness is there any way to get at that

177
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:06,880
stillness when everything is chaotic when everything feels out of control

178
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:13,760
how do we get how do we realize that when we come to the space where we say

179
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:19,919
oh i see there's just a moment of ah

180
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:26,720
that and it's a moment if we notice of ease there's just a kind of feeling into it

181
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,080
that's oh that's here oh that's here

182
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,120
and just that moment of ease should be registered

183
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,799
oh i noticed i got it i caught it oh great

184
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:52,799
rather like when we come back from being lost in thoughts on meditation we say i'm back here i am i am still here i'm

185
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:58,799
here and that i am here sometimes puts a little ease

186
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:07,200
in the chaos of what's going on and when we recognize it then it becomes

187
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,559
something we know and it becomes a way of

188
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:19,520
shifting our awareness from whatever it is that we've encountered that we may want to analyze

189
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:25,440
fix change and say oh this is what it feels like to be confused

190
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,559
and just that much shift in awareness brings us to a place where we're not

191
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:36,880
rolling around in whatever the the emotion is that we might have recognized

192
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:48,440
how do we not get caught by the state of mind but catch it

193
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,320
so that if we wake up sad or confused

194
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:00,559
or angry we can say ah sadness is here

195
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:06,480
hmm i should be careful about that or confusion is here

196
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:13,120
oh you're trying so hard or anger is here

197
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,840
oh anger is here wow

198
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:25,360
i don't have to then list all the reasons i've ever been angry or list the reasons i've been angry with

199
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,600
this person

200
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:37,880
i can develop a relationship to uncertainty

201
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,720
anger is here i don't know for sure what's going to happen in the next moment confusion is here

202
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,280
i don't know what's going to happen in the next moment

203
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:59,679
when we have space for things to be just as they are we have a freedom to not be have have to

204
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,519
control what happens next

205
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:16,960
so we aren't caught by whatever it is we can say oh that is here

206
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,840
we're we're reflected by afflicted by uncertainty at every turn

207
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,919
we have you know i could go down the long list there's covid you know over six million people have

208
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:35,360
died in the world from covet six million people

209
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:43,360
we've lost people we've been isolated many of us have decision fatigue is this

210
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:52,480
safe is this not safe there are over uh 1.7 million refugees

211
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,520
from the ukraine in the last 12 days wow

212
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:03,120
where are all those people there's inflation and financial and

213
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,960
insecurity there's climate change there's inequality there no

214
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:15,360
end to things that we might worry about and we as humans try to protect

215
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,720
ourselves against these things we become ever vigilant and we become more vigilant and more

216
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:27,679
vigilant and pretty soon we are little vigilant machines and we're so busy being vigilant we haven't noticed that

217
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:34,960
our hearts have turned down that we have locked ourselves up that we're constantly looking with an eye of

218
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,880
suspicion and so something we were counting on

219
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:46,320
comes up and somebody says well i'm not going to be able to make it and all of a sudden because we're

220
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,840
carrying this suspicion around with us oh what's this about why are you doing

221
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:58,640
this to me and all of a sudden there's this adversary relationship what is quite possible the other person

222
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:04,799
just something came up and there's nothing they could do about it we don't know

223
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,360
we don't know

224
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:19,520
ajahn chah said looking for certainty and that which is not certain you're bound to suffer

225
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:26,640
looking for certainty in that which is not certain you're bound to suffer how do we free ourselves of that

226
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:33,919
how do we find a place of safety without spending all our lives trying to be safe and not

227
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:39,039
letting anything happen and trying to control the outcome of what happens

228
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:47,520
we look to what our experience has taught us we can trust this we can't trust that this is safe that's not safe

229
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:55,039
and we'd say that with the idea that it's always going to be the same but it turns out that it's not

230
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:03,039
the conditions are never the same they're always changed in some way

231
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:09,520
just as we're changed in some way so no end of planning no amount of

232
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:15,840
planning is going to assure that everything's going to happen just the way we want it to

233
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,440
better to say oh this is what it's like to be disappointed

234
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,480
oh this is what it's like to be disappointed i feel sad

235
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:35,520
i feel let down i feel thoughted whatever that experience is like

236
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:41,039
we can look at that experience and not oh this is your fault we don't have to

237
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:47,520
have blame for all the bad things that happen in life we can say oh a bad thing has happened

238
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,600
now what's the next step what do i do now what what's what how do i approach this now

239
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:59,440
where is my intention now one of the ways we do that is by taking

240
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:06,640
advantage of the space between what arises and naming it our own

241
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:12,159
one of the best instructions somebody ever gave me was to realize that i could

242
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:17,919
name something that was going on and not make it mine or me

243
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:24,799
anger is present but i'm not angry i'm not anger anger is here if anger is

244
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:30,480
here something needs to be done but it isn't me i don't have to make it mine

245
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:38,320
and have it be oh this this is an angry person i can notice okay the energy is up in my

246
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:45,360
body adrenaline is running i want to retort well wait a minute

247
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:53,200
okay i can't do anything about that adrenaline but knowing that the data adrenaline is rushing gives me a moment

248
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:59,919
in which i can remember my intention toward kindness and i'll say yeah but i don't feel kind

249
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:06,400
okay not feeling kind is here i don't like the way that feels it feels really crummy

250
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:12,000
and that we're not held by it anymore once we see it we can disentangle

251
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,279
ourselves from it we don't have to push it away i have a little problem with the

252
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:22,320
instructions to just let it go because it feels too much like putting it away

253
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:29,600
but if i can say okay it's here and my intention for kindness is here and they are struggling with one another

254
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:37,039
now it's out here there's space i'm not in here fighting it i'm looking at it i'm saying okay okay okay i see both you

255
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:44,559
guys are here when you're in that space of seeing of discerning the difference

256
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:50,480
between what has arisen and who i am

257
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:56,480
then we have more freedom to choose the wise next step

258
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:05,760
sometimes when the adrenaline is running through our bodies the best thing to do is to turn around and wash our hands

259
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:12,000
do something that takes care of that energy without responding without jumping into

260
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,039
what's the wise thing to do here but rather take advantage of the fact that i notice

261
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,000
this is happening

262
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:30,480
noticing the feelings becomes a habit of mind noticing mind state becomes a habit

263
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:36,080
of mind and it begins to show up when you're not looking for it

264
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:42,320
and you start realizing oh this is what oh this is happening now oh i see this

265
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:48,039
and not oh this is my habit and this is always happening

266
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,679
whenever i hear stories about refugees

267
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:10,480
what comes to mind is a hangover from when i was in grade

268
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,760
school it was the time of the hungarian revolution which gives you a clue of how

269
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:21,200
long ago that was and two little girls showed up at my school

270
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,320
they did not speak my language they were extremely exotic my god they had their

271
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:34,159
ears pierced unheard of in 1955 57 58 58 probably in

272
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:41,200
in billings montana unheard of these were the most exotic people i'd ever seen and i was so eager to get to know

273
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:48,399
them and find out about them and they i couldn't speak to them and they were terrified and i remember that look of terror and

274
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:53,600
the two girls they were sisters would huddle together and they'd kind of hide from everybody

275
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:58,559
and they'd look around with suspicion

276
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,320
and every time i hear about refugees of any kind i remember those two

277
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:10,559
i have no idea what happened to them they were only there a brief time but they impacted me and they are a

278
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:17,440
condition of my life they are a condition that this person who's arrived in this

279
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:23,840
place is always affected by refugees any refugee

280
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:30,559
anybody who's put out unexpectedly unknowingly

281
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:37,279
and i can't imagine i don't i don't know what it would be like to

282
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:42,320
feel like that but the experience for me is a very open

283
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:48,720
experience it doesn't leave me with fear and dread it leaves me more with

284
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:54,720
the feeling of compassion of oh my god what can i do about this

285
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,760
and to recognize that in the midst of the uncertainty and despair

286
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:06,960
is to realize there's this unpleasant thing and there is this pleasant thing

287
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:14,240
and both are conditions that the very distress we feel about

288
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:21,760
injustice inequality those feelings of

289
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:27,360
this is not right this should not be this way are also in the same room with the

290
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:33,519
feelings of how can i make this better

291
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:39,039
what can i do about this and the intentions that we have toward

292
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:44,080
kindness and compassion and wholeness show up in that moment if

293
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:51,039
we allow them if we allow ourselves to see them and not be dragged away by whatever it

294
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:58,559
is that that comes up but rather oh this is here and what else is here

295
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:06,640
words matter what we name things matters uncertainty

296
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,279
is just impermanence fully realized

297
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,760
to not be uncertain not be certain about who we are what is true

298
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:25,360
but to every moment see it freshly what's true now what's true now

299
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:30,399
is to look at change and realize that all the conditions that we've been

300
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:36,320
through have changed us and continue to change us the new

301
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,840
conditions change us and to be willing to see

302
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:49,200
i'm changed by this i'm changed by this experience i'm changed by this knowledge i'm changed by

303
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:55,200
recognizing who's shown up in this moment in this body

304
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,559
i'm changed by that and to embrace that change

305
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:06,960
in the sense of just allowing it to be true just seeing it

306
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:15,200
this is how it is it's like this it's like this this

307
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:23,279
what arises in the moments when

308
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:29,519
the unexpected arises what happens i recently took a week

309
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:34,559
when i realized i was really busy trying to make everything happen

310
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:40,240
and said what happened what happens if i don't do all this responsible stuff

311
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:46,720
and for i decided to work a crossword puzzle and for four days that's all i did i

312
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:53,279
worked that crossword not a crossword puzzle i mean a thousand piece puzzle a regular puzzle i'm a crossword puzzle

313
00:33:53,279 --> 00:34:01,519
fanatic so that came up but what i did was work this puzzle just to see what happens if i don't do

314
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:06,720
all these things what happens what arises what do i think

315
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,679
what do i think it this person who is this person here

316
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:21,559
what is useful is to realize that almost anything could happen

317
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:28,560
and to know that we don't have to know the outcome we don't things don't have to be the way

318
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,639
they are how we think they should be

319
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:39,440
we can't go back to a non-existent past

320
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:46,638
we can only access this moment this person who is here in this moment

321
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:52,240
we do so with the accumulated wisdom and humility of all the things that we

322
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:58,320
have thought and been in the past who are not who we are now

323
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:05,520
as amanda's poem said we are both beside and beyond who we

324
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,800
were who we are

325
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:18,880
it's always changing we are the heroes of our everyday

326
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:27,280
we take the next step into the uncertain with the confidence of seeing clearly

327
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:34,560
and the wisdom of our own intentions so those are my thoughts for tonight

328
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:41,040
i hope it's useful do you have any questions observations

329
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,760
i'd be happy to hear

330
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,960
let me read the poem to you again

331
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:10,400
closure to begin again isn't to go backwards

332
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:17,760
but to decide to go our story story is not a circle carved

333
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:24,160
but a spiral shed shaped spinning shifting inward and outward odd

334
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:29,520
infinitum like a lung on the bank of speech

335
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:35,760
breathe with us we disembark both beside and beyond

336
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:42,640
who we were who we are it is a return and a departure

337
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:48,079
we spiral on pushing up and out like a growing thing

338
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:55,040
making its form out of earth in a poem there is no end

339
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:00,240
just a place where the page grows wide and waiting like a lifted

340
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:05,359
hand poised and paused here is our bond

341
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:14,160
unbordered by bone perhaps love is how it feels to breathe the same air

342
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:20,400
all we have is time is now time takes us on

343
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,920
how we are moved says everything about what we are to each other

344
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:31,280
and what are we to each other if not everything

345
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:40,480
may you know the peace of uncertainty

346
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,200
the possibilities of uncertainty

347
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:53,440
may your practice lead you to a place where you can see clearly

348
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,760
so that wisdom is with you always thank you
