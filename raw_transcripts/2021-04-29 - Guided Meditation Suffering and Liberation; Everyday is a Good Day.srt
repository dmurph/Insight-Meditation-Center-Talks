1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:17,920
good morning

2
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:26,240
there's a famous saying by a zen teacher of great note

3
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,679
and the saying is quite simple every day is a good day

4
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:46,160
it's one of those delicious things that a conventional experience

5
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:53,760
contradicts and in a deeper way

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,760
we can experience it as an opportunity

7
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,878
to discover the fruits of practice

8
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,640
conventionally some days are good some days are not so good some days make

9
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:20,720
us happy feel success and some days don't

10
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:29,920
but every day presents an opportunity

11
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:38,320
an opportunity to be present to wake up and see

12
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:45,759
that within the life we're living the process of liberation is possible

13
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:57,040
that the ways the mind and heart can get hooked by thoughts and feelings

14
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:08,319
is not the only way life can happen

15
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,440
so each time we sit

16
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,799
we encourage ourselves

17
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,319
please take up this practice

18
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:34,000
it will nourish you in a way it's maybe deeper than we can even hope

19
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,319
for take up this practice

20
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:46,879
of awareness and see

21
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,720
what's going on in the workings of your being

22
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:05,840
and how to cause yourself less suffering

23
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:15,360
and in quite a deliberate way we let that perspective

24
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:24,000
register in our being yes it's a cognitive notion

25
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:36,480
but it can be a powerful one it can be instructive and then

26
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,959
as we start to engage the city

27
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:47,840
and deliberate and simple giving over to awareness

28
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,480
in as matter-of-fact a manner as we can

29
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,319
what's the state of being right now

30
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:15,840
what is the state of being of mind and heart and body

31
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:28,080
and how can it be nourished in a way that enlivens it

32
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:37,040
that helps it to discover its natural sense of aliveness

33
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:46,960
and that's the attitude with which we notice the body

34
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:57,840
how can we enable and nurture its natural aliveness

35
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:11,039
can you bring that inquiry to attending to how you

36
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:25,840
create the posture of meditation

37
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,440
what is your routine for doing just that

38
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,840
setting a posture that enlivens

39
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,840
i'll offer some suggestions

40
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:15,280
physically noticing is the body upright is it leaning

41
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,720
forward or back

42
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:27,520
is there a holding the clenching anywhere

43
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:36,080
sometimes it's helpful to think of opening the front of the body

44
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,918
the whole way from the groin to the

45
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:53,759
throat like it's you're opening up the lungs the heart

46
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,080
the diaphragm

47
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,840
softening the abdomen

48
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,599
and then at the back lengthening the spine

49
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:23,120
the lower spine sort of gently shifting down

50
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:32,000
lengthening down into where the spine reaches down to how you're

51
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,520
your point of sitting making contact with your seat

52
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:48,560
and then the upper body like lifting out of the hips

53
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:56,479
and lengthening up the whole way up through the back of the

54
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:01,919
chest the back of the rib cage the whole way up through the neck to the

55
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,720
crown of the head

56
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,840
not a forceful engagement

57
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,879
with inviting something setting the stage

58
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:29,599
creating an environment that will allow something to flourish

59
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,640
and that something is awareness

60
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,120
this state of aliveness

61
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,519
and has been in the body since it was

62
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,839
born

63
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:05,120
and then noticing noticing the state of mind

64
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:12,000
and more subtly noticing right now the inclination of mind

65
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,880
is it inclining towards

66
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:26,480
a drowsiness is it inclining towards

67
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:36,959
over activity getting caught in thoughts or feelings

68
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:44,320
it's a very delicate process noticing that mind

69
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:52,240
so powerful so influential the state of mind

70
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:07,200
can it be met with a commitment to this simple deliberate

71
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,120
process of being aware

72
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,079
experiencing in contrast

73
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,519
to an emphasis

74
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:47,839
on creating some preferred outcome

75
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,880
and reminding ourselves

76
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:04,880
that both shamatha are present in this process

77
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,839
simple as it is

78
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,839
steadying attention

79
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:29,839
and a directed attention

80
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:37,680
and then the greeting whatever arises

81
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:47,839
and then as we've been talking about in this couple of weeks engaging the breath

82
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:57,839
to support that process that delicate but powerful process

83
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:11,839
of allowing noticing and experiencing

84
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:21,680
and engaging the breath in a way that discovers how it can

85
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:31,600
reflect the subtleties of mind and heart of thoughts and feelings

86
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:39,360
as we engage the breath

87
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,199
starting quite deliberately with an extended exhale

88
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,519
can that exhale empty out

89
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,639
from the bottom of the lungs sometimes it feels like we're emptying

90
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,760
out from the abdomen

91
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:24,240
and then pause and then allow

92
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:32,839
allow the breath allow everything and anything that's happening in this

93
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:40,639
moment this is the very aliveness of being

94
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:51,199
and it's also the air it keeps the body alive

95
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,240
and the mind alive

96
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,839
and so making the breath deliberate in that way

97
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:11,360
extend the exhale and explore how much can you extend the exhale

98
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:18,639
without the inhale being hurried

99
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,880
and gasping

100
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:35,920
it's like we're doing a yoga stretch with the breath stretching on the exhale

101
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:45,120
opening up space in the heart the diaphragm the lungs

102
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:59,839
to receive the inhale

103
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:12,959
rediscovering a new directed attention

104
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:18,800
with the exhale and receptive attention

105
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:27,839
receiving with the inhale

106
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:33,868
[Music]

107
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:55,839
it teaches the interplay of shamatha and vipassana

108
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,320
and then chewing into the breath in that way

109
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:27,040
letting it instruct you and

110
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,240
is it helpful to maintain that deliberateness for a while

111
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:42,880
or is now would it be most helpful to resume

112
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:51,600
the natural rhythm of breath in the body

113
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,440
can you let your body decide

114
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:07,360
can you let the way you're tuning in to the process of aliveness and awareness

115
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:19,839
decide how to engage the breath

116
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:51,440
okay then noticing become more subtle

117
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,840
not just a mental activity

118
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,360
but a body and breath and mind

119
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,840
activity

120
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,440
and noticing and acknowledging

121
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,840
how is mind now

122
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,760
are the thoughts flooding in

123
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:55,200
are they becoming spacious and quieter

124
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,080
however it is so beard

125
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:35,840
attending and experiencing as fully as possible however it is

126
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,799
and letting the effort of engagement

127
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:55,919
be guided by what enlivens attention

128
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:17,840
what supports awakeness

129
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:05,840
contending to the breath have a fullness of attention

130
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:24,399
relinquishing any tendency to keep the narrative going

131
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:31,760
very deliberately pausing and bringing full attention to

132
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,080
breath

133
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:47,840
full attention to exhale

134
00:24:49,679 --> 00:25:01,840
nothing in this great flow of existence needs to be held held onto

135
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,720
and with the inhale

136
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,960
nothing in this boundless sea of existence

137
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:29,840
needs to be resisted

138
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:51,440
full attention to exhale releasing letting go

139
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:57,840
of suffering

140
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:04,559
letting go of distress sadness

141
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:11,840
fears and anxieties

142
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,840
like a great act of compassion

143
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:39,840
a deep caring and nurturing of being

144
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:37,039
and with the inhale allowing receiving

145
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:47,120
the nourishing enlivening

146
00:27:47,279 --> 00:28:03,840
experience of now

147
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,840
do

148
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,278
and as i ring the bell

149
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,760
receiving the sound of the bow

150
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:48,158
i'll bring it three times and then letting the sound of the bell

151
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:55,200
open to all sides

152
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,200
the same way our awareness

153
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:09,840
opens to everything

154
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:18,559
it teaches us in an inconceivable way

155
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:37,840
how this individual consciousness is part of whole being

156
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:46,160
[Music]

157
00:30:52,830 --> 00:31:01,659
[Music] [Applause]

158
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:11,440
[Music] [Applause]

159
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:16,429
[Music]

160
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:26,809
[Music]

161
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:07,679
meditation can be such an extraordinary teacher

162
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:18,960
of the very workings of our being [Music] which can so often create

163
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:26,840
challenges problems and difficulties those very same workings when held in

164
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:42,640
awareness become a profound wise and compassionate gift

165
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:51,039
to my mind when i reflect on that teaching every day is a good day

166
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,840
the uh the teacher's name was jungmen

167
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:05,679
and it's intriguing that you know young men was considered a

168
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:12,640
a wonderfully insightful and skillful teacher

169
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,480
and how the phrase that he's most remembered for

170
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:29,440
is so so simple in in one way we could say so trite

171
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:38,000
you know about [Music] at the very same time

172
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,480
so utterly profound yeah

173
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:57,840
if you take the word good you know what is it to live

174
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:07,840
a good life about it

175
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:20,179
what is it to not harm but to do good

176
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:25,839
[Music] and our meditation is offering us a way

177
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:35,839
to explore that alchemy

178
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:45,280
in a kind of elemental way you know even within our own body how do we

179
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,839
nourish it

180
00:34:51,119 --> 00:35:02,800
how do we nourish the vitality of being

181
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:09,520
day by day breath by breath experienced by

182
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:17,838
experience interaction by interaction

183
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:27,040
how do we soften the ways in which we suffer

184
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:35,680
the ways in which we closed on consider it more helpful to distract

185
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,240
ourselves

186
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,520
how do we nurture the confidence

187
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:54,960
the trust in who we are and how we are to take on

188
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:02,560
the challenges of our day of every week

189
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,200
of our life

190
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,839
how do we enliven our relationships

191
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:27,838
so often an interplay with others

192
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:34,240
where we want to discharge our negative emotions

193
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:45,279
i'll say this or i'll do this because something in me is hurting

194
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:57,760
how do we enliven relationships how do we bring the best out of others

195
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,400
of the situations in our life

196
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:09,839
in the situations of our world

197
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:23,838
all this flowering form the roots of awareness

198
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:37,839
and young men simply saying every day is a good day

199
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:45,200
[Music] can the challenge of life

200
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:51,838
be such that can it be related to in a way

201
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,560
that something is nurtured

202
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:05,838
and supported to blossom

203
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:16,960
in a way it's a an inquiry

204
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:22,400
into the nature of panya [Music]

205
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,960
what is the wisdom of our practice

206
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:36,160
that can help us discover the response to those

207
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:47,119
existential questions

208
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:53,760
in part of its cognitive no part of it's pretty straightforward

209
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:06,320
if you just act out your pain in an aggressive way

210
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:15,838
you don't flourish and the recipient of your aggression doesn't flourish

211
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:28,000
and then more subtly how do we see the self being

212
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:36,400
the self how do we see how it

213
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:48,160
limits through deep-seated emotions negative emotions how it limits

214
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:53,520
its own being how do we nurture

215
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:58,640
the positive deep-seated emotions

216
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:11,838
for our own benefit and for the benefit of everyone

217
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:24,240
and then how in a way below thought in a way

218
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:39,839
beyond thought how do we sense the interconnectedness of being

219
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:52,319
sometimes so simple the way we say thank you

220
00:40:52,319 --> 00:41:07,839
the way we hold the door open for the stranger who's behind us as they also leave them

221
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:25,680
in in japanese buddhism the the sacred act of kindness

222
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:35,839
is revered [Music] it's like a special treasure

223
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:45,760
the fact that the person won't even notice that you were the person who indeed

224
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:52,319
acted out the kindness or generosity delightful

225
00:41:53,760 --> 00:42:00,319
you're freed from the burden of oh and then will they

226
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:06,240
be grateful to me notice how wonderful i am you're free from that burden because

227
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,000
it's a secret you'll never know

228
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:19,760
and the ways in which our own life has been supported and nourished

229
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:31,040
in ways that we'll never know

230
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:36,640
and when we when we allow ourselves to engage that

231
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:45,838
that our life has been supported by many people we do know

232
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:51,359
and maybe many that we don't

233
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:59,839
it offers us a kind of reassurance

234
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,640
in this ferocious world

235
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:13,680
but in the midst of all the things that are going on

236
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:27,838
there is the steady beat of kindness and generosity

237
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:34,000
and the reassurance and the comfort

238
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:41,839
and the encouragement it offers

239
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:48,640
this sends the blossoming

240
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:55,838
of awareness

241
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:09,838
as we receive our natural tendency is to give

242
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:17,680
the enactment of our connectedness

243
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:28,160
we're all in this together right down to the microbes

244
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:37,010
and the oceans and the skies of being

245
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:46,720
[Music] so young man says every day is a good

246
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:55,680

247
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,720
oh tell me something profound sophisticated

248
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:07,359
[Music] but something deep in our being

249
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:16,880
delights in hearing that every day is a good day

250
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:22,160
