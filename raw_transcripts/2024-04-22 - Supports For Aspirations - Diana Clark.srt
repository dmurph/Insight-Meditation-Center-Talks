1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:07,080
good morning thank you Martha I'm as Martha said I'm Diana

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:14,040
Clark and for those of you who don't know me I uh teach her on Monday nights and occasionally substitute for

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:20,199
Gil here and there so this morning I want to talk a

4
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:25,439
little bit about what is it that motivates us to

5
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,199
practice what is it that motivates us to come here on a Sunday morning or to have

6
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,320
this uh daily meditation practice or listen to Dharma Talks on YouTube or

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,559
Audio Dharma or read Dorma books or you know whatever it might

8
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:49,559
be like what what is it that are aspirations that are related to

9
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:59,039
practice and it can be helpful to reflect on this on occasion taking some time to

10
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:05,439
think about well what is it that um what is our motivation or what is our

11
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:14,000
aspiration maybe as I'm speaking you can ask yourself this question what is maybe like the north

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,920
star that is guiding you or supporting you in

13
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,439
practice and there's a way in which when we align with our aspirations there's a

14
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:33,200
sense of maybe some openness or some ease or a sense of

15
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,360
well-being in contrast when we have like this goal that we got to get that that's

16
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,880
kind of associated more with a feeling of tightness or uh maybe um some

17
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,000
clinging or leaning forward maybe an aspiration is something

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
that's more of an uplift and a a sense of a I don't know some ease and

19
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,960
inspiration because there there is great power available when we are aligned with

20
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,599
our aspirations when the heart is connected with that which is important

21
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:16,120
to us when the heart is connected

22
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,280
to something bigger than just what we're doing at that

23
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:29,280
moment not that what we're doing at that moment isn't important but there can be a way in which um just I like this word

24
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,519
aligning or connecting because so often right just

25
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:40,159
the busyness of our lives really encourages us to be

26
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:48,200
disconnected from what's important to us and there's a way in which Our Lives can feel like one very long to-do

27
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:55,800
list every day this to-do list and sometimes we kind of maybe like

28
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,840
lose sight or that there's like something bigger that's possible

29
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:09,840
and maybe part of the gifts of having a meditation practice or even coming here

30
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,879
and sitting silently before a Dharma talk is a way in which there can maybe

31
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:22,560
Bubble Up what's important for us or maybe there can be some more space for the mind and the heart to touch

32
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:29,400
into what's important for us and it might be that our aspiration is for some

33
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:36,920
deep well-being and happiness peace

34
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:43,080
love freedom or maybe an aspiration is about

35
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,840
making this world a better place and having some service supporting others so

36
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,840
that they can bring their best selves forward and help make this world a

37
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:01,599
better place or maybe there's an aspiration about beauty wanting to bring things in

38
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:08,360
Beauty into the world or to share beauty or to express Beauty in some kind of

39
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:14,439
way all of us might have our own aspiration its own particular flavor

40
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:20,919
or expression but it can be helpful to

41
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:30,160
sometimes bring that to mind and connect with it and then there is this obvious this

42
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,440
question or maybe for me it's obvious because like well why am I not like

43
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,680
consistently going in that direction why am I finding myself distracted and doing

44
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:49,880
other things and partly because to consistently Orient towards our

45
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:55,479
aspirations is not easy if it were easy you would have all

46
00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:02,039
be doing that and you'd be completely awakened or have Peace and Freedom Beauty all that kind of stuff

47
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:09,280
already so what is it that makes it difficult and can we address that can we

48
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:16,880
um work with that so that we can consistently move towards what's most important to

49
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:24,600
us one thing is that uh we've all kind of like created a society that likes and

50
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,960
promotes instant gratification

51
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:37,440
right we all like to you know have things right away how many inventions are about to make things

52
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,280
faster and right even like all these uh gizmos We Carry in our pockets that are

53
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,400
all about like making things even faster and better and you know you can learn

54
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,400
the answer to that quickly instapot you can instantly have

55
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:01,400
dinner ready I don't know something like this right so this idea that we kind of like

56
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:07,639
expect things to happen quickly or maybe there's this way we

57
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:13,720
aren't always connecting with our aspirations because we tend to

58
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:19,520
forget and again it's because this uh our community or Society is really

59
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:27,080
promotes this sense of distraction you know trying to like entertain ourselves or to always feel

60
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:33,639
better or you know not feel any discomfort so there we have to distract

61
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:42,479
ourselves because there's a lot of discomfort in life emotional discomfort physical

62
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:48,280
discomfort so sometimes we just forget because we have these Todo L this and

63
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,880
we're have a pattern of distracting

64
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:04,199
ourselves and maybe there's this way that just very simp our kind of like Society or the networks

65
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:11,360
of individuals that we interact with really aren't uh oriented

66
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:21,039
towards connecting with what's important to us instead we have these institutions or

67
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:27,919
um you know like the or industries that are designed to try to convince us to do

68
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:35,560
what they want us to do buy this do that believe this

69
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:41,639
right it's just you know what's happened where we find ourselves in

70
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:49,800
society we can be pushed around by these other forces it's easy enough to do and

71
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,240
certainly I have found myself going down the rabbit hole of uh YouTube videos and

72
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:01,440
watching the most bizarre things that I have no interest in it's quite

73
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:08,520
something it's these algorithms I guess right that are pretty

74
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,400
powerful so I'd like to talk a little bit about applying oneself to practice

75
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:22,479
applying oneself to a practice that can enable us to stay connected with what's important to

76
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:28,159
us and I'd like to use a story that we find in the sutas uh as a support for

77
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:35,200
this and this story is about Prince

78
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:41,760
bod uh some of you will know that this name this word bod means Awakening so

79
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:48,040
Prince Awakening and it's kind of a interesting thing that he's named

80
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:55,200
this so he Prince bod wanted to become awakened I don't blame him he must have

81
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,440
more Peace and Freedom but he didn't want to really work work at

82
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,880
it right I I mean who can blame him we all want things to be easier and have

83
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,480
the path of least resistance and instant gratification of course we do and for me

84
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:19,160
I find a little bit of comfort that thousands of years ago they were the same they wanted things to be as easy as

85
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:25,519
possible too so he wanted to become awakened but

86
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:33,600
he didn't want to work too hard about it at it and he had heard that it was going to be difficult and

87
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:41,320
painful so he wanted a shortcut so shortcuts that uh

88
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:46,880
specifically that he thought was okay if he donates a certain property to the

89
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,600
Buddha and his monastics where they could practice then this would bring him

90
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:58,240
something that would really support his Awakening so just this idea okay I'll um

91
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,600
give something to the monastics to the

92
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:09,399
SAA and he also had the idea that okay if he could have the Buddha do something

93
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:14,760
in particular for him something auspicious then maybe that's what it

94
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:21,519
would take is to have this awakened person do I don't know like some magic thing

95
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:28,880
and then Prince B could become awakened so Prince bod rather than

96
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,440
thinking that he himself had a role in his happiness that he himself had this

97
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:41,959
was responsible for connecting with what's important and going achieving or

98
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:47,959
having experiencing what was his deepest aspiration I'm assuming getting awakened

99
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:53,839
was his deepest aspiration maybe not but rather than thinking that he had

100
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,880
a role in his happiness he somehow was kind of like giving that over to the

101
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:06,279
Buddha or just thinking if he did a particular gesture donating property being a prince

102
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:09,560
this wasn't a hardship for

103
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:18,320
him so Prince B had this the pink Lotus long

104
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:24,519
house built I love this name Pink Lotus long house built with the intention to

105
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:31,519
uh donate it to the Buddha and his monastics as a place where they a

106
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:39,000
practice and he wanted to invite the Buddha to come

107
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:47,320
to have a meal and to come to the pink Lotus L house this is very common for uh

108
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:55,120
individuals to invite the Buddha and his monastics to a meal this was a very common way to support the SAA and to

109
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,200
show respect and care and to hear some teachings was common that after the meal

110
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:08,040
there would be some teachings so Prince bod invited the

111
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:16,800
Buddha and he had this delicious food prepared and they uh then he also asked

112
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,519
Prince buy asked in this pink Lotus long house for there to be a white cloth that

113
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:29,600
gets uh spread along the entire as the name suggests long house it's a like this long single room and then white

114
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,920
cloth to go down the stairs and onto the ground I'm thinking of it as like the

115
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:41,040
red carpet treatment right so he can walk on this when he comes

116
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:48,839
in so the Buddha goes and his monastics um they go

117
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:54,279
to Prince bod's house or Palace where he lives Prince bod is outside waiting for

118
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:59,920
them and he as greets he greets them pays homage to them

119
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,920
and invites them all to go to nearby to this pink Lotus L

120
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:14,560
house they all go there and they um and the Buddha stops right

121
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:20,600
before this white cloth before going up the steps to the pink Lotus long

122
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:26,560
house and Prince B had this idea if I can get the Buddha to step on this cloth

123
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:33,480
it'll be auspicious and that will help me so Prince Bodi sees the Buddha stopping

124
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:39,399
and he says Venable sir please step on the white

125
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:45,680
cloth please step on the white cloth so that it may be for my welfare and happiness for a long

126
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:53,399
time and the Buddha just stands there doesn't say anything doesn't move

127
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,360
he just stands there

128
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:07,360
so the Buddha had this he has this advice regarding shortcuts in general so

129
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,519
maybe he recognized what was happening here and I appreciate very much this

130
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:18,120
advice about shortcuts gets uh um captured in this short little simile

131
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:23,199
that's uh in a verse and this and the simile goes like

132
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:29,360
this this is the Buddha speaking he's not saying this to Prince

133
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:37,920
this is me doing an aside so the Buddha says as the Wagoner who left the highway

134
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:46,519
a road with an even surface and entered Upon A rugged path one Broods mournfully

135
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:51,720
with a broken axle so this idea that there's going on

136
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:58,440
a road with an even surface this is something of course there's no pavement thousands of years ago an even surface

137
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:04,639
mean that is been trampled upon a lot a lot of people have gone down this

138
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:11,320
road and so maybe there's this way that uh to like leave that behind and to go

139
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:16,440
Upon A rugged path like maybe to go where other people don't go and maybe in

140
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,480
my mind it's kind of like bushwhacking your way through this uh new territory

141
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:28,639
or something but then if you are taking your wagon Chariot something like this

142
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:35,240
then the EXO wheel breaks and for me I have certainly had

143
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:41,319
this right I'm on the traveling and then um my little app says oh there's traffic

144
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:46,399
up ahead like oh okay I'll take this exit and you it ends up right just

145
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:53,160
taking longer or I get lost or you know something like this right we often do this like literally go off the highway

146
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:59,839
and try to take a shortcut so getting back to the story

147
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:06,240
with uh Prince bodh so Prince bodh sees that the Buddha is just standing

148
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:14,279
there and he repeats himself venerable sir please step on the white cloth so

149
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:21,519
that it may be for my welfare and happiness for a long time the Buddha continues to just stand

150
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:28,639
there doesn't say anything he just stands there I can imagine that Prince bod is getting a little bit agitated he

151
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:34,440
says it a third time venerable sir please step on the white

152
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:39,800
cloth so that it may be for my welfare and happiness for a long

153
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:48,440
time and Buddha stands there and he looks over at

154
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:54,000
Ananda Ananda some of you may know is the Buddha's attendant and somebody who

155
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:02,759
really knew the Buddha well and had a lot of wisdom and I appreciate this so much Anda gets it he understands he

156
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:09,280
understands and Ananda says to Prince bod fold up the cloth Prince B the

157
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:15,798
Buddha will not step on the white cloth he has compassion for future

158
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:22,918
Generations so what's not being said here is that Ananda knew

159
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:29,440
recognized that if uh some If Prince bod if I'm sorry if the Buddha it were to

160
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:36,160
step on the white cloth then Prince bod would say oh I you know so auspicious

161
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,840
for me I'm going to become awaken now because the Buddha did this and the prince right he has a platform on which

162
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:48,039
he would be talking about telling everybody all you have to do is step on the white cloth or maybe the opposite

163
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:54,080
would happen maybe the Buddha did step on the white cloth and then a bunch of Calamity would happen to the prince bad

164
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:01,480
things would happen and then the prince would be saying oh that Buddha person don't believe them he he's kind he's not

165
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:08,200
helpful or maybe Prince bod would be talking about the importance of stepping on a wet cloth and that would encourage

166
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:14,960
people to like be looking for other auspicious actions you know something that they could do instead of taking

167
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,760
responsibility for their own welfare and

168
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:26,919
happiness so the Buddha didn't want people to always be looking for external

169
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:33,080
conditions some or to make somebody else do something in order for them to be

170
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:39,000
aligned with their aspirations in order for them to reach their

171
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:48,840
aspirations I think all of us know this but maybe there's a sometimes a piece of us that doesn't quite that want was

172
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:54,280
hoping that maybe it's not so true but this path of practice is one that we all

173
00:18:54,280 --> 00:19:00,720
have to walk ourselves we have to find our own way

174
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:07,280
the Buddha points the way shows the way but we're the ones that actually have to do

175
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:16,360
it have to learn by direct experience have to overcome difficulties

176
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:25,880
ourselves so getting back to the story after the meal that the prince B

177
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:32,240
offered to the Buddha and his monastics um after he had folded up the cloth and

178
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,480
offered the meal and stuff then Prince bodh turns to the Buddha and says

179
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:45,480
pleasure is only gained through pain pleasure is only gained through

180
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:52,400
pain and the Buddha is assuming and interpreting that pleasure is like you know more ease more peace more freedom

181
00:19:52,400 --> 00:20:00,320
maybe even Awakening and Prince bod has this idea okay you have to have a lot of pain

182
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:10,080
in order to achieve that and in some ways right the modern day equivalent of this is Nike no pain no gain right so

183
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,200
like thousands of years ago right they're talking about the same thing I love

184
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,880
it so this of course helps make sense you know why the the prince is motivated

185
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:26,960
to have the Buddha do something for him to rather than having to do it himself he doesn't want to feel pain we don't

186
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:35,960
want to feel pain none of us want to feel pain pain so maybe we can't blame him that he

187
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:41,919
was asking The Bu to step on a cloth and I have my own version of this

188
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:47,679
story this was uh early in my practice um after sitting a long

189
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:55,039
retreat that was hard it was difficult you know sometimes Retreats are fantastic and sometimes they're not

190
00:20:55,039 --> 00:21:00,320
that's how it is and we don't get to control you know exactly how things unfold during a

191
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:09,320
retreat and this was a long retreat where I had a lot of difficulty a lot of tears and confusion and physical

192
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:16,120
pain all these types of things and I had figured like okay I paid my dues this is

193
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:21,600
enough I'm ready to just be awakened and I remember uh going to one

194
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,919
of the teachers and saying okay can you like zap me or give me the secret

195
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:33,960
teachings or you know something CU I feel like you know I've done enough now can't can't I just I I give this teacher

196
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:40,600
a lot of credit with a lot of warmth said it doesn't work that way [Laughter]

197
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:46,480
Diana but you know I just felt like okay you maybe I deserved it after all this

198
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,960
hard work of this Retreat or whatever it was I don't know what my thinking was but maybe just a sincere wish like

199
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:57,960
anything but this please so maybe there's a part of us that kind of is hoping that there's a

200
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,720
shortcut that somebody else can do something for

201
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:11,039
us so the prince has said what pleasure is only gained through pain and in

202
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:17,440
response the Buddha says he gives a little bit of his own

203
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:23,799
story as a way to as a teaching to the Buddha to the prince bodh he gives a little bit of his own story and the

204
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:28,840
Buddha says before my Awakening so while

205
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:36,000
he was still striving trying to get awakened the Buddha says when I was still una awakened but intent on

206
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,559
awakening I also thought that pleasure is only gained through

207
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:47,159
pain so some of you might know this story of the the Buddha's Awakening that

208
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:53,679
he lived in this had this opulent lifestyle lived in a palace he went uh

209
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:59,200
then he leaves the palace to strive towards Awakening he has some meets with some medit

210
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:07,120
teachers he learns um some exalted meditative techniques or reaches High

211
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:12,760
meditation States and realizes oh these meditation states are nice but they're

212
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:20,760
not Awakening so then he goes to the opposite extreme and practices

213
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:30,440
austerities thinking that pain must be the way to freedom and pleasure and uh he describes some of it

214
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:37,559
this way some of this austerity this way so this is the Buddha speaking describing his path of practice before

215
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:45,400
he was awakened seeking the state of supreme peace I set out to discover what is

216
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:52,720
skillful traveling I came to sanama and urua and there I saw a delightful Grove

217
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:59,799
a lovely piece of ground with a clear flowing river Pleasant smooth Banks and

218
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:05,159
nearby was a village for Ms so a comfortable place and he would be

219
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:11,520
supported I sat down and thought this would be a good place for

220
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:17,760
practicing and then he thought why don't I with teeth clenched

221
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:24,240
and tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth squeeze squash and Crush mind

222
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:32,960
with mind so this idea he's going to strive as hard as he can Crush mind with

223
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:41,240
mind like a strong person grabs a weaker person by the head and throat and squeezes squashes or crushed them that's

224
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:48,720
what I did until sweat poured from my armpits little graphic detail like just

225
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:54,720
to show like the amount of exertion here and the Buddha says my energy was

226
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:04,000
roused up and unflagging and my mindfulness was established and Lucid but my body was Disturbed and not

227
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,279
tranquil because I pushed too hard with that painful

228
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:16,200
striving so then still in this mode he tries breathing L meditation to hold his

229
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,960
breath he tries not eating so he tries all these austerities with this you know

230
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:27,159
real intensity and they don't lead to

231
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:33,120
Awakening and then so he's still talking to Prince

232
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:38,919
bod try to give this story about how all these different things all these different painful activities that he

233
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:47,240
tried didn't work and he kind of like sums it up by saying whatever spiritual adepts have

234
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:53,240
experienced these painful sharp severe acute feelings due to

235
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:58,480
overexertion no one has done more than me so just saying that like he's done

236
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,158
the the most painful

237
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:10,480
things and then he describes how he went to go sit underneath the booty

238
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:22,279
tree so we see that making no effort while he was in the palace or with

239
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:29,080
Prince bod didn't lead to Awakening or making tons of effort while he striving

240
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:33,960
and doing painful exertion doesn't lead to

241
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:42,600
Awakening so then he describes to the Buddha describes to Prince bod

242
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:48,000
how he did become awakened I won't go into the details about that

243
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,760
now and so Prince bod responds with well how long does it

244
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:02,520
take if you were my teacher how long would it take like I don't blame him right he

245
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:07,919
wants to know is this something that I have to do for a really long time or can

246
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:13,120
there be a shortcut because now that you've figured it out Mr Buddha then

247
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:18,000
maybe you can give me some hints and it'll be faster and

248
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:25,640
easier and then a Buddha replies with a question to The Prince and he asks the

249
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:33,000
prince are you skilled in the art of wielding a hooked go while riding an

250
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,919
elephant I don't know exactly what that is but uh a hooked go while riding an

251
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:45,919
elephant apparently this was something that uh required a skill to

252
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,600
do and the prince Bo says yes I

253
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:58,919
am and then the Buddha asks him suppose you were to train a person

254
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:04,039
and wielding a hooked hooked go while riding an

255
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:09,240
elephant could that if that person did not have any confidence could they

256
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:14,919
achieve what they could achieve if they had confidence

257
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:20,200
no if that person had no Vitality could they achieve what they could achieve if

258
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:27,919
they did have Vitality no if that person were dishonest and had

259
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:34,159
no no Integrity could they achieve what they could achieve if they were honest and had

260
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:40,440
Integrity no if that person had no energy could

261
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:46,919
they achieve what could be achieved if they did have energy

262
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:55,600
no if that person didn't have any wisdom could they achieve what could be achieved if they didn't have wisdom

263
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:03,440
no so then the Buddha says there's these five factors of

264
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:09,640
endeavoring confidence Vitality

265
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:16,080
Integrity energy and wisdom and with these five factors of

266
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,360
endeavoring the one can achieve what they want to

267
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:29,080
achieve and then the Buddha answers the prince bod's question about how long will it

268
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:35,480
take the Buddha says if you have these five factors of endeavoring someone could become

269
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:40,880
awakened in 7 years let alone 7 years 6

270
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:47,320
years let alone 6 years 5 years four years 3

271
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:53,200
years 2 years one year let alone one year 7

272
00:29:53,200 --> 00:30:01,320
months 6 months five months you know how this is going to go right s weeks six

273
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:06,760
weeks five weeks 7 Days 6 days 5 days

274
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:13,360
let alone two days a person with these five factors of endeavoring can hear the

275
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:22,559
instructions in the morning and become awakened that evening it's beautiful right

276
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,880
inspiring and so I'll just unpack a little bit these five factors of endeavoring

277
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:36,559
first of all this I'll unpack this word of endeavoring maybe we'll say applying on

278
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:42,880
or working towards or seeking or pursuing with diligence or something

279
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,120
like

280
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:56,320
this and also I'll say that these five factors of endeavoring take into account all aspects of Our

281
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:02,960
Lives all aspects of who we are it's not just our um expertise with

282
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,080
meditation or it's not how much we know of the suas or the teachings or

283
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:13,399
something like that this confidence is the first one

284
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:18,919
this confidence that this is something that's worth

285
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:26,320
doing and confidence that it is possible that it is possible to have

286
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:34,840
greater peace and ease and that it's conf that you have some confidence that you can do that that you

287
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:40,639
can move in that direction and sometimes we think about

288
00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:48,360
like okay this aspiration what would it look like when we achieve it and we think like I can't achieve

289
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:55,440
that that's like that's it's an aspiration it's so far in the future but sometimes what we forget is

290
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:01,240
that the version of ourselves that's going to take like the last step

291
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:07,000
is not the same version that we are today when we move a little bit in that

292
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,559
direction we're a little bit changed then we take the next step we're a little bit changed take the next step

293
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:21,080
we're a little bit changed so sometimes we like to project way into the future and say I can do

294
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:28,440
that but it's not the same you that's going to do that it's the you that has

295
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:34,840
made all the steps in that direction so you can have some confidence that you can do that all you need is the

296
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:40,760
confidence to take the next step just that's it just the next

297
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:48,840
step then so confidence that it's worthwhile that it's possible that

298
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:54,360
humans is possible for humans and that you can do it but you can do it all you

299
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:02,480
need is the next step that's all you need and then there's this next one about

300
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:10,320
this Vitality this Vitality all that's needed is sometimes

301
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:16,799
you might feel like oh my gosh I can't achieve that that's like so big it's going to take so much energy I don't

302
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:22,120
have that much energy all that's being pointed to is

303
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:27,159
maybe just the amount of Vitality that requires for example to listen to a

304
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:35,440
dormor that's all cuz this is about the heart and the

305
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:43,480
mind and sometimes when we listen to Dharma talks podcasts YouTube videos read a Dharma book there's a way in

306
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:49,440
which there can be a inspiration or there can be some

307
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,880
openness or some uplift that's all that's needed we don't

308
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:01,760
need tons of energy because the truth is that a lot of people come to Dharma practice because

309
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:08,079
they are ill or they have uh not they are have some sense of Despair and they

310
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:15,040
just don't have energy this practice is for you also it's not saying you have to have

311
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:20,638
perfect health it's not saying you have to have tons of energy just enough to

312
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:26,760
like Engage The mind or allow the heart to have some uplift

313
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:36,638
and then the sense of being having some integrity and

314
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:44,440
honesty the way this gets described in the sutas that honesty is about

315
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:50,599
sharing acknowledging what's really going on with

316
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:55,760
you if you have a teacher to really share what's going

317
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:02,400
on sometimes we want the teacher to like us or we want the teacher to think that we're good students

318
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,880
or it's teacher or whomever it is so maybe we're like skipping over those

319
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:13,680
parts of ourselves to where we're not doing so great that's okay but you're

320
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:19,400
short changing yourself some of this kind like honesty and integrity is to show up and to be

321
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:27,119
able to say this is where I'm struggling this is where I feel like I'm making some progress and I'm uh have

322
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:33,160
some Clarity but here's where I'm struggling to be able to share

323
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:40,040
both the struggles and the difficult the difficulties and the winds so this idea

324
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:45,880
of being authentic about how you're doing with your

325
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:51,839
practice and this idea of energy is just like related to the right effort in the

326
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:58,280
eight-fold path it's just amount of energy to recognize oh this is is

327
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:04,000
helpful this is not helpful this supports this movement

328
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,200
towards my aspiration this does not support this movement towards

329
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:15,319
aspiration that's the type of energy that's uh

330
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,160
required and then the last one is about

331
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:26,160
wisdom part of the wisdom is recognizing that things

332
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:33,240
change of course they change but to really see that in a really deep way

333
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:39,920
there aren't exceptions to this everything changes and just to have this type of

334
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:48,079
wisdom allows that things developments to happen things to shift so we don't have to try to cling

335
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:53,800
on to them or try to in insist that they be different instead they're going to change on their

336
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:59,520
own on a time frame that's appropriate for them

337
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:06,960
so these five factors of endeavoring that can support us in

338
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:12,200
reaching our aspirations being aligned with connecting with and moving towards

339
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:18,720
our aspirations confidence

340
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:24,520
Vitality Integrity energy and

341
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:32,000
wisdom we all have these if you're here you have them and if in the future

342
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:40,000
whomever is listening to this podcast you have them also if you have enough energy to listen to

343
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:47,680
this confidence Vitality Integrity energy and wisdom is these five factors

344
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:52,720
to support this movement towards meeting our

345
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:59,240
aspirations and I'd like to think that Prince bod took this uh under I mean

346
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:06,480
undertook this and became awakened did the sutas don't say whether he became awakened so maybe not maybe

347
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:14,079
being a prince he thought like oh no I'll go try some other spiritual teacher I don't know but may you all reach your

348
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:18,280
aspirations thank you
