1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:08,880
so hello everyone and on this last day of

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:16,439
2021 and

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:24,560
in a maybe in an interesting way the future is silent

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:31,679
at this point and we're going into the silence

5
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,280
so in in the teachings of the buddha there's a

6
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,360
concept called noble silence and it's uh

7
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,520
in the modern world in our retreats we call noble silence the practice of

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,120
being silent during the tweet not being not having conversations during the retreat but in the

9
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:01,520
in the buddhist teaching noble silence is the kind of the rich golden silence

10
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,879
that can occur in deep meditation

11
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:13,360
and i think this warm silence the silence of a warm spring

12
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:20,719
wind that brings about the flowering of the cherry blossoms

13
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:28,000
in china and japan sometimes it's called the golden wind

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,920
so maybe today the interesting way of meditating

15
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,000
would be to discover what it's like to experience

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
yourself in meditation in silence what's available

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,240
when the mind is silent how do you experience breathing

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,200
if you're silent in your awareness of it

19
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,759
if there's a continuity of awareness in the silence

20
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:13,200
what happens if you're aware of your body silently without any thoughts

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,520
and there might be difficult to do but there might be gaps

22
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,640
in your thinking pauses in your thoughts the end of the out breath there might be

23
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,160
a time for your thoughts to go quiet or it could be that the thoughts become

24
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,519
quiet enough and calm enough that you're aware of the silence around them

25
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:42,640
it's possible to have enough silence to if silence like in the

26
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:49,200
worldly silence can be so silent the place you're at that you still can hear someone speak

27
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,640
but you hear them in this vast field of silence so the same thing we're thinking in our

28
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:01,040
own mind to be aware of that silently your thinking silently

29
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:07,440
so what happens to you what unfolds for you if you stay close to the silence of the

30
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:14,800
mind if you if you stay close to the silence of awareness itself

31
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,840
independent free of thoughts and thinking

32
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:29,920
and what's that what happens what's if that's the emphasis if that's the priority you give to this meditation

33
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,599
then in those moments when the mind is silent really notice what's happening

34
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,640
and there's probably more moments of silence available to you than you

35
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,519
avail yourself of there's probably more points of silence

36
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,879
and it might be easier to tap into silence than you realize

37
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,400
and uh so you might want to um

38
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,720
you know tap into it or settle open to it allow for it

39
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:12,760
however brief it might be and see what happens in the silence of the mind

40
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,239
okay

41
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,360
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

42
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,400
there's an art to receiving the world

43
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:14,158
receiving the future that comes into the present with the silent mind

44
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:21,360
the kind of silence that doesn't have expectations or demands assumptions

45
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:28,320
judgments about what comes from the future into the present

46
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:37,440
this is particularly nice when it's a friend who's or coming stranger who comes

47
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:45,039
and to be able to receive anyone with a healthy silence of the mind

48
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:50,159
is a gift we give them so that we're there to receive them

49
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:55,600
closer to how they are than to how we

50
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:01,520
think things should be here with the projections of our assumptions

51
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,799
and judgments ideas and history and

52
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:12,960
expectations to be able to receive the people who

53
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:18,720
come into our lives with an initial silence

54
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:24,880
maybe they don't know we're being silent but inside we're there to

55
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,600
receive what is coming as it is

56
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:38,080
before the noise before the thoughts before the judgments and assumptions and

57
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:45,120
expectations it's a generous thing to do

58
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,000
and perhaps that can be the case for this new year as well

59
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:58,880
who knows what the new year will bring but perhaps we can meet it first and

60
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:05,278
foremost with the silence of the mind

61
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:14,559
that allows give space for us to be wise informed clear about what

62
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:21,440
is happening may whatever benefit that comes from our

63
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:27,200
meditative capacity ability

64
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,158
be used for the welfare and happiness of others

65
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:38,320
may we be clear and fresh and wise

66
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:46,000
in how we meet others and support others may we be free from our judgments and

67
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:53,399
our bias and our projections our assumptions expectations

68
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,639
may we not burden people with our demands

69
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:08,480
but may we be upright and strong confident in ourselves

70
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,320
confident take care of ourselves

71
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:23,840
and in the silence of our mind learn to be loving and kind and wise

72
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,279
of how we do respond may it be

73
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:35,200
that our practice supports all beings to be happy

74
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:42,720
all beings to be safe all beings

75
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:50,440
to be peaceful and all beings to be free

76
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:58,600
[Music] uh

77
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,200
[Music]

78
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:21,039
so what i would like to do this morning is rather than having me speak

79
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:26,640
um to read perhaps some of the questions you

80
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:33,440
might have about the practice about the teachings about the dharma and i'll try to respond if you can if

81
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:39,760
you're able to write it in the chat i'll read them the questions that come and while you're taking your time maybe

82
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,840
to formulate a question or two and the

83
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:51,039
um couple of announcements so one is that tonight for the new year's eve imc

84
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:57,039
has a new year's eve event that you can participate on zoom and it includes some nice kind of new

85
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:03,120
year's eve kind of things that are appropriate for meditators and now including

86
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,960
meditating silently into the new year and the way that you know this online

87
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:15,039
offerings work if some of you might find actually it's a nicer time to celebrate new year's eve

88
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:21,760
if you're on the east coast and and get to go to bed earlier

89
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:27,519
and uh so you can find information about that on the imc website both under the in the

90
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:34,320
calendar and also in the what's new section on the home page the other is that

91
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:41,840
i've said this a few times now but so starting monday i'll start a series on the sati patana sutta so last year we

92
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:48,080
did the anapanasati sutta the instructions of mindfulness of breathing and this time it's the instructions on

93
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:53,760
mindfulness of of

94
00:32:54,080 --> 00:33:01,919
you know the mindfulness of life as a whole mindfulness of these four different domains of practice

95
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:07,600
body feelings mind states and dharmas and this is the foundational text for

96
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:13,600
this mindfulness tradition so we'll go through that slowly over a few weeks

97
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:21,159
so let's see the questions you know so let me see how i can if i can what i can do to

98
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,559
yeah so let's see

99
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:45,760
so there i don't see any questions yet it's a little hard to track on the youtube but let's see

100
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,360
and uh

101
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:07,279
how to let go of how to let fear go cultivate trust

102
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:13,679
yeah not let fear grow cultivate trust you can cultivate trust

103
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:20,480
by learning to be confident that it's okay to address fear to develop a willingness and wisdom

104
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:26,638
about how to be with fear so rather than thinking that we're not supposed to be afraid we can first focus

105
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:32,158
on how to how to bring mindfulness to fear how to

106
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:38,079
be present for it and and

107
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:45,358
but to do that it usually takes some it helps to have some ability to have inner stability

108
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:51,358
and so one of the reasons to practice mindfulness or breathing for example or any kind of meditation practice that

109
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:57,599
calms the mind down settles us down is we have some some degree of stability

110
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:04,079
so we can turn our attention to the fear without being triggered by the fear if we keep being triggered by the fear

111
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:11,200
of getting more afraid then probably it's not the right time to bring attention to fear and then the

112
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:16,400
confidence can come with knowing that i think the best thing for me to do now

113
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:22,960
is to um find another way to step away from the fear um if it's a real world fear something's

114
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,480
happening that is dangerous maybe i have confidence you can leave it

115
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:34,480
find make yourself safe if it's something in your imagination your thoughts or you know your anxiety

116
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,920
then maybe even sometimes distracting yourselves uh exercising doing something that pulls

117
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:46,800
you out of it so you're not caught in the fear of tr of the trap of fear can be useful

118
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:54,640
and then um but your practice with fear is a wonderful thing to do and one of the ways to do it is to

119
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:00,720
have the ability to stable attention to bring attention to your fear feel it in your body feel where it is

120
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:07,599
and have this attitude of helping the fear feel safe now sometimes our reactivity to fear is

121
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:13,599
we're trying to get rid of it or we're afraid of the fear but to meet the fear with this kind of gentleness and

122
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:20,000
kindness so the fear itself feels like it's held in a field of safety this is so

123
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
helpful

124
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:34,400
i feel like greed hatred and delusion are all born out of fear what are the teachings about fear there's a second

125
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,680
question about fear so yeah i think it's quite wise to see how

126
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:45,520
much greed hating delusion is born out of fear and so what another reason why really to

127
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:51,920
get a handle on fear and to work through it there is a discourse where the buddha

128
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,960
talks about working with his own fear before he was enlightened and

129
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:03,920
and what he did was uh whatever posture he was in while he was meditating walking sitting lying down that the fear

130
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:11,440
arose he continued doing what he was doing but then he would just be present with the fear until it had passed

131
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:17,119
so that doesn't involve a lot of insight into the fear or you know the kind of detailed

132
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:22,880
mindfulness instructions we often give around fear but it is a uh

133
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:28,240
instructions to give it its due its time from a mind that's stable

134
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:34,880
then mind that doesn't get pulled into its orbit pulled into its gravitational pull but then not be troubled by it and let

135
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:41,040
it pass on its own but you know fear is a big important topic and at some point in the pandemic

136
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:46,640
i think i did a whole week on fear so you can go back and see what i had to say then

137
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:53,200
and uh or you know an audio dharma there's talks on fear and and there's a lot lots lots it's a

138
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:58,000
really great topic and for practice

139
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:05,599
and what are what is cons

140
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:11,920
what is consciousness and how does it fit with karma

141
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,839
yeah that's one of the what is consciousness is such a great question and

142
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:24,560
you know i kind of suspect no one really knows and

143
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:30,320
though everybody's a lot of people try to know it and there's a lot of claims people know what it is

144
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:35,760
it's possible that uh consciousness is not really minimal to

145
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:42,880
a thing it's a process and as a process it's not a one thing it's not an entity but it's kind of like

146
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:48,640
um a uh the sum of the total of many different

147
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:56,560
mental processes that come together and there's some kind of way and um and what that way is it might just be

148
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:03,040
an image and the consciousness might be a a secondary sense of the overall

149
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:08,800
functioning of the mind who knows what it is in buddhism consciousness is

150
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:15,920
more the cognizing function of the mind the mind that knows the simplest kind of knowing

151
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:21,680
knowing hot as hot cold as cold knowing

152
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:27,920
you know color as color just the simplest kind of knowing but that's not very satisfying for many

153
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,040
people in the west who have very strong association what consciousness is and

154
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:38,400
part of the reason is so powerful this question of consciousness is many people

155
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:45,280
have very strongly identified themselves with consciousness and so i'm conscious therefore i am

156
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:51,760
and this strong identification of consciousness itself is reinforced by some religious teachings outside of buddhism

157
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:59,119
maybe in buddhism even but this identification makes it very very tricky to kind of work with it

158
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:04,560
but what's the connection to consciousness and karma there's kind of two answers to that one

159
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:11,520
is that consciousness itself is an activity like all activities and so in a sense it's

160
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:18,400
it's it's uh it creates karma perhaps and it is the recipient of karmic consequences

161
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:25,599
just like anything else the second answer is often um has to do with the theory of rebirth whereas uh

162
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:31,680
some people have this idea that it's consciousness which goes from one lifetime to another and so what's the connection to the

163
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:38,480
karmic uh momentum over time over multiple lives and um that's like what the question is

164
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,760
about it's a good question but i'm not really qualified or able to give a coherent

165
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,400
answer on that topic

166
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,920
so i'm trying to follow them in the order in which they were spoken

167
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:09,200
how to work with narcissistic people

168
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:18,079
i i don't know about that narcissistic people it's a little bit hard to work with them do we have to work with them

169
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:23,599
how do we relate to them maybe

170
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:30,880
and it's a little hard because i think of narcissism as a kind of a very strong

171
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:37,599
delusion that people are caught in and don't know they're caught in it and a very strong delusion about self

172
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:44,079
and self-importance and strong self-orientation and

173
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:49,599
you could have compassion for them i think it was a lot of suffering and being narcissistic

174
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:54,720
and um gave them some space um

175
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:59,920
not space to allow them to you know override you but kind of sometimes just

176
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:07,119
you know just don't participate in the narcissistic ideations they have but be kind

177
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,920
do you have suggestions on how to silence thoughts

178
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:18,800
well thoughts are connected to so many other things they're connected

179
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:24,319
there's a lot of thinking connected to physical tension physical pressure they're connected to

180
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:30,720
our emotional lives and so to relax the body and relax our emotions

181
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:35,839
to relax the mind are all ways of quieting the thinking mind

182
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:42,560
and then um and then the other thing is to do another thing way to do it is to

183
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:48,720
some people do is to practice concentration practice to really give a little emphasis on

184
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:54,400
staying with a breath not missing one in-breath one out breath just really staying maybe counting the breath

185
00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:01,359
counting one to ten or counting one to one if that's easier and then start over again at one and

186
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:09,200
just really count and that's sometimes like counting and really staying with the breath can a little bit over time

187
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:15,599
remove the energy the fuel that goes into the thinking and begins to redirect the focus of the

188
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:21,680
mind to not be thinking anymore but to be present to kind of like

189
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:27,440
exhaust the thinking mind of its fuel and things get quiet

190
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:34,079
and then also you can turn your attention um and look thinking right in the eye say i see you and sometimes what

191
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:41,280
you really can be silently aware of thinking it's enough to quiet it down

192
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:48,000
so there's a lot to be said about the great question but this this context that's what i'll say

193
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:54,640
what came first a thought or awareness what a great

194
00:43:54,640 --> 00:44:00,560
question maybe that's for you to discover and maybe

195
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:08,520
it's going to be discovered moment by moment it's never like a final answer to the question um

196
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:14,960
sometimes what comes first a body sensation or a thought and sometimes you'll see the body sensation arises

197
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:22,440
first and then a thought follows and sometimes a thought comes first and a body sensation follows

198
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:32,160
how do you not grade yourself and how effective you are being with meditation sessions

199
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,440
yeah that could be difficult so what comes to mind at this moment is um

200
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:43,200
uh start counting how many times you do it and keep tab you're going to keep a record of how often you do it

201
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:48,720
and at some point when you get to 323 you might kind of give up this is

202
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:55,440
ridiculous there's enough of this or you'll be humored wow here i am again

203
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:04,759
can you talk about heart space and how it shows up in everyday life heart space

204
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:10,560
yeah i think that the question maybe would be

205
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:17,359
not how heart space shows up in everyday life but how everyday life shows up in heart

206
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:24,880
space to sit and for example to meditate and have your heart space opened up

207
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:32,160
then that that stay there and let your life come to

208
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:38,079
come into your heart rather than you going to meet the world keep the heart space just keep expanding

209
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:43,359
it make it as spacious and open as possible making your heart as wide as the world

210
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:49,440
and then let the world occur you know do its thing within the heart space

211
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,520
how to set interpersonal boundaries without feeling that you are being selfish

212
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:03,200
yeah one of the ways is to tell people what your needs are uh tell them to tell people that uh you

213
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:08,480
know it's uh that you have you have need for a little bit more

214
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:13,520
time to process things and so you need to have a little more space

215
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:18,800
between people or you need physical distance between people just so you can kind of stay in

216
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:24,880
touch with yourself that when there's people cross your boundaries too much you lose touch with yourself you don't

217
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:32,079
understand yourself well enough you don't know how to be wise and respond kindly and so because you have that need

218
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:38,319
could you please step back a little bit can you please give me a little bit space and and um so you're talking about

219
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:44,079
your own needs so you're not telling someone they're doing something wrong you're you're saying with the impact

220
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:49,760
they have on you and that impact is not so helpful in that you're asking their help to

221
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:55,680
to create more space and if they don't want to help you then then then you know that there's a bigger issue going on

222
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:02,480
that if they don't take you into account and care about how you are than your needs

223
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:14,400
how does one let go oops

224
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:22,720
oh i'm sorry it kind of oh yeah how does

225
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:28,180
one let go when one wants to but keeps circling the same ground

226
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:34,720
[Music] well that's uh one of the things i find useful then is to discover what are the

227
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:40,800
underlying emotions that are keeping me clinging or keeping me uh

228
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:47,520
hesitant to let go the emotions have such a big uh are such a big effect on us

229
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:53,680
and so there are earlier questions about fear is there something you're afraid of and that's why you're clinging or is

230
00:47:53,680 --> 00:48:02,319
something you're afraid of that's why you're not willing to let go of or is it anger or resentment or is it

231
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:07,440
anticipation and expectation what's the emotion that's uh under

232
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,720
underpinning it all and if you can identify that then we want to do uh

233
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:18,960
the um mindfulness of the emotion until it's passed or loosened up enough and

234
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:24,400
then you might find that the clinging is not so tight and it might be easier to let go of it or have a wiser

235
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,359
relationship to it

236
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:36,000
can you speak it to the distinction between buddhist and psychological depth

237
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,680
when releasing oneself from an area of stickiness

238
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:48,880
yeah i don't know if it's so useful to make a strong distinction about it

239
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,039
but

240
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:02,559
and it's a little dangerous you know to make any statement limiting any one of these buddhism or psychology to some simple

241
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:07,680
idea of what one is there's so much overlap

242
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:14,559
and but i've seen sometimes in the world of psychology psychotherapy

243
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:21,040
i've seen people refer to depth as being understanding your biography really deeply and well

244
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:26,720
going through the layers of what happened to us in life and the influences on us and the impact on us

245
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:33,119
and then and sometimes understanding that really well helps people to get unstuck

246
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:39,040
in buddhism the focus is less on our biography and more to go through the layers

247
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:44,800
of what's what's operating in the present moment and it might go through some of the same

248
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:50,000
stuff but it's a different angle towards it buddhism is always about the present moment

249
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:56,160
and so but the present moment has all those our past history the karma of our what's happened to us

250
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:02,400
exists in the present moment kind of layers so buddhism tends not to be so retrospective

251
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:09,960
in the depth but rather more into the layers of the mind something like that

252
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:19,599
i lost some of what you said in answer to your question well this has been recorded so you can go listen to it

253
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:26,960
again can you speak about moving through grief

254
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:32,880
it's such an important topic grief should be respected it's a grief is not a mistake

255
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:39,119
but see it as something that's really important and and maybe even a valuable part of life in

256
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:45,838
spite of being extremely painful and difficult but

257
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:52,480
we want to try to avoid grieving poorly

258
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:59,280
it isn't that we don't want to grieve but grieving poorly what i mean by that is resisting grief

259
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:06,240
uh being angry at grief trying to fix grief trying to get over grief uh taking antidepressants because of our

260
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:12,960
grief anything or alcohol because of it or blaming ourselves for grieving or

261
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:19,839
feeling that we should be over it by now all that i call poor grieving poorly

262
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:26,079
grieving richly is to find a quality time

263
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:31,280
and quality heart space to use a language earlier comment

264
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:38,880
in which to allow the grief its time and allow ourselves to really feel the grief from the waves of grief and

265
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:46,000
respect it deep respect for grief if we get out of the way of our grief

266
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:52,640
our heart our grief tends to know how to process itself and work through and even grief which seems impossible to get

267
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:58,480
through our hearts are amazingly resilient if we get out of the way

268
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:05,599
but when we grieve poorly we're kind of like interfering with the natural process and so those are some brief comments

269
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:11,200
about it i hope that gives you a little bit to to go with

270
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:21,359
and silence feels like loneliness how to

271
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:27,119
embrace the silence in these pandemic days oh yes um you know sometimes i think we need a

272
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:32,559
dictionary of silence that silence is so many different things and it communicates so much

273
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:39,280
and some people have been silenced and it's been very painful and some people

274
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:44,319
getting the silent treatment means that they're kind of dismissed or

275
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:51,760
their existence is denied and that people do horrible things to others to each other uh with the silent treatment

276
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:58,800
with silencing people and so the emphasis on silence sometimes in meditation or meditation retreats

277
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:04,400
it can be very hard for some people have this very strong history and associations with the silence

278
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:10,319
and um and so spending a lot of time with silently alone like a pandemic and and

279
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:16,640
having it mixed up with being loneliness can kind of kind of cast a certain perspective on silence

280
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:22,240
which is not so useful and how to embrace the silence of these

281
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:30,079
pandemic days i think that if silence is if loneliness is an issue during the pandemic days

282
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:35,119
then you know it's certainly for someone who's doing meditation loneliness is a

283
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:42,800
quite a a worthwhile focus for the mindfulness to sit quietly and really

284
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:49,760
turn your attention to the loneliness in a deep penetrating way loneliness is an activity of the mind

285
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:55,040
loneliness is not a you know it's not inherent

286
00:53:55,040 --> 00:54:00,720
some there's operations and thoughts ideas processing of the mind that produces the

287
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:05,760
sensations feelings belief of loneliness and that's good news

288
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:11,200
because it's possible to quiet it down it's possible to free oneself of it

289
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:17,839
and to do that through mindfulness we turn our attention towards it and really feel it and sense it in some deep way

290
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:23,760
and learn to see it in such a way that the seeing of my of loneliness is stronger

291
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:30,000
than loneliness um and then there's also a kind of ordinary things to do

292
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:36,720
sometimes try to reach out to people if you can at all find ways to maybe if you can not be so

293
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:42,319
lonely and um even uh you know putting on a mask and going

294
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:48,000
walk in a public park where there's some other people around the three-dimensional people

295
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:54,640
might be you know kind of a good medicine so that we're not so alone in our house

296
00:54:54,640 --> 00:55:00,480
by ourselves too much it's going to be very very hard and things but this pandemic's been you know

297
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:07,359
so unfortunate how difficult it has been for so many people so it's almost time i think we've

298
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:12,400
stopped so thank you for the questions i appreciate them very much it's wonderful for me to get the

299
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:18,160
sense of you know what you're working with and your concerns and

300
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:23,839

301
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:29,119

302
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:34,319
um i believe questions are always good whether they're answered or not it's it's always good to be questioning and

303
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:41,520
having questions and maybe questions you asked or questions you you can then now try to answer for

304
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:46,720
yourself if i didn't answer them or if i did
