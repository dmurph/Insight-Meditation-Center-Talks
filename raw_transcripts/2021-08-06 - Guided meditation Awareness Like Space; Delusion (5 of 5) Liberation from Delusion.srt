1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:10,639
hello everyone and it's delightful to sit down here and

2
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:17,840
into this posture that's so so rich for me and connotations

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,600
associations and in uh what gets evoked and

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:29,279
it's centered in this meditation posture for decades and it's kind of like a

5
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:37,280
homecoming and to do it together with community to do it together with all of you and adds a certain depth or

6
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:45,200
width and breadth and wonderfulness to this beginning of meditation

7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,038
so thank you and

8
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:59,680
so we're working in meditation and mindfulness with attention our capacity to be aware

9
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,680
and one of the and freedom is a hallmark of buddhism one way to

10
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:13,600
understand freedom is that we're setting our awareness free freeing our attention

11
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:20,159
from the way that our habits of mind um take it over and direct it

12
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:28,000
the habits of mind of wanting or not wanting pushing or pushing away or holding on or

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,680
being being preoccupied with certain thoughts and ideas concerns

14
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,240
emotions these habits of mind then propel attention

15
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:46,079
in the direction of the concern and uh propel them the attention into the world

16
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,240
of thoughts or feelings or what's happening and in a sense they

17
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,360
the attention is not free the attention is being directed it's being

18
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:04,079
utilized some people might say that attention is being uh hijacked

19
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,679
and so to set attention awareness free

20
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:16,640
is one of the great pleasures joys of life and it's almost like we can live a

21
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,400
different life then there's room for something different to occur to

22
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,920
animate us to motivate us to to connect us to the world

23
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,920
when the awareness has been set free it's almost like a door has been a wide open

24
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,280
that was closed or almost like a light has been turned on where it's been turned

25
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,440
you know it's off in the dark so i want to give a little analogy for

26
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,280
this if um

27
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:58,560
so uh if a person lives maybe in a very crowded room for a long time

28
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:06,319
maybe a hoarder and almost no space in the room to walk around in perhaps that uh if uh

29
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:12,239
or i mean and then if a person walks out into a very large room

30
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:18,239
uh comfortable nice safe looking room where there's lots of space there might

31
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,480
be things furniture and chairs and things different things there but immediately what becomes

32
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:31,519
obvious is how much open space there is and in fact for most rooms there is more

33
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:38,400
space than there are things in the room and if we're only focused on the things then

34
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:45,360
sometimes we can miss the open space i've been in places where there's high ceilings and here at imc there's a very

35
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:53,439
high ceiling over me and it's easy to spend a long period of time focusing on what's at eye level and

36
00:03:53,439 --> 00:04:02,159
but to look up and see the high ceiling these places kind of uh space kate's room

37
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:09,599
opens things up in a certain way and so it's possible to shift one's attention from the objects in a room

38
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:17,359
to the space in the room in the same way it's possible to be claustrophobic in one's own mind and

39
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:23,199
be maybe an equivalent of a hoarder of the mind just collecting things and wanting things and

40
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,560
fantasizing and and going you know one fantasy one

41
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:35,280
thought train overlapping with the next and with you know almost breathless between them

42
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,759
and it's possible then to open the metaphorical inner eyes or a sense

43
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,800
of awareness we can open it up we can look around

44
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:54,400
and we see that there's actually more space in the mind than there are objects

45
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:01,919
there's more space in our capacity for awareness the field of awareness then there is

46
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:08,639
the things we're preoccupied with or caught in it and if you can look around a little

47
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:15,600
bit in your mind to see the space the openness that some people might experience with the stillness

48
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:23,360
in the mind quiet in the mind or a silence in the mind rather than space

49
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,360
and there's actually together with the objects in the room there is the space

50
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:35,600
together with the concerns we have there's also space there's also silence there's

51
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:42,320
also stillness and to let awareness

52
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:48,160
relax into that to take that in and see that in that space in that stillness

53
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,600
there is a freedom an awareness there can find its freedom where it isn't

54
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:00,960
being directed as much and the sweetness of awareness is set

55
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:08,479
free so assuming a meditation posture

56
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,319
and tenderly closing your eyes

57
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:25,840
and giving a little bit more attention maybe than usual in sitting with a spine or body that

58
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:34,240
is feels attentive for people sitting upright it's maybe sitting a little bit more upright

59
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:41,360
for people lying down it might be adjusting the shoulder blades a little bit and that upper back

60
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:49,039
so that the shoulder blades maybe come in a little bit and and the chest is allowed to be more

61
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,280
open

62
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:08,080
and then ex become attuned to the body's experience of breathing

63
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,918
aware from the inside out

64
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:22,479
and gently tenderly as you exhale relax your body soften

65
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:31,919
maybe letting there be a gentling of your body together with

66
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:45,840
keeping the alertness of the body

67
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:07,440
and then you can stop relaxing the body

68
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,879
but as you exhale now see if you can relax the mind

69
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:25,520
maybe that means to quiet the mind may have your thinking becomes quieter

70
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:31,680
slower calm thinking

71
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:43,599
as you exhale to relax any tension pressure to think

72
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:51,680
or to fantasize or any other way the mind is tense or

73
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,959
contracted narrow

74
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,560
allowing the mind to become

75
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,839
wide and open

76
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:23,839
appreciating whatever stillness there is in the mind

77
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,640
if you throw a rock through empty space

78
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:48,480
through the air nothing if nothing is disturbed by the

79
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,839
rock

80
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,200
if you play music the notes travel through the air without

81
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,480
disturbing anything

82
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,600
so when we center ourselves in awareness

83
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:24,079
all kinds of things can arise thoughts and feelings and emotions

84
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:31,360
there's nothing we have to do except experience them allow them to

85
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,320
appear and travel through

86
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,560
the space of awareness

87
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:50,160
without having them disturb anything and without us disturbing them getting

88
00:10:50,160 --> 00:11:01,839
involved in them

89
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:13,440
perhaps becoming aware that beyond the edges of your concerns your sensations your

90
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,839
feelings

91
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:28,240
there's lots of space lots of room

92
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,760
and allow whatever particular experiences arise

93
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:43,839
allow them as if they're floating through all the space of the mind that's here

94
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,560
instead of attention being directed by our concerns

95
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:08,720
our concerns are held in a wide open free awareness

96
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:25,839
relaxed mindfulness

97
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,919
you

98
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,919
you

99
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,919
you

100
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,919
you

101
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,440
and then as we come to the end of the

102
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:12,158
sitting is there some deeper way fuller way that you can relax

103
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:19,679
if you are more in touch with your body or your mind from this sitting

104
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:28,240
more settled you have access to some way to relax more fully

105
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:34,240
maybe softening relaxing at your core inside

106
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,240
in your heart or your mind

107
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:49,840
not to do this ambitiously but just a little bit more

108
00:27:55,039 --> 00:28:03,919
and then if there is some calm or relaxation or subtleness seeing if you can maintain

109
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:09,120
it as we now turn our attention

110
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:17,679
to the people of this world the animals of this world all the living beings

111
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,519
that we share this planet with

112
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:27,278
in a sense that we're in a family with

113
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:35,200
some some of these creatures we share the planet with are distant relatives

114
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:49,200
into in this relaxed settled way to gaze upon others with kind eyes

115
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:56,880
with a kind regard to gaze upon all beings

116
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,720
with the generosity of heart

117
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:14,000
and perhaps after a session of meditation it is possible to look upon others

118
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:21,278
in a qualitatively different way than if you're preoccupied and caught up in things

119
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,840
maybe you have access to a simple kindness and well-wishing

120
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:35,760
and if so it's useful healthy health-making

121
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:43,679
to give a simple expression to this kind this well-wishing without ambition

122
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:51,440
or obligation wishing maybe even saying to yourself

123
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:57,520
may all beings be happy

124
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:08,320
may all beings be safe

125
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:13,278
may all beings be peaceful

126
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:23,200
may all beings be free

127
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:30,960
and may we live as if we're related to all living beings

128
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,799
because somewhere of some way or other we actually are

129
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:51,840
may all beings be happy

130
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:06,720
so before i give my talk today a couple of announcements one is

131
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:14,559
that next week i'm going be away

132
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:19,600
and so matthew bren silver will come and

133
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:26,799
teach these early morning 7 a.m here in california teachings matthew is a wonderful teacher and i

134
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:32,720
think you'll be delighted by his teaching and his presence and

135
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:41,279
very happy to have him fill in for me and the other is that our retreat center

136
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:46,480
the irc insight retreat center we were going to open at the end of august

137
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:53,840
but now we decided to delay that probably till the middle of november and and the retreats that we were

138
00:31:53,840 --> 00:32:00,320
scheduled to do in person now will be online and which means that we can accept more

139
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:07,919
people so if some of you are interested in a chance to do an online retreat and

140
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:16,000
you can go i think you can go onto irc's website and see what's available now or i think it's all been converted now um

141
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:22,799
and um to online retreats and and um and uh these online retreats are quite

142
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:28,960
wonderful it's one of the surprises of the pandemic is how how well the benefits beneficial is for

143
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:35,518
people to do them and so anyway so that's available

144
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:45,120
so this today this last talk on this five part series on

145
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:53,519
delusion it's also the last talk in the now the three-week series on the three

146
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:59,200
roots of unwholesome behavior the three sometimes called the poisons

147
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:06,399
greed hatred and delusion and so in conclusion i'd like to

148
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:13,600
kind of paraphrase the buddha when he said that he said kind of emphatically

149
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:20,559
or enthusiastically he said if it was not possible to bring greed

150
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:26,720
hatred and delusion to an end i would not instruct you to do so

151
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:35,760
but it is possible to put an end to greed hatred and delusion and so this is my instruction

152
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:43,440
so maybe for many people it's inconceivable that they can give up these very strong forces in the mind but

153
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:49,840
this is what buddhist practice is sets out to do and it's a phenomenally

154
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:56,240
beneficial and dignified and valuable path to be on to

155
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:02,000
first alleviate decrease and then to have an experience of the absence of

156
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,600
great hatred delusion and that absence is followed by coming to a time where

157
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:14,878
the tendency to create hatred and delusion is comes to an end and

158
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:21,200
and one of the things that's quite wonderful about this is that greed hatred and delusion are the roots

159
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:28,320
for all unethical behavior or say it differently all behavior that causes intentional or

160
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,599
conscious harm to others and even to ourselves

161
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:40,398
and it's a phenomenal thing to become a person who has cleansed themselves or freed themselves

162
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:45,839
from these powerful forces the consequences of which we can read in the newspaper every day

163
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:52,000
of how people treat each other and the impact we have on others and the environment and all over

164
00:34:52,000 --> 00:35:00,560
and it's some you know the hope is that there are some people who appreciate the human capacity to

165
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:05,839
become free and uh and our model then or

166
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:12,240
a beacon for others it's possible to be on this path maybe in this lifetime we're not going

167
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:19,119
to go all the way to the complete ending of all greed hatred and delusion but the diminishing of it

168
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:25,440
and to have greater and greater periods of time when we're free of it before it comes back

169
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:32,079
is really marvelous for the buddha he teaches what he teaches called the

170
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:37,680
dharma and and sometimes his dharma that he teaches is said to be

171
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:43,440
visible here and now directly perceivable in the present moment it's not something

172
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:49,359
esoteric and distant uh you know but rather something that's available here

173
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:55,920
and one of the inspiring ways in which he makes it so available maybe it's hard to do this but

174
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:03,839
so kind of you know in in our lives is that the dharma that when the dharma

175
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:10,079
is visible here and now when we have had the experience

176
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:16,320
of greed hatred and delusion and we experience the mind the heart free of

177
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:23,119
it without it and that distinction between what it's like to have a mind of with

178
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:29,440
great hatred and delusion and what it's like to have one without that is where we can see the dharma in a

179
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,960
very profound way but it really takes both so part of this

180
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:42,079
study of greed hatred delusion is a willingness to see it in ourselves to admit it

181
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:48,079
to ourselves to become familiar with all the tricks all the ways that great hatred and

182
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:53,280
delusion operate for us not to uh feel bad about ourselves or

183
00:36:53,280 --> 00:37:01,520
or be depressed by it but the more familiar we become then that when when it's not there

184
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:09,359
we're able to recognize that in a clearer way it's like going from a crowded room full of things and um because we really

185
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:14,560
know what that's like the experience of an open room that's free of a lot of

186
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:19,599
crowded things just feels so different and we really appreciate it in

187
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:25,040
fact if the room is spacious and clean and peaceful enough it can feel nourishing and

188
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:30,400
delightful to be in it and so to be familiar with great heightened delusion

189
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:36,000
to better appreciate um and and be nourished by the

190
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,880
absence of it that is to see the dharma here and now and so it's not understanding you know

191
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:49,040
great profound teachings on emptiness or great states of consciousness or

192
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:55,359
transcendental states as much as it is this clear kind of ordinary recognition

193
00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:00,400
that's possible uh the presence and the absence of these things

194
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:06,880
as we become familiar with greed hatred and delusion and this week it's the topic is delusion we begin

195
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:13,680
to appreciate that all of these in delusion as well have a common characteristic

196
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,880
and maybe we can call it a common denominator and that is they all involve

197
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:24,240
clinging or grasping and clinging uh some people like to think of it as

198
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,599
like uh you know plastic cling wrap that uh it just sticks to us we stick to

199
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:34,880
it and and sometimes you can't get rid of it or you can't unfold it or something

200
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:40,320
and it just accompanies us but grasping is a more powerful

201
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:45,920
clinging maybe some people are synonymous grasping when people would cling with p to people

202
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:51,920
with our hands or with our hearts or our minds we grasp on we don't let go we claw

203
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:58,720
sometimes it feels like they're clawing onto what we want and to other people or something

204
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:06,480
so all greed hate and delusion has a share having clinging and grasping as part of

205
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:12,160
it and something we're grasping something we're clinging to

206
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:18,800
and the experience of becoming really free is the uh opening up of that

207
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:26,079
grasping hand it's the relaxing of the clawing hand it's the softening of the

208
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:34,640
fist or the resisting hand there's a deep deep kind of letting go of a knot

209
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:41,680
inside of us deep letting go of a contraction a coagulation of

210
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:49,599
that exists within the field of awareness and um and uh

211
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:56,400
and so to to move in that direction to have a sense oh this is possible and

212
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:02,000
to begin to experience this release of clinging release of grasping

213
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:09,520
first in small little experiences in life even the smallest letting go relaxing

214
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:15,040
around something is a foretaste or is or partakes in part

215
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:21,520
with the liberation of a buddha it's just a matter of degree and so we're not so different from the

216
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:27,440
buddha if we begin to appreciate the small degrees it which we live without greed hatred

217
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:34,000
delusion the small degrees in which we can let go of it and relax around it um small degrees we can let go of

218
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,760
clinging and grasping and the appreciating that seeing that

219
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:46,319
and valuing it and valuing ourselves for being on this path

220
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:52,880
supports the growing growing capacity to let go more deeply to relax more deeply and it

221
00:40:52,880 --> 00:41:00,000
isn't so much we're letting go of things in the world which some people protest that you know just means that we live a lot in life of

222
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:07,599
radical renunciation just let go of everything that there's some value to that for sure

223
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:13,280
but um but uh it's not letting go of things that's the

224
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:19,920
object of buddhist practice it's letting go of the clinging to things it's letting go of the grasping

225
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:26,160
in the mind and whether or not we let go of things or even people sometimes

226
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:31,760
um is uh is secondary it's that that we use our wisdom to know what's best to do

227
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:38,319
there but it doesn't take much wisdom to appreciate that we're better off not having clinging or

228
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:43,760
grasping in the mind and the people we do cling to

229
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:50,560
they really appreciate it many times when we can be with them and love them without clinging to them so if you learn

230
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:56,640
to let go of the clinging life becomes a whole different game and

231
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:01,760
importantly that as we learn not to cling this absence of this activity of

232
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:09,440
clinging of grasping this non-doing of clinging and grasping that um where it

233
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:15,920
lowers the tendency to be caught in delusion and hatred and in greed and we begin

234
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:21,200
seeing how the movement towards delusion towards greed towards hatred

235
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:28,720
comes along with a with a activity of the mind activity of the heart of contraction of tightness of clinging

236
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:35,680
of tension that is just not good for us and to really feel and recognize that

237
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:41,599
because we're really in touch with ourselves it gives us the opportunity to recognize something different

238
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:49,359
the absence of clinging and how good that is and how our view of the world changes

239
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:54,480
if we're seeing the world through the lens of non-clinging rather than seeing it through the lens

240
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:00,400
of clinging seeing in the world through the lens of non-greed

241
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:08,240
non-hatred and non-delusion it is possible to do this and

242
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:14,880
it's uh more valuable to it to do this than a lot of other human pursuits more

243
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,240
valuable than becoming rich more valuable than having i don't know

244
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:27,839
popularity and all kinds of things so i wish you much much happiness

245
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:34,720
and peace and well-being and and i know that the greatest happiness

246
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:40,560
and peace that's available to you will come when you when you really

247
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:46,240
let go and release the clinging and grasping in the mind and free yourself of greed hatred and

248
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:51,359
delusion and may it be so so thank you

249
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:57,040
for this series and being part of this and listening and i look forward to being back with

250
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:06,400
you in two weeks so thank you
