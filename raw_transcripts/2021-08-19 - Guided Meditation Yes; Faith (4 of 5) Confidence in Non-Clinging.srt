00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:08,080
warm hello from redwood city here at the insight meditation center

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,480
and

3
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,760
the imagination that is wonderful that thinks of so many of

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,199
you spread out across the continent and the globe

5
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:34,160
um getting ready to this myth for this meditation and kind of a gathering together of

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,520
a community of meditators as much as gathering together our bodies

7
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,280
and minds to be here

8
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,760
and now to be here in the company of others meditating

9
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,920
and i think it's important to appreciate that one way or the other we don't meditate

10
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,520
alone that um we're finding our way

11
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:10,400
as a community as a as society as a

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,400
in all kinds of ways that that exists

13
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,000
so yesterday this week someone had been

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,880
offering these single words that maybe for some of you might be interesting to keep in your

15
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,640
in your in reserve for your practice both on the

16
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,920
cushion and meditating and also in daily life and

17
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:49,119
you know i started off with the word now and uh it can be a powerful word

18
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:55,840
if it helps place you in the now in the present moment in a way that is supportive and

19
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,040
helpful and attentive to what's here

20
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:08,959
and then tuesday was the word here wednesday was the word yes

21
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:16,080
it's a very you know it's a positive word and to be able to associate the practice of mindfulness

22
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,280
with this positivity of yes it sometimes really helps us to settle

23
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,200
in here and today i'd like to introduce the word no

24
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:34,239
and maybe not a popular word but it can be a very wise word

25
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,360
that not be said with aversion or hostility of any kind

26
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,040
or a kind of not even very careful it's not a kind of dismissal of something

27
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,560
but um if we're in meditation we say we can say no

28
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:57,440
to habits of mind that we know all too well don't serve us are not helpful

29
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:04,640
that we know it's to our detriment or we say no

30
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,800
gently kindly in a sense of not now this is not the time

31
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,440
to to trains of thoughts and thinking which

32
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:24,480
are not to the point what we're doing when we're doing this precious work of settling in here to develop clear

33
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:31,120
presence in the present moment so we can say no and it's that clarity of no it's

34
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,400
different than the positivity of yes yes it's kind of an opening and allowing almost

35
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,720
but a no there's a clarity to it not this no

36
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,239
and then there's all kinds of underlying beliefs that go underneath assumptions that go along

37
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,319
underneath our way we operate the way we think the way that we act and motivate us and one

38
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,760
of those is all kinds of ideations of me myself and mine

39
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,760
ideas of self i need to do this i need to do that desires that we have and beliefs and

40
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,840
desires are important and they are all these things have value but when we meditate

41
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:18,479
sometimes it's appropriate to gently lovingly say no this is not the time no

42
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:25,520
not this not this not this this is not what they get caught in this is not what to get

43
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:33,360
concerned with not this and sometimes when something occurs in meditation and we start

44
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:40,000
focusing on it sometimes it's not present momentum awareness we bring to it but rather it

45
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,120
begins to be retrospective thinking analysis discussing it to ourselves

46
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,320
and then we kind of lose the thread of the present moment and so just know

47
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,440
no so if you'd like on this this meditation today

48
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:03,520
you might experiment with a clear

49
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,280
statement of just no to certain things that take you away from the present moment certain things

50
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:16,800
that get you entangled with the present moment habits of mind which are not useful

51
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:23,680
and uh it's kind of like mine sometimes it's like a two-year-old child that is going to push against the boundaries

52
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,840
push against the limits to find out where it's safe where the boundaries are

53
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,759
and sometimes a clear no to a two-year-old will actually settle them they'll give you clear because now they

54
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,039
know where safety is they know what's allowed and there's kind of a clarity there

55
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:47,039
so sometimes for the mind too it needs to hear the no it needs to hear not this

56
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:53,479
so so that's my suggestion for today so

57
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,840
um so please uh take a meditation posture that is

58
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,880
suitable for you and it could be many different types

59
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:11,039
and i like to think that the principle of a posture is that one that is comfortable for a period of time

60
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:16,400
but also alert

61
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:23,039
that promotes alertness of course much of the alertness is coming from the mind

62
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,039
so almost any posture might work

63
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,639
and then to soften the gaze of your eyes

64
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:44,639
if you're looking at your monitor as i speak you might continue but just soften

65
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:50,960
the gaze maybe even slightly out of focus if it's a relaxed thing to do

66
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,199
and maybe even then taking your gaze and pointing it down 45 degrees

67
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,560
towards the floor maybe and maybe imagining that you're looking

68
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,599
at a mountain far in the distance or and just kind of relax and soften the

69
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:13,199
gaze letting the eyes rest in their sockets

70
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,880
and if it's comfortable for you you can also close your eyes

71
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:33,599
and then to gently

72
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:41,440
carefully taking a few long slow deep breaths

73
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:48,000
and as you exhale to relax and settle in

74
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,160
to this body relax and settle in

75
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:01,919
to where you feel some stability or safety or well-being

76
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:09,478
in your being in your body in your heart

77
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:29,360
and letting your breathing return to normal and continue maybe for the next three

78
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:38,200
breaths to relax your body face shoulders belly

79
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:07,440
and maybe for the next three breaths maybe if it's possible

80
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:14,800
to relax the mind calming your thinking

81
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,480
releasing any pressure or attention to think

82
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:43,800
and then to settle into the body's experience or breathing

83
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,959
maybe as if the rhythm of breathing in and breathing

84
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:04,560
out are like the gentle waves out on the ocean

85
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:13,040
in which you gently are floating up and down on it lifted on the inhale

86
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,480
gently lowered on the exhale

87
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,560
and feeling their rhythms breathing in and breathing out

88
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:33,839
as if it's a rhythm that can allow you to relax and

89
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,640
feel comforted or feel safe

90
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:03,279
settling into your breathing and if there's anything that takes you

91
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:10,640
away from your breathing thoughts maybe even feelings

92
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:19,040
if it seems appropriate you can gently clearly say no not that no

93
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,560
and continue with your breathing

94
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:31,279
but if it doesn't know it doesn't make it go away or stop then maybe make it the object of

95
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:39,120
mindfulness and it isn't so much you're saying no

96
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,480
to whatever it is that's happening you're saying no

97
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:51,120
to your involvement with it you're concerned with it

98
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:58,240
so that your concern can remain you're breathing

99
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,320
the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out

100
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:11,360
if you are thinking more than you're meditating

101
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:18,880
say no to thinking remind your mind

102
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,240
not now no

103
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:31,160
and always when you need to begin again with your meditation

104
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,919
you

105
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,200
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

106
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:41,360
to take a few moments to see if there's any ways that you have

107
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:46,799
benefited from this sitting even if you're restless or it's been

108
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:51,840
challenging there are the ways that you are a little

109
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:57,519
bit more attentive or connected to yourself

110
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,120
are you a little calmer than you were before

111
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,120
did you learn something about the value of no

112
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:20,679
that help might help you better to say yes

113
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,759
to mindfulness to being present

114
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:38,799
there is a no that is a no to what takes us away from

115
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:44,398
our own goodness our own well-being

116
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:50,080
our own our own care and good will

117
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:59,600
and at the end of the meditation reflecting a little bit about how we might have benefited

118
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:07,360
or maybe having confidence that even if we don't see the direct benefits

119
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:14,840
there are unknown benefits from doing this

120
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:23,200
practice and whether the benefits are known or unknown in the last minutes of the meditation

121
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:31,440
to dedicate them to the welfare and happiness of others

122
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:37,039
somehow imagine that they spread from you out into the world

123
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:44,640
and somehow or other direct and indirect channels of contact

124
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:51,760
with others the benefit of this meditation practice may it be that it spreads out across the

125
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:59,480
lands and seas to touch all beings

126
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,720
so they benefit as well

127
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:12,240
may the people in afghanistan benefit from our meditation

128
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,279
maybe by increasing our capacity to care and to

129
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:22,720
be inspired to improve the lives of people there or

130
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:30,240
maybe the peoples who are we can support and help much closer

131
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,840
may our our care extend to the people of haiti

132
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:43,679
with so much struggles in some ways

133
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:52,080
maybe people who feel forgotten by the rest of the world may we not forget them

134
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:58,480
may we care for them and may they receive the benefits or practice

135
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:04,240
places in the world where their covet is rampant

136
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,080
still difficult in india and indonesia and

137
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:15,840
thailand and many places

138
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,960
may they be held in our sphere of goodwill and that we wish that our practice benefits

139
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,000
them as well and most look most most local more

140
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,360
locally to here in california the many people

141
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,679
who've been impacted by all the fires here

142
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:49,240
lost their homes their communities

143
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:57,840
may it be that our practice here is for the welfare and happiness of all

144
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:05,519
beings including ourselves and as we benefit may it benefit others

145
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:12,640
may all beings be happy may all beings be safe

146
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:20,559
may all beings be peaceful and may all beings everywhere

147
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,880
be free

148
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:35,710
[Music]

149
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:50,480
so today is the fourth talk on faith

150
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:56,720
and um the word sada in pali

151
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,000
is sometimes translated translated into english as confidence

152
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,200
and one of the reasons for this is that one of the primary purposes for this

153
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:13,360
sada this faith is to have the confidence to engage in practice

154
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:19,519
the confidence that you can engage practice make a difference

155
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:24,960
and many times in the teachings of the buddha it's clear that someone when someone

156
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,559
learns the dharma well enough to have faith the purpose of that faith

157
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:35,600
is so they begin their practice so it's not faith in some

158
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,840
belief or something you're supposed to carry with you and then apply to your life you know in terms of a

159
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:46,559
idea but rather it's a it's a confidence that there is

160
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:55,120
something worthwhile to do and it's worthwhile to practice worthwhile to be mindful to develop

161
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:01,840
our meta or compassion or our equanimity or our clear seeing of what's happening

162
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:07,840
here all kinds of things the practice of generosity

163
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:16,000
so um the um so this idea of confidence

164
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,360
and um um

165
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,480
so one of the things that as practice develops and we begin having

166
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:33,039
some real feeling for what this practice is about then there's a particular kind of

167
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:40,240
confidence that can arise that maybe for the people who haven't experienced it well enough

168
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:47,519
it might seem foreign or uninteresting or kind of bland or kind of not really

169
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:54,240
so important because it's the absence of something and how can the absence of something be so

170
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:01,039
something to be confident in then that confidence is in the absence of clinging

171
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:06,960
absence of grasping or the ass the absence of

172
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,919
attachment when attachment means clinging or grasping

173
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,358
and so to have confidence in non-clinging

174
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:22,800
and and this is a can be very helpful to understand this that

175
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:29,599
at some point it's not always so clear what to have confidence in there's all kinds of questions about we

176
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:34,720
might have or challenges we have but it's but at minimum at some point we

177
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:40,000
can have clear confidence that it's not worthwhile to get attached

178
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:47,839
to get to cling to grasp onto uh things and uh and to have that clear experience

179
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:53,040
of that because not because it's a belief and for people don't have the experience

180
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:58,720
of non-clinging there can be all kinds of protests about why clinging grasping attachment is

181
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:06,400
useful and important but if you have the experience of it then non-clinging then we have a clear

182
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:13,920
then reference point for watching feeling how cl clinging when it comes back in

183
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,520
is to our detriment grasping as it begins working it up is actually a

184
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:25,040
diminishment of ourselves or limiting ourselves or or

185
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:31,119
get interfering with the best qualities of who we are to come forth into the world

186
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:38,960
and so at some point we start experiencing the benefits of non-clinging how wonderful it is

187
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:45,440
and then the practice can be maybe maybe the confidence is not completely strong about it yet

188
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:51,920
and then practice has a little bit to do with the questioning the debating

189
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,760
about how important is it to not cling is it okay not to cling maybe you're

190
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:03,760
supposed to cling maybe in these kinds of areas we have to be allowed to grasp or to get attached

191
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:09,040
and and how about here and here and so there starts to be a natural

192
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:16,160
questioning a debating uh exploration about where do i fit you know is it okay

193
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:22,720
not to cling is that really valuable or and so and so rather than being struggle and

194
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:28,960
think that this is wrong to have this debate or this question i believe that at some point in practice that becomes a

195
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:34,480
healthy part of the practice questioning debating taking both sides being the devil's

196
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:40,000
advocate looking at this deeply and and seeing and if you find you know a

197
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,839
really good reason why you need to grasp it it's for your betterment and betterment of others there's no one to

198
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:51,599
stop you but if you really are mindful and carefully attentive and really

199
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:57,680
experience the the peace the well-being the benefits of non-clinging

200
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:02,880
you might start to start having confidence in non-clinging

201
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:09,040
have faith in it trust it and so then the faith the sada

202
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:14,480
is not a belief system it's not in something that

203
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:19,760
you know you've been told is a good idea like practice and but now it becomes something that

204
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:25,359
becomes a very important reference point for our lives and this is the reference point we could

205
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:30,880
say it's peace we could say it's a sense of happiness or freedom

206
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:36,560
but uh to to call it that um

207
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:43,839
kind of takes that the gaze the focus away from what brought it what brought that peace

208
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:49,040
and happiness and well-being and uh and what brings it in some very

209
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:55,280
deep way is the non-grasping the non-attachment the non-clinging

210
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:02,079
and uh and so to keep an eye on that then you can right there at the juncture

211
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:08,640
at the place where the real work exists because very few people become totally

212
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,760
free and totally peaceful once and for all most people can have a taste of it and

213
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,920
then they get caught up again and but to remember to have confidence and non-clinging

214
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:26,720
puts you at that juncture where the practice really uh has some very great value that's

215
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:32,880
where the work is and it isn't that you have to let go but maybe it's the confidence to

216
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:40,480
non-cling allows you to look at clinging in a deeper and deeper way to really be present for it

217
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:47,359
to realize this is important if if the emphasis is on freedom or peace or happiness

218
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:53,839
then if we lose it then like then we try to get it back perhaps we don't know quite where to do and

219
00:38:53,839 --> 00:39:01,200
and where the focus might be so non-clinging but if the focus is on only

220
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:09,200
on non-clinging or we only think about that then we might not appreciate all the benefits that come from non-clinging

221
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:16,240
so ideally we're kind of looking at both and aware of both for someone who just begins to practice

222
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:21,599
i think that the benefits of non-clinging and the well-being that comes from it is right there at the

223
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:28,079
beginning perhaps or early on but in various maybe i don't know i don't want to diminish the value of it but in maybe

224
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:34,320
small ways maybe mundane ways ordinary ways just the shoulders relax a little bit

225
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:39,920
that's a letting go and a sense of well-being that comes there's a little bit more calm in the

226
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,960
mind but as practice gets deeper and deeper

227
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:52,320
or fuller and fuller then the the value the experience of non-clinging becomes richer and richer

228
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:59,920
and at some point the confidence becomes phenomenal strong confidence where we realize

229
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:05,200
that there's nothing that's worthwhile

230
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:10,240
losing the non-clinging for that all the things we need to do and

231
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,920
take care of in this world we can take care of better with non-clinging

232
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:23,119
it's a difficult place to have confidence in because many times the world family friends people in the world

233
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:29,359
expect us want people want us to be get anxious or get caught or participate

234
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:34,640
in the attachments that they're involved in and to show that we care by getting

235
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:40,160
afraid or anxious or being angry or upset by things but

236
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:48,160
and so it's a little bit hard when the people around us expect us to behave in ways that call back our clinging

237
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:54,160
but to really discover strong confidence in clinging and non-clinging

238
00:40:54,160 --> 00:41:01,280
and not to succumb to the social pressure pressures to be otherwise this is also another place where you know

239
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:06,400
it's not easy and that's where the debates come up or the explorations or the

240
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:12,160
deeper looking at what's going on that's necessary but you know keep having

241
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:17,280
coming back and i think the one way to understand the path of buddhist practice

242
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:23,760
it's a path to a greater and greater appreciation of non-clinging greater and greater confidence in it and

243
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:31,440
non-clinging and in doing so discovering the the tremendous

244
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:37,040
what follows in the wake of that the tremendous sense of well-being freedom happiness

245
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:43,839
peace clarity there's many words for what follows in the wake of non-clinging

246
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:49,359
and um and we don't want to raise any of it or or

247
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:54,720
latch on or cling to any of it and by keeping the focus on non-clinging

248
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:01,920
then we don't cling to what is wonderful but not long non-clinging opens our door

249
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:07,280
the door to what is wonderful and and then if you stay close to

250
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:14,000
non-clinging maybe we won't cling to what's wonderful and may it be that you share your

251
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,200
wonderfulness your goodness you're not clinging

252
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:24,319
share it with others in such a way that you are being generous supportive helpful

253
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:30,720
and so it's really clear to yourself that this practice you're doing is not just for yourself but it's also for the

254
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:36,078
welfare of others confidence and non-clinging

255
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:42,560
so thank you and then a couple of announcements

256
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:47,680
so first one is maybe in the wake of what i just said i've been very moved by

257
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:54,400
the crisis in the world right now and uh and the one that's kind of

258
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,839
closest to my heart to the moment is what's going on in haiti

259
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:08,079
and a neighbor to the north american continent if you listen and often as i said earlier a kind of

260
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:14,160
forgotten country with tremendous poverty so close to a country that has

261
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:20,800
tremendous wealth and i wondered if um our youtube community

262
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:25,920
uh could band together in our goodness and generosity and

263
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:32,160
here's opportunity to take our practice and benefit the world and uh to raise funds for the people of

264
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:37,680
haiti and there's an organization called partners in health that does a lot of

265
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:43,200
on-the-ground work with local healthcare workers bringing supplies and medicine and med

266
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:49,119
medical workers to partner with them works with local communities very intimately so they're really in harmony

267
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:55,280
with what's going on so what i like to propose is you could certainly make a donation directly

268
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:00,640
but i'd like to propose that tomorrow friday and maybe sunday also for the imc

269
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:05,920
community more widely is maybe if you make a donation any

270
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:11,119
donation you make to imc through the kind of the

271
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:16,720
online button i think it's on the youtube page ref the link to it

272
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:23,440
under the that any donations imc will turn around all of it

273
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:28,480
and uh and give it to partners in health and that would be lovely if we could uh

274
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:33,520
come together like that so tomorrow and sunday so i'll announce it again tomorrow

275
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:40,319
and the other um announcement is that tomorrow after our

276
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:46,560
little dharmet that i do i'll provide a zoom link and then we can have a community meeting

277
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:52,640
of those those of you who can and just to check in and ask questions and you can ask me questions about the

278
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:58,400
