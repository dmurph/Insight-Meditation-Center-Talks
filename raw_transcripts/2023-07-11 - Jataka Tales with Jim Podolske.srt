00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:14,240
good evening everyone how is the sound level for everyone okay can you hear okay

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,900
Abraham

3
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:31,160
okay it's a little louder um

4
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,000
yeah last week Diana asked me if I would give a talk tonight I fill in for her as

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,980
she teaches her retreat

6
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,520
I've really been enjoying what Diane has been teaching she's been

7
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:58,460
reading suitors stories about teachings that the Buddha gave to people

8
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:05,580
that um stories that about teachings that the

9
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:11,400
Buddha gave to people who came and asked him questions about what he was teaching

10
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:20,420
um you know who are sincerely curious about what the Buddha had to offer

11
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:28,080
all of those teachings were given after the Buddha had

12
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:36,600
fully awakened so it wasn't until after he had finally broken through all of the

13
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,540
the um Fetters greed delusion and hatred

14
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,840
that he could then start

15
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,520
sharing his knowledge with other people so that's

16
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,240
um what we've been hearing for these last few months these teachings from the time

17
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,020
that the Buddha had awakened

18
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:14,660
it said that when he awakened he could also remember his past lives lives that he had lived

19
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:20,819
prior to to the life where he woke up and

20
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:25,340
you may or may not

21
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,400
believe that but anyway there's these the whole set of

22
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:40,920
stories called the jyotica tales which are Tales that took place in the lives before the

23
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:46,620
Buddha woke up and they're often used um

24
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:52,620
in Buddhist cultures as ways of teaching

25
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:58,140
about particular type habits of heart and mind

26
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:03,959
particularly qualities of heart and mind that that one can cultivate

27
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:10,019
and that facilitate the opening of the heart

28
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:16,200
to let out the things that need to be let out and

29
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,540
to let in the things that need to be let in so

30
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:27,780
um so tonight I wanted to read one of these jyotica Tales this is one that I heard

31
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:34,319
about a little over 20 years ago I was on a retreat with Lee brasington and he

32
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:41,220
was ugh this was a retreat on concentration practice on the

33
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:47,760
absorptions and one of the things that facilitates that practice is doing

34
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,879
the Brahma bihara practice these practices of loving kindness of

35
00:03:53,879 --> 00:04:01,260
sympathetic Joy of compassion and of equanimity

36
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:06,659
so this particular story that I'm going to read is one about compassion

37
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:12,620
and the thing that I liked about these stories is they were

38
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:17,820
they're kind of foundational you don't really have to understand all

39
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:23,220
of the Eightfold Path and the four noble truths and you know the 12 steps of

40
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:28,740
dependent origination these are just stories about simple qualities of heart

41
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:33,680
and mind that you can cultivate

42
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:39,560
so um

43
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,460
so I'd like you all to get comfortable

44
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:53,460
you know sit in a posture that's you have some sense of relaxation and

45
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:59,280
comfort but also some sense of alertness

46
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:06,780
I don't recommend that you use this as I listening to this story as a way of

47
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:13,199
falling asleep I'd like you to to be a to be awake for

48
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,410
it [Applause]

49
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:28,380
okay oh hand this particular version was written by a

50
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:34,440
man named Rafe Martin about 30 years ago and it says that it's for grades 9 10 11

51
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:40,860
and 12. so looking around the room I think you all are qualified

52
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:47,220
for this to hear this teaching and I don't know about people online but I'm

53
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:55,580
I'm assuming that many of you are so we'll start the story

54
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:04,740
once the Buddha was born as a banyan deer when he was grown he became leader of

55
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:12,020
the herd he guided his herd wisely and led them to the heart of a secluded Forest where

56
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:18,680
sheltered by the giant trees they lived free from danger

57
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:27,000
then a new king came into power over the land and above all things this King loved

58
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,819
hunting as soon as the sun rose he would Mount his horse and Lead his men on a furious

59
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:38,819
Chase through fields and meadows forests and glands

60
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:44,819
shooting his arrows madly he would not leave off until the sun had set

61
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:52,680
then the wagons rolled back to the Palace behind him filled now with deer or rabbit

62
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,620
pheasant monkey leopard bear tiger and

63
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,560
lion and the King was happy

64
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:10,680
his people however were not pleased Fields had been ruined by the Royal hunt

65
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:17,100
Farmers and Merchants have been forced to leave off their work in order to beat the jungles and drive the hidden beasts

66
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:24,918
towards the waiting King and his men Affairs of State too left unattended

67
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:32,039
people determined to bring all this to an end devised The Simple Plan

68
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:38,340
they built a stockade deep in the forest will trap a herd or two of deer in this

69
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:46,620
Stockade they said then the king can hunt all he wants let him hunt to his heart's content

70
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:54,620
we won't ruin our fields or Force us to leave our shops then let him be happy

71
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:01,680
Stockade was built and two herds of deer were driven within its walls

72
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,259
the gates were closed and the delicate animals charging and wielding in frantic

73
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:12,660
circles sought some way out but there was none

74
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:19,340
exhausted at last they stood trembling awaiting their fate

75
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,400
the men left happily to tell the king of their success

76
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:37,500
one of the herds that had been captured was the herd of the Banyan deer the Banyan deer walked among his herd

77
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:44,399
sunlight played on his many branched antlers his black eyes Shone and his muzzle was

78
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:52,140
wet the blue sky is overhead Green Grass Grows at our feet he told

79
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:59,160
the others do not give up where there is life there is hope

80
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:07,220
I will find a way and so he strove to ease their fears

81
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:14,339
soon the king arrived to view the newly captured herds he was pleased

82
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:23,640
he strung his Barrel bow in preparation for the hunt noticing two deer Kings below he said

83
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:32,220
the leaders of both herds are magnificent animals no one is to shoot them they shall be spared

84
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:37,800
then standing on the wall looking down over The Stockade

85
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:46,080
he sent his arrows flying into the Milling herds the deer became frantic racing wildly

86
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:53,480
they injured one another with horns and Hooves as they sought to escape the deadly reign of arrows

87
00:09:55,260 --> 00:10:01,920
and so it went every few days the king and his courtiers would return to The Stockade

88
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:08,880
and every few days more of the gentle deer were killed many others were wounded by the flying

89
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:15,019
arrows still others were injured in the effort to escape

90
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,660
the king of the Banyan deer met with the leader of the other herd

91
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:27,300
brother he said shaking his antlered head sadly we are trapped

92
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:34,080
I've tried every way but all are barred against us the pain our subjects suffer is

93
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:39,720
unbearable as you know when the Arrows fly many get

94
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:45,899
badly hurt just trying to stay alive let us hold a lottery

95
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:51,120
each day all the deer One Day from your herd one day for mine

96
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,519
must pick a straw then the one single deer on whom the

97
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:02,180
lottery Falls will go stand near the wall just below the king

98
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:09,959
that one deer must offer itself to be shot it is a terrible solution

99
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:16,040
but at least this way we can keep many from needless injury and pain

100
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,839
and the leader of the other herd agreed

101
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:31,680
the next day when the King and his courtiers arrived they found one trembling deer standing

102
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:40,200
directly below them its legs and body were shaking but it held its head high

103
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:46,440
what is this said the king ah I see these are Noble Deer indeed

104
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:54,060
they have chosen the one deer alone shall die rather than that they should all suffer from our hunt

105
00:11:54,060 --> 00:12:00,839
these deer Kings have wisdom a heaviness descended on the king's

106
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:08,279
heart we will accept their terms he announced from now on shoot only the one deer that

107
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:13,680
stands below and unstringing his bow he descended

108
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:20,660
from The Stockade wall and rode back in silence to the palace

109
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:29,779
that night the king tossed and turned a radiant deer pacing through his dreams

110
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:37,140
one day the lot fell on a pregnant Doe she went to her King the leader of the

111
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:42,360
other herd and said I will willingly go and fulfill the

112
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:50,040
lottery once my fawn is safely born but if I go now both I and my unborn

113
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:55,079
child will die please spare me for now

114
00:12:55,079 --> 00:13:01,399
I do not ask for myself but for the sake of the child that is soon to be born

115
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:10,260
but the leader of the other herd said the law is the law I cannot spare you

116
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:16,139
the lottery has fallen on you and you must die there are no exceptions Justice

117
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:19,519
demands that you go

118
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,839
in desperation she ran to the Banyan deer she fell on her knees before him and

119
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:33,480
begged for his Aid he listened quietly observed her with

120
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:41,700
wide and gentle eyes rise sister said the Banyan deer and go

121
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:48,300
free you are right the terms of the lottery require that

122
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:55,200
only one need to die therefore you shall be freed from the lottery until your Fawn is born

123
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:02,779
I will see that it is done too Overjoyed for Words The Grateful

124
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:07,579
bowed and then bounded away

125
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:14,459
the Banyan deer Rose to his feet there was no other he could send in her

126
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:19,800
place he had spared her therefore he himself

127
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:25,160
must replace her how could it be otherwise

128
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:33,620
he walked calmly with great dignity through his browsing herd

129
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:41,040
they watched him as she moved as he moved among them his great curving antlers and strong

130
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,139
shoulders his shining eyes and sharp black hooves

131
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:52,980
all reassured and comforted them never had their Banyan dear King let

132
00:14:52,980 --> 00:15:00,540
them down never had he abandoned them if there was a way he could find it

133
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:08,220
if there was a chance to save another he would take it not once had he lorded it over them

134
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:14,779
he was a king indeed and his whole herd took comfort in his presence

135
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:25,380
the courtiers were waiting with bows drawn Atop The Stockade when they saw it was the king dear King

136
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:31,019
who had come to stand below they called out O King of the banion deer

137
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:36,740

140
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:55,620
but lowering their bows they sent a message to the king

141
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:00,860
your majesty come with all speeds at The Stockade

142
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:08,100
not long after the king arrived riding like the wind with his robe streaming

143
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:15,440
behind him what is it he called why have you summoned me

144
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:20,839

145
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:28,560

146
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:35,699
one another Banyan King said the dear At Last I know

149

people suffer today a doe with fawn asked for my Aid

151
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:10,380
the lottery had fallen on her and both she and her unborn Fawn were to die

152
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:16,678
the lottery requires that only one shall die I shall be that one I shall take her

153
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:25,938
place the lottery shall be fulfilled this is my right and my duty as king

154
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:33,020
a stone rolled from the king's heart

155
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:41,520
Noble Banyan dear he said you're right a king should care for the least of his

156
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:47,160
subjects it is a lesson I have been long in the learning but today through your

157
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:54,360
sacrifice you have made it clear to me so I shall give you a gift a teacher's

158
00:17:54,360 --> 00:18:00,419
fee for the lesson you have taught me you and your whole herd are freed

159
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:07,220
none of you shall be hunted again go and live in peace

160
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:16,860
but the Banyan deer said great king that is indeed a Noble gift

161
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:21,740
but I cannot leave yet may I speak further

162
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,640
speak on Noble dear

163
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:34,080
O King of men if I depart to safe if I depart to safety with my own herd will

164
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,120
that not mean that the remaining herd shall simply suffer all the more

165
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,520
each day you shall kill only them they will have no respite

166
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:50,220
A Reign of arrows will fall upon them well I desire

167
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:56,760
Above All Things the safety of my people I cannot buy it at the cost of

168
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:02,419
increasing the suffering of others do you understand

169
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:13,020
the human King was stunned what he exclaimed would you then risk

170
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:17,840
your own and your herds freedom for others

171
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:25,080
yes said the Banyan deer I would I will

172
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:30,480
think of their anguish great king imagine their sufferings and then let

173
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,740
them two go free

174
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:45,000
the king of men paused and he pondered at last he lifted his head and smiled

175
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,620
never had I seen such nobility or such Resolute concern

176
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:58,140
how can I refuse you you shall have your wish

177
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:04,620
the other herd Too Shall go free now can you go off with your own herd

178
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,520
and be at peace

179
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:15,179
but the Banyan deer answered no great king I cannot

180
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:22,620
I think of all the other wild forefooted creatures like them I have lived my life

181
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:27,780
surrounded by dangers and fears how could I live in peace knowing the

182
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:36,139
Terrors they must endure I beg you mighty king have pity on them

183
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:41,419
there can be no peace unless they too are free

184
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:49,679
the king of men was again astonished he had never imagined such a thing

185
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:57,900
he thought and thought and slowly the truth of the Banyan deer's words grew clear to him

186
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:03,559
it was true he realized there's no real peace unless it benefits

187
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:07,159
extend to all

188
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:17,160
you are right great dear said the king of men at last never again in all my realm shall any

189
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:22,679
four-footed creatures be slain they are all freed for my hunt

190
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:29,760
rabbit bore bear lion leopard tiger deer

191
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:36,539
all never again shall they fall to my huntsman's arrows

192
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:41,658
so my teacher have you now found peace

193
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:48,559
but the banion deer said no great king I have not

194
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:55,919
what my lord of the defenseless ones of the air the birds great king lives surrounded by

195
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:03,000
a net of danger stones and arrows shall greet them now wherever they fly they shall fall from

196
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,580
the skies like a rain throughout your kingdom they shall know such suffering as can

197
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:14,159
hardly Be Imagined oh great king I beg you

198
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:19,520
let them go free release them also

199
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:27,419
great ones said the king of men you drive a hard bargain and are determined

200
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:33,780
it seems to make farmers of us all but yes I shall free the birds

201
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:40,620
they may now fly freely through my Realm no man shall hunt them again

202
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:48,480
then may they build their nests in peace now are you satisfied are you at last at

203
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:55,260
peace great king answered the Banyan deer

204
00:22:55,260 --> 00:23:00,900
think if you will of The Silent Ones of your Realm fish my Lord

205
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:08,880
if I do not speak if I do not now speak for them who will they swim the lakes rivers and streams

206
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:15,419
of your land hooks Nets and Spears will there be ever poised above them

207
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:20,539
how can I have peace while they abide in such Danger

208
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,179
great king I beg you spare them as well

209
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:34,620
Noble beings of the king of men tears trickling down his cheeks

210
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:43,260
compassionate one never before have I been moved to think in such a way but yes I do so agree

211
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:49,200
the fish too are of my kingdom and they too shall be free

212
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,580
they shall swim throughout my land and no one shall kill them again

213
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:03,480
now all of you assembled courtiers and attendance announced the king hear my

214
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:09,600
words this is my Proclamation see that it is posted throughout the

215
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:15,780
land from this day forth all beings in my realm shall be

216
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:24,179
recognized as my own dear subjects None Shall be trapped hunted or killed

217
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:31,280
this is my lasting decree see to it that it is fulfilled

218
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:38,039
now tell me Noble one he said turning to the Banyan deer once more are you at

219
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:45,720
peace flocks of birds flew overhead and perched singing from amongst the nearby

220
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:51,679
trees dear grazed calmly on the green grass

221
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:59,520
yes said the Banyan deer now I am at peace and he leapt up kicking like a fawn

222
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:05,940
he leapt for Joy cheer Joy he had saved them all

223
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:13,759
then he thanked the king and gathered his herd departed with them back into the depths of the forest

224
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:19,799
the king had a stone pillar set on the spot where he had spoken with the Banyan deer

225
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:25,740
carved upon it was the figure of a deer encircled with these words

226
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:32,039
homaged the noble Banyan deer compassionate teacher of Kings

227
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:38,000
then he too lived on caring wisely for all things

228
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,720
so that's the story of the Banyan deer

229
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,860
and it said that in this story The Banyan deer was

230
00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:02,600
the Buddha in a previous life when I first heard this story

231
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:11,179
it ended with the line never stopped caring

232
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:18,840
and when I heard that uh you know I I had sort of a mixed reaction

233
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:24,419
I loved the story I loved the compassion that it showed

234
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:31,320
and I thought does this mean I have to be compassionate all the time

235
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:38,120
it was a little it was a little bit daunting when I heard the story um

236
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:47,760
so I'm curious to hear how this story landed with you all what questions you

237
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,720
might have what comments what reactions

238
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:56,179
um

239
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:05,820
did you learn from the Banyan deer did you learn from the King

240
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:12,140
uh what was that like

241
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:20,460
and in the spirit of this story I won't limit it to just the people sitting in this room but if somebody

242
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:28,080
that's on on YouTube would like to uh participate as well you can enter your

243
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:33,960
comments and I'll ask bhupal to read them when we get to them

244
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:39,960
um but for now I

245
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:46,320
encourage you all to um step forward yeah so could you give the

246
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,100
microphone to Abraham

247
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:05,760
yeah thanks I was having trouble with the sound system I didn't hear all of it but I

248
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,279
think I heard enough but you also asked a couple of questions right there um

249
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:16,679
that I learned from the deer I think you described dear the story describes the

250
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:22,140
deer as walking very resolutely

251
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:30,179
with a lot of calm and dignity knowing what the situation was

252
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:35,299
and I think that in itself points to the practice

253
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:42,840
freeing oneself from from the pain and anguish

254
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:50,900
not freeing the pain and anguish is there but knowing what what is going to do

255
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:58,980
resolutely is a freeing kind of a freeing from excessive worry

256
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:04,200
but then to your question um

257
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:10,260
or your statement how does one that's a very daunting task how does one

258
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:16,200
embody that much compassion and it is it's a story and it's pointing

259
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:26,000
towards compassion but for me I take it more I think and maybe the five uh five

260
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:32,460
oh no I can't even think you know ah the trainings

261
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:38,340
not to take life not to harm anyone not

262
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:45,240
to steal not to lie not to abuse oneself sexually or others

263
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:54,000
and not to use intoxicants but the word is training there's no Perfection required

264
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:01,799
it's training so we fall we fail uh but the training is still to be all

265
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:09,799
compassionate I think that's how I see it great thank you

266
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:23,820
thank you I think the thing that came to mind when I heard the story was probably

267
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:29,039
the term or thought of leadership this is probably what you would want your

268
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:34,679
leader to to sort of embody um just sort of we all come from the

269
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:40,919
same drinking well or whatnot but I thought it was kind of um admirable rare

270
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:46,740
for the Banyan deer leader or King to sort of put himself at the same level as

271
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:53,039
the rest of his tribe and I think of kind of our political landscape and how there's a lot of tribalism and Division

272
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:59,100
and stuff like that but uh it was nice to nice to hear and get that sort of

273
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,460
symbolism

274
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:09,380
yeah now when I first heard it I you know I kind of thought

275
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:17,520
okay well the Banyan deer he's got a free pass he's not going to

276
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:22,620
get killed you know so you know that's pretty good

277
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:27,779
but then he wants his whole herd and then he wants the other herd as well

278
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:36,120
I mean it just you know it just keeps going that it isn't sort of like okay this is a good enough deal you know I've

279
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:41,880
I've struck a deal and this is good enough you know he's just always looking for

280
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,700
um more inclusivity

281
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:54,480
when I was read this story I was told that apparently in some versions that it goes on a

282
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:01,140
little bit further which is after all these animals are no longer going to be killed or harmed

283
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:07,980
they start destroying the fields you know they start going through the farmers fields and eating and everything

284
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:14,340
else and so the Village People Come Back To The King to the human King and say

285
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:21,179
well you know look at this you know this is this is not good and so there's a further deal that's made with the

286
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:28,860
animals that they can graze and eat anywhere in the forest and uncultivated

287
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:36,659
land but they're to leave the cultivated land alone so it it isn't you know it isn't just

288
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:43,700
the animals getting uh free but you know them also respecting

289
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:50,220
the villagers so it you know there's there's never an

290
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:57,299
end to it you know like every every action has some something to it so you know that

291
00:32:57,299 --> 00:33:03,380
continuation of thinking and caring for other people

292
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:09,679
is is one of the lessons I get from this story

293
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:41,880
are there any comments online no okay

294
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,080
oh Sally

295
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:56,279
so I I was actually wondering when the deer was going to ask the king

296
00:33:56,279 --> 00:34:05,000
to not kill humans to not go to war oh with his own kind

297
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:17,878
well there's about 550 of these jadaka Tales so that may be left for

298
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:23,820
another another story yeah but I thought that would be the you

299
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:29,220
know maybe the the capping request right yeah yeah

300
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:35,040
anyway yeah there was another part that I

301
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:40,440
noticed was the way in which the king went from taking great pleasure in

302
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:46,378
hunting to took

303
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:51,658
to still letting his uh subordinates

304
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:57,240
hunt for meat but that he he no longer took any

305
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:02,820
pleasure in it you know like it was like he didn't he didn't go there anymore and so that

306
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:08,700
kind of waking up to you know some something that we might

307
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:18,319
find personally pleasurable but actually is doing harm to others that that was falling away

308
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,420
and

309
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:32,180
and to build on that uh I I think

310
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:42,839
and to build on that um there was a falling away of his pleasure

311
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:48,599
and there was a developing of a reflective mode that dream comes to him

312
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:56,160
and the dream is powerful for him so there's a a whole direction towards

313
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:02,579
self-discovery and I think your point about

314
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:10,079
um you know when does he tell humans not to uh hunt each other

315
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:16,980
and of course that wasn't set up to begin with in this story it was only set up for the animals but I think

316
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:23,220
in a way that's kind of hinted at I don't want to apologize but I think it's

317
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:29,099
kind of hinted at by the deer starting to include more and

318
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:37,260
more types of beings in other words it's the Brahma maharas in the end it's all beings may all beings be free

319
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:44,180
from suffering yeah very good

320
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:54,660
the thing that that hit me you were talking earlier or someone was about the political divisions that we live in

321
00:36:54,660 --> 00:37:00,240
right now and the tribalism and stuff and that very first step that he made of

322
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:08,040
well no it's not just my clan of deers but I want that other one over there and

323
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:14,579
even the choice of giving himself instead of the other clans or herds

324
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:24,060
female with the baby you know he was Thinking Beyond his own small group right there is a lesson

325
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:32,300
to look Beyond even though they they're still dear but they're not my dear it was no I'm going to go there

326
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,859
yet no very stupid oh

327
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:52,980
yes I I follow on that very much the sacrifice of each individual animal

328
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:58,200
each day going to the slaughter spot

329
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:04,619
and then the king willing to sacrifice himself the the message of

330
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:11,640
being willing to care for your community enough to sacrifice for your community

331
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:16,859
to me it was a very strong teaching here

332
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:23,280
and that that's care for your community to care for those around you is is a key

333
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:30,440
piece of wisdom here thank you

334
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:39,859
yeah I think one of the the things that um

335
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:48,060
I guess I hadn't I hadn't thought about it until I I've read this over a couple of times recently

336
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:53,420
um for some reason I I was thinking that

337
00:38:54,359 --> 00:39:00,780
if the Banyan deer was the Buddha to be that this would be a lesson about him

338
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:07,380
learning something but actually it's more about him teaching demonstrating and teaching some

339
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:11,240
qualities to others

340
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:21,420
you know that sense of Radiance you know that the other deer and the and the human

341
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:26,720
King could just look at him and see that there was something

342
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:33,859
some something about him that was admirable

343
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:59,940
well maybe that's uh that's it for this evening thank you all

344
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:06,020
for coming and sharing um

345
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:17,660
and I think that Diane will be back next week thank you all

346
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:21,440
