1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,399
so a warm hello from redwood city here at

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:13,599
the imc and um welcome to our morning meditation

3
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:20,320
here and other times around the world and thank you for the

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,519
people who are greeting on chat it's lovely to see your names

5
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:32,320
and see your location and and to receive the greetings

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,440
when i was practicing in burma i practiced with a teacher named upandita

7
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,280
and his series of his talks were translated and published in english

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:56,000
with a book titled the state of mind called beautiful

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,280
a state of mind called beautiful and of course we can be in many

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:07,520
different states of mind but the idea that we can also have a state of mind that's beautiful

11
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:14,240
i think is quite inspiring and in fact this is what this anapanasati

12
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:22,720
is working towards and buddhist practice in general is for us to discover

13
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:30,320
or cultivate a state of mind which is quite luminous beautiful

14
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:37,119
inspiring in and of itself and one of the i've been fortunate to

15
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:43,600
see many beautiful places in the world and inspiring sunsets over the sea

16
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:51,600
and all kinds of things and the thing that i've that seems that i

17
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:58,240
for me has been the most beautiful thing to see is the beautiful mind and

18
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,280
why that's incomparable with the beauty of nature or beauty

19
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,920
other kinds of beauty i can't quite explain but maybe because it's uh so subjective

20
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,040
or so intimate while the same time as not being personal

21
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:22,000
something quite wondrous and uh so with the ninth step of

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,560
anapanasati the direction is to experience the mind

23
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:35,680
and so it's shifting from what it's kind of

24
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,720
like shifting from what to how and if i really want something if

25
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,319
i go to the supermarket and i really need something quickly

26
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:52,239
maybe we're having a big family dinner and everything's dependent

27
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:58,400
upon getting you know having salt and there's no salt at home and so

28
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,840
everything's gonna we need to get salt so i'm sent to the store to get salt and

29
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,319
i've never bought salt in the store i bought many things but somehow i can't remember ever having bought salt

30
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:18,000
and but i'm in a hurry and guests are coming and and and so all i'm focused on

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,040
is getting the salt and i'm searching the aisles searching the

32
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,720
names of things on the aisles to see where they have the salt and and i don't notice anything else in the

33
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:35,519
store but looking for the salt and and then when i finally get the salt i just focus on getting to the checkout

34
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,920
counter and the shortest line and my mind is completely consumed

35
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,040
with the thing that i want and nothing i don't really notice too

36
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:56,159
much anything else because it's so important to get that salt so it's all about the what the mind has

37
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:05,120
and um but maybe the end of the day if all this busyness of something i sit down and then i realize

38
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,959
how i am and i realize that i'm tired and maybe tense from searching for

39
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:17,040
salt and and the residue is still in me and all that and so i can feel a little bit how

40
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,240
i am but the initial how i am has to do with why i feel kind of

41
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:29,440
tight in my shoulders and my belly i'm weary in my face and and i feel a little bit discouraged

42
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:36,639
that i should pitch a big thing that got caught up in salt and so it's still about a what even i'm

43
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:44,160
feeling conventionally how i am but as i settle in and step back i notice something

44
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:51,759
that's very different and then as i notice how i am how the mind is

45
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:58,320
how the mind is that's processing all this how the mind is that knows

46
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,800
how the mind is as it knows searching for salt how the mind is when it knows how it

47
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:12,000
knows i'm tired and weary how the mind is and it's kind of like

48
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,840
the mind is the container or the reference point for receiving experience

49
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,919
and it's the state of mind it's not a thing but it's still a state that we can

50
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,280
feel and uh and that is when we that's where

51
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:39,120
the beauty begins to show itself and something very special about that shift to the how rather than the what's

52
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,440
of our experience the the how which is the how we're aware

53
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,880
how the mind is as it operates

54
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:58,240
so with that we'll do a meditation and we'll maybe at some point shift me

55
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:06,000
more to this how and so taking

56
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,759
a assuming a meditative posture

57
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,800
and of course how you are can begin right away how are you in this body

58
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,319
how are you in your posture

59
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:35,039
and to answer that question there is the mind is involved in a what

60
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,039
the particular sensations of the body

61
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:49,840
the position of the body

62
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,000
and then how is your breathing

63
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:04,800
and how are you with noticing your breathing

64
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:12,080
do you have a reaction to how you're breathing a response

65
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:22,159
is there a for and against something or wishing it to be different or want to make it different

66
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:32,160
what happens if you simply just know you're breathing know how you're

67
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,639
breathing

68
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,840
closing your eyes

69
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:54,720
and if it makes sense go inward into your body and feel the places where there might be

70
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,840
tension and holding

71
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:13,840
perhaps you can relax the shoulders release the shoulders

72
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:27,840
relax release the belly

73
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:38,080
if there's some way to relax or adjust your hands so they're more relaxed

74
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,440
release your hands adjust your hands so

75
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:55,839
there's no tightness in your hands

76
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,320
and is there can there be a softening in the face

77
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,920
in the easing up of all that we hold in the face

78
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,800
around the eyes and the forehead the

79
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:26,720
cheeks perhaps imagining there's lots of space

80
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,360
in front of the face behind the face

81
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,079
for the muscles of the face to release to relax

82
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:50,160
for the face to rest

83
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,800
then how's your mental activity

84
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:07,360
do you feel is there a lot of energy and thinking or

85
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,600
is the mind sluggish

86
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,200
is there any tension pressure

87
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:33,839
and if there is tension or pressure can you release the mind

88
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,720
release relax the thinking mind

89
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:47,839
quieting your thinking

90
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:28,160
and how is your mind what how is it what's your mental state

91
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:42,959
or the state of your heart heart mind

92
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:51,200
which is very closely related to how is your how are you aware

93
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,839
how are you receiving experience

94
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:26,000
oftentimes what the mind is focused on is the objects of our desires

95
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:34,320
objects of our aversions or the vague

96
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,839
kind of objects of our confusions

97
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:57,759
can you feel the part of the mind that is free of desire

98
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,120
that is not leaning forward or stretching forward

99
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:12,639
focused on having or getting or the mind that's free of desire

100
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:22,959
maybe it's a back corner of the mind or a deeper layer of the mind

101
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,200
or something at the center

102
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:39,600
maybe it's something that doesn't have a lot of distinguishing characteristics

103
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:49,839
a feeling of absence

104
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:03,839
is there a part of the mind which is free of aversion

105
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:13,279
part of the mind is not about something not focusing on

106
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,839
something that's not liked

107
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:29,600
a place where there is no aversion and because of that maybe the mind is

108
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,639
not so concerned with what

109
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:45,839
a place where the mind can rest in a peaceful place

110
00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:00,800
and can you become aware of a place where the there is no confusion

111
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:11,760
even if there is confusion as well someplace where there is no confusion

112
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,959
because the mind is not

113
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:24,240
focused fixated on a subject something it wants doesn't want

114
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,839
something is trying to understand

115
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:41,839
the part of the mind that can be at rest with itself

116
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:09,839
and then becoming aware now of your overall state of mind

117
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:17,120
the state of mind within which everything you know is known

118
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,639
but a state which is always more than what is known

119
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,759
so it's not something that we know as much as something we feel

120
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:37,839
a wide open expansive

121
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:51,839
feeling of the state of mind

122
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:01,360
and so that you don't get too involved in this state of mind looking for it

123
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,839
wanting it

124
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:15,199
fixating on it as you feel your state of mind

125
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:21,199
also be aware of yourself breathing in and breathing out

126
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:30,840
maybe as if breathing in and out you're breathing through the state of

127
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:37,919
mind we're breathing at the very center of the state of mind

128
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:47,840
with a state of mind so wide and broad that it includes breathing within it

129
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,039
breathing in experiencing the mind

130
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:01,840
breathing out experiencing the mind

131
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,200
and perhaps as you shift

132
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,960
from focusing on what you're thinking about

133
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:56,240
to experiencing the mind experiencing being aware

134
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,480
that this mind this maybe this awareness

135
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:09,200
maybe begins to have no sharp boundaries no edges

136
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:21,120
somehow it's related to the spaciousness around

137
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:28,639
to space not the same but

138
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:38,480
it has qualities of clarity like space or spaciousness like space

139
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:49,840
perhaps stillness like space around you

140
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:59,039
breathing in experiencing this

141
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:17,840
the mind breathing out experiencing the mind

142
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:53,200
as you exhale letting go of all the things you're thinking about

143
00:23:53,200 --> 00:24:04,640
all the what's of life all the objects of thought

144
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:10,640
and then on the inhale experience

145
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:19,840
your overall state of mind

146
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:29,279
through a role state within which thinking occurs

147
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:35,679
but as a state that's broader than our thoughts and ideas the what's

148
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:46,240
exhaling letting go whatever you're thinking all the what's

149
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,600
inhaling and feeling the

150
00:24:52,880 --> 00:25:00,080
broadness the peacefulness

151
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:15,840
of the state of mind that contains all things within it

152
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:29,840
like a room contains all things within the room

153
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:37,440
and then as we come to the end of this sitting bring to mind some person who

154
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:43,440
you have an uncomplicated relatively uncomplicated relationship

155
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:50,320
and bring them to mind so there's some image of them or sense of them

156
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:58,159
idea of them but rather than your thoughts and

157
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:05,840
memories and desires concerns about about the person

158
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,480
allow the person to just to sense the idea the image of the person whatever

159
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:18,320
sense you have to just rest

160
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:27,200
in the openness of mind within this general state of how you

161
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:35,679
are there's nothing you have to do about the

162
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:41,200
person but just let them be

163
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:48,720
included in your state of mind through your image your idea your sense of them

164
00:28:52,880 --> 00:29:01,520
so you're not actively relating to them rather just being with them

165
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:13,840
in your mind with your mind

166
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:22,399
if we're relating to them with our desires and our concerns then we're involved with what

167
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:32,480
but if we just allow them to be included in the how we are resting there

168
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,399
not actively relating or wanting or not wanting

169
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:55,840
just allowing the person to be in the peacefulness of the state of mind

170
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:13,919
and now maybe you can with some tenderness or care

171
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:22,000
can you now evoke a mood of good will of kindness for

172
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,600
this person of generosity

173
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:37,440
maybe wishing them well is almost too much

174
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,960
but imagining them well

175
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:52,880
feeling the goodness of their well-being

176
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:07,120
you know gently keeping them in your open spacious attention

177
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:14,960
now wish them well may you be happy

178
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,720
may you be safe

179
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:32,320
may you be peaceful

180
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:37,440
may you be

181
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,840
free

182
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:56,720
and is there some way that you can learn from how to

183
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,399
include someone in your state of mind in this kind of way

184
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:08,720
it is in fact a way to be close to your good will for

185
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:15,200
others rather than rushing into the whats and

186
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,559
the shoulds and the doings

187
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,039
as you meet people today in your life

188
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,960
take your time to let them be known

189
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:36,399
to receive and listen and sense them

190
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:43,360
in a generous state of mind

191
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:50,240
and then perhaps other things can happen and those other things might be related

192
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:56,000
to your good will may this practice of ours support

193
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,399
us to meet the people of the world with our good will

194
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:11,840
may all beings be happy

195
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,840
so

196
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:38,560
so i find that one of the inspiring topics in the teachings of the buddha

197
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:45,760
is the teachings around cheetah so ci tta which

198
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:52,560
is often translated in english as mind or sometimes it may be in context is also translated as

199
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:59,838
state of mind and maybe there's no difference between mind and state of mind

200
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:07,359
the mind here as i said yesterday is not a thing it's not like we can see the mind in

201
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:14,640
some clear like take a microscope in the brain and discover where the mind is the mind is

202
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:20,240
more of a gestalt it's more of a the sum total

203
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:27,839
of our mentality of how the mind works and so it's not a thing and so because

204
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:32,960
of that maybe because of that the buddha never

205
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:40,800
talks about letting go of the mind he talks about letting go of a form of

206
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:47,839
feelings of perceptions of mental activities and he also talks about letting go of

207
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:54,880
something that we've come to understand in the west as consciousness the pali word is vinyana

208
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:00,240
and it's possible that vinyana should not be translated as consciousness

209
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:06,560
there's a whole history of about maybe three four hundred years or so 300 years

210
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:13,280
maybe of the western use of the word consciousness it's kind of a coined in just you know

211
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:19,119
in relatively recent times and um but it's uh it's kind of entered

212
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:24,560
into our languages word consciousness and the idea of it probably in a deeper deeper way in the last

213
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:31,359
hundred years or so and we take it now as many of us as kind of second nature's obvious what it is

214
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:36,400
and and it's often held up in religious circles spiritual circles meditation

215
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:42,880
circles as something really ultimate and there's ideas of cosmic consciousness ultimate consciousness

216
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:50,640
different uh states of consciousness altered consciousness and so it gets really there's a lot of

217
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:57,040
it gets that word consciousness gets a lot of association a lot of power a lot of

218
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:03,119
projection a lot of a lot of expectations and hopes around this word

219
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:09,200
and and a lot of people will feel that somehow a broad state of consciousness is

220
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:14,320
somehow ultimate and really profound

221
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:19,760
and i certainly don't want to diminish the ultimate feeling of it the profundity of

222
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:25,680
of states of consciousness states of awareness but what's fascinating is that for the

223
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:32,400
buddha whatever that is if it's vinyana this word that he we

224
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:39,440
translate his consciousness he says let go of that let go of that and um and sometimes he even treats it

225
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:46,160
as a kind of a problem clearly it's problematic this vinyana is what we translate as consciousness

226
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:51,760
and um and but he never says that about chitta

227
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:58,320
about mind maybe mind should be translated as consciousness but consciousness also has a sense in

228
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:04,240
english of something that knows and the state of mind i'm not sure exactly if it's

229
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:11,119
something that knows but it's a broad a tone or mood or

230
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:18,320
feeling or sense of the mind and sometimes that state of mind can feel fragile it can feel sluggish it

231
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:25,280
could feel agitated contracted and certainly sometimes the state of mind

232
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:30,880
doesn't feel good and in fact some of the some of the sufferings the dukkha

233
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:38,079
that this buddhist practice is meant to alleviate is experienced as kind of a vice-like

234
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:44,400
experience of the mind or the heart where it's really tight irritated

235
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:51,119
mind is like rough sandpaper perhaps or um you know the mind you know just feels

236
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:57,359
just so miserable in our minds oppressed by it so sometimes the mind

237
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:06,079
can feel that way but the mind can also feel the opposite of that we experienced and the word cheetah

238
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:13,359
is a very fascinating word that this is what used to to translate as mind because the word

239
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:20,960
has many other meanings or homonyms same sounding words word we would spell

240
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:26,480
the same way and but the dictionary for cheetah also

241
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:34,880
has the word for brightness as a definition for cheetah also wondrous or wonderful

242
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:41,280
and so there's maybe a little kind of idea that the mind is something really

243
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,800
not exactly in itself but has is related to something wondrous and bright

244
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:52,560
sometimes the mind is called a luminous in buddhism teachings of the buddha or

245
00:39:52,560 --> 00:40:00,000
clear or clean the mind it becomes clean and not that the mind is inherently any

246
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,079
of these things because the mind is not a thing that can be inherent to anything

247
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:13,200
maybe it's a little bit more like a hologram or you know or yeah

248
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:18,880
something that doesn't quite exist by itself and you could put your hand right

249
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:24,160
through the mind if you ever see it it's not quite not there but it's um

250
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:31,680
it's still a mood a feeling a sense that is can be very powerful

251
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:38,240
very significant for us and so significant that as i said often

252
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:43,760
when the mind is suffering it's really oppressive when the mind is happy or peaceful or

253
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:50,560
clear the mind feels quite wondrous quite bright and open

254
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:56,960
so um so the uh and much of the buddhist

255
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:04,880
path of practice is real is is done in terms of the mind

256
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:11,119
and that's uh sometimes it's done so instead of personal terms instead of saying i'm

257
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:17,760
training myself uh it's we're training the mind we're

258
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,440
developing the mind and we're liberating the mind and this is i find fascinating that

259
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,480
plenty of times the buddha doesn't say that a person gets liberated

260
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:34,000
rather the mind gets liberated and some of you might find a little bit

261
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:41,839
uh disappointing that find out that you will never get liberated and um that's not the name of the game

262
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:49,280
um but your mind will get liberated and at your job whatever you are whatever the you is a job is to help

263
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:55,599
the mind experience liberation to be free to bring it to some kind of beauty

264
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:01,440
and this this idea that the mind has the potential for beauty for luminosity for brightness for

265
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:08,800
cleanliness i find phenomenally inspiring and and but also that my other things

266
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:14,560
even more inspiring is that the mind is not a thing because it's not a thing

267
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:21,040
it's malleable it's shapeable it uh it's uh we're never stuck with our mind

268
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:26,160
might be stuck with our brain and um in whatever way the brain works

269
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:33,119
but to the mind we're not stuck with the mind it's uh it's the it's kind of the field

270
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:39,040
within which our practice uh has its effect its influence

271
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:45,119
that as we develop as we develop more concentration more mindfulness more letting go more

272
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,720
equanimity more wisdom more strength in the practice

273
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:58,880
in the mind that the mind begins to um to um whatever then

274
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:05,440
we call the mind say the mind is starts to have a wondrous feeling wonderful sense that we

275
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:11,680
can experience and and one of the things i also find

276
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:19,920
wonderful about this word cheetah the way it seems to be used in the suttas is that it's very personal the

277
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:25,200
experience of it so don't go looking at a buddhist text or listening to a buddhist teacher like

278
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:30,800
myself for a definitive definition or exp or

279
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:36,560
description of what how the mind is experienced and then try to make sure that you have that

280
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:42,400
experience too or feel bad because you don't have it the way it's described um

281
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:49,359
you're the your mind you are shaping your mind your the this this thing that's being

282
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:56,960
constantly morphed and changed and shifted that's something that's arising within you with all the cause and conditions of

283
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:02,720
how your inner life works and how your attention works and what you focus on

284
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:09,200
and what you're how you're thinking or conceiving it's a dynamic thing so it's very

285
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:14,319
personal so it's more discovery of how you experience it

286
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:20,800
then you have you don't be concerned about discovering what the right way to experience the mind is

287
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,920
or what the right mind is or how the mind is supposed to be

288
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:35,359
but you can as we feel the mind become aware of a mind that is has an ouch to it

289
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:41,599
and a mind that has an ah and this very technical terms in gil

290
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:48,160
language ouch and ah is meant to kind of give us lots of room to not get caught up in the

291
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:53,200
details and try to be right or wrong or it's a very simple thing ah that

292
00:44:53,200 --> 00:45:01,280
that's an ouch that the state of the mind doesn't feel good that's not doesn't that it's and now and or this feels good

293
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:06,560
and the direction of buddhist practice is in the direction of the ah

294
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:13,760
direction of the beautiful mind in whatever way that you define or experience or see beauty

295
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:23,599
luminous mind clear mind clean mind spacious mind peaceful mind

296
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:28,720
so it takes a while and i'm not still you don't have to kind

297
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:34,400
of be in a hurry to experience some of the wondrous ways the mind can be experienced

298
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:42,000
but as the anapanasati develops and as we become calmer and more settled going through the steps

299
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,359
especially after step eight where we're pivoting mental activity relaxes it means we're

300
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:53,760
not so fixated on the what's what we're thinking about and wanting and but we're beginning to rest back into

301
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:59,119
the into the easy chair of the mind we're resting back and just

302
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:05,760
allowing and feeling and sensing the overall state of the mind and

303
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,800
breathing with that breathing in experiencing the mind breathing out

304
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:23,920
experiencing the mind so thank you and we'll continue tomorrow
