1
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,160
so there has a

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,880
has been a strong tendency in the west i

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,840
think

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,840
to present the buddha's teachings in a

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,080
fairly rational way

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,400
and to emphasize the the

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,519
empirical nature of it and it's really

8
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,760
about seeing things as they are

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,519
in a direct way and and

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,800
in doing so sometimes we left behind

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,920
or go unnoticed the tremendous degree in

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,880
which the buddha

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,079
and the buddhist early buddhist

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,600
tradition is using its

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,640
using imagination using creativity of

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,878
images and ideas and imagination

17
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,320
to support the teachings but not just

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,440
the teachings

19
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,120
but to provide us with a uh

20
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,120
a different reference point for both the

21
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,800
teachings and the practice

22
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,880
than simply ideas rational ideas

23
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,320
logical ideas that

24
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,600
the buddha uses lots of similes

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,880
lots of poetry lots of images lots of

26
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,560
little stories

27
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,560
all of which touch into um

28
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,360
other dimensions of our inner life than

29
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,560
our rational cognitive understanding

30
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,159
and it touches into our emotional life

31
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,880
our kinesthetic life our

32
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,600
motivational life our that part of it

33
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,240
can be

34
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,600
inspired can be gladdened um

35
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,000
it uh ties into our memory and our

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,119
associations

37
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,079
and um so all these capacity and

38
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,680
thinking as well

39
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,479
all these different uh faculties that we

40
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,360
have

41
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,399
get touched get awakened get somehow

42
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,520
brought into into the field of

43
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,200
our dharma relationship with dharma

44
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,119
practice

45
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,880
and this contributes the sense of

46
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,560
unification

47
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,760
that is samadhi cultivating samadhi

48
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,440
developing samadhi is really an

49
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,400
important part

50
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,440
in fact the buddha said that to see

51
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,640
things as they are

52
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,599
cultivate samadhi and samadhi is

53
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,280
unification

54
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,360
and unification is the is the bringing

55
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,280
together of all our faculties

56
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,879
together in a kind of whole working

57
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,840
dynamic working of the whole to really

58
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,280
be in harmony that everything's in

59
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,879
harmony

60
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,239
so using the imagination

61
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,000
is a means to evoke that and elicit that

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,480
in support of the meditation practice or

63
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,519
support of this freedom

64
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,959
and um it is um

65
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,720
so it has to be done of course carefully

66
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,560
it can be overdone

67
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,560
and certainly people use their

68
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,400
imagination for all kinds of things

69
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,680
which are not

70
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,360
healthy or appropriate for dharma

71
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,680
practice to spend a lot of time in

72
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,040
fantasy

73
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,080
and having a feeling of uh you know

74
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,239
the delusions of grandeur of delusions

75
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,200
of

76
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,519
great pleasure or you know just kind of

77
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:16,959
you know kind of getting lost in the

78
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,920
pleasure of fantasies and imagination or

79
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,800
getting lost in the fantasies of

80
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,080
conflict and war

81
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,400
and that we have towards with other

82
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,120
people

83
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,599
all kinds of things you know goes you

84
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,280
know really takes us away from this

85
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,720
practice

86
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,200
and but the imagination that connects us

87
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,360
to it we have to get a feel for it does

88
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,959
it really connect does it really help us

89
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:39,440
be more

90
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,560
settled more present for experience and

91
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,560
it's using the imagination

92
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,080
to eventually go beyond the imagination

93
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,120
it's kind of a stepping stone and uh

94
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,959
and the kind of images that the buddha

95
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,400
seems to use

96
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,040
tend not to be stories or there's not

97
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,680
it's not whole

98
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,760
ongoing sagas that we're imagining

99
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,400
they tend to be very simple like that of

100
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,040
a

101
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,159
mountain or the earth or

102
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,200
a lake um

103
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,680
the um you know so it's not like a story

104
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,959
of things there's just kind of an

105
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,639
image and sometimes it's the dynamic

106
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,400
image like the image of an

107
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,199
underwater fountain from under a lake

108
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,320
the underwater

109
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,040
spring that's spreading spreading

110
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,440
goodness throughout the body

111
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,800
you know it's not a story it's just kind

112
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,680
of a dynamic image of what's happening

113
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,080
another image that i love i'll do this

114
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,280
tomorrow some of these but

115
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,759
so this integration process and as i

116
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,320
said before if

117
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,880
if we don't use our imagination it's all

118
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,280
too easy that our imagination gets

119
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,560
used by others we internalize the images

120
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,080
and imagination that

121
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,680
advertisements commercials politicians

122
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,880
other people um

123
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,880
make up and then we internalize them in

124
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,400
the way sometimes they're not beneficial

125
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,039
for us actually can be quite detrimental

126
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,320
um imagining all kinds of terrible

127
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,360
things that are happening the world that

128
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,479
that that just kind of spiral us down

129
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,000
and in a way that's not helpful

130
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,280
so it's not fantasy it's not to

131
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,960
avoid or deny what's going on

132
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,440
run away from life as it actually is

133
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,240
that

134
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,440
we use imagination and buddhism but

135
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,560
it's really but it's with care but

136
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,240
knowing how we do it so it really helps

137
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,880
us supports us to be present

138
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,560
if it doesn't help us to be present

139
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,320
there's no need to use it

140
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,560
and it isn't like you're better buddhist

141
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,400
if you use your imagination

142
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,720
but it is available to us support us to

143
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,960
get kind of more focused

144
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,360
and so

145
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:01,758
the one of the ways that the buddha

146
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,919
talks about developing gladness and

147
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,520
meditation

148
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,680
and gladness at least to joy joy that

149
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,000
leads to tranquility tranquility leads

150
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,120
to happiness

151
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,160
happiness that leads to samadhi

152
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,600
is uh to appreciate what's absent

153
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,120
as we sit and meditate and in the

154
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,520
the main the most common one thing that

155
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,479
the buddha

156
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,440
emphasizes is the absence of the

157
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,199
hindrances

158
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,600
so when people are meditators they are

159
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,280
often contending with

160
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,440
the hindrances the hindrance of desire

161
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,680
aversion

162
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,840
lethargy and resistance agitation and

163
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,759
regrets remorse

164
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,840
and doubt these can be very strong very

165
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,080
compelling

166
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,319
uh hooks in the mind to be caught up in

167
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,680
thinking about these and involved in

168
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,319
these

169
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,960
and we can get lost in desire fantasies

170
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,400
and aversion fantasies

171
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,440
and and you know caught up in resistance

172
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,479
and

173
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,520
and our regrets and anxieties

174
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,199
really kind of get lost in these

175
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,360
universes that these can create

176
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,120
for us and um

177
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,400
and so as we settle down in meditation

178
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
as we kind of start getting more focused

179
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,160
more relaxed more settled

180
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,919
and start letting go of the force of

181
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,440
preoccupation the

182
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,639
debate of all these kinds of thoughts

183
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,919
that take us away from the present

184
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:26,800
moment

185
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,560
and we're able to sit more a little bit

186
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,160
more and more here here

187
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,280
in the present moment there comes a time

188
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,599
when the hindrances have abated that

189
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,599
they're not so strong anymore

190
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,840
and it becomes relatively easy to stay

191
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,960
here

192
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,360
and the image i used the other day of a

193
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,479
bowl

194
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,800
large bowl maybe that's you know huge

195
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,840
maybe

196
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,080
a five foot diameter bowl that they have

197
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,720
in some kind of

198
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,520
children's museums and you put a marble

199
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,240
into the top

200
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,120
you drop a marble down the edge and that

201
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,919
marble will

202
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,039
move this way and that way and

203
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,879
until it momentum slows down and then

204
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,080
eventually it falls

205
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,680
through a hole at the bottom of the bowl

206
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,720
or rests at the bottom of the bowl

207
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,560
but if you put a lean into the bowl and

208
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,160
keep pushing the marble it keeps going

209
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,599
and going going

210
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,360
so to be caught in the hindrances is to

211
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,520
keep the marble spinning

212
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,560
but to uh to finally settle down

213
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,319
and let the marbles all settle at the

214
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,560
bottom of the bowl and rest

215
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,639
you can feel in meditation so good the

216
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,560
mind just hear

217
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,039
so at this at this point the buddha

218
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,000
talks about

219
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,440
having gladness that one is no longer

220
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:37,919
caught

221
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,080
no longer hijacked by the mind no longer

222
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,919
enslaved by the mind because the mind

223
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,519
just pulls us away and

224
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,440
has a mind of its own and we just pulled

225
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,600
along and we kind of lose a kind of

226
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,080
freedom

227
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,720
in the process and so to feel the

228
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,880
gladness be glad about this

229
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,920
and here is where the buddha uses

230
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,160
teaches this as an act of imagination an

231
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,680
act of in particular

232
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,000
word that he uses that's translating as

233
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,920
imagination here

234
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,440
can be a visualization

235
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,880
and it has the word seeing anupasana in

236
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,360
it

237
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,040
and it's some anupasana with seeing

238
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,120
but it's not seeing through the physical

239
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,640
eye but rather through

240
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,600
the mental eye of imagination and so he

241
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,279
gives five similes

242
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,120
for being free of um

243
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,560
of the hindrances to be really here the

244
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,320
other absence

245
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,440
and they are a person

246
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,640
in debt who has become free of debt

247
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,720
a person who's terribly sick who has

248
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,839
who is no longer sick a person who is in

249
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,839
prison

250
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,640
and bondage in prison so even not just

251
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,399
in prison but in bondage you know tied

252
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,720
down

253
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,000
who has become freed from prison a

254
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,079
person who is enslaved

255
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,000
who has become freed of slavery

256
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,079
and a person who has wandered in the

257
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,079
desert for a long time

258
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,320
dangerous desert who has come out to the

259
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,600
other side

260
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,480
and is no longer lost free of wandering

261
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,320
in the desert

262
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,440
and so it gives these five similes for

263
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,399
being free of the hindrances

264
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,880
and it is the reason for these similes

265
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,640
is to give a um a reference point

266
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,399
for something would be people would

267
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,680
celebrate just be so

268
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,720
happy you'd be so relieving so

269
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,880
uh joyful to be out of prison to be out

270
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,120
of sickness and all these things

271
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,320
unless we don't remember that we're

272
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,240
free of those things if we just like

273
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,920
we're free of prison we just go on to

274
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,720
the next

275
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,000
preoccupation and concern and but to

276
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,040
take time not just to keep going back to

277
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,399
the breath and back to the breath when

278
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,680
we're present

279
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,120
but take time to really appreciate

280
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,160
the goodness or the well-being or the

281
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,440
or the delight that being free of the

282
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,160
hindrances are being focused and present

283
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,640
so that the goodness of that becomes

284
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,480
spreads through the body or opens up

285
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,760
more widely or

286
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,880
brings a kind of a gladness that is part

287
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,279
of this integration process this

288
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,760
unification process that we're beginning

289
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,800
to not just

290
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,600
keep doing the laser focus of the mind

291
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,279
if we ever did it that way

292
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,880
and just kind of like staying focused

293
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,880
focused focused but there's a kind of a

294
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,680
mellowing and opening and settling

295
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,959
um experience of just softening here

296
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,000
that the gladness can give birth to and

297
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,240
as we allow this gladness to

298
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,200
this joy space for it we don't pump it

299
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,000
up strongly we

300
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,079
don't it's just kind of just natural

301
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,800
hopefully a natural kind of

302
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,040
joy or gladness that is available when

303
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,880
we take time to feel the goodness of

304
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,160
this

305
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,279
what's happening in meditation

306
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,399
then that is what allows the growth then

307
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,200
of joy

308
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,160
and happiness that's on the way to a

309
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,639
strong samadhi

310
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,839
so so

311
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,279
another talk on the use of imagination

312
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,480
and and it takes some wisdom to know

313
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,120
what kind of imagination when what to

314
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,639
use maybe when you first sit down

315
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,480
what to use when the hindrances have

316
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,639
abated but

317
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,040
and not to make a big project of it but

318
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,120
to note this available to us and it's

319
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,920
like a little

320
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,120
aid a little quiet support that

321
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,480
it is meant to support us

322
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,040
to to be inspired to stay in the present

323
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,000
moment

324
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
and to feel the goodness the well-being

325
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,839
that comes when we really settle down in

326
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,600
meditation

327
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,240
we're allowed to be present here and now

328
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,480
we're allowed to enjoy it

329
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,200
and and this is the stepping stone for

330
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,320
going deeper

331
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,920
and in some ways in a more powerful way

332
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,040
into this 16 steps of anapanasati which

333
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,880
we'll be coming to and but for now

334
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,279
i'm just trying trying to introduce you

335
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,240
to this territory of imagination

336
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,560
which uh can come into play when we

337
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,440
start feeling

338
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,680
settled in meditation that supports the

339
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,040
further settling

340
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,519
and uh and absorption in the very

341
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,839
practice we're doing

342
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,720
so thank you and i look forward to

343
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,199
[Music]

344
00:13:42,199 --> 00:13:45,199
tomorrow
