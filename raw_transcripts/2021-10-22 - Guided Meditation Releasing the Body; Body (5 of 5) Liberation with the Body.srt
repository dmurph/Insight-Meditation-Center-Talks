1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,838
so hello everyone and

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:16,720
here in northern california we greet you from a rainy place finally it rained

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,759
significantly last night still raining a little bit

4
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:30,800
so um one of the

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,280
great areas of discovery in doing buddhist practice

6
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:44,800
has to do with the family of actions families a family of things we

7
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,360
do or that happen that involve letting go

8
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,680
and today the topic is release and letting go

9
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,520
sometimes is not popular sometimes it's misunderstood and

10
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:11,439
in buddhism primarily the profound movement of release of letting go

11
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,799
is not letting go of anything that is real

12
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:24,479
but letting go of the ways that we cling to it so we're letting go of clinging and all

13
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,000
the different variations of it so we letting go of

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,079
the kind of resistance that is also a kind of a compulsion

15
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,840
and so when we say let go sometimes let go let go let go

16
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,600
we don't necessarily mean letting go of the thing but of the holding to the thing

17
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:54,560
so if we say let go of the body it's um it's more like the way that if you tend

18
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,920
it to a injured animal and then when you're ready

19
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,240
to release it into the wild there's natural habitat that you might say you let it go into

20
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,400
the natural habitat and rather than it being a loss

21
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:20,000
for the animal it's a gain it returns to its natural way and to release our body like you would

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,360
release a bird into the air to let go of the body

23
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,280
so the body becomes free and one of the really wonderful things

24
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,519
about this liberation of that's at the heart of buddhism

25
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:43,280
that in some very significant way maybe initially perplexing way

26
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,800
is we're letting go we're liberating not ourselves

27
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,879
but we're liberating everything else from ourselves

28
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:02,720
if it's all about personal liberation it actually misses the boat it misses the

29
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,800
you know it doesn't really it's not really the full freedom but to

30
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,080
let everything go let's set everything free

31
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:21,680
of our clinging or grasping or conceit or selfishness or self-involvement

32
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,840
and this so this can happen with the body too we let go of the body we release the body

33
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,040
we discover how to let the body be

34
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:40,080
without any clinging resistance tightening

35
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,200
pressure that we exert onto the body

36
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:53,439
so this sitting today we'll have to do we'll talk and i'll tell you probably use language like letting go

37
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:59,360
but hopefully with this introduction you appreciate that we're not letting go of the body

38
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,760
but rather we're setting it free from the ways that we interfere with it or

39
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,760
live in a more difficult way with it so

40
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:21,040
to support the freedom of the body so that it's not restricted anywhere or

41
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,360
collapsed anywhere it's helpful to take a posture

42
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,159
that is open

43
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,199
where everything is nothing is

44
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,440
collapsed or so usually if you're sitting in a chair

45
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,880
or cushion it's usually to sit with a spine straight enough so the chest is a little

46
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,919
bit open and maybe even the shoulders

47
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:05,120
have a little bit of a movement of not being pulled back but they kind of

48
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,840
allow them to allow them to move back

49
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,919
lowering your gaze and letting your gaze be soft and

50
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,919
relaxed

51
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,720
and that itself is a movement of letting go

52
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:39,080
the involvement with the eyes that distracted by the mind searching looking trying to see

53
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,280
and if it's comfortable for you you can gently close your eyes

54
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,800
and taking a few long slow deep breaths

55
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:19,120
and as you exhale to appreciate the letting go of the

56
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:27,439
it happens there the releasing of the breath the releasing of the

57
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:35,840
inhale the settling relaxing as you exhale

58
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,000
and letting your breathing return to normal

59
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:08,800
into take the opportunity with the exhale to relax further

60
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:16,280
to relax the muscles of the face

61
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:26,599
releasing any pressure that's exerted on the eyelids

62
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,360
any pressure exerted on the forehead

63
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:46,960
perhaps tightening in the jaw can be released maybe letting the

64
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:57,160
open the mouth a teeny bit to separate the teeth a tiny bit

65
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,560
and relaxing around the mouth

66
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:24,039
there's any pressure of the lips touching can you release the pressure

67
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,000
and on the exhale to soften the shoulders

68
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,760
release the shoulders

69
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,399
and to relax the belly softening the belly

70
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:56,519
on the exhale to relax the legs the thighs

71
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:12,399
and perhaps the arms and hands and fingers if you feel any pressure or tightness in

72
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:18,920
the fingers you might even slightly wiggle them

73
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:32,880
in all these steps of relaxation are movements of letting go of release

74
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:39,519
releasing the body from the influence of the mind

75
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:45,480
the holdings and clingings tightenings of the mind

76
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:57,800
settling into the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out

77
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,800
as you exhale relaxing the thinking mind

78
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:40,640
any pressure or tightening associated with thinking

79
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:49,920
letting the mind maybe the brain spread out wide like a surface of a wide

80
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,800
still like every exhale

81
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:04,440
surface becoming calmer the wave stiller

82
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,279
and for every exhale now letting go of your body

83
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:55,760
releasing your body the hold of the mind

84
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:01,120
any clinging grasping

85
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:10,800
any preoccupation with the body judgments

86
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:23,320
as you exhale let go release

87
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:58,199
release your body from any ideas you have about the body

88
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:12,320
and don't worry too much about exactly what you're letting go of

89
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:18,320
just on the exhale release the body

90
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:26,560
let go letting the body be still

91
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:34,320
like a gentle sweet unmoving body

92
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:45,839
that from within is released set free

93
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,800
every exhale

94
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:16,880
anywhere in your body where there's even the slightest sense of tension or

95
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,840
stress pressure

96
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:29,799
see if you can release that

97
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:42,480
and if you can't release it see if you can

98
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,720
let go and make space around it

99
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:53,840
and in the last minutes of this sitting whatever your mind is involved in

100
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,880
let it go release it

101
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,640
and then do it again and again

102
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:11,919
let go and then let go for the next thing the next thing

103
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,679
let it be a release a relaxation

104
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,679
deep to your very core let go

105
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:35,600
let go and if you're trying too hard to let go

106
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,720
let go of trying hard

107
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,360
and the greater we the more we release the body

108
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,240
the more letting go we have in the body is free

109
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,480
the more the body becomes porous

110
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,480
and things nothing in the world that happens

111
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:34,440
gets stuck in the body nothing happens in the world

112
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,639
gets caught in the body

113
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:51,520
the more we hold on to things the more there's something

114
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:57,120
way in which things get stuck in the body or impact the body

115
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:09,760
to release deeply so we can be available in the world with

116
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,158
with love with care

117
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:24,559
so that we can be present for whatever whatever way someone else is

118
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:31,080
because we're porous

119
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:38,240
or we're open spacious we have lots of room

120
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,240
so we don't react contract

121
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,440
retract ourselves

122
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:55,559
and may we go into the world

123
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,559
dedicated to being present for others

124
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:12,320
in a poorest way in a spacious way

125
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,440
that allows our good will our friendliness our love

126
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:24,760
to not be agitated or not be contracted or not be lost

127
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:37,120
may our ability to be present and mindful support us

128
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:43,039
in caring for the welfare and happiness of others

129
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,399
may all beings be happy

130
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:55,398
may all beings be safe

131
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,398
may all beings be peaceful

132
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:09,480
and may all beings everywhere be free

133
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,240
thank you

134
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:42,000
this last talk on the week of mindfulness of the body

135
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:50,159
focuses on release and uh release is one of my favorite

136
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:56,399
words for liberation or freedom because it uh

137
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:05,039
has this this idea of um setting something free it gets released

138
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:10,080
and um and it has this kind of dual thing where

139
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:16,480
freedom maybe has the idea of you can go do that whatever you want

140
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:22,480
and letting go has a little bit more kind of the weight of what's been let go of

141
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:28,000
but for me release is in between that where clearly something has become free

142
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,600
free of something but there's also the feeling of this kind of opening up to

143
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:40,799
to just openness and a kind of freedom and

144
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:48,080
anyway so we have a release and um each step along the way of this

145
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:53,679
week we have these five different areas of mindfulness

146
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,840
we have relaxation recognition

147
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:05,519
respect restoration and now release but each of the first four

148
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:12,159
have within them something we're releasing so relaxation maybe is the most obvious

149
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:17,279
where uh we're releasing tension holding maybe stress there's something where

150
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:22,799
something is letting go and when we relax and some people don't maybe focus so

151
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:28,880
much on that what's let go of but rather uh the goodness the nice feelings of the

152
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:35,279
relaxation the comfort of it then um

153
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:40,960
the um recognition

154
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,480
involves a kind of release as well letting go as well and that

155
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:52,000
recognition is very simple it's just recognizing just how things

156
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,760
are in the moment without the complications of history

157
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:04,640
without the conversations of uh of uh projections into the future

158
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:11,360
without the complications of um of you know the complicated world and

159
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:18,240
complications of me myself and mine uh but just allowing something to be itself

160
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:24,559
allowing an itch to be an itch just recognize the itch it can be hard to be let go of all the

161
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:31,840
reactivity to it but that's the goal is just to itch an itch a warmth just a warmth

162
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:39,559
a twisting just a twisting a heat just heat

163
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:47,760
the um when i was in japan studying zen and

164
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:53,519
kind of one of the teachings i got there was something like when it's hot just be hot

165
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:59,200
when the weather is hot and when it's cold just be cold um so

166
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:05,200
whether that's exactly should why you should live your life i'm not saying but it's the idea that in the recognition

167
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:10,240
we're letting go of a lot of the complications and just letting things be in their simplicity the pristine

168
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:18,000
simplicity of each moment so it's a lot of letting go the respect we're letting go of

169
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,280
disrespect with disrespect here might mean um having an agenda

170
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,480
around things uh having uh being in charge bossing our life around like it

171
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,679
has to be this way or that way i have to get rid of this i have to get this happen it shouldn't be this experience

172
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:40,398
it should be some other way but the respect is to is to just

173
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:47,679
give permission for each thing to just be itself and so to respect to see again

174
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:53,520
so there's a letting go that allows us to have this seeing again just allowing ourselves to really be there in the

175
00:34:53,520 --> 00:35:00,880
simplicity of things and then the restoration to allow things to restore

176
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:08,079
there has to be uh we're letting go of again ways in which we restrict ourselves the ways in which we limit

177
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:13,680
ourselves or hold back or resist ourselves or box things in or contain

178
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:19,680
things and um and there has to be space for things to restore

179
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,720
like if you uh if you um if you have too much uh

180
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,480
uh too many plants growing in a fl in a flower bed then the seedling that you want for it to grow will not grow

181
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:36,720
healthy in a healthy way to allow it to grow well you have to kind of make a clearing so it has

182
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:42,720
some light that comes through and then today it's release

183
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,839
and um and i think it's a profound topic and it's not

184
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:54,320
you know it's easy to talk about it simplistically or easy to talk about it as if it's easy thing to do

185
00:35:54,320 --> 00:36:00,560
but um you know generally in almost any circumstance we find ourselves there's

186
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:06,560
something we can let go of something we can release maybe not what we want to release what

187
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:12,240
but maybe we let go of the wanting to release maybe that's where the the beginning of

188
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:19,200
freedom can happen and then we practice relaxation recognition respect maybe a restoration

189
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:24,800
instead of letting go of what's difficult to let go of and

190
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:31,839
so one of the things we're releasing is the body from our ideas of the body

191
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:38,480
and the tremendous amount of suffering in our culture around how the around ideas of body

192
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,599
body image and um and you know to be body conscious

193
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:50,400
sometimes just to be frozen and caught up and uh with how we're supposed to look and

194
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:56,960
and uh or how we don't look or and uh you know and the argument our societies around us support us in this

195
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,800
kind of very painful way in which the body gets this kind of uh

196
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:09,520
this whole agenda ideas of what it shouldn't be and so it's one of the great gifts for

197
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:15,440
our body to do something like meditation and let go

198
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:21,280
of all the ideas we have about the body let it be itself

199
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:27,599
so the other day we did that exercise of mindfulness of the hand where we're just feeling the sensations

200
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:33,040
of the hand and some people do that exercise will see the difference between

201
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:38,880
the ideas they have about their hand and their fingers are too much this or too much little that their hand is

202
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:45,040
through this to that the fingernails are just not quite right or just all these things about the hand

203
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:50,240
that the mind has ideas about and it can be kind of debilitating and

204
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:57,760
preoccupying but if we let go of all those ideas and just feel the hand for itself

205
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:03,280
the hand itself doesn't have a problem being whatever it is it's just a just a hand

206
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,880
and to free the hand to feel itself without the burden of all these ideas

207
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:15,359
so to learn to release the body from the ideas we have on top of it

208
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:21,200
part of the release of the body is to release the tension that's in the body

209
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:26,800
and generally you know most tension that we feel in the body

210
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:33,440
tightness and most stress we feel in the body is uh is a

211
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,960
byproduct of tension and stress in the mind and so the poor body has to kind of deal

212
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:45,280
with all the stress and tension and sometimes it becomes chronic and can be quite debilitating

213
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:51,040
and so to to release the body from the hold of the mind

214
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:59,279
so that we again can allow the body to restore itself or or heal itself even

215
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:07,359
and so to begin to appreciate how much we can release the body let go

216
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:13,839
not of the body but let go with the body

217
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:20,720
let the body participate in this deep pro the process of letting go of all this unnecessary and

218
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:28,320
maybe pain producing suffering producing activities that the mind does

219
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:34,800
and meditation is one of the great laboratories to discover how this works and

220
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:42,520
how to discover greater and greater release and relaxation and depth

221
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:48,240
um there was a apparently debate in buddhism at some point down through the

222
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:55,200
centuries whether enlightenment happens in the mind or happens in the body

223
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:01,440
and probably it's you know not a tremendously wise debate because it

224
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:07,200
probably happens in both places simultaneously but uh but the fact that some people

225
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:12,960
would really identify the body as a locus for liberation i find quite inspiring

226
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:20,640
it's also inspiring they found it in the mind maybe wherever it's found or whatever that doorway into liberation is great

227
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:26,640
but many people don't consider that the body is

228
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:31,920
kind of the location where freedom occurs and maybe part of this debate arises

229
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:37,599
because in the ancient buddhist teachings of the buddha he emphasized

230
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:42,880
repeatedly that there is no liberation

231
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:48,640
without mindfulness of the body and he suddenly has all these synonyms

232
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:54,800
for liberation and now some of them are quite you know lofty like there is no

233
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:01,200
attainment of the deathless without mindfulness of the body there is no experience of the

234
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:06,560
unconditioned without mindfulness of the body that somehow this mindfulness of the

235
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:14,560
body and navigating through it and discovering freedom through the body is such a huge part of this tradition

236
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:20,560
so i think as i began this week i want to end with the idea that

237
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:26,640
maybe sometimes we should think of sati usually translated as mindfulness

238
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:32,240
we should think of it as body fullness and that

239
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:38,560
how to live in a full body in the fullness of our body

240
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:44,880
and take time to do that when i teach retreats i sometimes

241
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:51,359
meditation retweets i sometimes give the instructions to

242
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:57,680
to walk around do the activities of the retreat

243
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:03,200
at the speed of mindfulness because often we do the speed of the mind

244
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:08,960
and you get caught in the mind the activity of the mind some people kind of zip around kind of fast and do things quickly

245
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:14,960
but the speed by which we can stay present for our body present in our experience

246
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:23,599
pretty present for our body fullness so to do things at the speed of

247
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:29,599
body fullness the speed of staying connected to your body know what's happening in your body

248
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:35,359
don't get disconnected your body this is a great exercise

249
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:42,240
and uh you might if you'd like uh spend this weekend

250
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:48,000
before next week we're going to do mindfulness of emotions and it turns out that the more you're

251
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,560
mindful of your body the easier it is to be mindful of emotions so you might want to spend this week at

252
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:59,920
this weekend kind of reviewing or looking over or practicing

253
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:05,359
body fullness seeing what it's like whenever it's appropriate in your weekend

254
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:13,200
to operate at the speed up operate at the speed of body fullness

255
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:19,760
mindfulness of the body thank you very much and i'm looking

256
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,680
forward to being back here on monday
