1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:09,919
good evening good evening everyone nice to see you all

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,020
so tonight I'd like to continue on this series I've been doing on the seven

3
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,779
factors of Awakening and I've been on the last factor of

4
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:31,019
Awakening Equanimity and so this is another talk on equanimity

5
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:38,000
kind of fleshing it out and emphasizing different aspects of it

6
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,860
so this word Equanimity what is equanimity and as I as I said before it certainly

7
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:51,059
was not in my vocabulary before I came to Buddhist practice

8
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:59,340
but this idea that it's a steadiness of mind and a heart

9
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,978
maybe in in the face of whatever conditions are arising whether it's some

10
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:11,580
inner turmoil or some outer turmoil have some steadiness not be completely

11
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:17,659
blown off guard or blown off course maybe I should say

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,840
Equanimity is also in the maybe another word we could use is balance

13
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,840
and sometimes tetramajatas this poly word that gets translated as Equanimity

14
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,159
and that means like standing in the middle which also could be thinking about

15
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:44,759
balance or also a way in which to see kind of like

16
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:50,220
both the ends of a spectrum or to be in the middle is to recognize that it is

17
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,259
the middle that there are other things around it and not be just completely

18
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:02,180
lost in whatever it is that we're lost in

19
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:09,000
and it also has this um upeka is a second poly word that

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,700
gets translated as equanimity and this word

21
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:21,180
is probably literally means something more like looking upon

22
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,459
and I like this um definition of equanimity because to make this

23
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:33,120
distinction that looking upon as opposed to looking away

24
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,140
sometimes when we think of equanimity we think of okay so if you're balanced or

25
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:44,700
unshakable or steady we just assume that's kind of that means

26
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:51,239
you're disconnected because it's often how we think about things that if you're either in the

27
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:58,379
thick of it or you're disconnected from it and so Equanimity is actually something

28
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:04,440
in the middle of those two it's that you're aware of what's Happening you're connected to

29
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:13,560
what's happening you are feeling what's happening but you're not overwhelmed by it

30
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,599
you're not I said blown off course yours still

31
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:24,060
remain balanced so maybe it goes without saying that one

32
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:29,879
of the functions of equanimity it just makes life easier if we're not caught up

33
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:35,220
in the latest drama and you know in drama in terms of

34
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:42,840
something that's wonderful or something that's terrible but it also helps create the conditions

35
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:50,099
in which there can be some deep letting go right if there's some steadiness then

36
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:56,099
it's easier to see oh I don't need to hold on to this

37
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:04,519
I don't need to shove this away I'm just feeling okay and upright right here

38
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:12,500
so Equanimity is also a practice or a support for letting go

39
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:20,519
and so this uh simile that I I'd like to offer is about how Equanimity is part of

40
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:26,340
practice it's part of the way that we find our ways to Awakening

41
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:33,720
hence it's one of the seven factors of Awakening but here's a simile that the Buddha

42
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:40,280
gives kind of talks about Equanimity in the context of

43
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:47,580
um purifying or shaping the mind and the Heart

44
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:53,280
so this is the simile of a Goldsmith somebody who is taking gold

45
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,160
and heating it up and then bending it to be particular shape so that it can be

46
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,860
some jewelry for example or maybe coins or something like this

47
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:10,440
so the semi goes like this suppose a Goldsmith would prepare a hot

48
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:17,520
furnace heat up a receptacle take some gold using tongs and put it into the

49
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:25,740
receptacle okay right this isn't anything that's uh unusual have a hot plates a place and

50
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:31,740
then put some gold in a crucible and put that in with the heat

51
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:38,580
and then the semi continues then from time to time the Goldsmith would blow on

52
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,620
the gold from time to time the Goldsmith would

53
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:49,560
sprinkle water on the gold and from time to time the Goldsmith

54
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:56,100
would just look on as the gold was Heating this makes sense right of course back

55
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:03,840
then they didn't have a little oven that they could dial the temperature you had to just look at it and say I think it

56
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,660
needs to be a little bit more warm and then blow on it to increase the heater add a little bit of water to cool it

57
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:15,860
down and sometimes it was just right and to look upon

58
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:22,199
and then the assembly continues if the Goldsmith were to only blow on it it's

59
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:28,020
possible that the gold would just burn up get too hot if the Goldsmith were to

60
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:34,620
only sprinkle water it's possible the gold would cool down and would get too hard and you couldn't do anything with

61
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:41,340
it and if the Goldsmith were to only look upon the gold would not reach the right

62
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:48,120
consistency it wouldn't get up to the right temperature that then it would be malleable and flexible

63
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:56,039
but if the Goldsmith went from time to time blew on it sprinkle water on it or just

64
00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:03,240
look upon it then it could become the right consistency an encryption of the gold purified

65
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,759
bright and blemished rid of imperfection this long list

66
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:14,039
those exact same words or how the Buddha describes his own mind right before

67
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:19,319
Awakening having all these qualities these

68
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:24,419
characteristics so the Buddha is pointing to you with

69
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:31,199
this simile that there's different things that are needed to help get the Mind ready for awakening

70
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,960
get the Mind ready for some new insights or for some letting go

71
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:43,680
you know whether this is like the big Awakening or whether it's just getting the Mind ready for more freedom

72
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,918
whatever way that might whatever form that might take

73
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:57,599
so as you might imagine this blowing on the Goldsmith is a

74
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:05,340
stands for like adding some more energy A little bit more effort to our practice or whatever it is that we're doing

75
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:10,620
to sprinkle water on it is to kind of like allow the mind to get settled and

76
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:18,900
cooled down to be collected concentrated and Equanimity is to just look upon

77
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:25,879
so I appreciate very much that that um here the Buddha is putting Equanimity

78
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:32,099
in the context of what's best for a practice at that time

79
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:37,740
this recognition that sometimes energy needs to be put in there this energy can

80
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:44,580
take all kinds of different forms maybe it's a little bit more investigation or just literally kind of

81
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:51,000
bringing up the energy not so much that one is restless but just to maybe apply

82
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,640
a little bit more effort but sometimes what's needed is to calm down maybe there is too much

83
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:04,140
restlessness and to calm down sometimes it just to look upon

84
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:09,360
and of course mindfulness is the faculty that can help us determine what's needed

85
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,380
more energy more calm or just to look upon

86
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,700
and these four faculties mindfulness energy concentration and

87
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:26,279
Equanimity are four of the seven factors of Awakening

88
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:33,060
so just this way in which we can they can all work together to help the mind

89
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:38,300
become bright I love this and malleable

90
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:44,760
wieldy so we'll D in terms of it can be shaped in terms of a bracelet earrings

91
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:51,420
or necklace but also wheel D meaning can recognize oh maybe there's a different

92
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:59,160
practice that's needed right here maybe there's rather than my usual mindfulness of

93
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:06,800
breathing I'm noticing that I'm having a lot of ill will for example and maybe I can do some loving kindness practice to

94
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,980
soften the heart and mind away from some ill will

95
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:22,080
okay so we might say okay well this Equanimity thing sounds interesting but well how do we cultivate that

96
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:29,420
how do we cultivate this steadiness this balance the scene the big picture

97
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:36,779
so there's a maybe it doesn't sound like um I don't

98
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:42,420
know maybe it's not too interesting or doesn't seem like So

99
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:48,240
Glamorous maybe Equanimity but when we put it in the context of what

100
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,640
our minds are usually doing right they're always trying to go towards the

101
00:10:53,640 --> 00:11:00,779
pleasant and the exciting or to get away from the pain and blame and loss and all

102
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:05,820
these uncomfortable things so it's not the usual way in which our

103
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:11,339
minds are to have this balanced and steady way

104
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:18,240
so what are some things that we might do to support some equanimity

105
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,279
last week I spoke about the importance of some culturing well-being and

106
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,680
warm-heartedness number of ways we can do that

107
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:34,920
maybe I'll just say some loving kindness practice is an obvious way for some well-being and warm-heartedness

108
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:42,120
and I like this modern day simile that Rob barbaya uses another Dharma teacher

109
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:48,300
uses to describe well-being as a support for Equanimity he says

110
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:54,660
imagine that you don't know how to swim and you end up you know falling

111
00:11:54,660 --> 00:12:02,700
overboard and you're in the in some water and then maybe you are

112
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:08,160
um because you don't know how to swim you're like thrashing about you know

113
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:14,339
maybe expending energy in ways that aren't so helpful when you have this panicky feeling

114
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:20,399
but now imagine if you don't know how to swim but you have a life jacket on

115
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:27,180
and you get put in the water then you have this buoyancy and you have this feeling like okay I don't know how to

116
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:34,079
swim but I'm not gonna drown and maybe you could find a way to kick

117
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:41,880
or Swim a little bit to you know paddle to where you need to go so you don't have that panicky feeling

118
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:48,899
so we might imagine that the well-being or some warm-heartedness is a way that can

119
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:56,100
be like a life jacket that when we do find ourselves in a place that's uncomfortable not knowing

120
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:01,560
how to swim when you're in water but it gives us some buoyancy and some

121
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:06,779
steadiness so what are some other things

122
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:13,459
that might support Equanimity what are some practical things that we might do

123
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:20,339
so some of you know that Equanimity is one of the Brahma vaharas

124
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:27,300
which is a meditation practice I'm not going to talk about that right now as Equanimity is part of a Brahma

125
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:35,700
vahara but I would like to say something that we can do in meditation practice

126
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:43,680
and that is maybe just at the beginning of our mindfulness practice to spend I don't know five or ten

127
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:53,399
minutes just kind of this with a settling and sometimes it can be helpful

128
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:58,800
just drop in and maybe the same way that we do with Brahma vahara practice where

129
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:08,279
we kind of like Drop in an intention but for Equanimity practice to drop in

130
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:14,700
may I see the world with quiet eyes

131
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:21,380
may I see the world with quiet eyes

132
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:29,700
so it's not a demand it's not a plea

133
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:36,899
it's just setting the intention this idea of quiet eyes is not a usual

134
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:44,519
language and maybe there's some wiggle room in there in which you can find what what resonates with you in this kind of

135
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:50,519
unusual expression so this might be something that if you

136
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:57,600
find yourself really restless maybe you could drop in or at the beginning of a practice when

137
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:06,920
you feel like you'd like to cultivate some Equanimity is may I see the world with quiet eyes

138
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:16,380
or maybe there's some practices in daily life that we might do to support Equanimity off the cushion

139
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:24,420
and this is something that's been really helpful for me that uh when I first tried this I felt

140
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:30,540
like oh okay Diana this is uh good that you're doing this practice

141
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:37,019
and this is to um to evenly apply attention

142
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:45,839
to all stages of a project the planning the doing and the cleaning

143
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:53,279
up is there a way in which we can just just evenly apply attention to all three of

144
00:15:53,279 --> 00:16:00,480
those stages so when I heard about this I thought okay you know I'll do this for this next

145
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,699
meal that I'm gonna make okay planning I can pay attention to that

146
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:10,920
preparing I can pay attention to that I did not want to pay attention to

147
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:15,959
cleaning up there was something about like oh cleaning up okay that's just something I'm gonna do quickly and look

148
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:22,620
at the last thing I got to do to finish up I just really didn't notice how much I was like in a hurry I didn't want to

149
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:30,300
do it I felt like oh this is this the extra stuff but there's a way in which we can just

150
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:35,940
notice how much of our life is kind of like planning and preparing doing and

151
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:41,880
cleaning up and is there a way in which we might notice that we only pay

152
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:48,360
attention between one of those three stages and can we

153
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:55,019
notice for one if we are not paying attention just bring a little bit more attention to that

154
00:16:55,019 --> 00:17:00,600
and then this of course it turns out I'll speak for myself it turned out to be much more delightful to be paying

155
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:06,600
attention after clean it up after a meal and I'm not going to say that I'm always doing this

156
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:12,298
sometimes I'm like with the dishes not my favorite thing to do but

157
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:19,500
this is one thing that we can do Equanimity off the cushion to support us just pay attention to

158
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:26,240
or equal amounts of attention to all the phases of a project

159
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:35,280
but what are some wisdom practices that we can do to support equanimity

160
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:40,380
of course Equanimity as I've been talking about is part of the path of practice

161
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:47,120
and it's a big support for awakening and of course wisdom is a part of that too

162
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,559
so what are some other practices that we might do either in daily life or in

163
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:59,700
meditation as a support and one is just like I was talking about paying

164
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:06,000
equal attention to all three stages of a project whatever that project might be

165
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,039
so like just noticing in particular something

166
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:17,160
in the same way we can notice the changing nature of

167
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:22,860
things really tune in to

168
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:29,539
the way things that arise and pass away tune in to the things aren't always

169
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:35,280
exactly the same so this is a little bit different than

170
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:42,360
straight up mindfulness more that we're kind of like highlighting a certain aspect of our experience it's really

171
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:48,600
within mindfulness we do notice things arise and pus away but is there a way in

172
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:55,200
which we can tune in to be sensitive to pay attention to

173
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,640
that particular quality of all of our experiences

174
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:07,799
they're Rising their passing they're starting they're ending

175
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:13,620
and they're changing they're like getting modified as time goes on

176
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:19,980
and this is a practice because like all of us know we all know things are

177
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:29,640
impermanent right intellectually we understand this this isn't news to anybody but is there

178
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:35,880
is there a product it can be a practice to just tune in to this particular

179
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:41,400
quality of all of our experiences

180
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:47,100
and there's a way in which transformation can happen in which when we tune into

181
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:52,940
certain things over and over and over again

182
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:59,580
and of course seeing this change or fluctuation

183
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:06,600
in all scales right really small scales really the immediate changes of things

184
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:12,600
or the big scale the changes of the Season or in the beginning of fall

185
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:21,600
and starting to see that it changes the way our relationship to what's happening

186
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:28,799
if we're noticing that everything's changing then it's not quite as attractive to want to really hold on to

187
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:35,220
it because it it just doesn't make sense to hold on

188
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:41,280
it doesn't make sense to try to grab something that's like slipping away

189
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:48,240
and so we might even notice in our daily life reflection

190
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,960
are our moods exactly the same from the moment we we wake up until we go to

191
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:03,539
sleep how many different moods did we have how many different thoughts did we have

192
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:11,340
how many different things did we eat so just focusing on that particular

193
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:16,799
aspect of our experience the mind and the Heart can start to let

194
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:23,039
go because they see that things are not worth clinging to

195
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:29,760
and with that letting go this not clinging is a way in which we can maintain some of our balance or

196
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:37,500
steadiness because we're not trying to like grab on to things that are slipping away or we're not

197
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:44,400
trying to push things away so strongly because we're not insisting that things be a particular way we're recognizing

198
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,620
that they arise and pass away

199
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:58,620
another practice that we can do whether it's um in practice or in daily life

200
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:05,220
is what would it be like to not immediately have an opinion

201
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:11,820
about everything this is good this is bad this is this is this is really good and

202
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:18,900
this is really bad or something like this I mean so often we have opinions

203
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:26,460
and of course we do right things are Pleasant or unpleasant or neither Pleasant nor unpleasant

204
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:33,600
but an opinion is more like when we've kind of wrapped up a sense of Who We Are

205
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:41,220
with our whether we like it or don't like it often opinions are a way in which we

206
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:46,679
kind of Define ourselves I'm the person that likes this we don't

207
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:51,799
say it that way in our minds but it's definitely part of the the way that we

208
00:22:51,799 --> 00:23:00,299
identify or with or get identified or create a self is to cling on to a view

209
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:07,260
also to it's also part of the way in which we align ourselves with certain groups of

210
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:12,299
people and distinguish ourselves from other groups of people

211
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:19,260
so what would it be like to soften that and to not immediately say

212
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:25,020
have an opinion this is good or bad might say well right now it feels

213
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:32,700
unpleasant and just end it with that it feels unfortunate it feels this feels

214
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:42,020
this feels Pleasant connected with that maybe some of you know this uh Zen story

215
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:48,480
of this farmer who is uh farming and he has a horse and

216
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:56,400
he uses the horse for farming to help maybe drag the plow or maybe he

217
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,559
rides the horse to help bring the animals in from posture the livestock in or

218
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:06,720
all these types of things right can use a horse

219
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:13,559
and then one day the horse runs away and the farmer doesn't have a horse

220
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:21,480
anymore some difficulty for him and then some of the villagers come by

221
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:28,919
and say oh so sorry to hear that your horse ran away this is such bad luck

222
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:35,700
and he says bad luck good luck who knows

223
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:42,000
and the villagers think that's kind of an odd response but they just go on their way

224
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,120
and then sometime later when he's working now it's a lot of work right without a horse

225
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:55,260
and he said his horse is returning and it's brought with it other horses

226
00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:01,260
some wild horses that it had befriended so these other horses arrive with its

227
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:07,620
original horse and they follow the original horse into the Corral and he closes the gate and they go now he has

228
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:15,840
more horses whether this is a fabulous thing so then the villagers stopped by and say

229
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:21,720
wow this is uh what good luck you have that your horse brought back these other

230
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:28,260
horses and he says good luck bad luck who knows

231
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:33,539
and they think okay this guy's really odd person but that's all right

232
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:39,179
so then his son is trying to work with these new wild horses

233
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:45,840
so that they can really work there on the farm and while the sun is working with them

234
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:52,140
he gets kicked by one of the horses and gets really injured injured badly

235
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:58,639
broken leg and maybe some broken ribs they're not sure

236
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:07,080
so the villagers hear about this and say oh this is terrible that your son has this broken leg and is really injured

237
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:12,299
this is really unfortunate it's really bad luck

238
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:17,700
and the farmer says bad luck good luck who's

239
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:23,820
to say who knows so now right here's uh more work for

240
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:31,200
this poor farmer he has more horses but his son isn't able to help his son is

241
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,480
can't walk really sick or injured

242
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,520
and then there is a the Army comes by and they're

243
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,700
going to conscript any abled body young men

244
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:51,779
here's the sun of course who has this broken leg and is really sick and

245
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:58,380
injured and so he doesn't get conscripted into the army and so the

246
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:03,960
the villagers say wow what good luck that your son didn't get taken to get

247
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:12,179
put in the army and you know what he's going to say right good luck bad luck ooze to say

248
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:17,460
so maybe we have our own versions of this our story of this

249
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:22,620
Maybe we add some heartbreak When We Were

250
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:28,740
Young and didn't end up with a person that we thought we wanted to but then later found

251
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:36,539
somebody that was a better fit for us or maybe the same way with a job maybe there was a job that we didn't get and

252
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:43,380
but then we were able to get another job or we all of us have some stories about

253
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:48,720
this I know that I have to like when I reflect back on my life some things that

254
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,960
at the time felt really or heartbreaking for me but now I see oh

255
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:01,679
yep I couldn't have had this life now if I that had happened and this life that I

256
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:07,500
have now is so much better so maybe that's true for you also

257
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:13,620
maybe there have been some things that at the time felt terrible but turned out

258
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:19,200
in a bigger picture to not be so bad or maybe even to be great

259
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:25,860
so Equanimity is part of this not whole not having this opinion and really holding on to it oh this is terrible

260
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:33,179
right maybe it's uncomfortable maybe it's not what you wished but it was just a

261
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:40,220
reminder that things might turn out to you know in the bigger picture differently

262
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:47,159
so another maybe um reflection

263
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:54,779
to help support equanimity is often when we talk about Equanimity we talk about the support of these eight

264
00:28:54,779 --> 00:29:00,720
worldly wins these eight conditions that affect

265
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:08,340
everybody without exception absolutely everybody and a modern translation or

266
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:15,299
interpretation of them we could say is success and failure status and disgrace

267
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:21,360
approval and disapproval and ease and unease

268
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:28,140
I said undies like underwear I don't know but that's opposite of ease

269
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:33,799
but uh ease and unease

270
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:39,659
and so we can reflect about these we can use our wisdom

271
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:48,020
and just you know maybe I'll just choose one of them this one approval and disapproval

272
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:53,640
if we think about it that um this is about what other people

273
00:29:53,640 --> 00:30:00,779
think approval and disapproval and can we really control what other people

274
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:07,200
think no we can't we know this right we all know this

275
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:14,220
so is there a way that can read control the thoughts of others how many

276
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:21,000
thoughts do people have maybe that's just one thought that they had that they weren't so approving of

277
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:28,440
something that we did and the news cycles and the big picture but even the news Cycles in our little lives

278
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:36,799
right so interesting it's going to be different very soon so it's not that at that time

279
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:42,419
necessarily that people are going to remember this approval or disapproval so maybe

280
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:49,500
just kind of some reflection on this recognizing that it's not

281
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:54,659
we can't control what other people say or think and it's going to change anyway

282
00:30:54,659 --> 00:31:02,520
soon and then lastly I'll say that

283
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:07,559
maybe just this acknowledgment of things that are uncomfortable or difficult

284
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:12,720
again this is a reflection or an acknowledgment

285
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:20,460
it's one way is strengthen our capacities it's not what we want

286
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:26,399
but maybe it's how we learn some things that are difficult

287
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:33,659
we learn how to be courageous only when there's opportunities in which we've

288
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:39,059
there's fear maybe we

289
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:44,279
learn to be patient only when we're feeling

290
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:49,500
impatient so in the same way whatever it is the

291
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:55,860
difficulty that we are having to work with and that we are not feeling equanimity

292
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:02,399
maybe it can be helpful to kind of reflect on the bigger picture and recognize that okay I'm learning

293
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:07,620
something important here maybe it's not even clear what it is

294
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:13,559
but difficulties are a way in which we can stretch our

295
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:18,779
capacities and we all have this

296
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:24,000
I've heard of this expression I wouldn't have wished this on my enemy but I can

297
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,279
see how it was really helpful for me it doesn't make the difficulty different

298
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:36,059
it doesn't make it easier but that is one way in which we might can see the bigger picture and

299
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:41,279
might be able to not feel off balance

300
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,779
with some of the difficulties

301
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:52,380
and maybe I'll close with this one quote which is um

302
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:58,620
from the Tara got these these verses from

303
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:04,020
some monks they're kind of part of their Awakening verses

304
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:09,080
and this is the verse from subuti

305
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:16,080
and this is uh something that he describes after his Awakening

306
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:25,380
but I think as if beautifully describes equanimity my little Hut is roofed and pleasant

307
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:33,059
sheltered from the wind so rain sky as you please

308
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:39,299
my mind is Serene and freed I practice wholeheartedly

309
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:45,080
so rain sky as you please

310
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:51,779
so this idea of having a roofed and pleasant Hut like he feels he has this

311
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:58,860
steadiness and he's this practice wholeheartedly that he's like giving him himself to the

312
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:05,039
practice so it's okay if it's really hot in the Sun or it's okay if it's

313
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:12,138
really raining and cold he's okay he's okay

314
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:16,760
it's the one way to think about equanimity

315
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:24,240
so now I'd like to open it up to some questions or comments about uh

316
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:30,358
Equanimity or some things that I've said here does anybody have some questions or

317
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:37,158
comments including anybody that's uh online with us

318
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:53,358
Sage behind you Jim has a question

319
00:34:54,599 --> 00:35:03,119
thank you so much the question I wanted to ask is um basically a comparison between the

320
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:10,260
idea of equanimity and the like doctrine of not self it seemed like it seems like these two are

321
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:16,200
like very closely connected because the departure from our expectations about I'm sorry the last part I didn't hear

322
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:21,660
sorry I'm Ebola uh the departure from like our expectations about the little

323
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:27,960
like self in our stories about ourselves like is where the like Angus comes in I guess and I was just

324
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:34,859
wondering are there like sort of practices that are Equanimity plus like not all for

325
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:43,260
good ways to put that into practice I guess for the both not self and equanimity

326
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:49,020
I would say Equanimity by definition as you've kind of pointed out helps soften

327
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:54,420
the sense of self because we could might even say that whenever we are really

328
00:35:54,420 --> 00:36:00,960
holding on really tightly that's when there's this self is really there and there's like so many things right that

329
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:07,560
we can hold on to so I would say any practice that helps soften the clinging

330
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:14,760
or the the holding on will support Equanimity and some that lessening of a sense of self

331
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:21,359
does is that helpful most definitely thank you I wasn't thinking about that yeah and maybe I could say something

332
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:26,880
else that um I talked about earlier with Equanimity not on tonight's talk but one

333
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:34,800
thing is something else that's a support for Equanimity is to recognize oh things are arising because this condition is in

334
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:42,119
place and that condition is in place and that condition is in place so of course it's I'm it's a rising here so that same

335
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:48,960
thing seeing the conditionality of things also really supports not saying saying that oh there isn't a self here

336
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,920
there's just all these conditions so yeah great thank you

337
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:00,500
anybody else have a comment or question

338
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:17,300
okay okay very nice

339
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:24,180
so thank you thank you for your kind attention and may you feel some balance

340
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:32,000
and steadiness and ease and your practice sent in your life thank you very much
