1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,960
so

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,519
as i've said already that with the 13

3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,400
step of mindfulness of breathing we

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,359
enter into the territory of insight

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,480
of bipasuna and

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,599
before this meditation practice can be

7
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,720
characterized by practicing mindfulness

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,120
after all this is called mindfulness of

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,399
breathing in and breathing out

10
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,440
and mindfulness and vipassana are two

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,520
different things classically in the

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,120
early tradition

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,920
in the modern english kind of scene

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,160
people will use the word vipassana and

15
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,360
mindfulness sometimes synonymously

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,520
and sometimes the word vipassana refers

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,079
to the vipassana tradition

18
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,520
or vipassana meditation and it's used

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,640
kind of as a

20
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,559
you know to a general term

21
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,119
but in the teachings of the buddha the

22
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,799
word vipassana

23
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,000
doesn't refer to any kind of practice

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,119
but rather the results of practice so

25
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,799
it's the result of doing

26
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,960
mindfulness the result of doing

27
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,840
concentration

28
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,280
the result of doing mindfulness and

29
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,680
concentration practice together

30
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,960
which is one of the benefits of

31
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,200
mindfulness of breathing that they

32
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,320
they stay with the breath all the time

33
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,320
there is a concentration factor that

34
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,520
builds

35
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,680
as but we're also practicing mindfulness

36
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,079
of is staying aware of what's going on

37
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,040
where the the mindfulness is present

38
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,799
when those become both become

39
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,119
sufficiently strong the mindfulness and

40
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,880
concentration

41
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,000
then we start having insights we start

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,799
seeing

43
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,079
observing in ways that we don't usually

44
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,240
observe in everyday life you start

45
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,159
observing in deeper and deeper way or

46
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,920
with greater clarity

47
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,640
into the moment-to-moment experience and

48
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,360
that's when

49
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,119
insights begin and the insights

50
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,239
of the insight meditation practice

51
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,080
are not i i like to think of them

52
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,879
insights with capital i

53
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,720
there's lots of insights with a small

54
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,080
eye all

55
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,480
can be very significant but the

56
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,560
difference in my vocabulary and why i'm

57
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,800
using him now

58
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,760
is the small eye insights are the ones

59
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,400
that are

60
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,599
big aha moments where we see something

61
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,560
about

62
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,519
ourselves that's unique to ourselves so

63
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:36,000
for example

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,440
we understand something about the

65
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,519
conditions that led us to become who we

66
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,720
are today or

67
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,040
we see clearly our particular beliefs

68
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,400
that we're operating under maybe they

69
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,120
were

70
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,239
deluded or not really true ah and then

71
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,560
we put that down or we see

72
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,319
something about ourselves that we never

73
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,680
saw before and

74
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,000
and i said wow that explains why i

75
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,959
behave this way because oh there's that

76
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,000
anxiety or fear or something

77
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,920
memory that i have that keeps kind of

78
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,000
filtering my experience

79
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,239
so there's all kinds of very important

80
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,920
personal insights

81
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,360
that help us become freer and freer

82
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,760
but the insight with a capital i the

83
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,959
insight of

84
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,440
that inside meditation is really

85
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,000
focusing

86
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,720
focusing on are seeing things which are

87
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,519
universal uni uh that are common

88
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:28,799
denominators

89
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,239
of all experiences

90
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,640
and so it's it's true whether it's a

91
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,720
personal experience it's only unique to

92
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,840
oneself

93
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,040
and it's true for uh and

94
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,280
for everybody and so sometimes they're

95
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,760
called universal characteristics of

96
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,440
all experience and

97
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,959
and and in the buddha called these

98
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,239
perceptions so they're they're qualities

99
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,720
or aspects of how we perceive

100
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,680
all things that we we take in or

101
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,599
character characterize the perceptions

102
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,080
that

103
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,480
of all things so there's something

104
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,879
universal so they're transpersonal maybe

105
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:09,599
or

106
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,159
or um you know they're more encompassing

107
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:12,799
than anything

108
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,760
we see is personally whereas the

109
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,560
personal insights are important

110
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,560
going deeper down into the common

111
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,960
denominator of all experiences

112
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,560
the common characteristics of all

113
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,000
experiences this

114
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,960
it puts us down at the deeper foundation

115
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,919
from which

116
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,160
we build the cathedrals of

117
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,080
the citadels of our conceptual world

118
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,040
the world of self and self in the world

119
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,080
of others and

120
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,240
we we kind of build this world and

121
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,320
philosophy and beliefs and feelings and

122
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,120
all that

123
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,160
based on uh things that are uh uh

124
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,919
have this foundation of these common

125
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,759
characteristics common pers

126
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,360
ways of perceiving and

127
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,479
and the primary one that uh

128
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,840
is the buddha emphasizes uh is a

129
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,120
quality of all experiences

130
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,080
is something called anicha in pali it's

131
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,199
a-n-i-c-c-a

132
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,840
it's commonly translated into english as

133
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,600
impermanence

134
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,880
and and uh

135
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,039
probably not the best translation and

136
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,199
i'll get to that in a few moments

137
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,880
but i want to emphasize that what we're

138
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,880
focusing on here

139
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,000
is what can be called experience

140
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,639
in philosophical terms uh buddhism is

141
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,680
epistemological or it would be possible

142
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,840
this practice we're doing is

143
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,400
epistemological

144
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,400
i think what that means is that it's a

145
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,080
nature of how we ex

146
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,000
how we know something or the nature of

147
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,720
the experience we have itself

148
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,840
and so as opposed to ontological which

149
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,120
is

150
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,120
having some understanding or belief or

151
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,160
interpretation

152
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,280
about the nature of reality so

153
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,479
many people want to assume or believe

154
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,520
that insight practice brings us a deep

155
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,199
insight into the nature of reality

156
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,039
and it can be very reassuring to feel

157
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,600
like we have that kind of deep powerful

158
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,880
understanding the buddha seemed very

159
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,199
reluctant to make any ontological

160
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,840
statements about the nature of reality

161
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,639
he was not an early physicist who

162
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,319
understood the physics you know in my

163
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,000
nuclear physics of what was really going

164
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,120
on

165
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,199
he was a scientist he was a scientist he

166
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,840
was a scientist of perception

167
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,319
of how the nature of perception nature

168
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,960
of how we experience things

169
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,919
which is uh an interface of what it's a

170
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,600
meeting place

171
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,599
of what's happening in the world out

172
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,720
there

173
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,520
and and our perceptions how the mind

174
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,960
takes it in

175
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,440
and so it's a nature of experience now

176
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,120
this can be a little bit

177
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,400
feel complicated a little bit

178
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,639
discouraging because we want to have

179
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,800
certainty about the world out there

180
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,520
but everything we know about the world

181
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,800
happens through the

182
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,840
filter through the the avenue

183
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,520
of our experience how we experience

184
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,479
something

185
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,759
it's kind of like if there's an

186
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,680
hourglass the

187
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,080
one wide end end of the wire that when

188
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,120
you know broad

189
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,080
cup of the hourglass is the expanded

190
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,240
world outside of us

191
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,000
and the other end of it expanded

192
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,639
kind of cone of the hourglass is the

193
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,240
huge inner world

194
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,440
that we have but the the

195
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,880
the neck of the hourglass is

196
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,199
what we see through our eyes what we

197
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,960
hear through our ears

198
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,800
smell through our nose taste through our

199
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,280
tongue feel through our body

200
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,560
and then what is known

201
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,360
about what's happening in the mind the

202
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,680
knowing the experience of knowing

203
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,360
or recognizing what's happening in the

204
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,680
mind one way or the other

205
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,120
everything that we know has gone through

206
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,919
those six kind of hourglasses of

207
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,599
perception

208
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,160
and then with that the inner world can

209
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,720
make

210
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,280
it complicated and we can invent new

211
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,039
ideas and stories and

212
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,680
connections and all kinds of things so

213
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,120
but we don't we don't

214
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,319
remember or don't recognize that

215
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,520
it all had its genesis in that realm

216
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,759
of hearing seeing so for example

217
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,719
language

218
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,440
and concepts and words for things had to

219
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,800
we had to have some

220
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,279
you know that had to come through

221
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,479
hearing someone speak

222
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,000
those words or reading those words

223
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,480
and so the buddha made tremendous

224
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,680
emphasis

225
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,880
on this kind of in a sense this narrow

226
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,680
neck of the hourglass where everything

227
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,519
is coming in

228
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,120
and rather than seeing it as an

229
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,240
hourglass we see it as the foundation

230
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,480
upon which everything is built inside

231
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,360
and sometimes outside as well

232
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,200
and and so what is it that is the common

233
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,240
characteristic

234
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,320
of experience and it's anita

235
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,440
that all the experiences

236
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,480
are coming and going they're changing

237
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,240
their they appear and they disappear

238
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,320
the details the fingerprints of

239
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,440
experience

240
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,880
appear and disappear moment by moment

241
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,279
and sometimes it's because what's out

242
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,399
there

243
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,839
is passing by really quickly and

244
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,720
or not so quickly but clearly passes by

245
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,160
we have here i think some of you can

246
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,800
hear that

247
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,360
sometimes the train whistles going by

248
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,000
they come

249
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,440
and they go they come and they go and

250
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,120
and so it's pretty easy to notice that

251
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,360
those come and go

252
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,680
but but also the way as i said yesterday

253
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,800
the way that we they bring attention to

254
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,760
something

255
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,320
we very rarely fixate the attention in

256
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,560
some solid hard way

257
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,160
because if we do that it tends to be

258
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,000
strainful it's stress

259
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
stressful but that very gently the mind

260
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,279
the awareness

261
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,959
is kind of moving around and taking in

262
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,640
different details

263
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,079
and it's fascinating to do this with

264
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,640
physical pain where pain can you know

265
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,320
can feel from a distance like it's just

266
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,680
solid and

267
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,120
we're really kind of connected

268
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,959
we're connected to it and uh

269
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,240
and then uh we will um

270
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,720
the um um

271
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,760
but if we really pay careful attention

272
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,279
this observing way

273
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,120
we see the experience of pain is a

274
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,200
kaleidoscope of all kinds of sensations

275
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,000
going on arising and passing

276
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,399
and this arising and passing is

277
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,760
repetitive

278
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,839
so some things come and they go and they

279
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,240
return they come and they go

280
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,279
and um and so that can give

281
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,079
lend a sense of continuity and even a

282
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,040
sense of

283
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,360
permanence like they're not stopping

284
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,440
they're continuously there

285
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,519
but as we drop deeper and deeper into

286
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,959
this deep subtleness

287
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,920
of meditation and able to observe

288
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,360
intimately and closely everything

289
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,800
without

290
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,480
without the mind making the leap

291
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,079
making the constructing the idea of

292
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,760
continuity

293
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,839
then we just see the arising and passing

294
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,040
of phenomena

295
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,360
and the repetitive nature of it the

296
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,000
inconstant nature of it

297
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,200
and and so

298
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,440
the word anicha a-n-i-c-c-a

299
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,959
comes from the the root nicha

300
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,120
which means uh it can mean something

301
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,959
like constant

302
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,240
continuous and also sometimes maybe

303
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,839
permanent

304
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,880
and the a is is a negative prefix so not

305
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,200
constant not continuous not permanent

306
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,440
when we translate this as impermanent as

307
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,200
done often in english

308
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,560
it suggests that uh very many people

309
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,680
hear that as meaning

310
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,279
it's not going to last it's going to

311
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,959
come to an end

312
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,720
and it's kind of you know to be

313
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,920
constantly reminded everything's going

314
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,120
to come to an end

315
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,000
it maybe can be even depressing or and

316
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,320
also it kind of misses the boat

317
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,639
because um we have to then we just

318
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,399
expect and wait some things take a while

319
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,839
to end

320
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,160
and while it can be wise to be

321
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,920
understanding and recognize that things

322
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,440
will end there's a lot of wisdom to that

323
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,519
it's not the full story or it's not

324
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,279
really what the buddha is pointing to

325
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,560
as an insight the core insight of

326
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,560
insight meditation is to see the

327
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,040
inconstancy

328
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,240
of experience moment by moment how it it

329
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,480
arises and disappears arises and

330
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,920
disappears

331
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,440
so anitcha as as one of the core

332
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,639
insights

333
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,519
is probably better translated as

334
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,160
inconstancy

335
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,560
to the inconstant arising of passing a

336
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,639
phenomenon

337
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,160
that there might be continuous a

338
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,240
continuous constant

339
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,519
inconstancy constant continuous things

340
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,560
being inconstant like a river is

341
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,120
constant it's continually flowing but

342
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,839
it's also

343
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,240
never the same there's been inconstant

344
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,160
about it as well

345
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,200
and um so

346
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,040
nice enough for now so um

347
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,360
so we're entering into this deep world

348
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,040
of insight now

349
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,720
and um and uh and hopefully you'll begin

350
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,639
appreciating the observation of

351
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,160
inconstancy

352
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,839
thank you
