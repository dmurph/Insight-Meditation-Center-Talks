00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,200
hello everyone and welcome to this meditation

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:11,960
session and um for this morning I'd like

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:20,119
to um say something about the importance of

4
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:25,800
safety that uh when

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,039
our psychophysical system our body and mind

6
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,960
really feels safe something settles

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,760
deeply something relaxes in the body the heart the mind that

8
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:48,520
supports the deepening of the Dharma life deepening of

9
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,840
meditation and for many people a fair amount

10
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:01,359
of feeling not safe feeling anxious or afraid

11
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:07,759
it doesn't have to do with here and now sometimes with anxiety it has to do

12
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:14,240
with predictions or assumptions or imaginations of the

13
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:20,720
future and sometimes it's a deep conditioning from things that have

14
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:28,119
happened in the past which are no longer happening now and these forms of not feeling safe

15
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:33,200
or feeling afraid need our care need our love need our

16
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:43,119
attention for sure and at the same time it's uh we can also remind

17
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:50,040
ourselves that there is safety here and now that hopefully when you sit down to

18
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:56,799
meditate you're sitting at at a time in a place in a situation

19
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,840
where it's relatively safe

20
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:09,800
and that that for now for here and now it's

21
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,879
possible to remind yourself of that safety that it's a offering that you

22
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:22,480
make to yourself give yourself not to dismiss the fears and anxieties not

23
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,680
to um but to put them in

24
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:34,760
context to allow settling and a peacefulness that maybe can

25
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:41,560
hold anxieties with a generosity a care a

26
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:50,800
love where we're not so caught in them we're not so under their

27
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,599
influence but rather our fears and anxieties come come under the

28
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:05,840
influence of our ability to offer safety care

29
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,159
love where we're independent of them the influences and direction of us to them

30
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:18,239
not our anxieties to us so as we sit this

31
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,640
today um to the degree to which here and now

32
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:30,920
in the room the place you're sitting at this particular time not in an hour hour not later in

33
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:36,760
the day but here and now there is a degree of safety or

34
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,760
Tranquility or peace

35
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,599
here around you in

36
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:56,159
you not to override the fear as I said but in addition to it so we're not so

37
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,200
caught in the fear we hold it in The Wider context

38
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,480
and this is one of the gifts of meditation and the deeper the meditation

39
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:13,439
goes the more maybe indirectly without it being an

40
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:20,239
intention we are creating the conditions within of deeper and deeper feelings of

41
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:29,880
peace and safety so something deeper and deeper can let go and relax and open up

42
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,919
so like we did yesterday I'll let this meditation be mostly

43
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:43,680
silent so that uh you can maybe remind

44
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:50,320
yourself to the degree of the safety that's here and

45
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,880
now and um and if there's not then

46
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:02,680
maybe call on your love and compassion for that your

47
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:11,880
care so when your this meditation when you find yourself drifting off in thought wandering away from the present

48
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:18,479
moment wandering away from the breath it might very well be an

49
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:24,280
opportune time to gently remind yourself of the safety

50
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,319
that's is here maybe saying the word gently to

51
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:37,280
yourself safe safe and then return here and now to the

52
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:43,639
breathing to the present moment and the value of this is often

53
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:49,720
what takes us away from the present moment might be some kind of anxiety or

54
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:57,400
fears something like not feeling safe and if something else takes us away

55
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,919
from the present moment it still might be settling easier to

56
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:05,160
come

57
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:15,639
back if you say the word safe reminding yourself of that so we'll

58
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:18,840
sit silently today

59
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560

60

if you are distracted if you're flowing along with your

thoughts consider where whether or not you're

79
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:07,279
better off returning to whatever degree of safety and

80
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:13,959
peace There Is Here and Now whatever degree you find it in your

81
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:22,000
body in your heart your mind or in the location you're

82
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:29,639
sitting here and now helping you to stay

83
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:38,040
stay here and now flowing in the present

84
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:46,199
moment instead of flowing in your thought with your

85
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839

for for

102
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:48,480
and then as we come to the end of this

103
00:26:52,120 --> 00:27:04,200
sitting to recognize or feel any degree of calm or peace or

104
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,398
safety that's currently available for

105
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:18,320
you maybe somewhere in the body the heart the

106
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:28,760
mind maybe if you gently say the word safe something in you resonates smiles

107
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,600
recognizes

108
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:47,720
it our body and mind benefits from

109
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:55,080
bathing in the sense of safety that we can

110
00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:03,559
provide here and now that we can touch into here and

111
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:12,880
now and then imagine now bringing

112
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:20,039
safety peace to others the gift of

113
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:28,200
safety so that people feel safe when they're with us

114
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:40,320
they don't feel any assertion from us any demands they don't feel a need to take

115
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:47,679
care of us or worry about us

116
00:28:49,519 --> 00:29:00,039
or protect themselves from us very simple gift of safety

117
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,799
that comes from being peaceful at ease settled in

118
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,960
ourselves may it be that we go through the

119
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:25,399
day creating safety offering safety to this

120
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:34,080
world where so many people feel UNS safe may all beings be

121
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,799
happy may all beings be

122
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:49,398
safe may all beings be peaceful may all beings be

123
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:58,398
free and to the degree that we know something about these four states

124
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,480
may we create the conditions for others to have the

125
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,829
[Music]

126
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:30,960
same thank you e

127
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:25,039
so hello and welcome to this third of five talks

128
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:31,399
um uh focusing on the poems of the

129
00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:37,679
earliest female Disciples of the Buddha the ones that became fully awakened the

130
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:43,919
early nuns and yesterday um the poem that I

131
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:52,000
read had uh involved a conversation between kisag goami and

132
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,799
pachara and pachara the a pachara the venerable pachara

133
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:05,519
uh was probably one of the most important uh women teachers and in the

134
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:12,399
time of the Buddha there's more references to her being a teacher especially to other nuns other women

135
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:19,880
than there is U to any other woman at the time of the Buddha these early texts and so there's in in these poems

136
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:25,600
there's a number of poems that refer to her including one which is her own poem

137
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:33,080
which is her Enlightenment poem and um it um and so I'd like to read

138
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:39,360
that and describes um and you know uh yesterday I told her a little bit of her

139
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:46,360
about her story uh where she had um phenomenal degrees of suffering with the

140
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:53,360
death of her whole family in the course of one day or learning about it over the course of one day and two young child

141
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:59,519
children her husband her parents her brother and um

142
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:05,960
and so um so she became a

143
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:11,919
nun but maybe it wasn't so easy for her even as such she practiced diligently

144
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:17,398
and so this is her story that she tells in a

145
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:25,200
poem and she's um talking about herself this is what she was

146
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:33,120
thinking young men gain wealth by plowing

147
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:40,120
Fields sewing seeds in the ground caring for children and

148
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:46,360
wife but why is it that I thorough in virtuous

149
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:52,960
conduct doing the Buddha's instruction not lazy or

150
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:59,720
proud have not attained release have not attained

151
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:08,878
neana with feet washed I wa W I watched the water the

152
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:16,280
foot washing water flowing from High Ground to low so she's sitting outside

153
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:21,720
and she's doing what is as common in the ancient world as

154
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:28,320
um as maybe for hopefully for us is for washing our hands through the day and um

155
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:37,440
people walked around Barefoot so they were cleaning their feet off and with feet washed I watched the water

156
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:43,919
the foot washing water flowing from High Ground to

157
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:54,599
low with this the Mind concentrated and like a thoroughbred

158
00:34:54,599 --> 00:35:04,680
horse with this the Mind concentrated like a thoroughbred horse taking an oil lamp I entered my

159
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:11,880
Hut looking over the bed I sat down on the bed taking a

160
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:17,960
needle I pulled out the wick as the flame went

161
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:26,280
out the mind was freed so this is a story of a person who

162
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:31,320
practiced diligently sincerely but perhaps there was a way in

163
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:37,000
which he was a little bit more uh trying too

164
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,920
hard um and uh maybe too diligent and so

165
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:50,240
sitting down to wash her feet uh and then watching the she probably poured the water out or poured it over her feet

166
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:56,720
and then watching the water flowing down the hill uh uh she became concentrated

167
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:03,720
she kind of lost her self-consciousness it was something about the movement of the water flowing that pulled her into

168
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:11,119
the world of the water flowing like being absorbed and watching the water flow in a river going by and so doing

169
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:16,359
something completely unselfconscious it a simple ordinary thing putting down the

170
00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:23,560
effort to practice um almost like because she would had this momentum maybe of a strong mind strong practice

171
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:29,040
mind um when she put something to rest and just got absorbed in the water

172
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:35,880
flowing down her mind became concentrated and uh and then she entered

173
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:44,880
into her Hut there was no windows back then so the Huts maybe it was evening and the Hut was particularly dark and um

174
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:50,079
and this kind of Simplicity the radical Simplicity of just looking at her

175
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:58,560
bed people who get concentrated look they they can see things and everything stands out sharply clearly for itself

176
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:04,880
there's um you know you see a flower wow just a flower you see an ordinary device

177
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:10,160
the cup you drink water out of it's just like ju just that the

178
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:17,760
pristine Perfection of a cup or a flower or or um anything at all and when you're

179
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:24,040
concentrated you kind of see in a different way and here is you just seeing something ordinary her

180
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:31,119
bed um and then she sat down on that bed and because it was dark she had an oil

181
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:39,280
lamp and the oil lamp is a you know it's oil and it has a little Wick that's coming out of the out of the oil and in

182
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:44,440
order to turn off the light she didn't flick a switch she pulls the wick out of

183
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:52,200
the oil and um and then the flame went out and in a concentrated mine she was

184
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:57,560
just right there for the flame just like she had been for the bed and and um

185
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:04,480
maybe the whole world was just that flame that light and something about when the light went

186
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:10,400
out something in her mind let go and she was

187
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:19,000
freed um some kind of peaceful focus on something like a flame maybe as the flame went out even

188
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:27,560
that Focus kind of evaporated or dissolved and there was a deeper letting go and then she was free

189
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:34,319
so uh that's pachara story and uh and I love that it has to do with these very

190
00:38:34,319 --> 00:38:42,160
ordinary moments that we're liberating and there's a long history in Buddhism of recognizing that um Liberation

191
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:47,839
doesn't necessarily happen as we're practicing but as we practice we're

192
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:53,359
creating the conditions the concentration the Stillness the peace the sense of

193
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:58,520
safety that uh when we're least expecting it

194
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:05,040
um there is something can let go deeply we're right here and we let go so that's

195
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:13,599
pachara story and uh and then there's a two poems or maybe more where she um is the

196
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:18,640
teacher for a woman or for a nun and

197
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:24,920
um and uh she kind of refers back to this her first poem the the the way she

198
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:30,599
is thinking and and uh little experience of washing the feet and um and this

199
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:35,760
makes sense uh teachers often will teach from their own experience from how they

200
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:42,480
were thinking about things and then they're that worked for them and they're kind of offering that to others and so

201
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:49,640
she starts by um referring back to her own reflection about a young man young

202
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:57,440
men who work hard and can then support their family um as a as a represent

203
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:03,599
sense or's a metaphor for um for a practitioner can also engage fully and

204
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:10,560
and hard in order to uh become free so she writes or she she

205
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:17,560
says um uh and this is this poem is supposed to be that she's teaching to 30

206
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:22,720
nuns and um and uh or the word is 30

207
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:28,640
some approximately 30 uh nuns she says

208
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:36,800
taking a pistol young men P pound

209
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:42,079
grain so caring for their children and

210
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:49,359
wife they gain wealth young men gain

211
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:56,240
wealth do what the Buddha teaches having done it you won't regret

212
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:03,680
it quick wash your feet sit to one

213
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:08,838
side and settle on a tranquil

214
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:18,240
mind do what the Buddha teaches and then as a narrator for the

215
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:25,960
rest of uh the next two verses narrator says hearing these words of pacha's

216
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:31,200
teaching the nuns washed their feet sat to one

217
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:36,240
side settled on a tranquil mind they did

218
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:43,440
what the Buddha teaches during the first watch of the night they recollected their past lives

219
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:50,240
during the middle watch of the night they purified the Divine eye during the last watch of the night they shattered

220
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:57,920
the mass of darkness and then the 30 nuns said

221
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:03,440
to pachara um well narrator goes on

222
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,680
standing up the 309s bowed down to her feet and

223
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:16,440
said we have accomplished your instruction we will live honoring you as

224
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:22,680
the 30 gods honor the great God Indra who is unconquered in

225
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:28,599
battle free of taints we have the three

226
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:34,880
knowledges so the simple poem where the pachara encourages them to practice they

227
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:40,559
do and and not only do they attain Liberation but this is a remarkable

228
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:46,400
thing about these poems the confidence the clarity the possibility that uh of

229
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:53,440
uh of spiritual maturation that uh is championed here they attain the same

230
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:59,079
level of Liberation as the Buddha these three watch of the night the first two

231
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:04,160
watches are something something that Buddha is supposed to have attained the night of his

232
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:09,480
Awakening the recollection of past lives uh the Divine eye which is seeing how

233
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:19,520
people are born and die according to their karma and uh and then um the um um the

234
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:28,040
the here is the shattering the mass of Darkness Liberation and uh and uh the first two

235
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:33,680
watches that those are not required to be awake to be liberated but to be a

236
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:39,800
Buddha fully full potential like a Buddha this is what one attains and the

237
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:45,319
three knowledges they're called and um and so here they the this is also

238
00:43:45,319 --> 00:43:50,599
possible and the women are pointing this out they too have

239
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:58,240
this and um so then uh there's one more that pachara teaching to a woman

240
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:06,160
named utara taking a pestel young men pound grain caring for children and wives they

241
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:13,760
gain wealth apply yourself to what the Buddha teaches you will have no regrets quick

242
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:19,880
wash your feet and sit to one side having established the Mind unified

243
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:28,119
and well settled consider mental constructs as not self as something other

244
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:33,880
than self then utara says I heard her words

245
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:40,559
pacha's advice I washed my feet and sat to the side during the first watch of

246
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:47,400
the night I recollected my past lives during the middle watch of the night I purified the Divine eye during the last

247
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:53,839
watch of the night I shattered the mass of Darkness I then emerged owed with the

248
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:59,359
three knowledges then addressing

249
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:05,160
pachara I have accomplished what you instructed I will live honoring

250
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:11,760
you free of taints I have the three knowledges so I love these two these

251
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:20,400
poems that patara becoming awake and then her teaching the other nuns and then uh in

252
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:27,119
their appreciation of what they were taught that uh they will honor her they

253
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:33,160
rever her respect her for her gift and um and so here we get a sense

254
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:38,960
of uh of um at least for you know of ancient nuns we get a sense of one of

255
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:44,680
the most important teachers of the time of the Buddha and um how she was engaged

256
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:51,880
and engaged with teaching it's one thing to say in in Buddhist Traditions that a woman could

257
00:45:51,880 --> 00:46:00,040
be enlightened it turns out it's another thing to say that it's okay for them to be a teacher and there are traditions

258
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:06,680
where they say women can be enlightened but there's still a kind of a discrimination against women uh than

259
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:17,040
stepping up into the teacher role and here we have these wonderful stories of uh of not only a none a woman

260
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:23,640
who is a teacher but an Effective Teacher a teacher that can uh guide

261
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:30,079
people support people to their own Awakening so um

262
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:37,760
pachara so thank you thank all of you thank pachara thank all the lineage of nuns

263
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:43,800
and women teachers down Through the Ages who um upon whose shoulders we stand as

264
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:48,720
well so thank you very much
