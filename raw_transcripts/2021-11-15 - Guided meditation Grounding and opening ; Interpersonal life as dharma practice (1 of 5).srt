9
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,960
around um the theme of uh sort of dharma in our interpersonal

10
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,119
life and so um yeah that

11
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,400
is really a kind of invitation to to make this this one

12
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,159
this one week a kind of laboratory where we explore

13
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:26,720
our um yeah the place of of these like core teachings of of the of of buddhism

14
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:33,520
silas ahmadi panya ethics mind training and wisdom

15
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,200
in our interpersonal life so that's the the uh the invitation

16
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,560
to consider this a little bit of a kind of immersive practice ground

17
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,840
for this week so uh

18
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:57,720
that's um that's uh that's it i'll say more about all of this

19
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:52,760
so settling into this familiarity and this freshness

20
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:13,319
the buzzing blooming aliveness of your body

21
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,959
we establish some sense of of groundedness

22
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,599
the downward pull of gravity

23
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,440
the settling effects of

24
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,759
the exhalation

25
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:53,560
the million consolations of the dhamma

26
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,000
we ground ourselves

27
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,880
and then open

28
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:56,120
the whole body as if bathed in awareness

29
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,560
no matter what is known

30
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:50,720
knowing is happening something in us

31
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:59,240
let's down relax us

32
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,529
[Music]

33
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:38,759
just giving a radical permission for the winds of feeling to blow as they blow

34
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,160
knowing

35
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:02,200
they won't blow anything over inside of us

36
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,480
and so imperfection

37
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:34,120
becomes our vehicle for peace

38
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:39,960
each moment in its own weird little way

39
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:48,520
beckons us towards peace

40
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,160
so we find our ground

41
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:42,559
and we renounce all our agendas around

42
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:50,840
fixing acquiring becoming

43
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,679
improving tweaking optimizing

44
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,399
we find our ground

45
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:20,679
we renounce the agenda

46
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,799
we let the logic of the dharma

47
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,799
unfold through our heart

48
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,399
do

49
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:31,600
so thank you it's good to uh

50
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,120
get to practice together

51
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,640
so tony kushner said

52
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:48,399
the smallest indivisible human unit is two people not

53
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:56,720
one one is a fiction from such nets of souls societies the

54
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,158
social world human life springs

55
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,799
so

56
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:16,159
sometimes when i give a talk about self-clinging the topic for today but

57
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:23,679
i give a talk on on that theme i tell a story of um visiting a local sangha

58
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:29,840
here in the bay area and um being sort of introduced in this grand

59
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:35,559
very generous way um

60
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:44,640
of uh maybe even in inflating or sort of like really celebratory bio kind of uh

61
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:51,679
introduction but on that particular night i had managed to show up this is pre-coveted i

62
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:58,159
had managed to show up to teach a meditation class with my zipper down

63
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:06,159
which i think we can all agree is the cardinal sin of mindfulness yeah

64
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:11,440
to uh not be properly dressed you know leaving the

65
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:18,720
house right this is uh this is not a sign of uh profound mindfulness right

66
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,080
so the juxtaposition of this kind of lovely intro and like the cardinal sin

67
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:30,159
of mindfulness something about that yeah

68
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:35,679
nobody is their bio and

69
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,960
we can only ever look good on paper

70
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:48,240
and i thought to share that as the framing for this week actually because

71
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:55,919
the relational world is a bit like that

72
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:01,679
our habits will not be concealed and

73
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:08,640
it's incredibly beautiful and incredibly rich the interpersonal realm

74
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:15,039
the learning and the healing it's um uh

75
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:21,840
just so much beauty is on offer and of course no one

76
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:29,120
no one escapes with their dignity fully intact right we should just give

77
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:36,240
up hope for that yeah this is a realm of of humility and

78
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:42,799
longing and ecstasy and loss and courage and

79
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:49,518
vulnerability and shame and grace and healing

80
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,360
yeah this is the realm we're entering into to consider

81
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:06,799
and so other people other people are are like steroids for the paramis and the

82
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:13,919
khaleesas yeah the the wholesome beautiful qualities of our

83
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:19,760
heart and our habits of suffering so the uh

84
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:25,519
emotion scientist um lisa feldman barrett says the best thing for a human nervous

85
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:34,080
system is another human and the worst thing for a human nervous system is another human

86
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:41,760
our life is is relational

87
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:49,440
sending and receiving sending pain receiving pain sending love

88
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:55,279
receiving love and of course in the beginning our our

89
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:01,440
very life depends on the care of others and that you know we we don't survive without

90
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:07,840
that care and so that that forges a deeply relational being

91
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:14,079
and the sense of belonging of relatedness that is fundamental

92
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:20,800
and if it's fundamental in the sense that if it is frustrated we suffer

93
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:27,599
yeah now as we begin this exploration i'm aware

94
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:36,398
that some of you may be feeling like you have too much contact others feeling like you have too little

95
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:41,919
and i hope this week is is relevant across the whole spectrum from those

96
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:46,800
feeling too much to those feeling lonely

97
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,638
um we try to get the amount the amount of contact just right but we

98
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:59,359
can never exactly dial that perfectly either

99
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:08,800
so some of meditation we do i would say only

100
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:16,560
only for itself it doesn't need to translate whatsoever it doesn't need to translate

101
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:23,280
into the next moment into the rest of our life it doesn't need to translate into the interpersonal realm

102
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,560
we sit and we experience the blessings of that

103
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:34,240
and that is enough yeah if it doesn't

104
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:40,640
if it doesn't function as the seed for something else that would be enough

105
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:46,320
and and some of what's developed on the cushion

106
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:52,480
uh needs to translate to we want it to translate to the rest of

107
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:58,000
our life especially our interpersonal life where

108
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,640
which is such a deep realm of practice yeah where where as i was saying the

109
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:10,480
what is evoked in us is so profound

110
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:16,400
and so other people other people we take this as a kind of formal realm of

111
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:24,160
practice um other people help us see how we're not

112
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:31,200
free where we have maybe overestimated our freedom

113
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:38,320
and other people help us through their love become more

114
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:44,880
free and this is the zone i feel where we investigate

115
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:50,880
where our insight has stabilized and where it has not stabilized

116
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:58,320
right we have an insight and we grow in our ease our freedom our care

117
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:04,000
uh we grow in the paramis but

118
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:11,520
then sometimes we recognize oh that's not actually stable maybe we know maybe

119
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:17,680
we've seen a thousand times a million times that greed and hatred are dead

120
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:24,160
ends but then [Music] all the sudden

121
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:31,359
they seem kind of appetizing yeah where has our insights stabilized and

122
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:37,760
where hasn't it you know sometimes

123
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:45,680
i entertain this um delusion about how

124
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:51,838
buttoned up my whole inner life is yeah

125
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:57,920
and then disrupting that is

126
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:06,960
a moment of seeing you know seeing just how glued together that delusion is

127
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:14,000
or a dream that seems too potent to be meaningless

128
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:19,800
or a reaction that takes me by surprise

129
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:27,200
and i want to have and i want to encourage all of us to have a measure of

130
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:34,880
fidelity to those realizations to the the ways in which the

131
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:40,240
the autobiography is punctured by moments

132
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:48,000
many of which are inter personal and when i teach you know i try

133
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,000
never to forget my freedom nor to forget my suffering

134
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,160
to have fidelity to all of that

135
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:06,800
so the interpersonal realm is uh is a realm of seeing what has stabilized

136
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,440
in us and what hasn't what has been realized

137
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,760
this is eve uh eucedric

138
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:23,520
i i still hadn't realized it that it hadn't succeeded in becoming

139
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:30,800
real to me real in the same register as a living room is real

140
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,920
that's the sense in which i want to discuss reality today she writes

141
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:42,880
reality not as what's true but as what's realized what is or has become

142
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:48,320
real where is the gap between knowing

143
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:55,440
something and realizing it taking it as real to practice buddhism after all is to

144
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:02,400
spend all the time you can in the attempt to realize a set of understandings most of whose

145
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:09,040
propositional contents are familiar to you from the beginning of your practice

146
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:15,680
the intensiveness of different buddhist traditions testifies to the centrality

147
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:22,400
of the project of realization to the sense of how normal it is

148
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,920
for realization to lag behind knowledge by months

149
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,960
or eons

150
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:42,240
dharma is not about knowledge but uh realization

151
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:49,119
to make these teachings real real to your heart

152
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:55,119
real such that you feel the freedom of it real such that they are

153
00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:04,839
they are realized they are stabilized and the interpersonal realm is a

154
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:10,720
very potent field for the exploration

155
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:17,200
of what has been realized and so we take this you know

156
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:23,920
and the gimmick of just a week intensive right on the interpersonal life but we take

157
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,200
this i invite you in to take this like as a

158
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:36,400
um a serious uh inquiry yeah a loving inquiry

159
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,760
where okay i make this a realm of practice for this week

160
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:49,319
i really want to actually investigate

161
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:54,720
and so we approach the the whole question of

162
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:02,240
our interpersonal life the the maybe the the deep strong relationships

163
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:08,400
that we have the you know the casual encounters that we have we approach all

164
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:14,640
of it with respect and wonder and freshness

165

of understanding and forgiveness and

172
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,960
that sense of not being moralistic about our inner life not being moralistic

about our interpersonal life that frees us up to investigate yeah to

look more deeply with more fidelity

what gets soothed what gets activated

notice all of that with care how do you how do you feel about

178
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:36,000
yourself when you're with others what ideas become more dominant what begins

179
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:43,839
to recede in your mind yeah what who do you take yourself to be

180
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:50,160
in the interpersonal realm does the dharma feel more

181
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:56,720
or less alive when you're with others versus when alone
