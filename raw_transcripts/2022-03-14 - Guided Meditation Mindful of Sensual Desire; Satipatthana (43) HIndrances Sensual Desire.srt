1
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:12,240
so hello everyone and welcome to our monday morning

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:20,000
meditation time together and um to introduce the meditation today

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,240
i want to evoke the idea that over these last

4
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:33,520
you know i guess it's been maybe close to 10 months we've been going through the sati patana

5
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,879
sutta the discourse the buddhist teachings on the four foundations

6
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,480
for awareness and

7
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,559
if we take this text uh to describe a journey of deepening one's meditation practice or

8
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:58,480
if you don't like the metaphor of deepening uh i'm very fond of the idea of clarifying

9
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,320
meditation becoming clear in our awareness awareness becomes clearer and clearer cultivating greater

10
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:11,520
clarity and so if as we develop greater clarity in

11
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,520
practice so we get quieter and stiller as a line as a mind is less caught up in

12
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,680
its preoccupations there's a new opportunity in practice

13
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:30,400
and as we come into the fourth foundation um it's best i think it's best to think

14
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:37,200
of this as building on what's happening earlier or building on a mind that is

15
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:44,000
has the ability to be quite clear or quite still calm

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,680
concentrated or deep or whatever whatever way you like to see this for yourself

17
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,920
and um and so then we start to see at some point this if so for example in the

18
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:04,560
in the third foundation we talked about the expanded mind the mind that awareness and the mind kind of

19
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,720
coterminous where awareness becomes quite expansive

20
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,319
then we can start because of seeing that and knowing that we can become aware of how the mind gets

21
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:24,720
contracted how the mind gets tight or narrow again or the more clarity we have the more

22
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:31,840
sensitive we are to how movements of the mind uh causes us to lose that clarity

23
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,200
how we become more uh things become more obscure or or

24
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,800
hidden or difficult to see if we like the idea of stillness the

25
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:49,440
mind becomes stiller or calmer that we see how the mind gets activated again agitated

26
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:57,200
restless so whether mind gets constricted or restless or

27
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,720
obscured we don't see that the clarity as the ma as the practice continues at

28
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,920
some point we have a reference point for seeing these movements of the mind

29
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,040
that take us away from our best interest to take us away from

30
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:20,239
the continued unfolding of the practice and uh it's one thing to be constantly

31
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:26,560
caught up in for example sensual desires and desires of all kind and hardly know we're doing it

32
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,560
but it's another thing if we're still enough quiet enough to be able to see

33
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,000
the mind getting caught in sensual desires and desires

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,120
and wanting things and it's a very different perspective

35
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,799
very different vantage point to just be lost and trying to find your way out

36
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,400
to be able to see it that has a particular mental phenomena activity of the mind

37
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,760
desire there it's coming i can see the impact it has on me i can see how it's

38
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,840
hindering or obscuring the clarity of the mind the wisdom of the mind

39
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:12,480
and and it's almost easier to see it if we have

40
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,919
if we have some kind of either direct or memory access

41
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:24,560
to what it's like to have a mind that's free of say for example sensual desire and we can see it oh there it is

42
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,600
it's a particular phenomena it's not the whole universe it's not i'm it's not

43
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,199
that i'm living or identified or caught completely in this universe of desire

44
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,400
look at that it's desire that sensual desire

45
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:48,638
and then it's a whole different game a whole different way of being it's moving towards freedom

46
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,680
so uh we'll sit a little bit and the first hindrance is sensual desire desire for comfort

47
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:02,479
a desire for sensuality sensual pleasures and

48
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:10,800
and so at some point during the meditation i'll introduce to you the idea of noticing

49
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:18,080
if there is essential desire essential desire arises and for you to see if you can see it

50
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:24,400
with whatever degree of clarity or stillness or calm that you have so you see it for what it is

51
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,320
as opposed to be it or you know enter into that world of desire it's

52
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:36,240
almost like you the mind is not bigger or wider or stiller and you can see oh their

53
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:43,280
essential desire so taking an alert posture

54
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,599
and gently closing your eyes

55
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,960
and perhaps as if it's your body's wish and you're following through in it so

56
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:08,800
it's arising from the inside let yourself take as deep a breath as the body wants

57
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,000
it's taking as deep as breath as the body wants and then

58
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,840
exhale as long as the body wants

59
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,000
breathing in deeply relaxing

60
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,800
the body maybe even relaxing

61
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,240
following the lead of where the body wants to relax

62
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,240
soften

63
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:25,680
as you exhale let your breathing will now return to

64
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,680
normal

65
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:45,120
and then as you exhale letting the mind become

66
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,720
as quiet and still as it might want

67
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:58,440
in the depths of the mind in the place where the mind can rest

68
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,039
let the mind become as quiet as it wants

69
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:41,839
and then following breathing

70
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,080
the simplicity of the body breathing

71
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:53,959
and perhaps as you breathe following the in-breaths the out-breaths

72
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,040
follow also

73
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:08,360
the path in front of you to becoming quieter and stiller

74
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:17,600
through the path within you with each in-breath and out-breath

75
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:25,120
supporting your inner life

76
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,480
to follow the the invitation the welcoming

77
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:40,959
to becoming quieter and softer quieter in thinking

78
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,519
softer in the heart

79
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:55,120
gently following the call the welcome

80
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,839
to that place of greater quiet and stillness

81
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,839
letting go of thoughts as you exhale

82
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,959
maybe at the end of the exhale allowing yourself to come to a quiet

83
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,959
place

84
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:09,600
and then as you continue sitting notice

85
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:19,600
if there is or is not the presence of sensual desire

86
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,799
the desire for comfort

87
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:31,279
for pleasure even in the meditation itself

88
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,080
if there is notice what that's like

89
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,760
if there's not notice that absence

90
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:05,679
and if there is the arising of sensual desire

91
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,840
notice what it's like to see it appear

92
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:20,080
if you can let go of it and be quiet for a moment and it reappears

93
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:30,000
see it as an arising phenomenon just something coming like a sound outside

94
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:40,279
and if it goes see it go

95
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:49,799
if you can let go of it let go of it gently

96
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,399
and if there is no sensual desires

97
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:12,200
appreciate that absence

98
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,000
and as we come to the end of the sitting

99
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:12,159
as much as you might value sensual pleasures essential desires maybe are

100
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,640
innocent

101
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:26,559
there's also a clarity and a simplicity in a freedom

102
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:34,480
that comes with the absence of sensual desires sensual cravings

103
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:40,400
concerns with pleasures of all kinds

104
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:50,120
and that clarity and simplicity and freedom

105
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:01,039
is a medium in which your good will can travel

106
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,039
unobstructed

107
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:12,559
and to whatever degree you can be free right now of

108
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:21,080
concerns with desires of all kinds sensual desires desires for comfort

109
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:30,159
can you allow that space to be filled with your well wishing for this world your

110
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:37,520
care [Music] your love your compassion

111
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,840
may it be that these wishes of

112
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:55,919
well-wishing may it be they somehow touch others

113
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:03,120
seen in unseen ways may benefit them that you wish may all beings

114
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:10,080
be happy may all beings

115
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:17,360
be safe may all beings

116
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:25,480
be peaceful and may all beings be free

117
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:33,279
[Music]

118
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:41,380
[Music]

119
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,520
thank you

120
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:01,919
so good day this monday in march

121
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:08,640
and so today we're beginning the fourth foundation for

122
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:15,679
awareness fourth support for developing a heightened

123
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,720
sense of clarity awareness that

124
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:28,000
begins to move us into our potential for liberation and freedom

125
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:35,440
and all along this is kind of the direction that the satyabatana this mindfulness practice is going

126
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,480
it's going to greater clarity so that there's really clear mindfulness

127
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:47,760
i like the expression lucid mindfulness that it's not simply just you know a simple

128
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:54,480
knowing and experience there's something about the knowing which has qualities of

129
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:00,720
clarity lucidity stillness freedom non-reactivity equanimity

130
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:06,240
something that's really special about the knowing the awareness itself

131
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,960
that comes from being settled to being concentrated getting calm and having a stress heightened capacity

132
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:19,840
to be aware almost like awareness and knowing is a muscle that gets stronger

133
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:27,279
and also that comes from being less preoccupied in our attachments less preoccupied with

134
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:32,399
our concerns our preoccupations and

135
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:38,080
and then the natural capacity for knowing for awareness

136
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:44,320
can shine can be there and to have the naturalness of it there's almost a spontaneity of it or

137
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:50,159
the simplicity of it just arising and being there without a lot of agency

138
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:55,440
is one of the stepping stones of developing mindfulness at first

139
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:01,120
there's more agency and then over time it's more a matter of the agency is more about getting out of the way and letting

140
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:08,080
go and so then we come to the

141
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:13,360
fourth foundation of mindfulness and like the second and third

142
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:18,559
there's a journey through this where at the beginning it talks about the

143
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:24,480
hint the different three different ways that the mind gets caught up gets attached gets

144
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:30,960
entangled with experience and then it talks about two ways in which the mind moves towards

145
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,399
disentanglement towards freedom and so there's a kind of a journey from

146
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:43,279
being attached to uh to becoming free and that journey goes first through

147
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:49,519
what's called the five hindrances then it goes through what's called the five aggregates

148
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:56,000
then the five uh fetter the six fetters the six ways that we get entangled or

149
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:04,399
fettered knotted up in in the experiences of the senses

150
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:10,960
and then that's that's the ways we get caught up and then the freedom has to do with the

151
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:18,559
seven factors of awakening um and then the the four noble truths

152
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:24,960
and so there's a journey through this and uh i love it that we start with the ways we get caught up and

153
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:32,000
hung up and get caught because we will understand that the idea is to become wise about this

154
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,320
if you're feeling like you're supposed to quickly get to some beautiful state wonderful state

155
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:43,519
it might be that you're not going to take the time to really know yourself in a deep way and know how you get intang

156
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:48,559
gold or know the entanglement itself so that in the future you're not going

157
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:54,000
to get tricked by it if you know it well you won't be tricked and be pulled into its orbit and make

158
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,279
mistakes and all that so taking our time so this week is the

159
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:04,880
five hindrances and uh we'll do one day on each hindrance

160
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,638
but today a little bit introduction for it um

161
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:16,079
the in the teachings of the buddha the hindrances are often

162
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:21,358
paired with the seven factors of awakening these are beautiful qualities of mind

163
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:26,960
that arise as we practice so mindful awareness itself mindfulness itself

164
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:33,679
investigation effort energy joy tranquility

165
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:39,839
concentration and equanimity and many texts the buddha teaches he

166
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:46,720
puts these together where one is the problem one is what we're overcoming and the other is what grows and develops

167
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:51,839
as as a result as a instead of that

168
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:58,000
and um so these two have different uh impacts on us the hindrances

169
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:05,040
uh are uh cover over our wisdom make make wisdom difficult to have

170
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,160
access to it they contract the mind they limit the mind

171
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:18,640
the seven factors of awakening allow for the functioning of wisdom allow for an expanse of mind

172
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:24,079
open mind a free mind and so one one kind of uh pulls us down

173
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:30,240
and one lifts us up in a certain way uh an image in the suit is used for this

174
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:36,079
covering over impact effect of the hindrances is that of a tree growing in the forest

175
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:42,320
but there's a larger tree that's covering it over so the small tree doesn't get any light so

176
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,599
it's stunted it doesn't really grow and develop and the hindrances are that stunting

177
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:54,400
that covering over that keeps the light of awareness from operating clearly when the light of awareness is free then

178
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:00,160
the tree of bodhi the tree of awakening can can grow within us

179
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:05,760
and that tree is this the some people call the sap of that tree

180
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,680
are the seven factors of awakening and and so then the light of awareness

181
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:17,920
really kind of lets it grow and develop and so the idea is to

182
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,040
uh let go of or be free of these obscuring qualities of

183
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:30,079
of the hindrances so that something uh beautiful can grow and develop instead in that space

184
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:35,599
and that clearing in the forest so um

185
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,559
the um

186
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:48,960
so the the first hindrance is uh in the sutta essential desires

187
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:56,000
in this in the teachings of the buddha sometimes it's alternative thing is called

188
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,920
avariciousness wanting the thing wanting things so the first one is the usual one is

189
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:07,599
sensual desire wanting desires pleasure essential pleasures of all kinds

190
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:14,079
and and then and the alternative is wanting things to acquire things more and more

191
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:19,839
stuff both can be a big entanglement

192
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:25,520
and sometimes people just call it desire the second first hindrance to cover all

193
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:31,599
those things but the problem with calling a desire is not all desires are problematic the desire to be free of the

194
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:37,359
hindrances may be really healthy and appropriate and um

195
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:43,359
but sensual desire and wanting things wanting sensual pleasure and wanting things

196
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:49,599
there are innocent versions of this kind of desire it's innocent to want something i run out of toothpaste so i would like to

197
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:55,200
have a new tube of toothpaste it's an innocent uh maybe beautiful ways

198
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:01,040
of having uh desires for pleasure that are you know it's simple and easy and

199
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:06,400
and um so you want to cook your broccoli just to the right

200
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:11,760
you know tenderness just to the right way so that when you eat it there's pleasure eating

201
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:17,520
it it feels nourishing and delightful and and and fresh to eat it

202
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:23,440
it's it can be innocent but um but then what is not innocent

203
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,560
is desires that were grabbed by were caught by were

204
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:35,440
preoccupied by and there's a kind of a become sometimes a strong enough kind of biological

205
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:41,680
uh force within us uh behind that like sometimes it's strong enough to be like

206
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:47,520
uh propellant fuel for a a rocket it's so powerful some form of sensual desire

207
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:54,400
that you know it's almost like it's hard not to kind of follow along the strength of it

208
00:38:54,640 --> 00:39:01,760
and um and for the purposes of sati patada it's not like it's immoral or bad or

209
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:07,200
wrong to have sexual desire it's just that it just happens to be

210
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,320
that they uh it makes it difficult for this clarity of awareness to grow

211
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:19,680
this openness expanded mind to grow to this quiet stills place of freedom

212
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:27,200
to show itself and since that's what the direction we're going we want to learn how to

213
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:34,640
be mindful of sensual desire so it supports that direction it doesn't support freedom to go along

214
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:40,839
with essential desires spend time in meditation thinking about sexual fantasies thinking about food thinking

215
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:48,160
about trying to make meditation as pleasant and enjoyable as you can like to recapture a

216
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:53,920
past meditation experience where there was all kinds of wonderful

217
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:59,760
you know uh bliss in meditation and the desire for that bliss again is

218
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:06,560
just another desire for sensual pleasure and so but what we do is rather than

219
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:12,960
negating them or condemning them it's just a very clear and purposeful

220
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:19,839
and dedicated mindfulness so this essential desire essential desire is present

221
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:26,560
and then getting to know it feel it i find it very useful to feel it physically there's something about

222
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:33,200
feeling the physicality of desire that for me is very quickly shows me the

223
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:38,400
downside of it and and that the other the way in which the body is

224
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:45,200
not really it's not really pleasant to be caught in the force of sensual desire

225
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:51,119
even sensual pleasure might be pleasant the force of this drive for it

226
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:58,640
is not it's kind of a loss a kind of alienation for myself in having it there

227
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,079
and um and then know when it's absent there are times as meditation deepens

228
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:10,720
that there's no essential desire at all and this is actually very important to register that to take that in

229
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:17,680
and get to know what that's like to know that benefits the way there's clarity and freedom or ease or you can

230
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:23,040
breathe more easily or you're not being pushed by some kind of inner force

231
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:30,640
so the instructions are know when it's present and no in its absence as we know the absence of it

232
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:37,440
that gives us a new possibility and this is really getting down to the heart of what

233
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:44,960
the insight of the whole purpose of of satipattana and that is to see

234
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:51,680
and be present enough and still enough or clear enough to see how any phenomenon at all any experience at

235
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:58,160
all see it arise see it appear nothing is there all the time when

236
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:04,400
anything that be qualifies as an experience is in perception for a while

237
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:11,359
it appears and then it disappears and when the mind is quiet enough and not involved in thoughts

238
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:18,720
you can start you can start seeing this arising of sensual desire and you might see its passing

239
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:24,240
and seeing their rising um there's a easier to have a very

240
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:29,520
kind of a different freer more disentangled relationship with

241
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:35,760
potential desire when you see it first arise then if it's already there full blown

242
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:42,560
and so to be right there and see there there it is then it's easier just leave it alone

243
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:47,599
and it's easier to abandon it to let go of it

244
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:52,800
and this exercising of our capacity to let go let go of the clinging the wanting

245
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,160
the reaching for is a wonderful thing to cultivate and develop

246
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:05,760
and so the way that buddha describes working with sensual desires one knows essential desire is present

247
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:13,280
when it's present one knows it's absent when it's absence one knows that it's arising when it

248
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:19,119
arises and one knows the abandoning of it letting go of it

249
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:26,079
when it's let go of and then if that's thorough enough and deep enough then at least can lead to a

250
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:32,319
deep freedom where we realize that the sensual desire is no longer there

251
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:39,839
and is not going to arise again maybe at least in that meditation session there's such a clarity of

252
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:46,160
fullness of such full clarity such peacefulness such subtleness such

253
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:52,560
something that it's like wow this is so good i'm essential desire is not going to arise

254
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:58,400
in this context because it just feels so free the freedom is so good

255
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:05,520
so to become wise about the hindrances to

256
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:11,760
become wise about how the hindrances obscure wisdom

257
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:18,560
and the buddha said a fool who knows fools who know their fools to that

258
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:23,680
extent are wise so to use that

259
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:31,440
practitioners who know they've lost their wisdom are starting to become wise

260
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,800
and so for the next 24 hours until we meet again

261
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:42,720
i'd encourage you to notice sensual desire desire for sensual

262
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:48,640
pleasures desires for comfort that might exist for you

263
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:56,240
and there's lots of them through the day for most people and to see if you can notice when it's present when it's absence in particular

264
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:02,079
see if you what happened what happened what's the opportunity what happens for you when you see it when it just arises oh

265
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:08,880
there it is that's a fascinating place so hopefully you'll get

266
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:16,079
wiser over these next hours around essential desire and then we'll continue tomorrow

267
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,319
thank you
