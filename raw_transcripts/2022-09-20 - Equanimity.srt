1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,940
so I'd like to start tonight with us quote from ambika body

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:13,139
some of you may know bikubody is he's one of the key figures in this

3
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:18,779
tradition he's I think he's from the Bronx or

4
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:28,340
Brooklyn or something like this he has a little bit of an accent and bikobodi is his ordination name

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,620
it was ordained I don't know you know maybe 30 40 50 years ago

6
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:42,540
and he lived for decades in Sri Lanka as a practitioner as a monk

7
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,879
and I had a very he's kind of you know not kind of he is he's conservative and

8
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:54,840
he's also the primary translator of the texts that we have today

9
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:02,219
it's a quite a remarkable person really I have so much respect for him his

10
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,740
translations as well as just his writings I think are fantastic

11
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:13,920
but you know he said Monk and as part of the rules for monastics and this

12
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,380
tradition is they don't drive they they want to go somewhere somebody

13
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:25,500
else has to drive them or and they also don't handle money

14
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,159
and they have all these restrictions on their lifestyle to keep their lifestyle

15
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:37,560
really simple really simple and also to have it that they have this

16
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,079
relationship with the non-monastics so that they the monastics aren't

17
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,540
sequestered off doing their own thing but they rely on a relationship with others

18
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:55,259
for their to go to the doctors or you know anything like this kind of stuff so

19
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:01,380
but Biko Bodhi so somebody who probably hasn't driven I you know I don't know how old he is

20
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:09,500
it's conceivable maybe 50 years 40 years something like this and then he says

21
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:16,319
the mind is like a drunken driver I don't know why I just kind of get this

22
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:23,640
uh kick out of this this idea of somebody who doesn't drive but to

23
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:29,760
recognize that he's pointing to this sometimes drunken drivers or of course I want to

24
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:36,180
go down the middle of the lane like we all do but when you have this drunkenness you

25
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:44,160
kind of find yourself swerving and going a little to this side oh maybe hit a car or nearly miss a car hopefully and then

26
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,099
you'll go oh man maybe off the edge of the road and then this way and that way and

27
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:56,040
so in this way that there's this um he's pointing to

28
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,680
how the mind you know we kind of wish that we would like go the direction we

29
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,319
want it to go that there would be it's kind of in the middle not getting pulled

30
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:14,700
One Direction or the other but this recognition that often we are

31
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:20,580
having this craving we're getting pulled towards something over here or maybe we

32
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:26,940
have some aversion we want to get rid of something over there so we're kind of going this way and this anything but

33
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:32,060
going down the camera like the center of the lane

34
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,860
and sometimes this um craving or this long anus for

35
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:44,459
something that was in the past doesn't even exist or maybe we have this craving of

36
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:52,519
something in the future that doesn't exist either right the only thing that really exists is this moment

37
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:59,000
so this idea that the mind is kind of careening back and forth

38
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:06,140
being pushed around even though there's this wish to be going down the middle

39
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:14,760
so equanimity is this quality that enables the mind

40
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:21,540
that lets the mind go down the middle of the lane not careening from one side to the next

41
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:28,979
not leaning from one side to the next and one word that put one poly word for

42
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:34,320
Equanimity is I like saying that word I don't expect

43
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,720
anybody to know how to spell it or even to be repeat it

44
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,940
but uh if we were to translate it into English literally it means standing in

45
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:52,259
the middle so this idea of equanimity I've been able to stand in the middle

46
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:57,540
so it's pointing to this stability or this

47
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:02,580
deadiness or this sense of balance or

48
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:08,160
unshakability we're just staying here going this direction not getting pushed

49
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,919
around so as this strong sense of inner balance

50
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:19,560
that might come from a what we might say like a ballast you know a heavy thing

51
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:27,320
that's preventing it from preventing the Mind from getting off course

52
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:34,919
is one way is one poly word that gets translated as Equanimity but there's a

53
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:43,500
second word that also gets translated as Equanimity into English and this word is upeka

54
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,900
Pekka and this word is more about seeing

55
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:56,340
clearly or seeing the bigger picture or something about this so this idea of equanimity not only is

56
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:02,460
there standing in the middle but there's a steadiness or this balance that comes from

57
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:09,000
like perhaps in the same way you might be on a hill where you have a view

58
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,780
and maybe you can see things that you can't quite see

59
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:22,500
when you're like in the midst of it from the hill side maybe you can see

60
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:30,240
things in the distance that are about to about to arrive if you were there you wouldn't be able to see them yet

61
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,600
but if you're on the hill and you see then you're not surprised when they whatever it is that arises when it's

62
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:43,039
coming in the distance it's like oh yeah of course of course this is here

63
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:49,380
so this Equanimity is being able to see the bigger picture but

64
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:55,860
it also has this quality of this even-minded acceptance

65
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:01,199
of ourselves of others of whatever is arising

66
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:07,620
not getting pushed around by craving or aversion the way of saying that is a

67
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,720
certain amount of acceptance like yes this is how it is right now

68
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:20,340
I'm not going to demand or insist that it be otherwise this is how it is

69
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:26,039
but it's not this resignation like oh okay yeah I'll just wait until this ends

70
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:34,680
until something better arises instead it's this acceptance that grows out of our respect

71
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,840
a respect for ourselves respect for others a respect for all the kind of

72
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,240
like the conditions that come together that makes whatever is happening right now

73
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,340
happen but things start to happen magically of course not

74
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:57,720
there's reasons and so this kind of respect that even though we don't know all the reasons

75
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:04,860
this recognition that there are reasons for why things are happening

76
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:09,800
right now you're hearing my voice most likely

77
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:15,539
maybe that's I mean there's so many reasons for this one is that maybe it's

78
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:23,099
because I have a microphone that required somebody to invent microphones required IMC to decide that

79
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:28,259
they wanted microphones to purchase them it required svet over

80
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:34,979
here to push the right buttons to make sure that you know the voice is going out it required me to have this idea

81
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:42,120
that I wanted to speak and that I had breath in my lungs that I could put through vocal cords and right we could

82
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,640
go on and on and on so Equanimity is part of this respect

83
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:52,860
this acknowledgment that there's so many things that come together

84
00:08:52,860 --> 00:09:00,060
to make everything happen and so it's

85
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:06,540
this recognition that there's we don't have to take it so personally

86
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:13,560
doesn't mean that we're a good person or a bad person or that it's always going to be this way or all these stories that

87
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,980
we like to make of course we do this human beings do this

88
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:28,519
is this recognition it's just this coming together of all these different conditions supports this equanimity

89
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:36,120
so part of the reason why I'm talking about Equanimity tonight is because I'm continuing this series on the seven

90
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:42,959
factors of Awakening these factors of Awakening are these

91
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:51,180
qualities of the mind and the heart that really create the conditions in which

92
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:57,899
Awakening can occur and we can think about Awakening in so many different ways you can think about

93
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:04,920
it one way is just this increase in Freedom this increase in peace increase

94
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:10,980
in well-being can also thinking about it with the

95
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:17,519
Buddha talk taught is you know there's these certain attainments

96
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:25,740
of Awakening when there's this radical letting go that allows a shift a permanent shift in

97
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,839
one's perspective with this

98
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:38,519
letting go there's much more Equanimity available after this letting go

99
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:44,399
but Equanimity is the seventh factor of the seven factors of Awakening so it's

100
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:51,060
the last one It's Quickly I'll list the other six there's mindfulness

101
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:57,720
and then there's these energizing factors of Investigation energy and joy

102
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:04,620
and then there's these calming factors of Tranquility concentration and

103
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:11,700
equanimity and I'll continue in some other talks like how these seven all work together

104
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,920
and how they're sequential and balance each other and all these kinds of things but

105
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:23,100
today I'd like to continue a little bit more with equanimity [Applause]

106
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:29,220
so for some of us we hear this word this Equanimity it

107
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:34,320
certainly was not part of my vocabulary before I found these Buddhist teachings

108
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,800
it's just sounds I don't know it doesn't sound very attractive

109
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:48,420
it sounds like okay whatever that is it kind of sounds boring and dry and dull

110
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:54,720
maybe something like this but there might be a way in which it doesn't

111
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:01,200
sound attractive because Equanimity it might feel like it's a type of disconnection

112
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,420
a way in which we're not present for what's happening

113
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:12,600
for in our lives or in that in the moment or maybe it feels like it's a

114
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,640
type of coldness or indifference

115
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:24,240
or maybe it feels like it's a kind of grayness or aloofness it might have some

116
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:30,720
of these ideas about equanimity but it's not that Granny mini has this

117
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:38,700
quality of this vitality and this openness and spaciousness and warmth

118
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:46,139
it's the not having to be removed from life not having to be removed from our

119
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:51,480
connections with other people not having to be removed from what's

120
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,639
being experienced but having this be able to have some steadiness or

121
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,860
stability no matter what's happening

122
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:07,800
this radical idea that there might be so many things that

123
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:13,560
happen that happens that so many things you know in our external

124
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:19,560
conditions the news what uh others are telling us or not

125
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:27,560
telling us or maybe there's inner conditions maybe we don't feel well maybe we have a disease an illness

126
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:34,220
what a beautiful idea that we don't have to be

127
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:40,620
careening of course or into some territory that we'd know isn't

128
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:47,540
good for us or supportive for us when these conditions change

129
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:54,060
but having said all this part of equanimity or practicing with equanimity

130
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:59,279
is this kind of like slide into indifference I would say that this is

131
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:05,399
what happens is that some we have sometimes we want to disconnect because

132
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:12,420
it feels uncomfortable or painful and so sometimes it tips over into

133
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:18,000
indifference and this is I love this so much about the Buddhist teachings that

134
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,660
well this is how we learn oh yeah this is indifference I feel kind of

135
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:29,760
closed down I don't have a sense of Vitality I don't

136
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,760
have a sense of contentment instead I feel

137
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:42,120
maybe sad or tight or something like this so part of

138
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:48,060
the way that we discover what Equanimity is and how it's available for us and how it can show up

139
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:53,279
part of that is learning how it isn't

140
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:59,760
and so it's natural that humans fall into indifference on occasion

141
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:06,060
maybe it's a lot maybe it's only on occasion but can we recognize that

142
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:13,199
I recognize that there's an alternative stay connected but still have this stability this

143
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:19,199
uprightness [Applause] but there's another reason why

144
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:25,500
Equanimity might sound unattractive and that is it's not uncommon to have

145
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:30,660
this belief that's maybe you know in the back of the

146
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:39,120
mind not in the front of the mind but maybe there's somewhere in the back of our minds that we feel like in order to

147
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:45,180
have some I don't know juiciness in our lives

148
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:50,279
some something that feels invigorating

149
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:57,959
we might feel like we have to have a certain amount of drama a certain amount of you know angst or so

150
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:04,079
I don't know or something like this you know big huge problems that have to get solved or something like this right

151
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:11,339
so much of the kind of Human Experience is about like solving this problem and solving that problem and all these

152
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:16,680
different problems and so this idea of having some contentment and uprightness

153
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:22,199
and this ballast some steadiness in some ways might feel a little

154
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:29,160
frightening who would I be if I weren't the person that had all these problems that had to

155
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:37,740
be solved or who would I be if I didn't have these emotional outbursts or difficulties

156
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:44,759
who would I be would would I just be gray and dull and boring but nobody like

157
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:50,040
me would I just sit in the corner very

158
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:55,380
quietly foreign so often you know it sounds a little

159
00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:02,100
silly to say these things and these thoughts certainly aren't in the front of our minds but there might be a little

160
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:10,020
bit in the back of our minds of well this is what it means to be human to be alive is to be filled with

161
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:19,199
uh energy maybe that's born from anger or this uh

162
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:26,160
wish to fix things that things aren't right and or this just wanting things to be

163
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:34,200
otherwise so Equanimity might sound like that it's

164
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,660
I think that it's uh maybe a little bit frightening a little bit dull this fear that it might

165
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:47,100
be dull but there's this openness this spaciousness right if you have this

166
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:53,280
stability then you don't have to protect yourself and things that can arise can just kind

167
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,679
of like just go right on through we feel them we acknowledge them we know

168
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:03,080
them but we aren't being pushed by them

169
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:10,260
so this experience of equanimity

170
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:15,720
I'm talking about it like it's one singular thing but in fact it's really a

171
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:23,640
spectrum I like this idea of spectrums instead of this binary on off either you got it or

172
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,919
you don't I don't know that just it doesn't uh because most often we feel they go I

173
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:34,980
don't I don't got it I don't have it but this idea of a spectrum

174
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:41,220
to really having little stability the slightest thing sends us off kilter to

175
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:46,260
having a lot of stability right there's this spectrum and then this practice is

176
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:52,260
just moving One Direction towards greater and greater stability without insisting

177
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:57,559
that anything less than that is somehow not not enough

178
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:06,720
so it's not an on off switch it's a spectrum

179
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,660
and we might say that with equanimities over here maybe emotionality

180
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:20,340
is on the other end of the spectrum but a part of being human is having emotions

181
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:26,240
I of course it is and it would be awful if somehow this

182
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:32,520
teaching was about you can never have emotions again or something like that or this thinking that

183
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:38,340
we should have this stayed demeanor all the time

184
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:46,140
so we can ask ourselves do we have this do we know both ends of

185
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:52,020
this spectrum do we know what it's like to have emotions and to be sometimes overwrought

186
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:58,799
or to be gleeful or and do we also know what it's like to be really steady

187
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:05,419
and to have this fullness this richness this vitality

188
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:12,840
that's available with this Rich emotional life and also with steadiness

189
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:19,500
and do we know how to maybe move back and forth right we don't want to be in

190
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:25,140
Equanimity if somebody in our family is really injured or hurt or emotionally

191
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:30,960
her trait we don't just want to be standing in this uh

192
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,419
I don't know this being stable we we want to connect with them we want to

193
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:43,159
have compassion and maybe it breaks our heart to see their heart breaking

194
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:49,799
so can we practice in such a way that we are in contact with our emotions not

195
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:55,679
pretending that they're not there having respect for them

196
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:02,539
but also recognizing that there's something else that's also available

197
00:21:02,539 --> 00:21:08,580
Equanimity in this life there's emotionality

198
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:16,020
equanimity can we get to know both ends of this spectrum can we move from one end to the

199
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:24,080
other when it's appropriate when that's what life is asking of us at that moment

200
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,340
I appreciate this very much because it's not asking us to

201
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:36,380
be different than we are it's just asking us to maybe stretch or

202
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:41,880
expand our capacity or our idea of what it means to be

203
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:47,100
a human or what it means to be a Buddhist practitioner or what does it

204
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:53,120
mean to be somebody who does mindfulness practice or whatever it might be

205
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:00,860
so Equanimity part of the

206
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:08,940
maybe I could say this at functions is it just makes life easier to navigate maybe this goes without saying right if

207
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:15,559
we recognize these two ends of the spectrum and we can move from one to the other

208
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:22,260
then we can respond to what's needed at any particular time but not only that

209
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:28,399
we don't have to hide from difficulties

210
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:34,260
having Equanimity allows us to have confidence that okay whatever is going

211
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:41,299
to arise I I can I can be with it I can handle it

212
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:49,380
and it allows us to not be blown around by these eight

213
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:56,340
worldly winds maybe some of you are familiar with this maybe I'll unpack this at a later time

214
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:01,679
in another talk but tonight I'll just mention them

215
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:10,140
something else I appreciate about the Buddhist teachings is that the Buddha is saying there is nobody who is immune

216
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:17,940
from these eight worldly winds nobody praise and blame

217
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:25,919
sometimes we get praise sometimes we get blame Fame and disrepute sometimes we there's

218
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:32,700
we have a good reputation and sometimes there's something bad that gets said about us whether it's true or not right

219
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:37,820
sometimes this happens nobody is immune to this

220
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:43,740
Pleasure and Pain course right we all have this

221
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:51,120
and then the last one gain and loss course our life cannot just be gained

222
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:57,299
gain gain without any loss and just this recognition that all eight

223
00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:04,440
of these what's called winds will blow in our lives we don't get to have just

224
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:10,140
the positive ones and completely avoid the negative ones no matter how much we might wish that

225
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:15,480
were so of course we can't have that so equanimity

226
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:22,440
allows us to be able to have some steadiness in these different Winds of Our Lives start

227
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:30,659
blowing and so another part of the supports for

228
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:36,860
I'm sorry one of the functions of equanimity is as a support

229
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:43,440
a support for letting go it's so much easier to let go of

230
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:50,220
whatever it is we're holding on to if we have a sense of it's okay

231
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:57,780
I'm not off balance I'm not out of kilter

232
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:03,960
then we can let go it seems you know but uh

233
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:09,720
comes to my mind is kind of like water skiing or something like this right when you're off balance

234
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:15,539
right you're holding on so tightly but there's a way in which sometimes maybe

235
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:22,740
it's just best to let go and just kind of like go into the water instead of being pulled in a way that's

236
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:28,020
unhelpful there's this expression that's kind of

237
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:35,400
like a rope burn right that you're just holding on so tightly and it just hurts because things change and we're holding

238
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:41,220
on so Equanimity allows us to let go not to

239
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:46,159
not take rope burn and of course

240
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:53,539
Awakening Liberation ease comes with letting go

241
00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:01,679
I think we all know this that clinging eventually leads to suffering if not

242
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:08,000
immediately eventually it always leads to suffering to difficulties so to support to support our not clinging

243
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,559
equanimities helps us to let go

244
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:21,840
and so how do we practice Equanimity or were there some supports for it to arise I'll

245
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:27,059
just for Dimension a little bit now and think in the talk that I'll give next

246
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:32,880
week I'll talk more about this but one thing I wanted to say is that with

247
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:38,039
Equanimity we start Where We Are we start where we are of course we do

248
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:43,320
like we can't start anywhere else right so we start Where We Are

249
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:48,659
And We Begin by bringing Equanimity to little things in life

250
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:53,880
small things we don't have to do anything completely

251
00:26:53,880 --> 00:27:02,580
radical but maybe uh I know on Retreat practice or there's uh

252
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:08,880
during Retreats there's it's uh the meals are served at buffet style where there's these big

253
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:15,900
platters or containers of food and then there's a line maybe Equanimity is

254
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:23,640
saying oh my goodness this is my favorite maybe there's cookies or something and like well maybe I'll just

255
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:29,820
wait and see if make sure that everybody else gets one and if there's still some I'll come back and get one maybe

256
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:36,659
Equanimity is you know something very simple like this letting the car in front of you get into

257
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:43,559
the lane or something like this and these really small things it's

258
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:50,039
really small certainly like the difficulties if we think of difficulties on a scale of one

259
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:55,860
to ten like start with things that are like a one or a two

260
00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:00,960
and just kind of like let go or practice kind of like some steadiness like okay I

261
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,419
don't have to go towards this or get away from that I

262
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:12,480
can do whatever I can can practice some Equanimity here some

263
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:18,120
steadiness [Applause] so don't underestimate how powerful this

264
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:25,500
can be even though I'm saying start with the you know one or a two there's a part of us often thinks like no no no no no I

265
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:31,260
really want Equanimity so I'm going to start with a nine but

266
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:36,679
usually it works best if we start where it's easy

267
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:43,620
start where it's easy and just get used to it just get used to this and that we realize that how much

268
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:52,320
it see how I don't know how much uh confidence it gives us and it's

269
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:57,360
a good feeling to not always be going after something

270
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,059
or pushing away but instead to have this steadiness

271
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:11,039
so to kind of like talk about this I I would like to read this poem

272
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:18,179
this idea of starting where it's easy with the equanimity poem is by Rosemary traumer and it's

273
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:25,879
called driving with my son the night before his driver's test

274
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:36,000
we turn off the music practice left turns onto the highway

275
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:43,380
park on the bias park on the street we get gas drive backwards use the median

276
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:50,880
change lanes use the blinker slow down full stop

277
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:57,419
there's a rule for everything and a comfort and knowing the rules

278
00:29:57,419 --> 00:30:06,320
and you can practice everywhere notes are DMV guidelines so have at it

279
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:14,520
imagine if we all practiced everywhere if we all signaled before every turn

280
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:20,580
of heart Turn of Mind turn of plans

281
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:26,279
imagine if we all agreed no matter where we're going and

282
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:31,799
no matter where we've been that we are all travelers on the same

283
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:38,240
side knowing we're on This Road Together

284
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:47,640
imagine if we agreed to stop in an orderly way no drama no shaming no blame so that

285
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:52,700
someone else might take their turn to go

286
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:59,640
imagine getting along with others no matter what they believe

287
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:04,860
could it be as simple as keeping it steady

288
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:10,860
looking over your shoulder making eye contact and a Crossing

289
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:15,860
giving each other some space

290
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:28,380
imagine if we agreed to stop in an orderly way no drama no shaming no blame

291
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:34,278
so that someone else might take their turn to go

292
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:45,659
imagine getting along with others no matter what they believe could be as simple as keeping it steady

293
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:51,659
looking over your shoulder making eye contact in a Crossing

294
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:55,700
giving each other some space

295
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:06,120
poem by Rosemary traumer driving with my son the night before his

296
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:11,760
driver's test I appreciate this very much her just

297
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:19,380
kind of pointing to like driving as represents so many things but just this

298
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:25,080
idea of keeping it steady keeping it in the middle of the lane I speak about he

299
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:32,340
says in the beginning there so I'd like to stop there and open it up

300
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:37,398
if there are some questions or comments

301
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:43,260
foreign

302
00:32:53,419 --> 00:33:01,520
if they want to type in a question they're welcome to do that too okay dead

303
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:09,779
when you say the spectrum of emotionality and equanimity

304
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:18,480
um is there not a way that you have some emotion you

305
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:24,179
know you could have a lot of strong emotion but as long but you don't um

306
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:31,740
allow it to take over does that make sense yes yes that's kind of what I'm pointing to

307
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:38,100
you know some sometimes in our lives right it does take over and we just uh

308
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:43,380
collapse into our emotions but there can be a way in which there's tears and like

309
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:49,500
okay this is what sadness feels like and there's a lot of sadness but there's a

310
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:54,539
certain not getting lost in it or but still

311
00:33:54,539 --> 00:34:00,539
really feeling it and yeah yeah of course right I mean humans grieve and we

312
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:06,059
have some losses when dear ones die or something like this right of course there's going to be

313
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:09,200
tears and yeah

314
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:20,598
anybody else have a comment or a question

315
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:32,480
no requirements but uh if you'd like

316
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:44,760
um my question is how do we keep this from becoming a really easy way to absolve ourselves of responsibility for

317
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:52,800
like broader like social responsibilities if that makes sense I can see it being very difficult for

318
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,920
Equanimity to become like a real like a problem very close to home like in our

319
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:04,800
like families and there's like something happening but I could see it really easily

320
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,260
becoming a way for people just to say like oh well like at 60 000 feet like

321
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:16,500
impermanence and things will change and yeah yeah so Equanimity is not

322
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:21,540
indifference it's often you know it's easy to feel like it is but instead it

323
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:29,400
allows to feel like oh the pain of the social injustice for all these things and to really to feel that

324
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:36,359
and still be able to have con contact with our greatest wisdom that allows us

325
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:41,760
okay how can I make a difference what can I do next that comes from a place of

326
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:47,400
wisdom and care not from a place of fear or or

327
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:52,740
anger that's you know out of control or something like that is that helpful

328
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:59,160
thank you yes I I certainly had this idea that it was about indifference too because I was

329
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:06,780
certainly the only thing that I knew was like you were either disconnected and aloof or you're from my for me before it

330
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:14,220
was kind of or collapsed into I didn't realize that there's something like a third alternative to be feeling and

331
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:19,560
knowing what's happening and feel that pain and the sadness or whatever it

332
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:25,140
might be and still be present and Be steady be

333
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,380
available

334
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:34,460
maybe uh

335
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:45,540
so we have a couple of questions here could you please say a little more about how the eight winds are part of

336
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:53,839
equanimity a part of equanimity the the eight wings of equanimity yeah

337
00:36:55,700 --> 00:37:01,200
part yeah yeah so Equanimity is part of

338
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:06,859
the way it's defined is that it's the steadiness this ballast this stability

339
00:37:06,859 --> 00:37:15,599
when these eight wins blow so it's like it's uh not being pushed

340
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,700
around by these eight things and part of that is equity is like you know seeing

341
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:26,579
the bigger picture well part of the bigger picture is to recognize of course

342
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:33,240
there is gain and loss even though we only want gain but loss is unavoidable

343
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:38,960
and we of course we only want pleasure we don't want pain but pain is unavoidable

344
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:44,160
Fame you know these are maybe clunky translations but to have a good

345
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:50,820
reputation or to have a bad reputation right it's there's always going to be somebody who's you know displeased with

346
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:58,440
us of course it's impossible to avoid that so that's part of how Equanimity is seeing the bigger picture of that the

347
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:04,200
negative things are going to happen and not being pushed around when the negative things happen or when the

348
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:10,980
positive things happen I think when the we have this good reputation or maybe it is fame maybe we get our

349
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:16,859
Fame 15 minutes of fame or something and not to think like okay I finally made it

350
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:22,619
and now I don't have to take care of anything else in my life or I don't know whatever this is you know just not to

351
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:27,920
get out of balance for that and was there another one

352
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:36,240
uh there's a question about a relationship between tranquility and Equanimity yeah this is such a good

353
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:44,339
question relationship between tranquility and Equanimity I would say Tranquility is more of a

354
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:52,320
um like a bodily experience or it's definitely a settledness but Equanimity

355
00:38:52,320 --> 00:39:01,700
as a little as flavor of wisdom like seeing the bigger picture restaurant quality is non-education and

356
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:07,200
stability and settledness I guess so it is relate I mean they're in the same family

357
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:13,740
but um equanimia has this quality of wisdom or

358
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:20,300
yeah I'll use this word wisdom I've seen the bigger picture and having this understanding of conditionality whereas

359
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:25,440
Tranquility is more just about the settledness this is a good question and

360
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:34,160
I'll talk about this more in a subsequent talk the relationship between all these uh Awakening factors

361
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,880
so it's okay

362
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:49,880
okay well or do you have

363
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:59,160
thank you for your talk Diana um

364
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:04,560
it triggered a number of things in me I won't say them all but

365
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:11,940
one of them was I just recently watched the movie um beautiful day in the neighborhood oh

366
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:17,940
about Mr Rogers yeah yeah I haven't seen it but uh yeah and there's one scene in

367
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:22,980
which he's comes into a family's home and

368
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:29,400
the the father of the family is dying of cancer and nobody's really talking about it

369
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:37,260
nobody's release and he said something like you know death death is part of life

370
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:43,380
and he said and it's part of Being Human and he said anything

371
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:49,140
that's part of being human can be talked about and anything that can be talked about

372
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:56,339
can be managed so that's

373
00:40:56,339 --> 00:41:04,680
what came up when you had been talking about that um you know facing anything yeah I'd love

374
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:13,740
this Mr Rogers thank you right for watching Mr Mr Rogers won't you be my neighbor yes I

375
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:19,680
love this thank you Jim for saying that I'll have to see this I meant to see it

376
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:26,838
when it came out years ago I didn't so I don't know that just makes me smile thinking about Mr Rogers

377
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:33,300
okay so maybe with that uh as an ending just um thank you for your kind

378
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:40,500
attention and thank you for your practice and may you have some Equanimity in the

379
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:44,480
upcoming days thank you
