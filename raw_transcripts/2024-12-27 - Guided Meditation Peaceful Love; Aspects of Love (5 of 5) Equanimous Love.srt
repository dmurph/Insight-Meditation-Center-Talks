00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:08,559
hello and welcome my friends to this 30 minute meditation here at inside

2
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:15,160
Meditation Center in Redwood City I'm delighted to be here with you and to

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:21,800
share this and I want to thank you very

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,920
much

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,440
the so this week uh the overall teachings have been about

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,520
different aspects of Love or different forms of love

7
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:47,280
and the first uh so far are can be primar can be

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,280
seen as relational forms of love when we have the first one care it's caring for

9
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:01,160
someone including oneself uh friendly or

10
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:08,159
kindness is you know something we do in relationship to others maybe to ourselves at

11
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,840
times and compassion is in relationship to someone who's suffering maybe ourselves

12
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:21,400
even and appreciative Joy is the joy in relationship to other people's joy and

13
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:27,439
maybe there's a secondary appreciation of our own

14
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:33,560
well-being and the third one can be in relationship to other people

15
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:40,119
but it also to understand how it works uh it's best to see understand

16
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:45,640
that we have a capacity as human beings to have a form of

17
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:52,759
love a form of warmhearted Radiance a form of

18
00:01:52,759 --> 00:02:00,719
um of uh inspired appreciation Delight

19
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:07,479
um goodness that fits into the category the range of what love is but it does

20
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:13,360
not need an object it doesn't have to exist in relationship to anybody

21
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:20,400
anything it's something that can just be some people when this kind of love

22
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,360
will assume that it's love for the whole universe or that it's

23
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:32,560
impersonal that it's the love of the universe that we're experiencing in

24
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,840
ourselves and um but I think in this early Buddhist tradition that I teach

25
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,599
from uh it's uh it just is in our hearts

26
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:51,080
just is and it's enough we don't have to add anything more or any explanation for it

27
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,200
and it's remarkable how much this kind of

28
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,599
non kind of a non-relational love

29
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:07,159
comes together with peace it's a love that is very very

30
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:13,799
peaceful and it's not a betrayal of others it's not a rejection of others or rejection of The Importance of Being in

31
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:19,480
relationship to other people if anything it creates amazingly

32
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,599
significant foundation for the other forms of

33
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:32,080
love and it provides us with a certain kind of freedom to love without needing

34
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:38,280
for it to be in exchange love without needing anything in return Love without

35
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:46,159
it needing anything from anybody even a body there just

36
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:52,200
love and um and this love can be peaceful

37
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,840
equanimous because it's not in relationship to anything no matter what

38
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:04,760
happens uh it doesn't matter to that love that love doesn't want or not want

39
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:11,360
what is happening it doesn't reject and it doesn't accept anything that happens

40
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,880
it just is maybe feeling like it's there to penetrate

41
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:23,919
everything so the mystery of love the wonderful possibilities of Love include

42
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:31,720
this one love that has no object that exists in itself

43
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:41,000
so to gently close your eyes or lower your gaze if you

44
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,960
prefer feeling your body and adjusting your body a

45
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:55,639
bit so your body is aligned there's maybe a feeling of

46
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:04,680
physical Harmony in the position of your hands your arms your legs your

47
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:16,199
back a way in which your hands your arms your

48
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:22,000
torso your sitting bones your legs your

49
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,639
head all cooperate to make a

50
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,319
hole in harmony working together

51
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,919
here and in this hole in this

52
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:50,840
being to take a deep breath maybe imagining your breathing spreads to all

53
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:58,360
parts of your body and as you

54
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,758
exhale to to relax the whole

55
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,720
body letting your breathing return to normal but continue for two three

56
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,000
breaths to soften your

57
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,639
body a gentling of the

58
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:55,800
body and then as you breathe in to

59
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:02,160
feel the the activity of thinking the thinking

60
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:10,400
mind does it have any Sensations associated with it of being

61
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:20,000
activated tense their pressure or contraction

62
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:31,520
constriction so feeling that on the inhale and on the exhale

63
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,720
relaxing the thinking

64
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:45,360
mind maybe imagining that your thoughts float away as the Mind

65
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:02,840
softens sometimes a softening mind can feel as if the Mind becomes

66
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,240
larger more

67
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:26,360
spacious and then to as you breathe in to feel your heart

68
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:33,360
center to feel whatever Center where your emotional life is active

69
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:42,800
however subtle it is however big feel the place where your emotional life is

70
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,560
centered maybe the Heart Center maybe the

71
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:58,920
belly maybe the face or the hands

72
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:08,920
feeling it as you breathe in and lovingly

73
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,880
kindly relax soften on the

74
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:31,279
exhale maybe almost as if your emotions are like a gas

75
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:40,279
that when the lid is taken off the gas spreads

76
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:50,680
wide no longer contained it spreads outward so your emotions soften relax

77
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,680
spread

78
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,360
and may be there in the emotional Center or somewhere

79
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:30,759
else is there any maybe subtle not so subtle feeling of tenderness

80
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,120
or

81
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:48,440
warmth kindness or love

82
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:58,399
care so you're feeling the sensations of love maybe as tenderness maybe as

83
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:04,560
gentleness softness and

84
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:20,240
warmth and as you breathe as you breathe in feel

85
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,240
that

86
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:33,680
spot as you exhale let it be

87
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:42,839
free free of expectations ideas of what it should or

88
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:45,279
shouldn't

89
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:55,760
be let it exist there free of yourself

90
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:09,920
a place of warmth or love that exists in and of itself with

91
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:15,079
no need for an

92
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:23,760
object no need to be in relationship to anything including

93
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:31,120
yourself and as you continue

94
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,560
maybe can breathe with this kind

95
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,800
of object free

96
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,120
love and if it's nice supporting for you

97
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:07,760
you can very softly like a very gentle

98
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:16,120
wind say the word love as you connect to this

99
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:20,320
place just

100
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120

101
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040

e for

112
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:11,400
love without an object is similar to

113
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:20,720
music traveling through the air before anybody hears

114
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,120
it it's

115
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,220
there but not yet [Music]

116
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:42,960
heard the Love is

117
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:49,720
Here radiating

118
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,919
outward but not yet touching

119
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
anyone

120
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
for

121
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

122
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

123
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
for

124
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

125
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

126
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,360
for for

127
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,240
and and as we come to the end of this

128
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:44,200
sitting to see or to feel if there's any degree of

129
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:51,000
peacefulness in you any place of

130
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,880
Peace any place of ease

131
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:06,519
where just being alive is enough quietly sitting

132
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,840
breathing maybe where love and

133
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:28,000
peace cannot be separated too easily they occur together

134
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,840
then staying close to the peace staying close to a love

135
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:46,480
which needs nothing to be any way different than what it is just

136
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:52,120
love turn your mind now out into the

137
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:59,640
world to the people you're likely to encounter today

138
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,039
have conversations

139
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:12,880
with to the people in your neighborhoods and places of work

140
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,840
and friends and

141
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:29,440
strangers see if you can gaze upon them with a peaceful love

142
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:35,880
that needs nothing for yourself or even for

143
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:42,679
them for a couple of minutes now just peaceful

144
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,760
love in how you take in gaze

145
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,640
upon this wide world

146
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:14,880
for a minute or so trusting a love which is not about

147
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:21,720
anything it's just love peaceful love

148
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:48,559
and then to get ready to end the meditation

149
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:53,760
now rising out of that love

150
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:59,799
perhaps aspiring wishing

151
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:06,000
for the welfare and happiness of

152
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:12,480

153
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:18,120

154
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:23,278
safe may everyone be

155
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:30,039
peaceful May everyone be free

156
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:40,320
and may your ability to appreciate to

157
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,880
Value to care for

158
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:49,760
everyone be the

159
00:29:51,399 --> 00:29:57,000
foundation for how you relate to all beings

160
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:06,799
today may all beings benefit from how you live this

161
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:30,960
day thank you for

162
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:12,320
so hello and welcome to this fifth talk on the

163
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:18,799
different aspects of Love different forms of love and today's topic is the fourth of

164
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:25,440
the Brahma viharas the Divine abodes the fourth being usually just

165
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,720
called equinity UPA in the in

166
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:36,919
p and um and it's many people can't quite understand often people can't

167
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:42,480
understand that equinity can be a form of love because equinity might be

168
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:50,200
closely related to indifference to not caring um but in fact this equinity

169
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:58,399
bahma bajara um is definitely comes with care definitely comes with uh

170
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:03,519
not without indifference not not aloofness or passivity

171
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:10,880
or but rather it's with a realism it's love that has a realist

172
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:17,919
realistic assessment of the situation and one of the ways that it so

173
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:23,840
it's wi it's love with wisdom and one of the ways that this

174
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,200
manifests itself is to recognize that sometimes

175
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,320
um we cannot help someone some you can have all the

176
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,840
compassion in the world you can have all the kindness in the world but people are

177
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:45,639
going to suffer they can make the choices they do that are going to make their life hard for

178
00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:52,840
them and uh and so rather than despairing rather than giving up love

179
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:59,279
there is a love that Still Remains there is a love with this it which is aonomus

180
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:06,720
that is uh doesn't get caught in despair doesn't caught in Anger doesn't get

181
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:13,440
caught in I should I should I should be able to do something and kind of relating the you know taking

182
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,559
responsibility for someone else but realize everyone has a certain degree of

183
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:26,000
self-responsibility the Dignity of allowing people to have their autonomy to make their own

184
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,559
choices is uh one of the great forms of Freedom we give to people people who

185
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:39,399
don't have autonomy um feel somehow stuck and feel oppressed and so there's a way that you

186
00:33:39,399 --> 00:33:48,200
have sooner or later we have to allow people to make their own choices and so the equinity and of this

187
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:55,760
love that can be present and they're warmhearted to people uh while not being

188
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,799
somehow um disp Ed by the challenge of

189
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:05,840
the person you're with and um so with this kind of

190
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:12,839
equinity love it's a love that can accompany people we're we're not rejecting people

191
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:20,480
we're still there with them and uh we still offer our care we offer our kindness we offer our presence and maybe

192
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:26,760
our presence is enough uh that we're there with our love and maybe this is

193
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:34,520
where it's a love that's not dependent on anything in the world itself it's not dependent on the

194
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:42,919
person getting better not a dependent on the person making right choices it's um it doesn't depend on

195
00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:51,320
anything and uh that it's a love which is stronger than the vagaries of

196
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:58,440
change it's stronger than all the different possible directions and ways that uh things can un

197
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:05,920
fold love is there and um it's related to a form of peace I think of this

198
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:13,400
equanimous love as being a peaceful love a love which uh um is not

199
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:19,240
ruffled by what's happening in the world and it's very difficult this kind

200
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:24,440
of equinity it's a considered a very kind of uh it comes with a lot of

201
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:31,240
practice because with mindfulness practice were slowly learning how to

202
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:36,920
separate out all the

203
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:46,599
the uh the the impur impurities the dross the dust

204
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:52,560
that's in the way of our love there can be kindness that we offer but we want

205
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:58,040
something returned we want to be appreciated for our kindness we want to be thanked we want to be recognized is a

206
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:04,880
kind person get a badge for how kind we are or we want to um remember the first

207
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:11,920
time that I was sicking kind to a young woman was I was attracted to her and so

208
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:17,000
I was trying to act really kind to make an impression

209
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:23,240
and when I finished that conversation and left I felt I was a little bit sickened with myself so there's a lot of

210
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:29,000
extra stuff that came into it and uh same thing with

211
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:35,760
compassion sometimes com the the acts of compassion is more about trying to uh

212
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:43,440
take care of our own discomfort and make our own discomfort go away than it is caring for someone else appreciative Joy

213
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:49,280
can be complicated sometimes there could be joy and appreciation but maybe there's an overidentification with the

214
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:55,720
other person so we're we're kind of allowing ourselves our happiness to be dependent on the happiness of someone

215
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:03,000
else and so and so equinity is when these things have been kind of cleared out and

216
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:09,319
um and there's a very little ego very little um you know uh self-centered

217
00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:15,079
desire self- centered aversion there's no self in the picture of this kind of

218
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:21,119
objectless love it's just love that's there in a peaceful way and to see it as

219
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:27,520
a strength and I kind of think of it as an impersonal strength it's it's person

220
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:32,720
person Al and that it arises from you in a certain kind of way but it's not

221
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:39,319
personal in the sense it's not something you construct or choose or do it's something you tap into something you

222
00:37:39,319 --> 00:37:45,160
allow something you um can uh

223
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:51,800
feel and um and then let it be there let it be with a situation and this is

224
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:57,839
invaluable because it allows um us to love

225
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:03,480
um in difficult situations and some situations certainly

226
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:09,359
call on it and it doesn't not you know sometimes it's the best thing we can do

227
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:15,960
uh and this sometimes this some of equinity Brahma vihara is sometimes called Grand uh they usually I

228
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:22,160
originally heard it as grandmotherly love grandpar grandparents

229
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:28,720
love with the idea and I've been a single parent and single parent but a a

230
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:34,480
new parent and um and as a new parent you know every little thing was a drama

231
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:41,319
and concern and should we call the doctor or something it was such but um

232
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:48,680
uh the grandparents they took it uh a kids's grandparents took everything were much more equanimous about things they

233
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:53,760
had raised kids they'd been around little kids they knew that when a CR kid

234
00:38:53,760 --> 00:39:00,119
fell on the playground and scraped their knee that uh this didn't mean calling

235
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:06,440
911 this just meant uh to be calm and loving and caring and be present for the

236
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:12,520
kid in a non-anxious way to stay equanimous the kid the kid doesn't feel

237
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:19,599
like there's the situation has gotten out of hand because the parent now is losing it the the kid feels like oh

238
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:24,760
there's stability there's there's a Known World there's a there's a safe

239
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:31,440
World here and and what's happened here is in the in the realm of the safety the safe world this what's happened to me is

240
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:39,760
painful but I'm being cared for by someone who's calm and present and certainly cares about me but um you know

241
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:46,760
offers to kiss the knee and but uh but uh is not activated not anxious not

242
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:52,440
alarmed by it so this grandpar love that

243
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:57,599
uh sometimes we don't need to be alarmed sometimes we don't need to be caught up

244
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:05,160
in what it means to us personally uh we can just have be show up with love show up with and see what

245
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:13,960
happens and see what emerges and sometimes that's what's mostly what's needed many people don't need to be

246
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:20,280
fixed many people and they don't need us to fix them many people need to be loved

247
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:28,319
need to be cared for need to be in the presence of someone who is willing to see them uh with clarity

248
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:34,200
but with a Simplicity of Love um maybe a love that doesn't need

249
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:41,280
anything in return and maybe sometimes that might seem a little passive because many

250
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,760
people want an exchange they want something to happen they want to know they want to get praised they want to

251
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:54,880
have something in return so it can be a little bit a little bit awkward for some people but um generally I think that if

252
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:05,760
you stay present um in a caring way and um engage in the conversation and that

253
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:11,760
um um I think that you'll win them over or you'll you'll demonstrate something

254
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:19,319
power powerful for them so um the love of

255
00:41:19,319 --> 00:41:25,960
equinity and uh one of the phrases that's used for this kind of love is um

256
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:32,160
the choices you make are your own and I still love

257
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:40,119
you and um so um may we love everyone and may we

258
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:46,079
know the appropriate love uh in this different circumstances we're in uh I

259
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:52,119
think of care as being the foundational from which the other four uh grow I've

260
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:58,000
heard people who believe that equinity is the foundation equanimous love is the

261
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:05,200
foundation for the other three bum viharas that the other three arise out of this more fundamental love of

262
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:12,040
equinity so however it is your way is the right way if you're loving any one

263
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:17,920
of these five different ways and may the end of this

264
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:23,640
year be one that uh St stays you close

265
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:29,760
to your capacity for care kindness compassion passion apprec appreciation

266
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:36,000
and equinity so that you can begin this next next year having that be one of the

267
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,720
primary characteristics of how you go through the Year may this next

268
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:50,319
year and be one of love so I offer you these um wishes for

269
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:55,839
the new year because I won't be here next week and

270
00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:03,960

271
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:08,280

272
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:20,640
the oh next week I'm going seeing who who it's going to be next week is Kim

273
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:27,880
Ellen so you're very fortunate to have Kim wonderful teacher with tremendous uh care and how

274
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:32,920
she teaches and intelligence and kindness and uh so she is wonderful to

275
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:38,680
follow up and she'll guide you into the new year I'll be back the following

276
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:45,119
week uh with the first uh day I'll be at IRC and

277
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:51,880
um and what the plan is for the beginning of the year is to um in the

278
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:59,760
last few years I've been given a long series of instructions that basic meditation instructions I did a

279
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:06,520
Sati batan Su I did the anapan Sati Su for a whole period of time uh

280
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:12,760
mindfulness four foundations of mindfulness the mindfulness of breathing and what I'd like to do this next uh

281
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:18,960
beginning of the year is to do uh instructions on concentration practice on

282
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:26,040
samade and uh samade and mindfulness I'll talk about this I don't see them as being two separate paths but they work

283
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:33,440
together but there is useful sometimes to just kind of focus on the Samari aspect of it so uh that's what I'll do

284
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:39,119
and we'll do it slowly uh over these days and weeks uh so hopefully that uh

285
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:45,119
you'll follow along well enough and uh get some benefit from this very important

286
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:51,839
topic and finally if I may mention that if any of you are interested in um

287
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:56,880
