10
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,979

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,960
arriving arriving here in this body

12
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,880
In This Moment In Time

13
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,340
fresh new full of possibilities

14
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,479
of this moment

15
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,780
in the same way that if we have a cup with stale cold tea in

16
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:02,700
it we have to throw it out to make room for fresh

17
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:13,280
new warranty if there's stale thoughts regurgitations

18
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:21,379
let's release them just for this period release them now

19
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,560
making room for fresh

20
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,819
ability goodness

21
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:59,360
feeling this body our sit bones and the cushion or the chair

22
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:12,200
if you're sitting on a chair your feet on the floor if you're in a cushion your legs touching the Earth

23
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,500
hands on your lap all these touch points

24
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,900
which we can always come back to these touch points

25
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:56,540
resting resting in this body resting in the space that surrounds the body

26
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,659
resting

27
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:10,620
and including everything including the sounds they're not

28
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:16,760
distractions they're just sounds they're just sounds

29
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:27,240
let your heart relax release in the midst of all this the body breathing pulsating

30
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,080
alive

31
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:41,900
sounds the energy in the room and the quiet the silence

32
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:50,479
between all the busyness outside and inside

33
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:07,320
tune the frequency of your radio as if you had a radio internally

34
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:13,259
tune into the calm the channel of the calm there is this calm in between

35
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:20,759
everything else all the noise all the chatter in the mind follow the chatter inside

36
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:26,180
outside yes those are there too

37
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:33,720
holler all the news and this and that but tune

38
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:43,020
in right now ah tune into the silence between the noise

39
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:48,198
and holds all the noise holds it all

40
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:02,000
I let the breath the sensations of the breath in the body guide you

41
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:24,020
connecting to the breath in the body

42
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:31,400
relaxing relax relax the body

43
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:39,680
receive the breath not tightly but spaciously

44
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,400
oh dear breath

45
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,500
enjoying the breath enjoying the breath

46
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:43,680
and if the tuning of the attention drifts if it drifts

47
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,380
like an old radio that drifts to other frequencies of

48
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:56,039
thought and plans and worries a return re

49
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:59,000
re-engage

50
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:12,319
again and again this moment with the breath with the silence that holds it all

51
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:20,340
permeates everything internally it's there you know it's there

52
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:27,080
us that it's here it's already here

53
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:36,140

132
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:49,020
for us to feel that there's something especially for those who are in the room and if you are joining us from YouTube

133
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:54,359
there is a Sangha there's a YouTube song I to really feel into energetically and

134
00:38:54,359 --> 00:39:03,359
yet here feeling into yeah it is nice Sangha Community yay how wonderful other

135
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:09,000
human beings were on this path source of joy

136
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:15,260
so today I'd like to share some Reflections on

137
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:21,359
Gathering collecting the mind the heart just this

138
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:28,500
sense of settledness that many of you gave a gave a shout out for the sense of

139
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:33,839
settledness calmness happiness contentment all of these are in each

140
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:41,599
other's neighborhood and

141
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:49,440
formally formally in um the the title or the topic of this

142
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:56,460
this uh talk is um the poly word is samadhi samadhi

143
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:03,359
or often translated as concentration but concentration brings up the sense of

144
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:09,660
concentration whereas this word samadhis actually

145
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:16,320
um it means to put together to place

146
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:22,920
together to collect to gather in the Chon tradition actually it's

147
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:29,760
often translated as calm abiding oh I like that right it's a different translations of concentration calm

148
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:35,880
abiding feel that on your body right concentration is like okay I gotta concentrate remember math class again

149
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:42,300
for some people that worse if it works for you go with it but the idea again with that translation of concentration

150
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:49,579
is to gathers when the orange juice is concentrated it's gathered it's Collective it's it's Essence right it's

151
00:40:49,579 --> 00:40:55,920
whereas we have it's like a word map we have so many different

152
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:03,440
associations with the word concentration that sometimes it's not helpful but calm abiding

153
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:09,240
collectedness Gathering and in fact the word itself in in Pali

154
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:17,400
samadhi comes is from the prefix sum which means together and the Ruda which

155
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:25,760
means to put or place so to place together to put together

156
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:31,880
to bring together so unifying the mind in a steady

157
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:39,000
undistracted awareness in the words of Richard shenkman in his book samadhi

158
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,280
so this idea of collectedness collecting ourselves because that feels delicious

159
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:53,720
doesn't it oh yeah collecting myself instead of being scattered the opposite is being scattered being everywhere

160
00:41:53,880 --> 00:42:01,079
collected scattered and especially in our Modern Life

161
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:09,359
I think as the speed of of technology and communication and just the Deluge of

162
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:14,940
information in so many ways um

163
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:23,880
has increased has increased social media and news outlets

164
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:29,460
etc etc even entertainment Outlets just just the number of

165
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:39,078
um entertainment options available just so many ways we can get scattered

166
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:48,619
so raise your hand if you felt scattered at least one moment the past week

167
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:55,880
two moments yeah it's

168
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:01,680
all the hands go up of course it's her common Humanity now this and in fact I

169
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:07,640
should have asked you to look around it's a common name of course we get scattered

170
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:14,760
this is the condition of um our lives right now

171
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:21,900
in the west actually everywhere in the world it turns out but especially in in here in Silicon Valley and then the West

172
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:27,300
in general so so to help to support ourselves we

173
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:32,760
want to collect ourselves and calm ourselves collect ourselves

174
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:39,660
and so so the question might arise well okay why do I want to collect myself let's do

175
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:46,740
the why let's do the how how do I collect myself is it by force is it like okay now I'm

176
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:53,400
gonna collect myself okay and and push away all distractions like to have a a

177
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:58,920
um a a an aversive fighting attitude with

178
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:05,880
everything like every distraction every noise like stop I'm collecting myself is it that that I'm making fun of it

179
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:12,359
clearly not right that's not the way to collect ourselves but but collecting ourselves really is through enjoyment

180
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:18,359
and falling in love with peace with contentment that's the way it's

181
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:23,880
done it's there's no other way it's it's not by the force of will and when the

182
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:29,880
whip like okay constant right now um You can try that it doesn't it's I'll

183
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:36,420
say more about in a moment but in Praise of collectedness and

184
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:42,119
praise of collectiveness I wanted to also share this quote which I love by

185
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:47,579
Thomas Merton the celebrated famous Trappist monk who

186
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:54,000
was also a good friend of uh his Holiness the Dalai Lama they were

187
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:01,520
buddies so Thomas Merton many of you might already know his name

188
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:07,140
um I love this quote by him there is a and and he said this

189
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:13,260
gosh how many years ago now uh decades ago I don't have the date of of the

190
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:20,400
quote but decades and he's been dead for a while so decades ago there is a pervasive form of

191
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:27,780
contemporary violence to which the idealist most easily succumbs activism

192
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:33,119
and overwork the rush and pressure of Modern Life are

193
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:40,260
a form perhaps the most common form of its innate violence

194
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:46,920
to allow oneself to be carried away by a multitude of conflicting concerns

195
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:55,380
surrender to too many demands to commit oneself to too many projects

196
00:45:55,380 --> 00:46:03,300
to want to help everyone in everything is to succumb to violence

197
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:09,000
the frenzy of our activism neutralizes our work for peace

198
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:16,619
it destroys our own inner capacity for peace it destroys the fruitfulness of our own

199
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:26,359
work because it kills the root of inner wisdom which makes work fruitful

200
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:33,019
powerful words from a Wise Wise being

201
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:38,880
too many demands too many projects

202
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:46,260
want to help everyone and everything do you identify with too many projects

203
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:51,540
raise your hand too many yeah

204
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:58,500
so this this um what he talks about which we recognize this inner capacity for peace

205
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:05,640
this to cultivate this inner capacity for peace to maintain that so that our outer

206
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:13,260
work in the world is inspired it comes out of that inner capacity that inner

207
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:19,920
holding of of Peace of stability of stability

208
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:27,540
so now motivating I'm trying to motivate a little bit probably doesn't I don't need to motivate why

209
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:34,079
practicing calm abiding settling Gathering is important but I

210
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:40,200
will just spell it out it is the way that we create this this fort this

211
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:46,560
stability this sense of um this this it's like a foundation it's

212
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:52,440
like a rock solid foundation on which our work in the world is based and also

213
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:58,280
our inner work of insight is based on calm

214
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:05,660
so the practice of calm abiding Gathering collecting

215
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:10,680
concentrating the Mind settling the mind we all just use the word settling the

216
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:16,920
mind the practice of cultivating samadhi to add to any extent

217
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:24,060
possible and they're quite a range in levels of of of depth of settle settling

218
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:31,800
that our minds can cultivate but at any level cultivating somebody is

219
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:37,859
the precursor is the precursor to Insight is the precursor to Insight

220
00:48:37,859 --> 00:48:46,440
internally and externally if we don't have a settled and calm mind we cannot

221
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:52,880
clearly see it's not possible

222
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:59,819
so imagine your mind you have binoculars right you're and you're trying to look

223
00:48:59,819 --> 00:49:07,440
at your life you're trying to look at your habit patterns you're trying to look at the world right the the lens of

224
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:13,500
inside the the binoculars of insight but if you don't have a stable

225
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:19,020
base if you don't put it on a tripod if it's just moving moving moving you can't

226
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:25,859
really look the image keeps shifting and changing there needs to be

227
00:49:25,859 --> 00:49:33,839
stability so that you can take your breath oh that's what's happening okay

228
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:40,440
so that building that that that tripod that we set

229
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:47,400
the binoculars on for the sake of insight and inside by the way is also another word for vipassana those who

230
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:55,319
have been practicing for a while if we pass a nut inside practice seeing things as they are arising passing all of that

231
00:49:55,319 --> 00:50:01,380
um and the precursor to that is somebody's

232
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:06,480
is calming settling the mind and also if we take Insight because insights really

233
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:13,440
are personal we always have in this practice you know many times

234
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:19,640
um maybe beginners think okay all these insights I hear about all I hear about

235
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:27,480
impermanence and I hear about not self I especially want that not self thing that how do I get to that that Insight like

236
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:35,099
that sounds or or emptiness that's what I want that sounds so cool give me some emptiness okay slow down

237
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:42,180
slow down it's from it starts from the personal

238
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:47,579
and when you have the insights that are in personal nature then it extends to

239
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:52,680
then you can see the universal but you can jump into the universal it becomes

240
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:59,520
spiritual bypass if you start if you want to just see the universal and poo poo the in the person I don't even exist

241
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:09,619
I don't yeah the Buddha says there's no self not so yeah no no no no come back get quiet down calm down slow down

242
00:51:09,619 --> 00:51:16,140
cultivate some somebody some stability of the mind and get to see the insights

243
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:22,619
your own insights from the personal level oh wow I'm suffering

244
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:28,559
I'm really attached to this relationship that did not work I am really suffering

245
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:33,660
there's a lot of suffering here okay how do I work with this there's personal

246
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:40,800
suffering here there's attachment there's wanting there's anger there's resentment there is self-blame wow okay

247
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:47,280
okay I'm gonna start there it's not like okay that's all personal forget it I just want to go and

248
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:53,099
like chill out and do the not self thing because no no no start you have to start

249
00:51:53,099 --> 00:51:59,099
right because what can happen whoa many different ways different

250
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:05,640
people have different but I'll just give one example you know you stay with you stay with say

251
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:13,079
um with the the um the pain the suffering okay so the

252
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:18,960
teachings all right mindfulness of the body is the first Sati patana the First Foundation

253
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:26,880
of mindfulness okay so you start to feel the sensations in the body yes really hurts

254
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:32,940
ouch this really hurts and then by actually acknowledging the

255
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:38,880
pain that oh yeah this really really hurts I'm really hurting right oh

256
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:44,400
sweetheart that arises compassion compassion oh

257
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:51,780
that which may not have been there because you were just kicking yourself I shouldn't have said that I should have done that I was I'm really hurting right

258
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:58,680
now I'm really hurting right now right now so there can be a sense of compassion that arises this really hurts

259
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:05,420
I'm really hurting oh if I have actually compassion kindness

260
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:11,339
ah things are easier and also the heart is not just easier but also you get a

261
00:53:11,339 --> 00:53:16,800
sense the mind the heart can get a sense that wow other people are going through that

262
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:22,740
too then the heart can open up to compassion for others this is hard or

263
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:28,020
that other friend of mine who a few months ago was going through something similar and I just like yeah yeah I was

264
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:34,740
checking you know for Facebook while we were wonderful now oh that ouch ouch and your heart opens up

265
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:40,200
oh that was really so in that way through your personal suffering you open

266
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:47,220
up to compassion not just for yourself but universally so it's through the personal becomes the

267
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:54,540
universal for example with compassion similarly with all the other insights with

268
00:53:54,540 --> 00:54:00,660
impermanence things arise and pass away you just keep having you have to keep

269
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:06,180
noticing seeing in detail yeah it rises and passes away I woke up this morning

270
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:11,940
oh yeah I was really really upset oh that mind state that heart state has

271
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:19,319
gone away and then it starts to become Universal everything is impermanent everything is impermanent then the next

272
00:54:19,319 --> 00:54:25,380
time something happens and you're in the midst of fear like ah what if this never ends of everything is simple

273
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:31,740
I know that I deeply know everything is impermanent so

274
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:36,960
and impersonal so let's talk about anatas not self in personality you get

275
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:42,180
to see when you really slow down and you get to see the Mind States you get to

276
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:48,420
see the sensations in the body they all arise and pass and you have no control when you get to see you have no control

277
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:53,880
over say aging over

278
00:54:53,880 --> 00:55:00,059
how this body recovers or doesn't recover from say a cut like wow

279
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:06,059
you can't do this the body is doing this or all the other ways that there is no

280
00:55:06,059 --> 00:55:12,900
governability there is you can start with the body but there's so many different ways to have all of these

281
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:18,540
insights a gazillion ways to have these insects but they the point I want to

282
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:24,960
make is it starts with the personal that's the point I want to make I don't want to give a a 24 hour or 48 hour

283
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:30,000
discourse and all the ways to have these insights because there's so many different ways

284
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:36,420
but but the point is it starts with the personal insights and

285
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:41,940
further back pull back a little more starts with having a calm settled mind

286
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:47,940
that is able to have the insights if if it's the binoculars of all over the

287
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:53,819
place you cannot have you're just kind of you're in the Whirlwind of a thought

288
00:55:53,819 --> 00:55:59,880
an entangle it won't Sun Tangled laughs stabilize

289
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:06,359
put your foot down sit down rest calm the body calm the

290
00:56:06,359 --> 00:56:08,539
mind

291
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:21,599
so so many so many wives so many why wise to do

292
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:26,940
to practice calming settling the mind

293
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:33,119
okay so I could continue but you might say okay I'm all right yes

294
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:38,700
I'm signing up so how do I do this how do I settle

295
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:45,059
well as I've been intimating and also also as I've been leading in the excuse

296
00:56:45,059 --> 00:56:53,099
me guided meditation it is through enjoying through loving

297
00:56:53,099 --> 00:56:58,559
through finding contentment because when the mind is content

298
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:03,900
when the heart loves what's happening it doesn't want to go anywhere

299
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:10,460
think of a hobby you have something you really enjoy doing

300
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:16,980
you just get absorbed and ours can go by you may not even eat

301
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:23,819
because you're so absorbed you're loving what you're doing so that's the kind of relationship

302
00:57:23,819 --> 00:57:28,920
cultivate with practice it's not a Grim

303
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:37,440
Duty I have to sit you know science says 30 minutes a day is good for my health no fall in love with it fall in love

304
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:43,500
with it that's the only way to do this so

305
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:48,960
there are different methods so so there are different techniques lots of

306
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:55,440
different objects for developing concentration for developing collection of the mind and

307
00:57:55,440 --> 00:58:00,839
and different techniques and ways and do this and do that and yet

308
00:58:00,839 --> 00:58:06,960
the ethos the way to approach it all of them is similar so

309
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:12,240
so I'll talk a little bit about both so

310
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:19,920
so there are many different concentration objects many different ways to collect the mind

311
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:25,980
so in the West we tend to

312
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:32,579
practice with mindfulness of the breath that's our primary object yes familiar

313
00:58:32,579 --> 00:58:38,520
with that one yeah that's that's usually the anchor right we go to the breath

314
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:46,980
we see thoughts entanglements mother go back to the breath or tune back to the breath yes you're with me yeah

315
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:55,520
everybody's had instructions on mindfulness of the breath yes okay so that's primarily the the

316
00:58:55,819 --> 00:59:02,099
object however there are 40 different objects

317
00:59:02,099 --> 00:59:07,859
in the visudi Maga which is the path of purification this thousand page manual

318
00:59:07,859 --> 00:59:14,160
two thousand year old manual practice manual which is wonderful then

319
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:21,660
wonderfully obtuse and great um there are 30 different objects

320
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:27,059
and um one of them is the breath

321
00:59:27,059 --> 00:59:34,079
and then there are the Brahma vihars the the practice of the heart for example

322
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:40,680
meta loving kindness and compassion and you know all the four Brahma vihar as

323
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:46,140
the practice of our muddita vicarious joy and Equanimity those four are some

324
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:51,960
of the 40 different ways to read the common collect the mind when you sit and

325
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:57,240
wish yourself well or wish somebody else well and engage really engage Stay Stay

326
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:03,619
you stay with that practice the Mind collects and settles and becomes happy

327
01:00:03,619 --> 01:00:09,059
then then there are a bunch of other objects that's 10 of them they're called

328
01:00:09,059 --> 01:00:15,480
the casinos and there are basically visualization objects for this practice

329
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:21,720
and some people actually um they pre they their minds take better

330
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:26,940
to the visualization object and my favorite visualization object is what is

331
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:33,299
called the white Casino in fact I taught a an online retreat at IRC at the end of

332
01:00:33,299 --> 01:00:38,720
last year and I'm teaching another one online it's on my website

333
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:44,940
in beginning of March so so the white casino is a just a basically the color

334
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:52,920
white and the mind can be can just settle and be absorbed and and find

335
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:58,500
peace just collecting with a white disc white circle and it becomes expansive

336
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:05,880
and some people report that it's actually easier for them to connect with that a sense of Purity and calm and

337
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:11,640
subtleness compared to the breath um so so there are many many different

338
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:17,579
objects many many different ways for for the settling to happen one thing to to

339
01:01:17,579 --> 01:01:24,119
keep in mind with calming collecting the mind around an object is

340
01:01:24,119 --> 01:01:32,400
the difference between samata practice practice samadhi samata

341
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:38,400
is the name of the practice samadhi is the state so the practice of collecting the Mind

342
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:45,240
versus Insight practice also translated as vipassana

343
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:53,660
these two are a little different so let me decode it for you so with

344
01:01:53,660 --> 01:02:00,420
collecting the mind you keep coming back to the same object

345
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:07,980
keep coming back when other things happen thoughts Etc you say not now you let them go you let them go you let you

346
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:14,339
keep coming back to the same object over and over and over again

347
01:02:14,339 --> 01:02:19,619
okay compared to that inside practice

348
01:02:19,619 --> 01:02:26,640
is the mind rests on say

349
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:32,760
the sensations of the Body for a while sees the three characteristics these

350
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:40,500
they're rising and passing and and then moves to another object moves to thought sees they're arising and passing Etc

351
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:46,140
says so so it keeps moving from object to object to object so in the words of

352
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:51,540
Steve Armstrong concentration practice is like absolute

353
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:59,160
monogamy you are dedicated to one object alone it's just breath or it's just a white

354
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:05,700
Casino that's it everything else like it's distractions you're just coming back

355
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:11,040
in inside practice maybe you start here here's where it

356
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:16,140
gets so so actually let me share his word so he he calls um

357
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:21,200
inside practice To Be A Serial monogamy

358
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:28,020
so your monogamous you give all your attention to one object you know the sensations of the body and then oh maybe

359
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:33,780
Vaden are feeling tone Oh this is how it's changing and shifting and then maybe thought so they're rising and

360
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:40,140
passing so you're giving your heart to one object you're really dedicated to it but then another object and another

361
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:45,660
object another object okay so what tends to get confusing for

362
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:52,140
Western practitioners hearing this is wait wait a minute that's not how I practice I I start with the breath I'm

363
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:57,960
just staying with the breath and then I've been taught as a western

364
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:04,920
practitioner okay then thoughts arise okay maybe I I notice thoughts are rising I pay attention to them a little

365
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:11,160
bit and then I let them go and I come back to the breath right because that's self familiar for many of you okay so

366
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:17,520
that that is um called dry vipassana that's

367
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:25,079
essentially the style that there are many many different styles so it's going a one level deeper

368
01:04:25,079 --> 01:04:31,740
so so let's so there are two let's just for Simplicity say there are two

369
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:40,319
different ways to practice vipassana and inside practice one way is to spend days weeks months

370
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:47,220
years practicing samata collecting the mind and when you really really have a

371
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:53,220
collected mind settled mind then you you practice vipassana right

372
01:04:53,220 --> 01:05:01,079
it's always a precursor right it's always a precursor so always has to happen first okay right that's one way

373
01:05:01,079 --> 01:05:06,359
not taught in the west that's so there are some teachers who teach this way my

374
01:05:06,359 --> 01:05:13,799
teacher peroxide or venerable peroxide a whom I studied with you know you practice the concentration samata until

375
01:05:13,799 --> 01:05:19,640
janas and absorptions you might have happened so really deep states of concentration arise and then only then

376
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:26,339
you switch to vipassana okay that's one way however in the west the mahasi

377
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:32,760
method that's mostly taught is kind of interleaved so the past the summer

378
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:39,780
targets interleaved with the vipassana gets interleaved that's why it's called drive apasana so you start with a little

379
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:44,819
bit of samadhi you calm and collect the mind right

380
01:05:44,819 --> 01:05:49,859
and then oh thought arises okay now it becomes a fast enough now you actually

381
01:05:49,859 --> 01:05:55,500
go to the thought and you see like oh yes distraction maybe you label it even

382
01:05:55,500 --> 01:06:01,200
yes labeling noting anyone yeah you're like oh yeah that's the kind of thought I'm having planning is self-judgment you

383
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:08,339
get to see it then so we were still doing vipassana with me now we let go of it and we come

384
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:15,599
back so we're now doing what we're doing some of the practice right calming the Mind stabilizing it a little bit so that

385
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:23,780
we have enough stability the next time oh backache oh tight moving tension

386
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:28,980
right you get to investigate investigate in the body a little bit now you're

387
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:37,260
doing what then after a while ah the body doesn't

388
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:42,780
attract your attention this much right the instructions are you let it go you come back to the breath now you're doing

389
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:48,599
what yes so you see how it's interleaved

390
01:06:48,599 --> 01:06:53,819
yeah whereas in this other style you're just doing like Summit a day and night

391
01:06:53,819 --> 01:06:59,700
and day and night and like after months like okay now we're gonna do vipassana it's just like okay now you're ready now

392
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:05,099
you're just gonna investigate all all phenomena so

393
01:07:05,099 --> 01:07:11,520
so and having said that it is helpful it is

394
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:17,039
helpful if your mind is is or heart is is

395
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:22,200
um drawn to it to take some time in your practice to

396
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:30,960
settle the mind a little more to just create more settledness through these various practices

397
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:36,180
so I want to come back to Joy I also want to say because this is so important

398
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:42,059
so important so this is from ajan suchito

399
01:07:42,059 --> 01:07:49,140
respected monk in in this tradition so about practice of samadhi this is

400
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:54,420
what he says I think of enjoyment as receiving joy

401
01:07:54,420 --> 01:08:00,420
and samadhi as the art of refined enjoyment

402
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:06,900
it is the careful collecting of oneself to the joy in the present moment

403
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:13,740
joyfulness means there is no fear no tension no out to there isn't anything

404
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:21,859
we have to do about it so there is stillness it's just this

405
01:08:22,980 --> 01:08:28,580
right so so cultivating

406
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:33,778
samadhi collecting the mind of course there's engagement right you have to

407
01:08:33,779 --> 01:08:40,738
engage but it's not effortful it's enjoyment it's tuning into the joy of

408
01:08:40,739 --> 01:08:49,199
the moment so I have the breath remember I was inviting you to fall in love with the breath you know what is content how

409
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:56,520
can you enjoy this moment can you relax so relaxing the body is very important

410
01:08:56,520 --> 01:09:03,060
if their body is tight getting it to settle is really hard

411
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:10,080
here's another quote about the use of pleasure in in calming

412
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:16,140
collecting the mind this one is from tanisara biku another celebrated monk in this

413
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:21,359
transition transition and tradition how do you use pleasure

414
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:28,798
focus on the breath right now of course he's talking about mindfulness of the breath as the object so

415
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:35,520
focus on the breath right now and see how it feels then experiment with the breath to see

416
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:40,560
how the way you breathe can produce either pleasure or pain

417
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:46,920
it may be subtle the difference between the two but it's there we've learned to

418
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:52,318
desensitize ourselves to this aspect of our awareness so it's going to take a

419
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:59,460
while to re-sensitize ourselves to begin seeing the patterns this is why we

420
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:06,000
practice keep coming back to the breath keep coming back to the breath

421
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:11,340
try to get more sensitive to this area of your awareness more skilled at

422
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:17,760
learning how to maximize the potential for pleasure Right Here and Now

423
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:25,440
simply by the way you breathe not only producing pleasure but also maintaining it

424
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:31,620
after all feelings of pleasure and Rapture are part of the path they are

425
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:39,420
tucked in the noble hateful path right under right concentration right under

426
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:44,460
right concentration and as part of the path they may have to be developed and

427
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:50,699
maintained as the Buddha said this pleasure is blameless

428
01:10:50,699 --> 01:10:57,620
so there's a lot of pleasure and enjoyment to the practice to cultivating

429
01:10:57,620 --> 01:11:03,719
samadhi samata this calm collected mind that for some people starts to get

430
01:11:03,719 --> 01:11:10,320
addicted like oh I want that pleasure like okay let that go that's also impermanent by the kids so much pleasure

431
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:16,440
and so much calm collectedness which again the point is not to check out in

432
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:22,800
it but to use it as a basis for our life for our insight for our service for the

433
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:29,159
way we show up in the world anyway there's a lot more I can say and

434
01:11:29,159 --> 01:11:35,699
and and I think I'm going to end now and and um maybe if you're interested you can

435
01:11:35,699 --> 01:11:42,480
you'll come and I'll teach you about the white Casino online in a few weeks but I think I'll end there there's this this

436
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:47,820
is endless this is just so so joyous this topic and this cultivation and

437
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:53,340
sharing it and also just igniting perhaps igniting the the delight and

438
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:58,739
interest in others it's it's a practice that's been so meaningful to me in my

439
01:11:58,739 --> 01:12:03,900
practice uh both driver passana this interleaving I've done that for many

440
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:09,659
years before practicing with with my teacher Parkside so

441
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:16,260
I hope the the reflections today were of service of of

442
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:24,420
to your practice to your Awakening and let's dedicate the goodness of our practice to all beings everywhere

443
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:32,699
ah May the goodness of our practice our our Attention our inspiration

444

447
01:12:54,200 --> 01:13:00,060
