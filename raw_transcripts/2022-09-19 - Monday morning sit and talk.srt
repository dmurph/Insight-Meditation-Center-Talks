1
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:18,680
so a warm hello from redwood city and

2
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,360
i'm happy to begin the week with you this way and

3
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,320
and as many of you know all of you know that the medium for

4
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,160
this path practice of mindfulness concentration of

5
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:43,600
compassion love that buddhism emphasizes is the present moment

6
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,760
it isn't that the present moment is the be-all and end-all of practice

7
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,760
but it's the entry point for something quite

8
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,880
significant that some of the greatest

9
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,560
experiences or possibilities for peace for happiness

10
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:13,040
for love for joy for relatedness to others

11
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:20,320
for compassionate and loving connections to the world

12
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,160
is the present moment there's something special about the present moment

13
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,519
that we can enter into it or sit in the middle of it that it allows us to touch into

14
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:38,560
something it's very very important that is not possible if we spend a lot

15
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,600
of time in rumination a lot of time thinking about things even

16
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,720
if that what we think about seems important and seems

17
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,480
and probably is important sometimes or whether it's fantasy and maybe

18
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,839
fantasies that do provide a certain degree of pleasure and

19
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,600
they are incomparable to the pleasure and the happiness and well-being

20
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,639
that can be accessed through really being here in the present moment

21
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,360
to not be ahead of oneself not be caught in desires of wanting things to be different in the way they

22
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,839
are but to really settle and be

23
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:30,320
here and so what is it about the present moment that it operates is such an important

24
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,560
medium such an important door for the depth of our experience

25
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,880
what is it that uh we can find here and what is it we can

26
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,560
be supported by and be cared by and care for

27
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:54,959
and that's the question for this meditation is uh

28
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:04,320
what is this present moment what are we connecting to and why is it so valuable

29
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:12,000
and are you willing to explore that question to really be curious and interested in the

30
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,399
gift of attention that goes into the present moment arises out of the present moment

31
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:27,399
so to take a meditation posture

32
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,519
and to

33
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:52,160
gently close your eyes and this closing of the eyes for people

34
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:58,880
who for whom this works is a beginning of this process of

35
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,199
tuning in to the present moment experience

36
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,639
no matter how mundane it might be

37
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:20,399
it's the way that we turn our attention to the present moment

38
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:27,199
that is a big part of what makes the present moment special that opens it

39
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:35,360
to something deep so turning the attention more fully here

40
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,959
taking a few long slow deep breaths

41
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:58,079
breathing in attentive to your present moment

42
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,800
experience

43
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:11,079
breathing out aware of your present moment experience

44
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:20,320
breathing in deeply and the sensations of the body

45
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,680
can ground you in the present moment

46
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:34,880
breathing out fully can connect us more fully to the present

47
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,959
moment experience of the body

48
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:11,040
and letting the breathing return to normal also as a way is this support for coming

49
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,480
here in the present moment take a few moments to relax

50
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:23,839
what you can in your body where the relaxing

51
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:30,079
is a further connecting to what's here and now

52
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,000
especially what's here and now in the body

53
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,360
relaxing the face

54
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,480
relaxing the shoulders

55
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,120
perhaps relaxing the arms and the elbows

56
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:08,079
adjusting your arms a little bit if that helps them be more relaxed

57
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,600
softening in the area of your heart

58
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:36,000
and relaxing in the belly soft belly

59
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,559
maybe a belly that relaxes downward and outward

60
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:53,039
suddenly something inside your whole area of your belly settles down into

61
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:02,880
the pelvic cavity a weight of support and ballast

62
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,840
and perhaps as you exhale

63
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,160
to relax the thinking mind

64
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,440
relax the anxiety to think

65
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,279
the pressure to think

66
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,320
and breathing normally

67
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:55,799
it isn't the abstract present moment we want to be aware of

68
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:02,960
the direct experience of what we can directly experience

69
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:12,240
often through the medium of the body the body is always in the present

70
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:19,520
and that way the body is a support for you an anchor here

71
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,160
here in the present

72
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:31,320
and becoming aware of how the body experiences breathing

73
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:53,840
being aware of breathing while turning on the light of awareness

74
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,960
that is shining on the present moment

75
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:08,240
the awareness is not pulled into the world of thinking rumination fantasy

76
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:19,160
but is attuned to the direct experience of the present

77
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,480
breathing

78
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,240
giving yourself over

79
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,320
to the simplicity of breathing

80
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,440
doesn't have to be complicated

81
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,840
but staying aware

82
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,520
of the rhythm breathing right from the beginning of the

83
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,960
in-breath to the end of the out-breath

84
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:23,320
just breathing here and now

85
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:33,840
whatever might be happening for you be aware of it as present moment

86
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:41,919
experience really just just what's happening now

87
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,720
here and now

88
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,320
there

89
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,480
in these minutes that you're meditating

90
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:08,400
in a sense you're forgiven of all the things you've done in the past

91
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:14,039
and you're freed from all the things you have to do in the future

92
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:28,159
you're allowed for these few minutes to just be alive breathing

93
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:34,320
here in the present moment you're allowed to put aside your

94
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,000
concerns your fantasies

95
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:45,679
to let that active part of the mind relax and settle

96
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:54,480
to just be here in the simplicity of direct experience

97
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:00,159
not needing to figure anything out maybe just

98
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:07,000
being attuned to the body breathing

99
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:42,000
the present moment is a radical time out

100
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,120
time out from the past the future

101
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:55,080
time out for concerns which are not here and now

102
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:03,240
a time out so that you can really enter the time now

103
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:18,360
time out so you can be time in here and now

104
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,880
and one of the opportunities of the present moment

105
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:18,078
is to feel the kind of inner

106
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:24,640
movements of tenderness of the heart

107
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,838
of care

108
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,359
that is known as compassion

109
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:51,440
a warm forgiving caring

110
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:57,760
tenderness that can be for oneself

111
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:07,800
or can radiate through this being of ours

112
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,559
the present moment is a doorway

113
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,200
the for developing compassion

114
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:31,560
one of the great treasures of the human heart

115
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:46,800
and how is it that you experience compassion

116
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,838
what is your way

117
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:59,920
and what is it like to experience compassion when the mind is quiet

118
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:07,200
the heart is quiet when there's a stillness of the body

119
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:20,320
so there aren't so many thoughts and feelings and

120
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:27,280
body movements that distract from

121
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:36,800
an inner quality of care compassion

122
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,200
loving sympathy

123
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:01,839
and sometimes it's the compassion we have

124
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,760
that enables a deeper connection to the present moment

125
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:16,400
a present moment which is paradoxically not troubled by anything

126
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:25,839
at ease in the sweetness of holding ourselves holding all things

127
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:29,640
in tender compassion

128
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:57,720
and as we come to the end of the sitting

129
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:08,640
to have the present moment be an opening of the heart of the mind

130
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:14,800
to reflect on all the beings of this world

131
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,799
and all the suffering of this world

132
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:30,000
and to have your compassion open outwards

133
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:37,040
as a force that extends itself that

134
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,240
spreads itself

135
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:49,520
that reaches out to touch all beings

136
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:55,440
rather than the suffering of all beings coming to touch us

137
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,880
and trouble us we extend ourselves towards all

138
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,880
suffering

139
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:13,839
as a loving force to quiet the flames of suffering the fever of suffering

140
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,920
may the extension of our compassion and love

141
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:31,200
help cool the fever fevers of the world

142
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,838
the fevers of greed and hatred and delusion

143
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,240
the fevers of suffering

144
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:56,280
may all beings be free of suffering

145
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:09,599
all beings be free of the agitation

146
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:16,680
any agitation from their difficulties

147
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:25,520
may all beings experience

148
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:31,000
the absence of hostility directed to them

149
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,240
the absence of our hostility

150
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:49,359
may all beings experience

151
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:52,640
full peace

152
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,480
may all beings be happy

153
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:10,960
may all beings know that they are cared for by others

154
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,838
that people do care

155
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:23,960
may all beings everywhere be happy

156
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:44,060

157
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,619
[Music]

158
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:02,880
so with um this talk i begin a five

159
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:09,800
part series on the brahmavihara of compassion

160
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:17,680
and it's hard to imagine buddhism without compassion

161
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:23,920
that it's one of the primary forces that have that has brought

162
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:30,640
buddhism down to us down through the ages it's one of the primary

163
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:39,040
movements or things that are awakened in us with awakening the more awake we

164
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:44,240
become the more compassion there is the more care and love

165
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:49,520
good will and i'd like to think of awakening this

166
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:56,078
famous english word for liberation enlightenment

167
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:01,680
is uh includes the awakening of compassion

168
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:09,359
and certainly for me one of the big surprises and treasures of

169
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:15,359
buddhist practice was the slow and gradual awakening of my compassion

170
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:20,960
it was so gradual and slow that i didn't really recognize that it was happening while it was

171
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:26,560
happening i wasn't oriented to notice it even though i was changing

172
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:32,240
and in retrospect after a few years of practice i looked back and seen that well maybe i didn't get

173
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:37,680
enlightened but i i certainly became compassioned

174
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:43,520
and discovered this wonderful quality in myself

175
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:50,240
and to my surprise it was a quality that was very satisfying to feel

176
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:57,119
it had kind of a has kind of a sweetness and a subtleness and a rightness to it

177
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:02,160
in and of itself compassion is not troubled by anything

178
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:08,480
and to come to this untroubled compassion is one of the great tasks of a lifetime

179
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:14,400
it's certainly easy to experience the suffering of oneself the suffering of others

180
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,599
and have certainly alarm and upset and distress around it

181
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:27,200
it's also possible to have qualities of compassion together with distress

182
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:34,160
but to be able to have a compassion without any distress is one of the great gifts that we can

183
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:40,000
give to the world and to ourselves and that come from buddhist practice

184
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:46,000
what is compassion um i almost

185
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,680
don't want to define it too much and sometimes i like to think that i

186
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:56,800
don't really know exactly what it is even though it's been one of the central

187
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:03,839
organizing principles for my life for much of my adult life i can't think of

188
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:11,119
very few things that are more important for me and how i live and what motivates me and how i orient myself to the world

189
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:17,200
than this compassion that's been awakened in me so it's clearly very important for me

190
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:22,400
and so it may be a little bit odd for me to say you know i can't

191
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:27,520
really define it exactly and perhaps it's because

192
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:32,800
over the years of my practice what i have called compassion has changed over time

193
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:39,440
and that maybe as i've developed or as circumstances have changed that the quality the characteristics of

194
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:45,920
compassion has not stayed the same in fact maybe there are different forms

195
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:51,280
of compassion and and so in the course of

196
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:58,240
time we tap into these different forms and shapes and characteristics of compassion so that we don't want to kind

197
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:04,640
of you know narrow it down to just just one thing this is what it is

198
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:11,680
um so a little bit reluctant to give a definition that way but it's you know also helpful to

199
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:17,440
understand some of the classic definitions of it and uh probably the most classic

200
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:23,040
buddhist definition in our tradition the theravadin tradition it doesn't come from the buddha who

201
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:28,319
never actually defined karuna and so it's a little bit

202
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:35,599
a guessing game really to think to understand what he actually meant by this word karuna the buddhist word for

203
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:41,359
compassion but buddha gosha a teacher who lives

204
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:48,800
about a thousand years after the buddha he provided a wonderful description of compassion karuna

205
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:54,640
and um he begins with uh the what he loves to do and

206
00:48:54,640 --> 00:49:00,839
many buddhist teachers in asia love to do is they try to

207
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:07,760
connect uh the meaning of a word with words that are uh

208
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:13,520
similar sounding kind of like not quite the etymology game but a correspondence game

209
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:18,720
of uh similar sounding words and um

210
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:23,800
and so karuna you know k-a-r-u-a-n

211
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,760
u-n-a um and it's um so it starts with k-a

212
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:38,400
and so he has all these words that coincidentally are kind of start with k or uh kind of like a k a a

213
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:45,440
r in poly that then he sees as being kind of resonates with compassion or

214
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:52,559
gives the reason why it's called karuna and so maybe uh and so the word

215
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:59,520
compassion i've translated these words with english words that start with c uh c a

216
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:06,000
or c o to go along with this c the c o at the beginning

217
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:13,440
uh you know closest to meaning to what the pali words are so it is compassion

218
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:18,960
because it causes the hearts of good people to be moved by

219
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:25,359
the suffering of others so the hearts of good people to be moved by

220
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:31,200
the suffering of others and first you know what is it what does it mean to be a good person

221
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:36,400
the word can also mean an ethical person someone who does who lives trying their

222
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:41,520
best to not live from hatred and greed

223
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:47,359
lust trying to live from qualities of friendliness and good will

224
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:53,440
and kindness and wisdom and so as people who have

225
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:58,880
discovered this is why meditation is so helpful i think meditation helps us to become good people

226
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:04,640
it helps free us from these forces of hostility or ill will or the

227
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:11,280
things that we can do that hurt other people and to be strongly motivated not to hurt

228
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:16,960
and if we're such a person who's able to be in the present moment it's such an important place to be as a reference

229
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:22,480
point as a discovery of this life then to be in the presence of others

230
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:28,559
people suffering or know about it something inside of us moves some people translate this word as

231
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:33,760
trembles or shakes there's removed by the suffering of others

232
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:39,760
and the question is how are we moved how are we moved so there's no distress

233
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:46,960
so then the definition goes on further and says it is compassion because it combats

234
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:53,040
strikes and destroys the suffering of others it's a little bit paradoxical ironic to

235
00:51:53,040 --> 00:52:00,240
use such violent terms in relationship to compassion but it does speak to the strong motivation to

236
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:07,520
really make a difference to really try to overcome suffering in this world and not

237
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:13,920
to just kind of accept in some kind of deep way but really have this goal this idea that it can end in some way or

238
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:19,839
other and then it is compassion

239
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:26,160
because it covers or moves covers or

240
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:33,920
those who suffer the word can also mean in pali moves or affects other people who suffer

241
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:43,359
so the compassion touches other people so it moves covers those who suffer

242
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:47,280
reaching out actually

243
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:55,520
reach here there's a different translation reaching out to pervade those who suffer

244
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:01,359
it is compassion because it covers those who suffer

245
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:07,359
so it moves those are sufferers so there's something that we reach out from the heart with the

246
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:12,800
idea of suffusing or spreading compassion now is this kind of

247
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:18,160
fanciful thinking to think that compassion can spread from us out into the world

248
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:25,280
is there a force like you know electricity that there are you know wave lengths of vibration that spread out

249
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:31,200
what is it i don't know and i don't i'm disinclined to

250
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:36,800
call it anything that but we do affect each other

251
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:42,079
we do pick up the cues the tone of voice the mannerisms of others that we can

252
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:48,319
feel sometimes the intentions of others and and to know that this this spreads

253
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:55,680
out is it means that to know that somehow people are touched by it it resonates in people

254
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:01,359
and for us to open our hearts and spread lovingkindness and compassion to the

255
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:07,200
world as if we're suffusing we're touching other people

256
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:13,119
who suffer a little bit more i want to say but this

257
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:18,640
ancient definition or discussion of it compassion is characterized as

258
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:24,480
supporting what reduces suffering i like this definition because it's not

259
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:30,480
necessarily saying we work directly to end suffering but we help reduce the

260
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:35,680
support for suffering the underlying causes for suffering and that's many

261
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:42,559
many things sometimes as things in the external world sometimes it's things within but whatever it is that supports people

262
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:50,000
to suffer or the condition for people to suffer that is addressed by people who have compassion

263
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:57,760
compassion uh this is next one is very important compassion functions

264
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:03,680
to not carry the suffering of others

265
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:09,680
compassion has the quality that when we have this karuna kind of compassion

266
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:15,920
we don't we're not burdened distressed by the suffering of others and that is

267
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:21,760
one of the key qualities of this compassion to not be distressed or burdened by it

268
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:26,640
and to be interested in alleviating suffering elsewhere

269
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:32,240
it it manifests as the absence of cruelty

270
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:38,000
its proximate cause is to see the helplessness of those overwhelmed by suffering

271
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:44,079
to see the helplessness of those overwhelmed by suffering i mean that really can touch the heart

272
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:50,799
in a deep way people suffer but there are some people have no ability because circumstances what's

273
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:57,359
happening in the world to their helpless they can't really help themselves and that really tugs the heart well if

274
00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:02,720
they can't help themselves who's going to let me help them people are in war zones

275
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:09,040
people are in tremendous uh experiences of oppression and that you know the whole system is set up

276
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:14,480
around them the whole world is set up and there's no way out of their

277
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:20,160
oppressed state or terrible state they're in and that the other people are helpless

278
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:28,400
sometimes in their suffering and tugs on the heart and awakens this kind of karuna compassion

279
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:34,720
and compassion succeeds when it makes cruelty subside and fails

280
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:40,319
when it produces sorrow so

281
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:45,760
when cruelty subsides hostility subsides and sorrow

282
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:51,920
and there's no sorrow it doesn't elicit sorrow in us distress in us

283
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:58,400
so to have our hearts moved in such a way that we're not burdened not distressed

284
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:06,400
that there's absence of hostility and anger but a strong motivation

285
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:11,680
to help and support people to suffer less

286
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:17,680
that's kind of the general kind of parameters of what this compassion is and

287
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:24,960
and i think many times this part that it it doesn't involve being burdened there's no distress in it or sorrow

288
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:33,280
involved in compassion that is kind of the art that's kind of like the magic of it or the specialness of it

289
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:39,599
and some people cannot believe that or cannot justify that they feel like they has to

290
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:45,839
be sorrow and distress and and a sense of weight the weight of the world on their shoulders

291
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:51,280
but to have this compassion that is sweet

292
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:59,359
that the compassion that is this one of the great sources of being happy in the world

293
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:05,119
if we want to be happy live compassionately

294
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:10,480
but the compassion of karuna this a particular kind of compassion

295
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:19,440
that the buddha emphasizes or buddha gosha here emphasizes it's a it's a very special thing and

296
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:25,760
and in these few words that i had to talk about compassion what i hope is that

297
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:30,799
it will awaken in you as a curiosity and interest

298
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:36,640
and what is compassion for you and what does your compassion feel like

299
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:42,640
what reference do you have for compassion that is sweet compassion that is a source of

300
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:48,319
well-being compassion that is deeply moved by the suffering of the world but is not

301
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:55,119
burdened by it distressed by it what is that do you have any reference point for it

302
00:58:55,119 --> 00:59:00,480
and if not maybe you can reflect on this and think about it and talk to people over the

303
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:05,760
next day about your relationship to compassion and how you understand it

304
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:09,960
so thank you very much

305
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:13,440
you
