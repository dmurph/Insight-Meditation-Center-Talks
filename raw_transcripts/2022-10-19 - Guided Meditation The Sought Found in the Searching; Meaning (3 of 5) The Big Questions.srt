1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:13,340
foreign hello everyone

2
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:20,220
and now contentment

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,840
is a little Maybe

4
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,320
problematic when a person is broadcasting to hundreds of

5
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,800
people in that for a few moments here I was just content to sit here and kind of

6
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,000
was not thinking about that I'm supposed to speak

7
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:56,760
so um it's nice to be here

8
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,698
and I want to begin with just a story

9
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:08,600
that uh hopefully you're generous with going along with the interpretation

10
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:16,220
because that's the point is the moral of the tail not the how well it fits the moral

11
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,820
and um so there because there's a spiritual Seeker

12
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:34,439
it's very sincere dedicated to the spiritual path wants to find but has

13
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:41,159
been doing it for a long time and and hasn't had any success

14
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:47,900
whatever that might mean and goes to find

15
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:55,939
one of the most senior Elder wise people in that spiritual tradition and

16
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,380
and explains the difficulty and you know been practicing for a long time

17
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:08,060
and searching for a long long time to no avail

18
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:15,480
and the teacher says oh okay um it's not far away for you what you're

19
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:23,580
seeking but you have to uh seek search look

20
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:30,780
practice wholeheartedly and um

21
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:37,800
the person what do you mean wholeheartedly I've been sincere and dedicated no no you have to practice wholeheartedly

22
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:44,819
do that for a year and come back

23
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:50,580
so the person does does that that's not quite sure what wholehearted means and tries all kinds of things sometimes

24
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:59,220
strains too much and learns that that can't be wholehearted and sometimes practice whole wholehearted relaxation

25
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:05,400
but that doesn't seem to be quite it and sometimes kind of evokes all the faith

26
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,940
the person has lots of faith in the spiritual path and but that doesn't seem

27
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:17,400
to quite do it but keeps trying it keeps engaging keeps

28
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:24,120
finding out trying to what is wholehearted what is wholehearted a year later goes back to the teacher

29
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,780
and says well now I've been doing this for a year and described what had been the

30
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:38,519
practices of wholeheartedness the efforts and the teacher said very good

31
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:44,159
you're been seeking so now

32
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:50,940
realize or now turn the attention around 180

33
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:56,159
degrees and realize

34
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:04,760
that what you're seeking what you're searching for is in the seeking

35
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:11,000
and with that the person was set free

36
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:19,139
so the story of kind of searching for something or what out there

37
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:27,600
that we're going to attain but maybe there's something very profound to be discovered not in the

38
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,300
what not in some realization not in some understanding not in some experience

39
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:41,940
but rather in the our capacity to be aware

40
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:49,199
the capacity in which we know anything which we gaze upon and see

41
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:56,699
and sometimes we're blinded and don't see the seeing because we're looking for something

42
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:02,880
we're involved in something thinking about something

43
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:10,860
and to take that backward step that 180 degree turn and to appreciate and find maybe even

44
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:16,860
freedom in the seeing in The Knowing in the

45
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:22,080
awaring is a radical paradigm shift

46
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,479
from how people many people live their lives and how they find meaning in their

47
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:36,000
life so to assume a meditation posture

48
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,758
that will be the support

49
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,740
for a wholehearted

50
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:58,460
awareness practice wholehearted just being here with the experience now

51
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:05,160
I like to interpret wholeheartedness not as straining or pushing or trying a lot

52
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:11,419
but a complete willingness

53
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:18,500
to enter into this moment of experience

54
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:28,160
a wholehearted means to enter wholly into the experience of now

55
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,620
gently closing the eyes

56
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:43,400
taking a few long slow deep breaths

57
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:59,300
relaxing with the long extended exhale

58
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:19,020
continuing with some longer deeper breaths hopefully in a comfortable way

59
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:24,120
and then at the next exhale the end of the exhale the

60
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:30,000
hold your breath for as long as it's comfortable and while you do so

61
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,560
feel your body and let your body relax more

62
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:42,780
till you feel the strong pull strong urge to breathe in

63
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,759
and then gently breathe in deeply

64
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:56,419
the end of the exhale hold your breath for just long enough that you start feeling the body relax

65
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,360
and maybe holding your breath the top of the inhale

66
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:21,780
that pause before exhaling there's a heightened attention to the

67
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:28,560
body to the urge to in exhale but also maybe a heightened sensitivity

68
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:36,500
to the body that allows you to the body to relax more

69
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:54,540
holding your breath for most people puts them more fully in

70
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,380
the present moment

71
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:13,640
and then returning to a normal breathing without holding anything

72
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:23,420
and on the exhale continue this process of softening relaxing your body

73
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:03,300
and then is there a way that you can be aware of the present

74
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,399
without trying to be aware

75
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:16,880
to be aware and allow yourself to be aware

76
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:39,560
where wholeheartedness is not trying harder

77
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:47,339
but rather allowing for fully

78
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:54,839
holistically globally

79
00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:03,440
for awareness to be here and now

80
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:37,100
not trying

81
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:46,880
but allowing the present moment awareness

82
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:54,140
and in a sense allowing breathing at the center of it all

83
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,140
to come to you to come to awareness

84
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,880
rather than you directing the attention

85
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:11,420
the attention receives the experience of breathing

86
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:07,200
and then wholeness wholehearted awareness

87
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:15,500
whole awareness of the moment let that include

88
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:24,380
honesty and honest recognition of what is happening

89
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:29,360
within you

90
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:43,160
thinking feeling wanting not wanting

91
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:54,260
and honesty that needs nothing wants something nothing

92
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:02,040
honesty that's not judging just an honest recognition of what's

93
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,759
Happening Now

94
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:06,380
and then the to turn the attention around 180 degrees

95
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:16,460
to find Freedom in the searching

96
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:26,220
rather than being aware of freedom

97
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:30,620
as something external from awareness

98
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:37,880
to be aware of the to know the freedom of awareness

99
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:47,640
is there a sense of freedom and non-attachment

100
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:55,020
in the simplest acts of knowing sensing

101
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,799
seeing with the Mind's Eye

102
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,658
even if it's just a hint

103
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:19,980
rest back in the freedom found

104
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:27,440
in awareness in being aware

105
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,320
foreign

106
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:42,539
to imagine yourself sitting back in an easy chair

107
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:45,980
maybe you are even

108
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:56,460
nothing's required of you nothing you have to do or say

109
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:01,340
but just be present Here and Now

110
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:07,700
and the people of your lives start coming in

111
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:15,419
and they sit down around you with you Neighbors come in

112
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:21,779
strangers come in the whole town the whole County the

113
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:26,880
whole state everyone

114
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,100
comes in as the walls of your house expand bigger and

115
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:38,520
bigger nothing's required of you but to be present

116
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:42,799
nothing you have to say or do

117
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:50,360
and maybe it's possible to be aware of them all

118
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:58,679
with the freedom of awareness the awareness that

119
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:03,620
doesn't get stuck anywhere or attached to anything

120
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:13,080
kind of like looking out across the ocean just not fixating on anything seeing the

121
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:18,020
ocean relax that ease

122
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:24,860
gazing upon all these people that have come to you

123
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,500
and perhaps to

124
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,960
bring forth Good Will and friendliness

125
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:49,100
a good will that simply is wishing them well

126
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:57,899
may it be that they have lots of benefits lots of Happiness

127
00:29:57,899 --> 00:30:01,399
lots of safety

128
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:11,539
lots of Peace may they be well may they be safe

129
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:31,760
gazing upon all beings kindly while staying calm

130
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:39,720
may all beings be happy may all beings

131
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:45,960
be safe they all beings be peaceful

132
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,120
may all beings be free

133
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:04,409
[Music]

134
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:12,259
thank you

135
00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:03,360
so hello everyone and here we are at the third talk and this

136
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:08,760
here five part series on meaning and um

137
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:18,000
that the meetings we have for ourselves meanings we have for life can come to bear on our meditation

138
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,080
there's a connection with it and sometimes we um that the sense of meaning we have

139
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,760
animates and activates our meditation like search for meaning

140
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:35,520
staying close to it sometimes it agitates it sometimes it's you know you

141
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:40,559
get caught up in these topics of meaning meaning uh the important important

142
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:48,000
meanings we have can influence how we meditate and why we meditate and

143
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,360
and so to begin looking at the meaning making aspects of the mind and

144
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:59,820
meaning making aspects of how we live our lives is important all around but

145
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:06,659
it's also important to really kind of clarify what we're doing in meditation what meditation is about for us

146
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:12,840
both so that we can maybe have a little bit wholehearted engagement we know why

147
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:19,140
we're doing something but also be so that sometimes the meetings we assign to meditation or

148
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:24,419
connect to it are not helpful they actually get in the way of the

149
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:31,940
depth and full potential of meditation um the

150
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:40,880
so the um so there's this idea of meaning

151
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:48,000
sometimes connected to the big questions of life that people are sometimes very strongly motivated to find or to live by

152
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,880
or or to establish for themselves so something as big as what's the

153
00:33:53,880 --> 00:34:00,840
meaning of life or what's the meaning of my life that I want to have there's these big questions about uh

154
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:07,140
death you know what what happens when we die what happens to us after we die

155
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:13,200
and um and so people are you know trying to understand that then that affects

156
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,540
their relationship to meditation meditation for some people is a strategy

157
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:24,118
in order to deal with death and for some people it's uh it's

158
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:32,099
understood that mindfulness meditation is one of the best preparations for dying and so wanting to die well or die freely

159
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:38,760
and not be die you know with difficulty but some people it's meditation is not

160
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:46,618
about dying well but about being reborn well or not not being reborn in future and there's a

161
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:54,118
strong momentum or approaching Buddhism about practicing in

162
00:34:54,119 --> 00:35:00,060
order to become free of rebirth so some people that's really important for what they do and that's kind of

163
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:06,060
informs and animates their whole dedication to meditation

164
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:11,220
some people mistrust meaning making

165
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:17,160
and uh and don't see a need for it and for them meditation is not about

166
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:23,040
um you know the big questions of life but have to do with the Simplicity of the moment just living this moment in a

167
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:29,220
nice way but that also is connected to meaning somehow the idea that just living fully

168
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:36,000
for this moment in a simple clear free way that that's meaningful that's important that's a valuable way of

169
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,339
living a living this precious life that we have that some and so you know this

170
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:48,000
idea of what interpretation what understanding do we have about what this life is about

171
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,839
so um so these are things to reflect on and

172
00:35:54,839 --> 00:36:02,760
and partly reflecting on what's most important for us and um and the value of really spending

173
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:10,980
time with that and looking at it then we can ask the question um how does my meditation support what's

174
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:16,320
most important for me and it's possible that if meditation

175
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:22,200
doesn't support what's most important maybe you shouldn't meditate maybe there's better things to do maybe it's

176
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:27,839
to do things that actually support what's most important but if meditation in fact does support

177
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:33,839
what's most important then maybe then there's a more easier to do it or more

178
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:39,900
motivated to do it or and we see the connection and and you know it it really

179
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:46,940
you know and encourage us to be more fully involved with it all

180
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:53,460
also to realize that maybe they're consciously or unconsciously that we

181
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:59,400
have these large existential questions or our large extential answers some of us live by

182
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:08,160
uh engagements as part of all this then it's possible to investigate more deeply

183
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:14,000
um kind of to turn the attention around 180 degrees to really look deeply inside

184
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,099
where do these existential beliefs where do these ideas

185
00:37:19,099 --> 00:37:24,660
what is uh fueling them where they arise out of what's the source of them inside

186
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:30,000
of ourselves and and rather than accepting it as a

187
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,660
given uh not questioning the philosophy or the beliefs that are there necessarily

188
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:43,920
but rather questioning maybe or looking deeply what is motivating that what animates

189
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:50,099
them what is their fuel for thinking this way or being this way

190
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:55,880
and what I mean for this they'll give you some examples that um

191
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:03,119
some people will ask you know what's the meaning of life some big question like that

192
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:11,040
and I might ask what's the emotion that is fueling that question

193
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,619
and some people will say it's fear fear of missing out fear not doing it

194
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:24,180
right fear of of failing this life or fear of you know not really

195
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:31,500
understanding what's the purpose of my life and and if fear is motivating it

196
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:39,420
then the practice of mindfulness is to turn the attention around to really attend to

197
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:46,619
the fear before we attend to the big questions and really go deeply into it and be

198
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:53,520
present until that fear dissolves and when the fear dissolves then what

199
00:38:53,520 --> 00:39:00,000
has happened to those questions if those questions are big questions or the big kind of meanings of Life are not

200
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,339
fueled by fear what fuels them

201
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:12,900
or if they're not fueled what happens to them is our relationships does our relationship to them change the beliefs

202
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:19,200
might still be there but if they don't have the uh the strength that comes with the power that

203
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:26,540
comes from the fear what happens to it then the same thing with death

204
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:33,440
concerns with death might have to do with fear and to look at the fear deeply

205
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:39,000
sometimes what fuels these things is conceit somehow it's about me and myself

206
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,099
and I have to prove myself I have to do what's right I have to account for

207
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:49,680
myself I have to show that I'm a good person I have to prove something

208
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:58,020
and um and so these big existential questions are very tightly connected to ideas of identity

209
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:04,980
of conceit of um that we attachments to self uh all right now I'm using all of

210
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:13,680
these in the context of how they involve attachment and um and uh

211
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:21,119
um and so we investigate that we bring our attention to that and so this idea of turning around 180

212
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:27,900
degrees and really is looking deeper and deeper rather than letting the big questions of Life the big existential

213
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:34,020
conclusions and ideas of life a hover there in our life and as if they're like

214
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:41,780
a fixed thing to stay with and we live by uh mindfulness meditation involves a

215
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:47,400
looking deeper and deeper what what animates it where does the source inside

216
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:52,800
where these kinds of beliefs understandings come from

217
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:59,220
what what fuels them and um and so it's a paradigm shift in a

218
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:04,980
sense from being concerned with something that's and

219
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:11,339
um you know um that we can be aware of we can think about we can believe about

220
00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:17,280
to something that's deeper than what we think about or what we believe about or

221
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:24,180
that kind of focus and returning around and what what is it like to be believing

222
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:30,420
what is it like to be searching what's it like to be holding on to these

223
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:35,880
ideas that it has to be this way uh or this you know if I don't kind of

224
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:42,900
believe this or hold on to this kind of thing everything will fall apart and these beliefs keep me safe Maybe

225
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:50,760
so these big existential questions in in this mindfulness tradition are important to see

226
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:56,940
the big existential conclusions we've come to they're important to see and then but then

227
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:04,680
look more deeply what's going on under the surface what is the source for them inside what

228
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:09,960
is the feelings the emotions the fears the conceits the you know what's what's

229
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:16,400
the complex it's all about and how this all connects to meditation

230
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:22,440
is that um it turns out that these existential

231
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:27,920
questions these big answers we have to the big questions of life

232
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:33,119
more often than not will interfere

233
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:39,900
with the full potential of meditation being a full releasing

234
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:45,180
of all attachment and when all our attachments have been

235
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:52,760
released what happens to our relationship to these big existential questions big

236
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:57,960
existential big you know answers that we might be trying to live

237
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:04,280
by or living by him they don't necessarily go away and the answer still might be relevant for us

238
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:10,040
but it's a kind of a whole different world to live in with them

239
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:15,119
if that we've been able to take meditation all the way to its potential

240
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:22,380
to a full release so what is your relationship

241
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:29,400
to the big questions of life to questions of meaning questions about life and death and what

242
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:34,680
is it questions of what's most ultimate

243
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:41,720
questions of God and Heaven and rebirth and and um

244
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:47,339
purpose and do you have something that you believe believe is Ultimate

245
00:43:47,339 --> 00:43:55,020
or you're searching for that and to respect that you whatever it is you're doing like this respect it deeply

246
00:43:55,020 --> 00:44:01,140
but then turn the attention around and look more deeply at what's

247
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:09,079
underneath that what's fueling it uh what's the what's it what's animating

248
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:15,839
those beliefs so that involvement and see if uh what you see there and

249
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:25,740
and find and and see if that might help you uh to become quieter Stiller

250
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:31,020
more at ease more

251
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:39,859
centered Here and Now in that place where there can be no attachments

252
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:46,200
so thank you very much and uh continue

253
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:51,980
this idea of meaning um tomorrow
