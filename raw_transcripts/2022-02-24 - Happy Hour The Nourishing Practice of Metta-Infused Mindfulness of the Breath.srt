hello hi we're international so let's uh let's begin

23
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:20,399
let's begin formally and i changed the settings at this point so

24
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:27,200
that if you are uh if well i ask you to to mute yourself i

25
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:34,399
think you're already muted i'm going to change the settings so that unmuting would go away for the duration and also

26
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:40,560
change the chat settings so that uh the chat will only come to me if there's

27
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:47,440
anything urgent that needs to be communicated like the sound drops off otherwise let's can keep

28
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:54,160
that channel quiet otherwise it can be distracting while i'm giving a guided meditation or a talk we can we'll open

29
00:13:54,160 --> 00:14:00,079
it afterwards and last but not least turning on recording for the sake of

30
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:07,759
audio dharma our friends will join later here we go

31
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:14,160
so hello and welcome everyone welcome to happy hour

32
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,519
so for our practice today um [Music]

33
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:26,320
i'd like to invite us to explore in our meditation together

34
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,480
a couple of different concepts that i want to bring together

35
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:39,199
one is the concept of practicing loving kindness meta

36
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:44,880
which has so many different dimensions it's both a cultivation practice and

37
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:52,560
it it makes us kinder happier

38
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,920
in how we feel externally relationships there's so many different

39
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:05,120
aspects to this practice so many different aspects but of course we've spent many many

40
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:11,600
sessions tapping into all these different aspects relationally internally etc

41
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,720
and one one aspect of the practice of meta

42
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:24,480
is that it's also a considered a unification practice

43
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,800
it's a practice that calms the mind that pacifies the mind

44
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:41,240
that steals the mind and it's like petting it's like petting the mind if you're petting a kitty like

45
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:49,680
so this practice if we gently gently pet the mind with this practice over and

46
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:56,320
over again it starts to purr starts to purr there's a sense of ease

47
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:04,639
and and contentment and goodness nourishment nourishment of

48
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:10,160
loving kindness for ourselves that just fills the heart fills the body

49
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:17,680
which is so healing can be so healing so that's the aspect i'd like to invite

50
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,800
us to tap into and if you've had a long day or a hard day

51
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,079
if this sounds like good news that this is what we're exploring then yay because

52
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:35,360
it is there is an aspect of healing calming and for this for it to build up there are various

53
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,639
things that need to be in place and one again

54
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:46,399
it's a much longer conversation and as we've covered many aspects but one thing

55
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:52,639
i like to lean into so just saying that this is not a complete description of everything that's needed

56
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:58,880
but what we'll be leaning into today for our practice is

57
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:07,199
is an embodies embodiment so we keep bringing back this meta to ourselves to

58
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,240
the body again and again

59
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:19,280
and again and when the mind wanders off for a thought or plan or tomorrow

60
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,319
yesterday it's like oh sweetheart it's okay it's okay come back to the body

61
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:30,880
come back come back and if we feel oh i've had this i'm done

62
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:37,200
with it i'm bored like oh stay stay stay stay just keep petting you

63
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:43,440
just you hang in there and one concept i want to bring in here

64
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,440
is in psychology this is called the very technical term of risk response

65
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:56,720
inhibition response inhibition which is this in one description of it is

66
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,799
refers to the suppression of actions that are inappropriate in the given context and that interfere with

67
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:09,440
goal-driven behavior yeah that's very psychological but the point here which is actually this practice it's

68
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,640
really um i mean this idea of response inhibition is when you stay you just

69
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,919
stay you kindly gently i know it sounds really clinical but it's also another

70
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,919
way to feel into like you know it's like oh i've had it okay it's been whatever 20 minutes okay i want to go and watch

71
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:31,280
netflix and i've practiced you know i've done it like stay stay

72
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:38,400
stay can you stay and the more you stay the more like okay i want to just fix it and and grab my

73
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:45,039
tea and drink it in the middle of meditation and fidget and like scratch myself how would if i stay

74
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:50,720
what if i gently stay again not in a harsh way i'm not suggesting that but

75
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,559
can you gently train yourself to stay keep petting

76
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:02,720
petting the kitty and see what happens see what happens at the end right

77
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:10,160
if you don't interrupt if you don't go after all these distractions of thought or mind just see

78
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:16,720
if the sense of nourishment again you need to be very gentle with this it's not a harsh thing to do just

79
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:22,240
lovingly oh can you stay sweetheart can you stay okay

80
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,960
so that is the frame for tonight that is the frame for tonight and again

81
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:33,120
gentleness ease its nourishment being nourished and healed

82
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,880
is our goal is our destination so if anything if you find yourself becoming

83
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,080
too harsh or too tight that's not the way let that go it's okay

84
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:50,640
just breathe breathe with ease breathe with ease

85
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,760
and kindly kindly turn to whatever is arising as if you're petting the kitty

86
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:02,080

170
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,440
petting the whole body maybe the body starts to purr after a

171
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:33,480
while receiving all this loving attention

172
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,200
let yourself be surprised

173
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:00,400
as to what levels of peace nourishment healing

174
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,520
might be possible

175
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:12,599
through continuity consistency with this practice

176
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:35,839
and the thoughts arise pet them and release them too

177
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,920
coming back to the body

178
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:50,760
the nourishment of the breath wrapped in matter

179
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:05,320
releasing releasing letting go the other side of the coin of mitta

180
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,640
release into peace

181
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:22,880
release into love loving each part

182
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:29,480
each and every part of this body with the breath

183
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:23,920
can there be meta wrapped with each breath in each breath

184
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:30,480
breathing in and out for this entire body especially if any part

185
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,040
is having challenges

186
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:03,760
let the breath imbued with kindness be nourishing

187
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:11,119
healing to your heart your mind to your body

188
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,359
breath by breath

189
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,359
here here

190
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:17,800
as thoughts arise can we release them come back here this body with metal

191
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:01,078
here here this body

192
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:10,359
each breath breath of kindness

193
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:29,760
and for the last moments of this practice period releasing releasing

194
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:36,480
with the out breath whatever rose or did not arise for

195
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:43,680
releasing any judgment any criticism and allowing there to be meta

196
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:50,720
appreciation care for yourself for this body for this heart and this

197
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:56,318
mind you showed up you did the best you could

198
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:03,880
and offering that to yourself and to others

199
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:15,839
[Music]

200
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:24,599
thank you for your practice everyone

201
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:36,480
[Music] ah

202
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:42,319
i have to say i don't feel like talking so much but i don't know if

203
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:49,200
if how it was for you i'd love to hear it at any point it was feeling like

204
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:56,160
per you know this purring was petting the cat with the breath metal infused with the breath the sense of purring

205
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:03,520
like oh yeah this is good i want to stay here this is good i can hang out here

206
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:08,640
even if for a few seconds you felt that yay what how

207
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:14,800
nourishing how nourishing for for us to rest

208
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:20,880
in this wellspring of this wellspring of contentment

209
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:25,920
in the heart another way we could see this practice

210
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:32,000
we did together was the merging of mindfulness of the breath

211
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:38,079
mindfulness of the breath with the practice of meta infusing the two together

212
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:43,920
so that's another perspective can hold this practice so so

213
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:48,960
some time if you want to share any reflections any thoughts

214
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:55,200
observations um

215
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:58,880
you can type in chat

216
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:07,359
typing in chat would be if just to me would be private and i won't read your name if it's to

217
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:13,359
everyone i'll read your reflection if you wish or you can raise

218
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:19,680
your hand yeah i see greg

219
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:27,440
i really like the the idea of taking something that's a tactile process

220
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:33,520
and turning that inward it seems really novel to me and uh

221
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:39,920
i do this thing or i have my whole life with my horses where i palpate down their spine when i

222
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:46,400
think there might be problems and then watching their spinal column

223
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:51,520
relax and then radiates out through their whole body and i was just sort of doing that to my

224
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:58,160
own guts [Laughter] based upon your suggestion so thank you for that

225
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:04,960
i love that greg i love that you were doing that to your own gut and did it have the same impact as you

226
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:10,720
observe in your on your horses actually it really did it was just sort

227
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:16,880
of the idea of a gentle sort of massaging of you know

228
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:23,119
you know the abdominal area and you know just like i noticed a sort of sometimes a

229
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:29,520
short-term contractile response in which the horse will elevate their spine and then they let it down and you see

230
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:35,599
you see like the arc of the natural arc of their spine drop as they relax and i had the same sort of

231
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:41,440
internal reaction to that so it was a beautiful little experience for me it's a really food for thought

232
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:47,359
yeah it's great it sounds like it opened something up and a couple of other things i wanted to bring here thank you

233
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:52,480
so much for sharing that greg i'm loving hearing about the horses and their you

234
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:58,559
know the rhythmic uh the petting and and and their releasing

235
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:05,680
and and one thing also comes to my mind is you know this idea of petting the horse out of care out of concern with

236
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:13,839
meta for them so it's the same movement of the heart that you're doing it's not just a physicality right there there is

237
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:19,359
that sense of care that you're also bringing and so i wanted to highlight that also which is what

238
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:25,760
really helps this release there's a sense of safety and care that makes it happen so that's lovely

239
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:32,079
thank you for that reflection beautiful and glad yay something opened up for you

240
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:36,960
