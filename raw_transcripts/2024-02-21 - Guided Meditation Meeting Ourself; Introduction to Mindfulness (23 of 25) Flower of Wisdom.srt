1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,520
so hello everyone and welcome to

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:15,880
imc's YouTube meditation session and for this morning I'd like to keep

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:22,880
the sitting mostly silent and invite you

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:31,960
to um put together what I've taught so far the first two days which is to

5
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:38,200
whatever happens for you during this meditation whether you're it's your breathing that you're able to hang out

6
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:44,079
with whether it's sensations of your body sounds in the area where you're at

7
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:52,079
emotions or thoughts that you would recognize what's happening you

8
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:59,320
would know it by stepping back not being completely uh entangled involved with it

9
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:07,960
or reating to it or judging it just know it really simply and then uh with that ability to

10
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,360
not be entangled or reactive just to know it simply then come and respect it

11
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,079
come together and decide the right distance for your awareness to respect it

12
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:25,640
properly um if it's a mountain line in the wilderness the respectful distance

13
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,119
is really far if it's um you know a young child that is injured and you're

14
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:39,000
putting on a Band-Aid the respectful distance is much closer so find the place and then linger

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,159
stay connected for at least three breaths to whatever is happening and

16
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:51,600
then maybe return to the breathing and then that would be the Rhythm where in the Silence of this meditation you are

17
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:58,840
meeting yourself you're learning you're experimenting with how to be have the simple presence recognition with

18
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:05,200
anything that happens there's a meeting happening and in a sense you're meeting yourself maybe meeting yourself in a

19
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,800
deep way and how you meet meet it how you meet your experience is what this

20
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:18,560
meditation is about meeting it with a combination of mindfulness and

21
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:25,000
concentration so um then we'll just start and uh with no other preliminary

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,360
if you'd like to use a preliminary way of relaxing and settling in like we usually do you're welcome to

23
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:38,120
do that and otherwise you're welcome to um just begin as you wish but we'll

24
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,040
keep this silence

for

72
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:51,039
as we near the end of this sitting for whatever is your

73
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:56,760
predominant experience of the moment the direct

74
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:05,799
experience step back from it a bit and know it with

75
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,720
respect almost as if you bring your hands together to

76
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:23,039
bow in respect to whatever is happening allowing it to be as it

77
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:30,080
is knowing it meeting

78
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,320
it with respect and

79
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,679
care

80
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:35,398
and then to turn your attention

81
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:43,799
outwards to the communities and people around you spreading

82
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:50,799
outwards in your neighborhoods or counties

83
00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:01,360
provinces and the people that you will meet knowingly or you know about or you

84
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:09,880
don't know today that in the meeting with

85
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:14,120
others can you meet them with

86
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:23,919
respect where you are independent not in Tangled with

87
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:29,519
them but able to see them clearly

88
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,880
kindly with

89
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:38,399
respect

90
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:48,840
independent but always ready in your at least your heart to bow in respect to

91
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,320
whoever you meet

92
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:04,279
regardless and for the people who are challenging for

93
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:10,480
us maybe we can imagine that one reason that they're

94
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:16,679
challenging for you their behavior is because they have not

95
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:25,480
received enough respect and care for their basic

96
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:31,760
Humanity and perhaps without agreeing with to

97
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,799
them condoning what they

98
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:45,640
do being independent of them offer them

99
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:56,159
respect may all beings be

100
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:01,720
happy May may all beings be

101
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:07,320
safe may all [Music] beings be

102
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:13,080
peaceful and may all beings everywhere be

103
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:19,278
free and may our ability to meet with

104
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,559
respect promote this

105
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,320
possibility

106
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:45,799
thank

107
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,320
you

108
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:44,840
so hello everyone and welcome to this cont continuation of

109
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:50,320
the introduction to meditation series and for this

110
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,440
um current series that we're coming to the last week in the last week of

111
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:03,159
it and two announce ments one is that um probably I'll I'll start a new

112
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:09,000
series on Monday maybe it's introduction to meditation part two or maybe we call

113
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:15,120
it the intermediate instructions but um I think it'd be nice to continue on this

114
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:21,000
and build on what we've done these weeks and the second is that um there

115
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,360
was a time we used to do some uh Community meetings on Zoom usually on

116
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:33,919
Fridays at day end of the week and I haven't had the chance to do that for a long time but I do have this Friday so

117
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:39,000
I'll post a zoom link uh on imc's what's

118
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:48,240
new and to um and then I will um uh also announce it again and

119
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:55,720
I'll post it in the chat on Friday and we'll go there right after this uh meeting uh on on YouTube and those of

120
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:01,519
you like to come together will will have some time for maybe me for give some

121
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:07,399
updates maybe for uh you to ask me some questions and maybe for some breakout

122
00:32:07,399 --> 00:32:14,840
groups so some of you can meet each other and have a small conversations

123
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:25,080
so so as for today the um the con continuation of practice the

124
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:31,480
deepening of mindfulness practice is greatly helped by wisdom wisdom is the

125
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:39,000
quality of understanding that supports us from uh that kind of protects us from

126
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,200
getting entangled being caught with what our experience is or what's happening uh

127
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,760
we don't get reactive we don't get attached we don't get uh resentful we

128
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:56,679
don't uh hostile to but rather what supports us to meet things with a

129
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:05,440
profound respect with a profound respect for ourselves where we can uh kind of hold

130
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,519
our seat uh take our place in a clear

131
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:19,760
upright way and um and uh and uh be able to meet people

132
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:25,360
with uh respect with kindness and maybe with

133
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,480
wisdom because we've taken the time to really know what's happening here and

134
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:39,000
now so one of the advantages of developing some concentration with

135
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:45,600
mindfulness is that concentration tends to quiet the thinking mind and as we as

136
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:51,080
the thinking mind gets quieter then uh we see the thinking mind

137
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:56,960
better uh it begins when it does arise we start seeing it in highlight against

138
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,360
against the silence against the Stillness often in daily life we're so

139
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:08,118
busy thinking we don't even know we're thinking distracted from distractions by

140
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:13,320
distractions and um and the thing thoughts might be coming so fast that we

141
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:18,800
almost don't have time to really assess what's going on but as we sit and

142
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:24,398
meditate there's a tendency to get calmer not always but when it does and

143
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:32,158
then we can start seeing the thoughts as they arise see them in highlight and we can start seeing the nature of some of

144
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:37,520
these thoughts we can start seeing them for what they are and in doing that we

145
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:45,440
become um uh you know able to see with uh start seeing something with uh free

146
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:52,480
of the lens of the particular Concepts ideas Paradigm even by which we're

147
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:58,000
living and um and we can see with fresh eyes see in new ways

148
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:04,440
and so to as practice develops we develop more and more wisdom where we understand better what's happening and

149
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:11,599
the understanding makes it easier not to get caught in it so I want to uh do a little showand

150
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:17,280
tell uh around um uh this and uh first

151
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,839
I'm going to hold up a flower and

152
00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:29,680
uh and this flower um just you know it's

153
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:35,280
a it's a little flower of sorts and um

154
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,720
and a little purple and green and uh if you hold up just a flower it's just a

155
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:46,200
flower and there's a famous story that's told kind of Mythic story that the

156
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:54,760
Buddha was in an assembly of people and he held up a single flower and didn't say anything but one disciple

157
00:35:54,760 --> 00:36:01,800
smiled and uh the Buddha uh recognize this and then uh recognize somehow The

158
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:08,200
Awakening of that disciple and um gave him permission to be a teacher

159
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:13,720
himself and um this is a story is particularly told in the Zen tradition

160
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:20,839
and so Buddha just hold up the flower and one of the things about the flower is the suchness of the flower just the

161
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:26,240
flower is itself and many times we think flowers are beautiful and appreciate

162
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:34,480
them and and um in Japan they have an sometimes a custom of having a single flower in a

163
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,560
special place in a toono a special uh um

164
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:47,400
Al Cove in the wall and the and by having just one not a big bouquet of flower but a single flower that then

165
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:54,880
highlights the specialness of the flower the thusness the sness the flower in itself when we put a big bouquet it's

166
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:01,760
beautiful maybe with colors and everything but the uniqueness and specialness of each flower is lost in

167
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:10,599
the whole the whole bouquet so just holding up a flower and so maybe we appreciate that

168
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:15,880
but then um we can do something different is I can hold

169
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:22,839
up um a different flower and uh and this one is new one is

170
00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:28,200
smaller I don't know if you can how well you can see it but um it's a smaller

171
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:33,400
flower and uh so now we can say something we couldn't say before we can

172
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:40,400
say that this flower is the large flower and this flower is the small flower this

173
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:46,280
flower is the you know and uh and you know that's pretty straightforward and

174
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:51,599
obvious and if someone um if I ask someone to go get the large flower of

175
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:57,359
two flowers if this is what they were looking for they would bring this one to me so it's very effective if I have

176
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:03,079
something in particular in mind to uh to call this the large and this and small

177
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:08,680
but now look what happens if I I'll do magic in front of your eyes and you'll

178
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:14,400
see how the hand trick works of the magic so remember this is the small flower and this is a large

179
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:23,000
flower and um so now um I bring this

180
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:28,920
flower and now the flower that was a small flower before the big flower

181
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:34,800
before the large is now the smaller flower with this white one is bigger and

182
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:41,760
um and so now what was small what was uh large is now small right in front of

183
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:48,440
your eyes and uh and so it turns out that

184
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:54,640
large and small is not inherent in the flower

185
00:38:54,640 --> 00:39:00,839
large and small involves the mental capacity to compare one thing and

186
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:08,400
another and so the flower in and of itself is neither large nor small it

187
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:16,480
just is what it is humans with their Capac our capacity to compare and our capacity to

188
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:22,359
have desires preferences the desire to make things happen in the world find it

189
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:29,720
useful to compare uh the large flower and the small flower depending on the

190
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:36,480
context but comparisons don't exist inherently in nature it turns out that a

191
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:43,040
fair amount of human suffering is one way or the other born from comparative

192
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:48,800
thinking that uh uh many people suffer because of their what how their body

193
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:56,599
looks and that means they're comparing their body to other people's bodies their hair their nose their fingers

194
00:39:56,599 --> 00:40:01,800
their belly whatever and um uh or they're comparing it to some ideal we

195
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:08,040
have about how it should be it turns out the body parts that we have can exist

196
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:14,520
happily in their suchness they many times they can just be our hair can just be our hair our

197
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:20,000
hair is content to be what it is uh whether we have a lot or little or

198
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:27,599
something and um but it's because of our comparisons our values our Fe years our

199
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:34,400
stories we have around that we begin to suffer the We

200
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:41,680
compare histories and biographies and compare people by what we've done and not done we compare ourselves with our

201
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:47,560
past to our present our present to what our imagined future is We

202
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:52,640
compare uh um values We compare uh you

203
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:58,480
know goes on and on um what we this comparison one to the other we have

204
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:05,200
thoughts and we think that's the most beatific wonderful thought anybody's ever had we have another thought and we

205
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:12,560
think that we're we have the most awful thought that anybody's ever have and because and that involves

206
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:18,920
comparison now some of these comparisons have some usefulness u in order to get things done

207
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:24,920
in the world and um but uh if um but

208
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:30,560
it's also the uh the ways in which tremendous amount of suffering happens

209
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:37,359
if we sit in meditation we will might compare our breathing uh yesterday I had a deep long

210
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:42,599
sweet breath and today the breath is shallow and tight and we're comparing it

211
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:48,880
and through that comparison we want yesterday's breath or we condemn today's breath the breathing is just like the

212
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:54,480
flower the isness of the of the breath is just what it is a shallow tight

213
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:00,960
breath is just a shallow shallow tight breath it it's uncomfortable but that's

214
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:07,040
just discomfort in and of itself with no comparison to how it could be or how it

215
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:13,640
used to be and so there's something very profound that can happen when we see oh

216
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:22,040
my reaction my way of getting tight here or resistant or of uh getting mentally

217
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:28,240
entangled is born from the mental capacity to be comparing

218
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:34,760
things that's an activity of my mind as we meditate and get quieter that

219
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:39,880
activity has a chance to quiet down and we can see that it's somewhat

220
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:45,800
optional we don't have to always have these thoughts sometimes they're useful

221
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:53,880
as I said but often times they're a source of unnecessary suffering and meditation is a time where

222
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:59,559
we can't we try to give ourselves the gift gift of letting ourselves just be

223
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:05,000
in our isness the suchness you know just we are the

224
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,119
flower we are the single flower that's allowed to exist without any

225
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:15,800
comparison to anything else where the beauty the uniqueness the specialness of

226
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:21,040
each of us as flowers is allowed to just be as it is

227
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:27,079
regardless of the characteristics of our body

228
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:33,200
regardless of our belief systems regardless of our past and the future

229
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:40,000
regardless of whether we're healthy or sick or have

230
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,400
some limitation or not limited in some ways that all those things are something

231
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:52,480
we can respect and care for at the right time but to live caught in those or

232
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:58,960
oppressed by all kinds of things um is as major source of human suffering and

233
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:05,880
to sit in meditation think of meditation as the place where we are

234
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:13,240
allowed to Just Breathe just exist as we are to be our the unique flower that we

235
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:19,559
are and for a few minutes put aside all the comparative

236
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:26,240
thinking so that just to be alive is wonderful just to be here and now free

237
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:32,880
of all these comparisons and of course that's easier said than done and part of mindfulness

238
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:39,280
practice is when the comparative thinking arises to recognize it as

239
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:44,680
such and uh step away from it so we're not entangled with it turn around and

240
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:53,839
look at it clearly oh that's comparative thinking and and then meet it carefully

241
00:44:53,839 --> 00:45:01,440
study ourselves on that oh that's how it is um and U maybe three breaths Journey

242
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:07,480
with that's the mind that compares then maybe feeling the physical

243
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:12,720
sensations of what comparative thinking is like feel the underlying emotion each

244
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:19,920
of them is given their time each we're met with we respect taking our time and

245
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:25,160
um and uh and perhaps you'll discover

246
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:32,400
the gift of letting yourself be a flower letting yourself just be yourself

247
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:37,920
breathing meditating just being

248
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:43,000
yourself practicing with that um so this

249
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:49,400
is how wisdom can operate part of wisdom and uh as your practice goes along uh

250
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:56,000
there might be a day where this kind of uh wisdom becomes obvious and available

251
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:05,040
and it'll support the further development of the meditation so thank you very much and I

252
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,000
look forward to meeting

253
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:16,480
tomorrow
