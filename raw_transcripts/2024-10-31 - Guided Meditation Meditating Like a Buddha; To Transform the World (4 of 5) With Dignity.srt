1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,799
so good morning or good day everyone Welcome to our

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:13,839
meditation and today I would like to uh call attention to the Statue of the

3
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:20,000
Buddha that's behind me here the

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:28,359
um um statues of the Buddha sitting in meditation this way are idealized

5
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:34,559
depictions of the Buddha and in very

6
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:42,000
idealized they are symbolic descriptions of something very

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,559
significant and it isn't that we're looking at this to see the Buddha as it

8
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:56,480
is we're looking at it to see something about ourselves and uh what this posture

9
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:04,158
represents is someone who has an inner peace an inner

10
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:11,840
tranquility and a confidence where the person is fully

11
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:19,360
present in a dignified way without asserting themselves onto

12
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:26,600
others without demeaning others or wanting something from

13
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,640
others but uh in some ways has a certain kind kind of

14
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:40,119
self-contained Tranquility or peace and confidence at the same time is available

15
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:45,920
for others usually these statues have the bit of sitting in meditation with his

16
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,759
eyes only half closed or half opened so that he's also available to the world to

17
00:01:52,759 --> 00:02:00,399
see it and look upon it and with a relaxed gaze and so the idea here is that

18
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:07,880
as we look on on a Buddha statue like this one we have is to be able to

19
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:17,879
somehow or other uh have it Inspire in us our own dignity our own

20
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:26,080
capacity for inner peace and confidence our own sense of

21
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,239
self-respect and so there are many ways in which we can feel that and many ways

22
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:38,440
in which we can express it physically but the idea is if you would

23
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:44,440
like to have that be expressed in the posture with which you

24
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:50,920
meditate sometimes there said there's F there's four dignified postures for Med

25
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:58,599
meditation there is standing there's walking meditation standing meditation

26
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:05,640
sitting meditation and lying down meditation and each of those to somehow

27
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:12,120
or other adjust the posture so the posture

28
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:19,640
itself is in touch with or an expression of a certain sense of dignity a certain

29
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:26,400
sense of self-confidence

30
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,760
self uh uh you know in

31
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:37,799
peace and we have the idea these days in our societies of that postures there

32
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:44,480
people who take power postures before they're going to give a public talk or something to develop some

33
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,360
confidence and I don't know about this power confidence exactly but a dign

34
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:56,680
dignifying postures dignifying postures to sit in

35
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,719
meditation with a dignity like a Buddha

36
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,799
so to assume your meditation

37
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:14,519
posture and for today to give a little

38
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:19,919
emphasis on finding a posture that is an

39
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:26,160
expression of dignity of your value of your

40
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:33,240
confidence confidence that just being alive here that you are

41
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:41,599
important you are invaluable you have dignity

42
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:48,280
respect and um and you might want to sit if you're sitting you might want to sit

43
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:54,639
a little bit straighter you might want to sit or even

44
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:02,039
lie down in such a way that allows your chest to be more

45
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:08,560
open and open or more full a full chest

46
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,560
as a confident

47
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,440
chest to have your pans in a

48
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:31,638
position where they dignify us they hold us upright

49
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:40,520
here and in assuming a dignified dignifying

50
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:49,600
posture the idea is that this helps settle something

51
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:56,479
inside idea is that it evokes a sense

52
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:06,639
of inner tranquility that all things locally here and

53
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:13,599
now are good locally here in this body and this

54
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:20,159
mind this heart this person that's

55
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,599
you has self digity

56
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,440
self-respect gazing upon oneself

57
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,759
favorably and if you haven't closed your eyes maybe gently closing your eyes or

58
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:51,680
keeping them half open and see if you can have your

59
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,960
breathing breathe a sense of dignity

60
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,720
or deep appreciation and confidence into your whole

61
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,759
being breathing in a little deeper and

62
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,840
Fuller maybe feeling the strength of breathing

63
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:18,520
in moving the rib cage the chest the

64
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:27,599
belly so it provides a feeling of strength and

65
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:37,319
confidence and value and on the exhale relaxing letting

66
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:48,800
go but not letting go of dignity and confidence letting go into it

67
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,120
deep inhales as a way of creating more room for breath for

68
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:22,800
breathing and for the enlivening effect of breathing in and

69
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,198
breathing out

70
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,200
and letting your breathing return to

71
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:56,800
normal and feeling it to whatever degree that your body your

72
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:05,800
posture is the container for your inner life container for your

73
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:13,519
meditation that provides an atmosphere a

74

holding of quiet peaceful

75
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:31,360

118
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:59,840
and then as we come to the end of the sitting to consider

119
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:09,360
how whatever way that you want to support others other ways your gift to

120
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:15,320
your family your friends your community the world through your

121
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:22,000
generosity your care your kindness

122
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,279
friendliness your integrity

123
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:35,279
that whatever way that you have to offer with your skills and your

124
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:41,399
abilities it carries much more value much

125
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:48,279
more strength if you do it carrying your

126
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:54,080
inner dignity with you and if you dignify others in the

127
00:27:54,080 --> 00:28:01,640
process if you're really here in a full

128
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:08,000
dignified way whatever you're offering carries

129
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:15,080
more value whatever way you see

130
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:21,880
others as valuable as as having dignity what you offer

131
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:28,399
carries more value and may it be that this practice

132
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:35,399
that we do brings a greater sense of our own

133
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:43,399
personal dignity and allows us to see others in a

134
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:50,039
dignified way dignifying others and with

135
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:55,240
that living our lives for the welfare and happiness of this

136
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:01,960
world may all beings be happy may all

137
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:07,840
beings be safe may all beings be

138
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:14,000
peaceful may all beings be free

[Music]

140
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,480
thank

141
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,039
you e

142
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:42,360
and for those of you who noticed that there were no sound there was a period of time where I turned off the mic and

143
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,840
then forgot to turn it on so it was not your

144
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:02,880
computer so welcome come to this fourth talk on titled to transform the

145
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:11,919
world and um it's partly or a big part chosen as a theme

146
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:20,120
in the given the it's the week before the election that we have here in the United States election that has created

147
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:27,919
a lot of anxiety and a lot of divisiveness and and election which suggests that the

148
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:34,639
there might be a lot of conflict in the wake of it and

149
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:41,919
um and certainly we can get involved in election politics getting out the vote

150
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:47,559
all kinds of things we can do that together with others can make a big

151
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:55,720
difference but here I'm offering something different for now and that is uh an

152
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:01,279
approach to how to transform the world that

153
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:07,880
um is suitable and may be powerful no matter what the outcome of the election

154
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:13,320
no matter what happens that whatever way that we want to

155
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:19,200
respond way we want to deal with it that let it come from these values that come

156
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,720
out of this practice and so for today the emphasis

157
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:32,639
is on Dignity and respect that uh Buddhism puts a tremendous value

158
00:32:32,639 --> 00:32:37,919
on our dignity our value our

159
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:45,360
self-respect and as I said in the meditation that the Buddha statues like the one we have here are symbolic

160
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:52,720
representation of what it's like for a human being to be uh fully in the place

161
00:32:52,720 --> 00:33:00,639
inhabiting in the place where they are so the Buddha's sitting on the Ground full fully grounded fully present in

162
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:08,399
this spot no question about it he's here rooted here on that spot and then the

163
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:14,480
upright torso is uh with a chest that's kind of

164
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:20,159
little bit open is an expression of a

165
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:26,799
dignified presence the eyes are half closed the head is not leaning forward the Torso is

166
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:32,840
not leaning forward pulling back it's fully here present in this world

167
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:40,919
without being aggressive or being passive and uh without staring or

168
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:49,440
turning away here with dignity and presence and then uh the body that's

169
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,960
relaxed and alert a wonderful these kinds of some of these posture statues

170
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:02,639
if you looked at them from the side or from the back uh sometimes my favorite part of the statues is um the the

171
00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:11,440
alertness of the spine that the uh sculpture has made it it's alive in a wonderfully

172
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:19,320
significant and Powerful way like this so it isn't just that we're alive and present with the front of us with the

173
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:24,679
with our things thoughts and ideas and eyes and what we can see and how we see

174
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:31,760
others seeing us but from the back we have our own back in a sense with um

175
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:38,158
standing up um you know this alert posture it's not collapsed it's not

176
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:45,000
depending on anything it's self-reliant and this is all symbolic and the idea is for each person to find

177
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:52,000
their own way to manifest a kind of dignity in their very being sit and

178
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,879
meditate show up with it um

179
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:07,599
so they uh uh there's a you know very important document that came out of the

180
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:14,200
United Nations some 60 years ago called the uh Universal Universal Decor

181
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:19,800
Declaration of Human Rights and it begins all human beings

182
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:26,280
are born free and equal in dignity and in

183
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:31,960
rights all all human beings are born free and equal in

184
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:41,640
dignity and so to be able to uh live in a dignified way and to see the Dignity

185
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:47,960
of others and uh uh people who offer

186
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:55,640
spiritual care especially like chaplains and hospitals and other places uh I see them as I see them

187
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:03,560
having a work the work the task the mission the vision to be

188
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:10,720
dignifi they see and treat people as if anybody they encounter has dignity has

189
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:17,160
value has uh um

190
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:24,760
uh is an equal is a someone to make room for they're allowed to be here and we

191
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:30,040
can respect them we can dignify them we can hold them up and the reason why it's

192
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:36,640
so important for these chaplain to do that is that and for us to do it is a

193
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:43,839
lot of people in our world are now treated as if they have dignity as if

194
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:49,359
they're valuable they're not met with respect they're not seen as full human

195
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:55,520
beings on this planet and um and if we offered but and

196
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:02,160
so if we everything we do for others whether speak to them kindly or we speak to them with difficulty because of

197
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:09,680
differences we have can we first and foremost uh view them as dignified human

198
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:15,640
beings as respect worthy human beings and one of the reasons for that is then

199
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:22,760
they'll listen to us then whatever way we show up for them has more value more meaning if we offer kindness the

200
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:29,119
kindness is more powerful if we offer truth to telling the truth telling

201
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:35,359
stands more stronger with that unassertive unaggressive dignified way

202
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:41,680
of carrying it and being with it and if we dignify others they might be more

203
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:48,400
available to hear what we have to say to experience our generosity they might it

204
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:56,440
might settle something when people are diminished and belittled and disparaged

205
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:01,480
it makes people feel terrible and then that feeling terrible

206
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:07,760
uh is a t creates a tendency to for um uh living in harmful ways harming

207
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:14,720
oneself and harming others it doesn't create people who are going to support others into this world but if we can

208
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:24,480
meet others with dignity dignify them then um maybe then there's a chance for

209
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:30,839
uh cooperation for coordination for mutual respect and

210
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:36,440
uh and uh maybe that's more important than getting her

211
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,880
away and

212
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:50,520
um sometimes the word dignity is associated with a inner Tranquility

213
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:56,240
inner peace that comes together with an inner

214
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:03,079
confidence confident dignity confident peace as if

215
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:10,760
we are we are allowed to embody the place we're in as if we can really show up and

216
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:18,359
be here and we count we're important in and of ourselves but not so important to

217
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:24,200
diminish the value of anybody else but important so we can value other

218
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:29,359
people in it as equals in their

219
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:36,240
dignity maybe separating out what they say and what they do from maybe an

220
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:41,760
inherent dignity that comes with being a human being inherent

221
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:47,400
value respect worthy for something profound in who people

222
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:54,359
are and well how do we do this how do we dignify people well here's a quote from

223
00:39:54,359 --> 00:40:01,200
Elanor Roosevelt again talking about uh Universal human

224
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:06,359
rights where after all do Universal human rights

225
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:14,160
begin in small places close to home so close and so small that they

226
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:19,720
cannot be seen on any maps of the world such are the places where

227
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:28,440
every person and child seeks Equal justice equal opportunity equal

228
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:39,920
dignity without discrimination unless these rights have meaning there they have little meaning

229
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:46,079
anywhere unless our own

230
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:53,720
dignity and are dignifying others the dignifying of others has no role in the

231
00:40:53,720 --> 00:41:01,400
small interactions as we go through the day then perhaps it's hopeless to expect it

232
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:08,640
to happen anywhere else in the wider world so may it be that this practice

233
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:15,400
that we do helps us to sit like the Buddha walk

234
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:21,079
like the Buddha talk like the Buddha with a

235
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:29,040
confidence a presence a peace and a clarity

236
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:35,720
about our own dignity and value and the dignity and value of

237
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:44,119
others may we share a dignified and

238
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:49,560
dignifying world with others may all

239
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:55,359
beings know that they are valued in their fundamental way that

240
00:41:55,359 --> 00:42:03,040
they were born born equal and free may all

241
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:09,359
beings be free thank you
