6
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:41,120
were here with me last time you might remember that I'd like to start off not

7
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,879
with the dhama talk but with questions about your formal meditation

8
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,559
practice you know not all of us meet with teachers or get to go on Retreat

9
00:00:53,559 --> 00:01:03,199
and ask questions about practice so how's it going on the cushion these

10
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:09,320
days what did you notice maybe this morning or at

11
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:15,000
home are there any places that are sticky or confusing or you don't know

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,159
how to work with something if you've been practicing for a while and something new is

13
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:29,280
happening Happy to answer any questions like that from a few brave souls

14
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:41,680
okay hi hi uh my name is Angela I did

15
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,680
not I don't I'm not even sure what Dharma means I trained with uh transcendental

16
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,399
meditation for a few years now back in Boston and my question is how important

17
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:03,840
or is there an importance in Transcendental Meditation we sit in a chair um and I have tried to sit on a

18
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:11,560
pad but I just my body and I'm not sure if that's part of the practice so my question is what are your feelings about

19
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,640
that or what comes to you when I ask those questions yeah it thank you you

20
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,879
know it's a really good question and this is for just a reminder for folks um

21
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:30,360
one the Buddha offered four postures sitting standing walking and lying down so all of those are completely

22
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:37,040
legit postures and uh sitting on a cushion on the

23
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:45,159
floor is not um better than sitting on a chair so

24
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:53,120
and it's so good to to remind ourselves of this because sometimes our bodies cannot sit on a cushion and it's painful

25
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,640
for folks who at some points in their lives have to transition to a chair cuz

26
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:05,280
then sometimes we have to learn how to meditate in that posture right so thank

27
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,840
you for the question I'm glad you're taking care of your body

28
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:15,519
yeah

29
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:24,239
yeah good morning my name is Melody um I have fairly long practice maybe 15 years

30
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,280
or so but just recently my mind has been very very

31
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:36,319
busy like just chattering chattering chattering something it's about something

32
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:42,920
good but um because I think it's about a creative process that's going on and so

33
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:50,519
it keeps going back to that back to that and so the way I'm I'm working with it is I sort of

34
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:58,159
gently step alongside it for like a second or two or three and then I gently

35
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,480
come back to here and now and that's I'm doing it all the

36
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:10,560
time and um more than usual so in some ways it's really H H uh helping my

37
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,959
awareness practice but I just wanted to know if you have any thoughts about that yeah is there any frustration or wanting

38
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:23,000
it not to be happening yeah there was there was some of that

39
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,840
but but uh but I I I resolved that

40
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:34,000
yesterday by doing some dhama reading and so forth and so I'm it's more I'm

41
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,639
befriending it at this point great so it sounds like it's it's not a problem it's just what's happening right and we can

42
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:47,120
notice oh when causes and conditions change in our lives content changes doesn't

43
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,440
it and so also maybe

44
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:59,000
noticing like the content happens in the mind the creativity um so a couple ways of

45
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,680
working with it is what you're doing kind of like walking beside it and then at some point maybe putting it down

46
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,680
maybe actively um but also we can check out like oh what does it feel like to be

47
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:17,440
maybe excited in the body or enlightened and then rest with that instead of just

48
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,400
coming back to maybe your anchor like rest with the uplift of it yes that's

49
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,520
what I'm doing the energy the effort that you know something wants to be born

50
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:34,800
of this and so be open for that right be open for that and then and then you know

51
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:41,280
also watch like oh it's a little bit of a hook like I'm gonna you know figure out the

52
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:48,080
next step on my creative process you know it's like of course and that's exciting and and we can it is valuable

53
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:55,400
to set along around set aside time for dedicated practice so sometimes when I

54
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,919
have a lot going on I just remind myself okay right now we're just meditating we

55
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:06,639
can think about that in 20 minutes all right yeah thank you for your question

56
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:13,840
and maybe we have time for one more about your practice anything up

57
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:31,560
questions Okay so

58
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:39,840
I just want to say out loud what a gift you have in this

59
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,840
community just that there's I don't know something like 50 folks here or more

60
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,080
today a lot of other communities haven't bounced back like this since the

61
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:58,160
pandemic there's like 15 20 so it's really wonderful to be in a

62
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,360
full room really

63
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:12,360
wonderful yeah oh yeah one online question yeah yeah

64
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:27,879
sure the question is from Eve um they ask how important are retreats

65
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:34,240
to the practice I'm not at a place in my life where Retreats are an option and my

66
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:40,400
practice is mostly daily meditation yeah thanks Eve it's a good

67
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:47,240
question so Retreats have their time in place you know and

68
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:54,400
and um I'm a retreat teacher

69
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:03,639
so I see value in retreats and there's lots of value in daily

70
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:12,240
meditation practice right daily dhama practice daily like I I do emphasize and

71
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:19,039
and really focus a lot on us expanding our definition of

72
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:26,080
practice because so often in this lineage there is this

73
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:33,039
preferencing much like the cushion right the preferencing our idea that it's all

74
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:41,080
about Retreat practice and and meditation practice but but the

75
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:46,440
Buddha the Buddha laid out many many things for us

76
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:54,440
to cultivate and and so keep doing what you're doing

77
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:01,360
yeah yeah keep doing what you're doing and you know if the time comes in this lifetime to go on Retreat then great and

78
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:10,079
if the time doesn't come to go on retreat in this lifetime not a problem yeah people have very very very

79
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:17,519
deep daily life dhama practices

80
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,880
yeah so thanks for that question

81
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,920
and it's a good inquiry for today for all of

82
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:34,200
us how maybe in these times to integrate these

83
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:42,839
practices and to remember um the value of in our

84
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:48,240
daytoday bringing in these teachings of the

85
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:54,320
Buddha and so maybe I'll start with Howard Thurman

86
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:00,640
who in here knows who Howard Thurman is raise your hand just a few

87
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,920
folks um it's Howard

88
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:12,959
Thurman yeah he uh was like a Christian

89
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:18,459
Mystic um [Music]

90
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:27,079
he was a teacher of Martin Luther King when Martin Luther King went to grad

91
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:33,800
school he was was one of the first people who

92
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:41,680
influenced Martin Luther King around practices of nonviolence and he went I can't remember

93
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:48,399
what decade um but he spent maybe five or six months in India both lecturing

94
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,199
and um learning and meeting with people like

95
00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:00,959
Gandhi and I think it's so helpful I marked a couple pages

96
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,760
um sometimes when things are changing very rapidly like they have over the

97
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:16,839
last week or so um we have a very short

98
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:22,120
memory but U maybe Howard Thurman wrote this 50s or

99
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:28,160
60s he says remain at peace accustom yourself to remain at

100
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:34,680
peace in the depth of of your heart in spite of your restless

101
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:42,680
imagination and so I've talked to a lot of students this week and some of the imagination is going to like some of

102
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:49,760
it's not imagination it's actually happening and there's an overlay of extra worry

103
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,720
yeah and so Howard says peace anywhere seems to be wishful thinking during days

104
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,959
of turmoils within and violences without Peace of Mind peace of heart peace of

105
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:06,720
Home peace of country peace of world peace of Cosmos it does not matter which

106
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,920
the same sense of pinpoint unreality

107
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:19,079
pervades there seems to be a vast stiring of energy malignant and unstructured that catapults to the

108
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:23,759
surface all kinds of disharmonies conflicts and

109
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:30,279
disorders and he goes in to name all these places including the United States

110
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:36,040
always there is present a turbulent quality the out of hand aspect of the

111
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:41,480
common life accustom yourself to remain at peace in the depth of your heart in

112
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,519
spite of your restless imagination so it's a

113
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:52,639
reminder right that this is this is this human

114
00:12:52,639 --> 00:13:00,160
life these vistit toes and I think it's so helpful like

115
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,480
to remember how can we find our Center in the midst of it

116
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:13,600
all again and again and again and again right and this is what our practice trains us to do doesn't it like notice

117
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:20,680
the mind getting caught up and come back notice what's happening in real

118
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:26,800
time in our hearts and Minds right

119
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:33,199
noticing if were caught in grief and

120
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:40,959
despair and then knowing how to meet with that with a lot of kindness right so for some

121
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:46,320
folks that's the practice right now it's some grieving

122
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:54,360
practice for some folks it's practice of being with anger or

123
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:03,320
rage and someone yesterday asked me you I kind of give this big

124
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:09,480
question around you know I'm feeling so much anger so much rage

125
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:15,519
and um I know that I'm supposed to have compassion but how can I have compassion

126
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,839
you know just really upset um and then I gave like a classic

127
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:26,040
teacher answer um but we misunderstood each

128
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:33,320
other and then and then they were upset with me which is

129
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:40,120
okay I'm like oh we missed something you know and then kind of moved on but

130
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:47,079
really the Miss was that I was saying to start where you

131
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:55,000
are start with incapacity and and grow that capacity to

132
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:03,480
meet the harder things and and this person thought I was saying saying I no be compassion for

133
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:09,240
with all the folks who are causing harm like maybe you're not there yet right

134
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,519
can we know we're not there yet and then be compassionate for what that feels

135
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:21,600
like for ourselves for our anger cuz that's suffering isn't it like for most

136
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:30,720
of us I mean you know there is

137
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,079
um rage that sometimes feels good and also it's painful isn't it it's

138
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:44,959
or what's underneath it is painful it's a response to something

139
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:52,959
right so I'm just going to give lots of tips today about how to be with things

140
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:59,800
right now and one of them some are from the DAP it's not Gil's version

141
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:07,040
I was going to bring his but I couldn't find it so this is there are other translations out

142
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:14,959
there so this is one translation so this is in the the uh

143
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:20,800
chapter 8 the thousands a single word of Truth which

144
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:27,600
calms the mind is better to hear than a thousand irrelevant

145
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:34,000
words so maybe there's one word that can bring you back that can remind

146
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,959
you uh about what how Thurman was talking about peace like remaining at

147
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:44,560
peace what's that word for you maybe it is the word

148
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:56,360
peace a single verse of Truth which calms the mind is better to hear than a thousand IR irrelevant

149
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,720
verses so I think this is pointing to you know maybe there's a chapter in a

150
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:08,640
book dama book like that's helpful for for you to remember a reference to come

151
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:15,558
back to again and again and again I bet some of you here have quotes

152
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:22,480
on your walls or reminders on mirrors you know maybe we need to expand

153
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:29,360
those you know put them in our wallets just post them everywhere

154
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:37,440
yeah it was so nice walking up I walked I parked down here and um you know on the on the side it says Insight oh yeah

155
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,600
insight and then that reminds me like oh these teachings like what builds to

156
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,360
Insight you know if we think about the 8old

157
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:57,039
path there's this bucket of um CA like our ethics like and

158
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:03,200
then there's this bucket of concentration and this bucket of wisdom arises just

159
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:11,080
like [Laughter] that I'm going to read a couple

160
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,679
more reciting a single verse of Truth which calms the mind is better than

161
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:26,080
reciting a hundred meaningless meaningless verses so maybe that means yeah we say

162
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:33,039
them out loud or chanting maybe some of you have a chanting practice that's supportive to

163
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,679
you they're just all

164
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:53,280
reminders and this is these are more more towards how to live our lives a

165
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:59,240
single day lived with conscious intention and virtue is of Greater value

166
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:04,159
than a hundred years live devoid of discipline and right

167
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:11,320
restraint a single day live with conscious intention and virtue is of greater value than a hundred years live

168
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,799
devoid of discipline and right

169
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:23,400
restraint and then it repeats [Music]

170
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:29,039
um and it says devoid of discipline and wisdom

171
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,930
so isn't a single day like how we

172
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:43,280
[Music] spend how we

173
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:52,200
spend our [Music] mornings can start to really pay

174
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:01,320
attention how we spend our afternoons our evenings and are we bringing ourselves

175
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:07,080
back we get lost get

176
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:14,159
confused like what we're here for what the possibilities are

177
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,279
more

178
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:48,320
reminders you know I love that the Buddha gives us so many ways to integrate these practices into our daily

179
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,919
lives and maybe we can just for a

180
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,880
moment make an intention so I'm going to give many different

181
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:08,679
ideas and maybe one Sparks you so I'm just going to say some

182
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:18,000
words because I I I think that what can happen when things are are chaotic in

183
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,480
our world is that we can get

184
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:31,360
overwhelmed and have a lot of doubt and then not know what to

185
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:38,240
do like or or not think that we have any power to do anything and is that

186
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,000
true it is not

187
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,720
true and we all have um

188
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,440
influence you know in our own

189
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,480
ways and so maybe because we have these

190
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:07,760
practices um we're the ones in our families or in our friends circle that

191
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:13,039
can remind people of other possibilities when they're lost and

192
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:18,760
caught in despair

193
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:26,039
worry right or we can be the

194
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:30,519
steady or steadying presence

195
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:36,640
right just by listening to them like I hear your worried sometimes sometimes

196
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,919
people just need to say I'm so worried they just need someone to

197
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:47,840
listen or maybe you're the one who says let's go on a walk

198
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,200
together or I know this really cool Meditation

199
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,039
Center all right so here are the here some

200
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:10,400
words generosity are there ways that in your daily life you can

201
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:16,600
practice generosity and here's the

202
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:22,000
thing when I say are there ways you can practice this what people's minds go to

203
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:29,159
is external did anyone go to internal okay all all right we have one

204
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:36,039
Advanced practitioner right so everything is both

205
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:42,440
externally and internally and both and we can't REM we can't forget to remember

206
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,320
ourselves right so what does that

207
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:57,320
mean wise speech

208
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:04,720
the Sila piece how can we practice doing no

209
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:12,600
harm in thought word or deed how can we practice doing no harm

210
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:18,400
in thought word or deed internally externally and both you

211
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:24,960
know and so internally that might be oh being a little softer like noticing the

212
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:30,039
harsh critic you know it's Tough Enough out there

213
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:35,919
y'all no one else is going to no one else can talk nicely to you like

214
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:41,639
internally like you're doing that so

215
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:50,360
yeah renunciation there's something to be let go of right

216
00:24:54,559 --> 00:25:02,799
now for some folks it's news light right now

217
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:16,000
right wisdom is there a way to

218
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:19,279
cultivate

219
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:30,440
wisdom and one of the ways I think about wisdom or insight it if we call it

220
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:35,120
Insight is are there ways right now to

221
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:42,360
cultivate our intuitive knowing and really deeply listening to

222
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:51,200
ourselves which is not so easy sometimes because sometimes we don't like what we hear like

223
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:57,039
oh I said so the other day I um was talking to one of my best friends I

224
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:02,559
think just yesterday just getting caught up we hadn't talked in a

225
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:08,520
while and then I started complaining about one of my

226
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:13,640
siblings who I complain about a lot they probably complained about me a

227
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:18,919
lot too and I could tell my best friend was

228
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:25,200
so irritated with me because I complained about the sibling a lot I was like

229
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:32,159
oh there's something in me that knew like oh I need to stop complaining about this

230
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:39,840
sibling and so we can notice like oh what are we complaining about that hasn't actually helping

231
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,640
anything but I wouldn't have you know like I mean this is why

232
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:51,600
friends help because they can reflect us back to ourselves but like oh this is

233
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:58,919
some intuitive wisdom like oh the felt sense of what it feels like to

234
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:02,000
complain without

235
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:11,159
action energy could can notice like how are we spending our time and

236
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:17,399
energy are we spending it complaining are we spending

237
00:27:17,399 --> 00:27:24,679
it like avoiding that which maybe should be met with some

238
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:29,960
care which is the definition of suffering

239
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:37,440
right other options are patience and we practice patience like

240
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:45,158
you don't have to choose all of them I'm just naming a whole bunch and if one really resonates with you maybe that's your thing for right

241
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:53,440
now and we have to have so much patience in this life and in these practices don't

242
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,120
we because uh

243
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,640
it took a while to get ourselves into this

244
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,480
predicament and we're not going to get ourselves out of it overnight

245
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:19,600
either so both we have to have patience like the upside is then we're practicing

246
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,000
patience so we're cultivating

247
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:32,480
patience truthfulness oh this is is a hard one truthfulness maybe it's not so hard for

248
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,559
you but maybe it's a little harder if it means um

249
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:46,120
putting yourself in a risky situation I'm I'm a classic people

250
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:51,919
pleaser there's folks that can relate I want people to like

251
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:59,440
me um I'm getting better it's like it's okay if you don't like me

252
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:05,519
um but but this truthfulness sometimes means that people won't like

253
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:10,600
you if you're being honest and if you're saying it out loud

254
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:17,840
or sharing it if you're standing in your truth if you're standing in your power and that's

255
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,200
okay it's not so easy all the

256
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:29,360
time but it also means truthfulness with ourselves

257
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:37,360
like really being honest with ourselves also not so easy not so

258
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:44,200
easy determination to me this is like this willingness to show

259
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:51,159
up show up for our hearts show up for our mind show up for our community show up for each

260
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:59,440
other and then these ones that we know the Brahma bahara

261
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,559
loving kindness more

262
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:10,080
friendliness Compassion or our kindness meets

263
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:15,200
suffering mudita let's not leave this one out

264
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:22,039
happiness for other people's happiness in all the places where Joy

265
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:28,200
can be had and it's not all suffering is it

266
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:35,840
you know newer folks to practice I know not anybody in here sometimes think the teaching is life is

267
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:43,080
suffering is that the teaching no there is suffering but life

268
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:48,799
is not just suffering although sometimes it can feel like it

269
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:57,480
is so remembering those places that uplift that bring joy you know yesterday

270
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:04,440
I called friend who has it was um they have a four-year-old they just turned four like sometimes I just need to see

271
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:11,399
this this four-year-old being's light so I facetimed and you know they I

272
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:17,960
don't know they they just take me out of any worry I'm like all right this

273
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,799
four-year-old's got it we're in good

274
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:30,679
hands and then Equanimity find finding some balance in the middle of

275
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:36,720
things not so easy not so

276
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:44,600
easy so how do we remember how do we

277
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:50,120
remember when our hearts are heavy there's a lot of worry in the

278
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:56,840
mind when we don't know which way to turn or what to do or what's up or what's

279
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:03,799
down like can you just remember one thing not one thing I tell you to

280
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:08,360
remember but one thing that's sparked in your own

281
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:18,760
heart whether it's to be more loving be more honest be more

282
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:26,480
truthful remember peace the possibility of Awakening even

283
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,840
right wisdom

284
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:51,720
Insight anybody care to say a word I'll repeat it you can just say it

285
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:57,039
out loud anything came to you like oh that's mine I'm going to work on that one

286
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,840
Victoria

287
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:17,120
um I liked the quote from the DAP about a single day I don't remember the characteristics

288
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:23,039
but of mindfulness and discipline it's better than 100 years

289
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:29,760
without because I waste most of my time h

290
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:37,480
yeah I know I I know better well and and I hear you and it is good it's such a

291
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:42,559
good reminder it's a single day you know what if it's this day always you know

292
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:48,720
this day that's a practice day and then a you know just a wholesome day spending

293
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:54,960
time and watch the mind being judgmental include that too like oh I can say it

294
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,760
cheerfully okay yeah don't worry about that okay great great I'm just saying the quote

295
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:05,960
got me yeah okay thank you thank you yeah yeah yeah it's a good it's a good

296
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:12,599
quote a single day live with conscious intention and virtue is of greater value than a hundred years live devoid of

297
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:21,520
discipline and right restraint and what chapter in The dood is that it's eight yeah the thousands

298
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:29,118
yeah yeah um generosity really um

299
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:34,760
yeah I really appreciate that uh kind of holding that in awareness and there's something around generosity of spirit

300
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:43,000
too that comes up for me and um kind of entering into the meditation and you

301
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:49,520
know being here today I was having a lot of kind of physical and mental tightness and I noticed just kind of a

302
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:55,118
settling and an opening up and um with that opening up this yeah this feeling

303
00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:02,560
of generosity towards everyone in this community and outside of this community and it feel so supportive of some of

304
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:09,480
those other things like mudita and so just really appreciate um yeah kind of dropping that

305
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:16,280
into awareness today thank you yeah thank you so generosity of spirit yeah

306
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:22,520
yeah and the generosity that like created this place right it is all built

307
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:28,320
on generosity yeah yeah if you weren't here I wouldn't be here

308
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:34,160
here if we weren't here like the teachings wouldn't right that's all it

309
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:39,359
goes yeah the generosity of the Buddha to share these teachings with us the

310
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:45,079
compassion of the Buddha to share these teachings with us

311
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,720
yeah any other Sparks or words that were

312
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:58,160
supportive it's going to be your word today this week this month

313
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:05,160
patience patience yeah

314
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,880
patience um I was kind of sparked by no

315
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:25,560
complaining don't complain and I wonder what is the like

316
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:32,079
that's the negative of it like I can see where

317
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:38,280
complaining kind of releases some of that Rage or you know helplessness or

318
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:46,400
frustration um in little things and in big things you know but what's

319
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:53,560
the positive the flip side of it yeah to me it's a motivator to take

320
00:36:53,560 --> 00:37:00,119
action so you know I can complain about myself sibling or I can just have a

321
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:06,720
difficult conversation with my sibling right um or or I can choose something

322
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:15,640
else like the birthday's coming up you know so I can express

323
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:23,280
love right yeah but I think that's really helpful yeah yeah yeah so we just have

324
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:30,560
about five minutes and I'm done talking but maybe there's some

325
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:37,960
questions um about practice in general about expanding

326
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:44,000
practice I'm about a step behind you because I'm still on the what sparks oh

327
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,760
yeah what sparks yeah please um for me is uh truthfulness I'm going to be

328
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:55,520
visiting a friend in Florida not my favorite place but she's a dear friend

329
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:02,359
and the other day she said you know I I said something about hurricanes and climate change and she said oh you know

330
00:38:02,359 --> 00:38:07,680
the the jury still out on that and I thought okay I'm going to be go spending

331
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:15,240
time with my dear friend and so it's that for me it's finding being true to myself but not picking a fight that is

332
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:21,079
not going to be helpful for anyone yeah yeah yeah and

333
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:27,680
and um to not seow more division it's like oh where can we meet where can we

334
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:34,960
we meet you know like we can know for ourselves

335
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:40,440
um when we're stuck in a position you know there's no amount of anybody

336
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:46,280
telling us anything that's perhaps going to convince us otherwise you know so it

337
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:51,480
is good to find those common places to meet

338
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:58,880
or yeah yeah just a couple couple more

339
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,559
minutes yeah here and then

340
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:12,880
here so um actually I really appreciated your

341
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:18,400
quoting um uh Thurman I I I recently um

342
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:25,760
read one of his books and uh recommended by a guy that I'm working with whose father actually just wrote a a biography

343
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:32,520
of his um but yeah he's so so that that resonated and I appreciate the fact that

344
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:38,560
that he came out of a different tradition you know he was he was a Christian and but yet there's a some

345
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:46,079
level there's a lot of overlap with our practices um I guess the only thing that

346
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:55,200
that Al also say that that came up for me and you didn't it wasn't prompted by any one specific quote or thing you said

347
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:01,599
but um I find myself more and more

348
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:10,920
um you know kind of overwhelmed by the the neurotic egotism of the times we

349
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:16,560
live in in this kind of preoccupation with ourselves and everything and and contrasted

350
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:22,640
with um the truth of nonself and that we're all

351
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:30,160
connected yeah and so I often find myself when I when I when I'm I'm outraged and seeing what's going on I I

352
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:38,280
I think of that and and realize that I think a lot of the stuff that that we feel is coming from that connection with

353
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:43,800
everybody else that's that's experiencing other

354
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:48,920
stuff yeah yeah and how do we balance that right yeah and then there was one

355
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:57,000
person right behind you this is a question on the practice

356
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,200
how does the practice look like and feel like when you're not formally sitting

357
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:08,880
yeah it's all of these things everything that I've said so it's it's oh can I be

358
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:15,319
patient while waiting in line or for waiting for my family to come out to the car right can

359
00:41:15,319 --> 00:41:22,640
I find ways to be generous with my spirit maybe smile at another right can

360
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:29,200
I find ways to when the critic comes to meet that critic with some

361
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:37,079
kindness right uh can I notice when Joy is happening and be with it

362
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:45,119
fully so these are the ways we integrate these practices into our daily lives can I notice if I'm about to say something

363
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:52,560
or do something that might callls harm to another or to myself and not do it or

364
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:57,839
can I at least reflect on it afterwards and vow to not do it again

365
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:04,960
right these are the ways that we must integrate these practices into our daily lives and

366
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:12,160
and then in our more formal practice maybe we notice some settling because

367
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:17,880
we've practiced these wholesome uplifting qualities of heart and mind

368
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:23,440
right does that answer your question it does uh in in the in the

369
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:30,599
sense of practicing the virtues but I'm also wondering about the uh

370
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:37,319
observing the nature of mind while you're doing things all the

371
00:42:37,319 --> 00:42:42,040
things that you mentioned yeah yeah yeah

372
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:53,680
um so I think it's helpful to build in some pauses right um so just I if if the mind

373
00:42:53,680 --> 00:43:01,839
is not like knowing what's happening when it's happening throughout the day to build in some pauses um or cues to

374
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:07,359
help bring you back like it could be every time you walk through a doorway

375
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:16,960
like you just take a beat and take a pause um or every time a plane flies

376
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:23,040
overhead you pause and you send meta right but it's it's get the Paw in

377
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:30,000
there you know and or right when you wake up in the

378
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,200
morning you know you lay with yourself and with your breath and you know when

379
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:42,359
you're about to be upright right you're sitting up you know when the legs are moving out of the bed and feet are going

380
00:43:42,359 --> 00:43:49,400
on the ground you know when you're standing up and make these habits and this way you're bringing in

381
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:55,000
moments of mindfulness throughout the day is that helpful okay okay so we have

382
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:02,800
to stop how really appreciating being with you today and so

383
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,559
we want to dedicate the Merit of our

384
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:15,599
practice our practice of

385
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:21,400
meditation of mindfulness our practice

386
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:28,240
of letting the teachings land in our hearts and Minds practice of showing up

387
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:35,680
for each other and for ourselves in this community may the benefits of our time
