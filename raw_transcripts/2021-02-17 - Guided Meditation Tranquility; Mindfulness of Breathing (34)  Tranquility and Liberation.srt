1
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:09,360
so good morning and i think i have the technology set up a

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,799
little more complicated today

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,920
so

4
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:34,239
we're going to be working with the breathing that's what the anapanasati is where

5
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:41,520
the simple rhythm of breathing in and breathing out is used as the

6
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,920
through line as the thread that goes through uh all our experience it's kind of like

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,399
the the um the beat of the song that's always there or it's the

8
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:02,800
kind of like the ballast of a boat that keeps the boat steady it's a the breathing is a

9
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,640
the rhythm of breathing and the coming and going of breathing so can support the mind to both have

10
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,080
develop a stability and also not to hold on to anything

11
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:21,920
and in fact this part of the stability of the mind it comes maybe seems like a

12
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,759
paradox comes from not holding on to anything it's when holding on

13
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:35,119
to things being preoccupied being churning away ruminating on things that

14
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,640
the mind becomes more unstable because it has an unstable basis on the

15
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,159
unstable foundation and um and so the rhythm of breathing

16
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,840
coming and going it's a con there is continuity there there's a constancy there that supports

17
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,079
us it's always there for us and because the inhale disappears the exhale disappears

18
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,360
it's like a wave like coming and going it's you can't really hold on to the

19
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,119
breathing and so it both provides us with this constancy this stability

20
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:15,920
and a kind of massage or support to not get caught in anything we still might have thoughts there might

21
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,840
be sensations all kinds of things might happen and we can be aware of them but with the

22
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,200
breathing kind of at the center or the breathing as support as a foundation

23
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,560
it comes and goes they it's a little more difficult to mind get fixated

24
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:39,120
or caught on its preoccupations and whatever is going on the emotions that are happening

25
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,959
and so it can be very it can be a gentling effect it can be a nurturing effect it can have a

26
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,959
tranquilizing effect to do this and for this meditation i'd like to

27
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:57,200
offer you something a little bit extra to pay attention to with the breathing

28
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:05,840
particular quality of it and that is the transition between breathing out and breathing in

29
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,280
the transition between breathing in and breathing out

30
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,840
and this is a place where

31
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:24,879
um just a little extra attention to and

32
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:31,200
there's different things that might happen there and so this is where you can literally pay attention to how it is for you

33
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,599
and it might change over time that on the in that uh the end of the out uh

34
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,799
exhale there might be just a very s

35
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:49,120
automatic quick automatic transition between breathing out and

36
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,200
breathing in it's just just boom boom breathe out and then immediately the in-breath begins

37
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,840
and that can be noticed how it happens one happens immediately after the other

38
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,360
it might be a the transition might be not so quick it might feel more like

39
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:14,319
it's gradual the exhale gradually ends and the inhale gradually begins

40
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:21,600
or it might feel like there's a sense a pause between the exhale

41
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,800
and then the beginning of the inhale and each of these has its advantages each of

42
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,240
these is part of the you know you know part of what we can notice but there's something about

43
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,440
noticing that transition in a relaxed and open way without expectation

44
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:45,840
that completes the cycle of attention of breathing in and breathing out and so um

45
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,600
and so um we'll bring some careful a gentle attention to this as we go

46
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,800
through the breathing so to take a comfortable

47
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,880
alert posture and

48
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:11,840
gently close your eyes

49
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:22,240
and perhaps taking a few long slow deep breaths full breaths three quarters

50
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,000
full and then as you exhale a little longer

51
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,039
exhale than you would just on your own

52
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,759
breathing in deeply deeply and then relaxing on the exhale

53
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:53,840
releasing and letting go

54
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,080
letting your breathing return to normal

55
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:39,360
and on the exhale go through the little almost like a

56
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,720
ritual of relaxing the body

57
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,560
and as you relax see if you can feel

58
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:59,919
some quality of tranquility or peacefulness in the area that you

59
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:08,080
relaxed so as you exhale relaxing the muscles of the face

60
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:17,199
around the eyes

61
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,120
the cheeks jaw

62
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,759
and if it's you're able to relax those

63
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:37,360
muscles is there any evidence any little even partial sense of tranquility

64
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:45,840
as part of that

65
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:58,160
then as you exhale to soften the shoulders release the

66
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,720
shoulders

67
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:11,120
and as the shoulders relax in the shoulders is there any sense of

68
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:27,840
greater calmness or tranquility

69
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,680
as you exhale relaxing the chest

70
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,399
the area around your heart

71
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:46,640
and even if there's agitation in that part of your body if you're able to relax a little bit or

72
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:55,839
soften are there any even hints of tranquility calmness

73
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,839
and then on the exhale relaxing the

74
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:26,959
belly letting the belly hang forward or

75
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:37,839
settle down deeper into

76
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:48,399
sometimes when we exhale sometimes when we relax the belly

77
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:55,760
they can also support a relaxation of

78
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:03,120
other areas of the body and you might as you exhale both relax

79
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,440
the belly and see if you can relax at the same time

80
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:16,639
release the shoulders the hands

81
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,839
arms

82
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:32,640
release the whole body

83
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:40,000
and then feel is there any physical tranquility or calmness

84
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:47,839
that you can pick up in your body as a whole

85
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,880
even if you do feel some thing opposite to calmness

86
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:05,040
see if you can be attuned to that which does feel tranquil and calm

87
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:29,839
and as you exhale relax with that calmness

88
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:43,839
and then becoming more centered on the experience of breathing

89
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:57,440
and in relationship to breathing itself is there any tranquility or calmness

90
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:05,200
or maybe around the experience of breathing underneath it behind it

91
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,839
some feeling of calm or peace

92
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,720
that's there associated with the breathing

93
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:39,839
and as you breathe breathe with that calmness breathe with the tranquility

94
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:57,760
and very calmly without thinking about it too much

95
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:07,040
appreciate or notice how the physical experience of inhaling is different

96
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:21,839
than the experience of exhaling

97
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,160
and then letting go of noticing the difference between them

98
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:49,120
let the inhale just be the inhale allow the exhale to just be the exhale

99
00:13:49,120 --> 00:14:03,839
as if it's the only thing that's here

100
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:50,800
and notice as you inhale the inhale inhale has an

101
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:57,920
end an end that fades away or an end which

102
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:05,600
comes abruptly and don't just notice and

103
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:13,839
feel the physical experience of that ending of the inhale

104
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:34,000
and then observe the transition to exhaling

105
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,839
maybe a little bit like you're

106
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,600
driving in a car and along a flat road and then there

107
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:58,959
comes a little hill a little bump that you gently lift up and then over the crest and you

108
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:04,480
go down kind of ride

109
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:14,480
the end of the inhale to the beginning of the exhale the

110
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,839
releasing

111
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:37,839
and then the same thing for the end of the exhale beginning of the inhale

112
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:46,160
maybe like driving along and there's a gentle dip in the road and the cars goes into

113
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,839
the dip and then slowly comes up

114
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:09,760
or maybe the transitions are sudden almost like a switch

115
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:19,280
that goes on and off switching from inhale to exhale exhale to inhale

116
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:33,840
both ways are fine gently observe how it is for you

117
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:05,200
perhaps in doing this careful sensing observing

118
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:14,080
maybe you can feel a quiet intimacy with the experience

119
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:29,840
of breathing

120
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:43,840
feeling whatever calmness or tranquility that's here

121
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:51,520
a tranquility that allows breathing to be as it is

122
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,840
comfortable or uncomfortable

123
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:07,120
but you just follow along in this rhythm

124
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,840
of breathing

125
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:19,120
seeing if you can feel any tranquility or calmness

126
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,960
associated with any part of the

127
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,840
breathing

128
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:48,320
and perhaps you can notice any calmness might be there in the transition between

129
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:55,279
breathing in and out between out and in

130
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:03,840
a calmness that's closely related to allowing

131
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,039
allowing that transition to do itself

132
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:31,840
with an intimacy with awareness breathing in breathing out

133
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,840
calmly receive the inhale

134
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,360
in the body

135
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:05,840
calmly release the exhale

136
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:24,720
and ride along in the transitions between these

137
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:38,480
a continuous intimacy tranquility

138
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:47,840
with your awareness of breathing

139
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,640
if you find yourself involved in thinking

140
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:08,640
what happens to your thinking when you place the rhythm of breathing

141
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:23,840
back in the middle of your experience

142
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:52,320
and for these few minutes we have together trust your breathing

143
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,919
more than you trust your thinking

144
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:05,840
center yourself on breathing in the body

145
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,840
releasing into tranquility as you exhale

146
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:33,840
receiving the inhale in your calmness as you breathe in

147
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,989
[Music]

148
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:13,839
so

149
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,640
and before bringing this to an end

150
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:58,839
scan through your body to notice what is it and where in your

151
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:05,200
body is there some tranquility calmness

152
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:15,839
even if there's places that are agitated notice the places that are calm or quiet

153
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:24,240
for a few minutes here breathe with that tranquility breathe through it

154
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:32,160
breathe along with

155
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,559
tranquility calmness

156
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:43,839
peacefulness

157
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:54,319
as if it's a gentle vapor that you can

158
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:02,079
blow through your body spread outwards throughout your whole

159
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:11,839
body as you breathe

160
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:39,680
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

161
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:49,839
perhaps in a world that's so agitated

162
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,280
our calmness

163
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:05,440
can be so that we don't fuel that agitation further

164
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:11,040
may it be that we don't add to people's anxiety

165
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:19,838
may it be that we don't contribute to restlessness

166
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:31,838
maybe that we don't reinforce

167
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,240
agitation of any kind

168
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,520
and may it be that whatever goodness benefit that we received from this

169
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:52,720
sitting may we dedicate it

170
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:59,838
to the benefit of others

171
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:07,520
may in our calmness may our benefits and merit

172
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:16,000
spread out across the lands so that all beings be happy

173
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:23,119
so that all beings might be safe

174
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:33,280
so that all beings might be peaceful

175
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:40,800
so that all beings might be free

176
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:49,359
may all being everywhere be free of all that oppresses

177
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:55,838
may all beings be happy

178
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:09,839
so

179
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:37,839
uh

180
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,839
uh

181
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,480
so

182
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:37,760
in these 16 stages 16 steps of mindfulness of

183
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:43,119
breathing as i've said that they are organized in

184
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:50,720
groups of four called tetrads and that the last step in each tetrad

185
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:56,160
the instructions are has to do with something in the family of letting go

186
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:02,319
or of freedom or of release whatever your language that you like to think of

187
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:07,839
that is and uh in step four

188
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:14,000
it's uh calming the bodily formations

189
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:20,480
sometimes it's translated as tranquilizing and i love the word tranquil but

190
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:26,640
tranquilizing i associate with something you do with animals or something

191
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:33,040
so it doesn't really evoke a positive obviously positive response for me

192
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:39,440
and and but you know bringing about tranquility of

193
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:45,119
the body in the eighth step it's calming relaxing

194
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:52,640
tranquilizing the mental formations the mind we'll see in a while that in the

195
00:46:52,640 --> 00:47:00,720
12th step it's um freedom release releasing the mind

196
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:08,000
freeing the mind and then in the final step of the 16 steps number 16

197
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:14,720
it's something called relinquishment which maybe it's a big word that doesn't really inspire so much

198
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:20,319
but it involves a real qualitative transformative experience of freedom of

199
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:26,319
liberation and so the movement towards greater and greater freedom

200
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:33,280
begins with this simple thing of relaxing the body and uh it's kind of beginning to learn

201
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:40,400
the lesson of freedom it's beginning to have a reference point for the goodness of what it's like to

202
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:49,119
not be tense not be caught and i think for many people it's a little bit more accessible this

203
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:56,319
physical relaxation than it is full-blown liberation but we're beginning to get a

204
00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:02,559
little taste of it and it's embody taste of it and

205
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:09,520
most people don't associate you know just simple physical relaxation with buddhist liberation but maybe

206
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:17,119
there's um the liberation is kind of such a matter of fact thing it's uh it's not

207
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:24,000
once you the greater liberation we have the more it just seems seen as

208
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:30,000
i don't know if ordinary is the right word but not such a

209
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:35,839
unusual thing or not such a

210
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:44,480
otherworldly thing in a sense it's uh it's just a very profound experience of

211
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:51,040
what we're beginning to experience as we begin to relax the body as we begin to relax as we begin to

212
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:58,000
experience a physical tranquility so in so you know as you know those of you

213
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,280
following along that i give a lot of emphasis on relaxing at the beginning of the body

214
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:09,680
the beginning of the meditation and now relaxing

215
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:17,040
you know it's maybe a little bit too s limited in describing the sense of

216
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:23,680
tranquility that comes that can come as we continue deeper and deeper into this anapanasati

217
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:29,200
but looking for tranquility looking for the calmness or the serenity that can exist

218
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:35,680
in our practice is said to be the support for greater tranquility we're not making

219
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:41,040
calmness or tranquility the be-all and end-all but it's a wonderful foundation that

220
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:46,400
begins to soften the hard hardness of the heart

221
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:52,640
the hardnesses of the mind the word stuck and things don't move tranquility begins to create a sense of

222
00:49:52,640 --> 00:50:00,559
safety inner safety where things begin to release more and more and we're not looking towards you know i

223
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:07,119
like the word tranquility more than calmness in my use of the words because calmness

224
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:15,359
can lend itself to the idea of becoming too calm so calm that you fall asleep and my vocabulary tranquility has an

225
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:21,119
alertness to it and the tranquility is not just calm

226
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:27,839
but it's also kind of a harmonious energy kind of energetics and so this calm kind of

227
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:34,079
aliveness a tranquil aliveness that can be here an embodied way

228
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:41,760
so i say all this as a way to encourage you to begin appreciating the in the influence that

229
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:48,400
relaxation has that in your daily life as you go about if there are times when you you notice

230
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:53,520
your shoulders relax your belly relaxes you sit down at the end of a long day

231
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:59,040
and you finally let down all your preoccupations and drive and

232
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:04,319
you know momentum that you have and you feel more relaxed

233
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:12,240
see if you can appreciate the the influence that has on you and see if you can maybe begin feel uh some

234
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:18,079
of the initial feelings of a certain kind of freedom if some kind of release

235
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:25,839
a certain kind of no longer being limited or bound or caught in something feel feel what it's like

236
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:33,359
physically begin to appreciate the small little movements of freedom that can be here and as you

237
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:38,640
get a hang of it you might find that there's actually a lot more little movements of freedom

238
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:46,800
little movements of not being caught that are happening all along and um and that may be often so easy to

239
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:52,960
overlook because we're it's not valued particularly other things getting something done is

240
00:51:52,960 --> 00:52:00,240
might be more valuable but there might be a very a lot of little movements of of just kind of oh that's great you

241
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:06,160
might step out of your house after a rainstorm and the rain has passed the sun has come out

242
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:11,440
and something inside of you just kind of releases um in that feeling of just being in the

243
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:17,040
sun being outdoors in the fresh air and so what is that influence what's

244
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:24,559
that effect on you and the body to be there and and to appreciate it don't hang on to it

245
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:30,160
don't you know get too complicated around it but just kind of start feeling

246
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:37,200
the little movements of freedom little movements of release of relaxation of tranquility

247
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:42,720
of peacefulness that seems to emanate from the movements of relaxation of ease that

248
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:48,000
happen and the more we start recognizing this in daily life and

249
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,040
meditation in different places it reinforces that movement it

250
00:52:53,040 --> 00:53:00,000
reinforces the value of not being tense it enforces the value of not being

251
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:06,640
caught up in preoccupations or driven or or or

252
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:14,079
bracing ourselves since things or closing down or trying to run away from things it reinforces it kind of kind of begins

253
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:22,000
to question those movements of mind those act ways in which we are which are the opposite of freedom and to do that

254
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,359
in the small areas of your life ordinary things

255
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:32,960
is a wonderful stepping stone that supports us finding it deeper and further further

256
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:40,640
along until the deeper areas of letting go of freedom that anapanasathi

257
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:47,440
is taking taking us to become more natural more accessible

258
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:53,280
more understandable because of what we've kind of

259
00:53:54,559 --> 00:54:00,880
really taken in earlier on in the practice so not just simply in meditation to

260
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:07,680
experience this but in other times of the day as well begin you know if you really want this anapanasati to really

261
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:14,400
deepen deep deeper deep go deeper and deeper in it this movement towards freedom

262
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:22,000
can be called it can become a a a

263
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:28,640
an ongoing sensitivity and ongoing attention

264
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:34,400
that we have um and it's not being self-preoccupied to do this it's i hope

265
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:40,240
you don't think it's selfish because the freedom is kind of beginning to turn ourselves inside out

266
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:46,240
so that we're actually in the freedom we are i think kind of more easily naturally

267
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:53,680
going to be more sensitive more caring for the world around us

268
00:54:53,680 --> 00:55:00,720
so tranquility letting go release relaxation

269
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:06,319
calmness all kind of or all ways they're connected to this

270
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:11,839
the family of experiences of movements

271
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:17,760
uh that's connected to liberation and um and to become a connoisseur of

272
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:24,640
this become a sensitive to it be informed by it to be inspired by it to be in touch

273
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:29,839
with it regularly maybe even so it becomes a little bit of a habit

274
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:37,760
so they can grow and develop in you and uh so that may this practice

275
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:42,880
that we do lead you to greater and greater experiences of freedom

276
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:50,559
and in doing so may it be for your delight so thank you so much for today and

277
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:58,319
we'll continue this tomorrow
