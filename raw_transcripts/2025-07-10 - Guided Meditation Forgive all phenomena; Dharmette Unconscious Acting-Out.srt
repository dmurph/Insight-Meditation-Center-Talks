1
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:14,639
Okay, welcome uh welcome folks. Welcome friends. Um happy to uh to be here. have been uh

2
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:23,920
away for a little bit but the practice continues for all of us and um

3
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:30,720
uh yeah happy to uh to practice together offer some reflections.

4
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:39,000
So, let's um let's uh let's yeah get stone together.

5
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:15,840
Maybe you give yourself some space and time to

6
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,439
take your dharma heart posture

7
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:28,320
kind of gentle way that maybe yoga teacher might counsel us to

8
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,798
get into a particular posture asa.

9
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,240
Maybe you take your time.

10
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,000
Maybe you start on a dime

11
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,399
and just drop everything.

12
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:06,719
Even though putting down what's uh sticky leaves a kind of residue of some

13
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:17,239
pain, some sense of neglecting something. Maybe it's okay. You start on a dime.

14
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,280
At points in practice, we uh become uh bored with

15
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,280
Samsara

16
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,280
bored by

17
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:53,560
the promises of praise and gain.

18
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:14,000
You just become uh fatigued by the compulsive effort to

19
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,120
keep everything together all the time.

20
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:08,520
And craving is always about one word,

21
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,360
next.

22
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:25,800
We dignify our next by talking about spiritual growth, samadei,

23
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:34,520
progress. But next is next.

24
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:59,479
Just this breath.

25
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:40,240
We're too busy knowing to congeal

26
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:47,560
the notion of my life, my practice, my sit.

27
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,720
Sometimes it it feels almost impossible to take just

28
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,000
one mindful breath.

29
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:53,079
It's like we'll never make it through the meditation period.

30
00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:02,240
But um actually often only takes

31
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,360
just a few conscious breaths

32
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,440
in order to land in a slightly

33
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,200
or significantly different place.

34
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,720
The burden of agitation

35
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,880
and avoidance

36
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:02,480
melts. Even a little, it's worth a lot.

37
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,720
Just forgive all phenomena.

38
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:08,280
Whatever you call your mind, your worry, hope and fear.

39
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,880
the sounds and the sensations,

40
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:22,200
the pleasantness and the pain.

41
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,280
Forgive it all deeply.

42
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,039
Trust that in the wake of that forgiveness, you don't

43
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:39,240
have to do much at all.

44
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:20,179
[Music]

45
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:42,679
Okay, it's good to uh good to practice with you.

46
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:52,320
So one of the the characteristics of the

47
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:58,720
self that it feels feels accessible. It's me

48
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:04,240
sort of right here closer than close.

49
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:13,440
And the self feels uh unitary. We we have access to it. We literally

50
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:20,799
hear the self. We can visualize the headquarters of self.

51
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:28,159
Uh Dan Danet, as I've often shared, described the this the sense of self as

52
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:33,200
the center of narrative gravity.

53
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,320
We sense it, hear it.

54
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:45,960
And whatever I am, it's amenable to conscious inspection.

55
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:51,440
And we might say there are different different facets of the self, but

56
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,720
they're available to us. And

57
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:01,760
to put it uh differently, um self view

58
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:07,320
doesn't really have room for the unconscious.

59
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:14,720
And Freud um famously said that our species has suffered

60
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:20,080
uh three humbling discoveries that have

61
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:25,840
eroded our uh quote naive self-love.

62
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:33,200
And the first was was capernicus, you know, and heliocentric that we we circle

63
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:40,080
the sun. It's very funny to me that we we thought I mean, you know, hindsight

64
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:45,760
is 2020, but it's funny to me that we thought we were literally the center of

65
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,799
the universe rather than like

66
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:56,159
one planet in one kind of incidental

67
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:01,519
galaxy, whatever. Uh, okay. That was the first

68
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:08,320
humiliation. And then uh Darwin, you know, that we

69
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,519
evolved from earlier creatures, monkeys, primates,

70
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:21,120
you know, and uh and now we're like I I do my best to differentiate myself from

71
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:29,880
monkeys by getting haircuts. And you know, we're very conscious about,

72
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:36,320
you know, we're not that, you know, we're humans.

73
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,440
And then Freud, maybe grandiosely, maybe not, said the the third kind of

74
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:47,600
discovery was his own that we do not govern our own mind.

75
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:53,919
And uh in Mahayana Buddhism, the the yoga

76
00:32:53,919 --> 00:33:01,519
tradition um the uh Elia Elia vijana

77
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:10,720
um is is I my understanding I'm not a scholar somewhat akin to the unconscious

78
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:16,960
and uh the phrase that I've always heard um the rendering of it was storehouse

79
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:26,320
consciousness. iousness, storehouse consciousness. And it's described metaphorically

80
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:32,399
as a kind of um receptacle for karma.

81
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:39,039
You know, where the kind of potential energy of our

82
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:44,240
habits, our karmic seeds lie in weight.

83
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:51,279
And um and so I I begin with this um cuz a

84
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:59,640
couple weeks ago I did something that I could not explain.

85
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:06,240
On the one hand it wasn't a big deal. It didn't cause serious problems

86
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:14,720
but um it was unskillful. you know, involved a a yeah, close friend and

87
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:21,040
colleague and required an apology and uh

88
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:28,720
uh and the details not not uh the point. What's important is I did something that

89
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:34,079
couldn't be explained by my conscious mind.

90
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:41,040
you know, I couldn't I couldn't point to it was like something else was acting on

91
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:46,720
me. And I remember dimly this kind of

92
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:54,960
conscious moment of deliberating, should I do A or B? And I did A. And it was the

93
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:01,599
wrong thing to do. And in retrospect, it wasn't clear how I

94
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:08,240
thought it would possibly work out in a skillful way.

95
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:15,440
It was like so obvious this was like a bad plan, you know,

96
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,720
and it was a kind of example. I'm talking

97
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:27,200
about it um because it was an example of the kind of disruptiveness

98
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:34,800
of the unconscious. The unconscious, you know, unconsciousness forces

99
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:42,519
uh it they highlight the the limits of willful self-control.

100
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:52,160
And we have these these patterns that just sometimes they just don't add up.

101
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:57,280
And they only make sense when you add a variable to the equation.

102
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:03,760
And the variable is I'm a little crazy.

103
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,960
That's the variable. You know,

104
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,240
I'm a little unknown to myself.

105
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:19,520
And when we're um propelled by

106
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:26,400
unconscious forces like our behavior is is it's less

107
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:32,000
adaptive. It's distorted. It's mismatched to the context

108
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,480
and we leave a little wake of debris, you know,

109
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:47,760
and the the kind of unconscious process is a is a form of overdisclosure.

110
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:58,560
What we said means too much. What we did did too much. We're exposed in some way.

111
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:03,599
And the the self-curation project is

112
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:10,640
shattered by unconscious motives, the leakiness of it all.

113
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:16,000
And the kind of fantasy of pulling off the performance

114
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,839
of self is challenged by the disruptiveness of the unconscious. It's

115
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:27,920
like we break roles, you know, like uh the breaking down the fourth wall,

116
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:36,000
right? Um yeah of per actors or whatever you know it's like okay the role

117
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:47,359
the role cracks somehow the performance of self is as a leak

118
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:56,640
and we're seen for precisely what we do not want to be seen as the klesas the

119
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:04,880
defilements ments have leaked out. And that often comes with um

120
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:12,880
some shame, you know, and the the the gap between our

121
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,000
preferred self story and the experience that

122
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,520
others have of us. It's often filled with shame.

123
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:34,000
And in these zones, we get so moralistic about our inner life. Very young, very I

124
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:41,119
don't use the word poratively, but very kind of primitive moralistic mind

125
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:47,359
states. And then maybe we want to hide or deny

126
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:55,799
or no, no, no, you don't understand. No, no, no. Okay, breathe.

127
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:04,240
The defilements are not self. Shame always requires a self, requires a

128
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:09,079
measure of identification

129
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:16,000
and we come to appreciate our mind is not in our possession. We do not belong

130
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:24,200
to ourselves but we can do the work of integration.

131
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:32,279
And to uh wake up is to wake up to more.

132
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:39,520
All all self-nowledge is good news, you know, in this sense. Even when it's bad

133
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:47,359
news, it's good news. And um

134
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:54,240
often we need another person to wake up to the kind of unconscious forces

135
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:59,280
that um the tectonic plates of our mind.

136
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:05,280
We we often need another person. But sometimes our behavior lights the

137
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:13,040
way. Sometimes we do something that we don't understand. We don't know where it came

138
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:20,680
from. Okay. Yes. Let me investigate.

139
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:28,079
Uh wir solich war den right. It's famous um

140
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:34,640
from Freud sometimes rendered as where it was

141
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:40,320
there shall I become. Where there was unconsciousness

142
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:44,359
there shall be understanding.

143
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:51,839
Okay. Nonshame. Nonshame. We find ways to

144
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:58,800
uh soothe ourselves. To soo ourselves to make room for the pain

145
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:08,240
by connecting with some goodness. And how do you take refuge in something

146
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:14,119
other than selftory?

147
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:23,359
And so we have to feel our way through the exposure, maybe the shame

148
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:31,280
until what's left is actually just some very clean kind of remorse about any

149
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:37,760
difficulties that were caused. And maybe there's some rupture,

150
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:43,520
a repair to be made. Maybe not. But either way, we're enriched by the

151
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:50,960
experience, enriched, changed by it, and we've

152
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:57,200
uh learned something about oursel. These kind of like dimly sensed

153
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:05,720
disruptive forces of our mind, the storehouse can be appreciated.

154
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:12,800
And the more we develop a kind of awake relationship with those forces,

155
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:19,359
the less we are, you know, are they kind of move in this subterranean way to

156
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:23,799
sponsor distorted behavior.

157
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:30,520
And uh it's possible that um

158
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:37,680
you know meditation without ever making the you know without always

159
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:43,200
making the unconscious turning it into propositional

160
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:49,040
self-nowledge things we could say I'm like this I have this.

161
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:56,079
Even without those words, it's possible it dissolves some of the forces that the

162
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:02,079
pressure on those tectonic plates eases

163
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:07,359
without even knowing what we've let go of.

164
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:13,680
We don't need to know what we're quantumizing in order for some of the disruptiveness

165
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:19,800
of this storehouse consciousness to be discharged.

166
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:27,280
But uh we'll never be able to do it all

167
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:34,720
alone. We need each other. And uh in other words, we might say that

168
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:40,319
um that wisdom is a is a property of diads

169
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:43,960
rather than individuals.

170
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:53,119
So, I offer this for your consideration and um

171
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:59,040
I didn't do anything really bad. It's not going to be in like the newspapers tomorrow.

172
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:06,960
Matthew Brent Silver Buddhist minister da da da. It was but it was just like

173
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:13,760
okay this is um this just requires some

174
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:19,359
investigation. So um yeah may we all uh know ourselves

175
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:25,440
well. I uh wish you wish you well. Lovely to be with you. Happy to be back.

176
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:30,280
I'll see you uh see you next week.
