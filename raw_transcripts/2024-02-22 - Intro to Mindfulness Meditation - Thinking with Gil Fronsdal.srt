1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,840
so so people are still coming and uh we could use this kind of informally if any

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,120
of you have any questions that you want to ask about the practice about

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,680
practicing with emotions from last week or anything about the meditation or anything on your minds or Hearts about

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,680
this

5
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:37,360
it's all pretty straightforward easy to do sit down sit down close your eyes and

6
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,879
boom you're like in Bliss and happiness and don't have any

7
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:54,440
questions um I seem to have when I sit down once I get through a few minutes of

8
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:00,320
mental turn pretty consistent feelings and I think I described a little bit about this last

9
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:08,040
week um just kind of like underlying anxiety not huge but there yeah um and I

10
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,439
also have a desire for it not to be there sure sure so I'm just I'm wondering how to how to hold those

11
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:20,600
things well that's the that's the qu that's the good question because hold it means you're not doing

12
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,640
what not necessarily trying to change it change it or fix it or go along with the

13
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:32,079
desire and then you know try to blast the anxiety out of existence or something so I so just to hold it just

14
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,520
the fact that you have that desire or that wish to hold it that's fantastic

15
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:45,119
and even to have that wish is the beginning of some different relationship to it right so so we're

16
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:52,399
kind of looking for a different relationship and that's partly what the mindfulness does it shifts our relationship to these to our desires to

17
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,079
our emotions to our aversions um you know and so and part of the shift is we

18
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:04,719
learned like as Yu said we hold it rather than go along with it we hold it rather than get involved with

19
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,879
it so so can you answer your own question now that that you said it you

20
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:16,480
asked the question so well yeah I'm just not really satisfied with the answer though but you why don't

21
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,560
you say say it say what you what you what what how you would answer it by

22
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,200
yourself that the both the anxiety and then also the kind of layer below it

23
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,959
which is the desire for it to be different are things that I can hold

24
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,120
mindfully and just just as a feeling would a physical sensation would be or

25
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:43,760
or the breath is just to notice it and to be with it great and do you have any sense of why that's that answer is

26
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:51,800
dissatisfying for you because you're still in the desire to get rid of it little bit yeah totally

27
00:02:51,800 --> 00:03:00,800
so you're not quite holding it you're a little bit also being it I'm in it in it as well uhhuh and um

28
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,319
so um so there's a few things you can do to support this I mean one is um we have

29
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:14,599
this technique called mental noting that's sometimes used in this practice and that's a a more emphatic way of

30
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:20,560
knowing what's happening so many times we just know it non-verbally and we're just present with something but

31
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:27,239
sometimes a fuller acknowledgement of something really makes a difference uh in some cult In some cultures uh you

32
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:33,480
wouldn't tell people your birth name because in the had some kind of power over you and there is power in naming

33
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:39,040
things and sometimes just naming we say sometimes I want to name something that's happening here and some difficult

34
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,599
someone names everyone's angry and everybody say oh yeah someone named it finally now we understand why it's so

35
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:49,799
difficult so the naming of something can be quite useful sometimes uh it also

36
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:57,480
helps create little bit of distance from it uh so because if you're still in that desire to change it but you you name it

37
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:04,599
oh there's that desire to change it desire then you're a little bit stepping back and then it's a little easier to hold it

38
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:12,040
the next thing you can do is to um uh uh you know the rafting so you recognize it

39
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,239
that's the naming you allow it which is the holding and then you feel it

40
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:24,560
physically so both of those the anxiety where does that in your body if you can find the location where it's centered

41
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,840
then it's easier to hold it like this if it's just Amorphis it's kind of like what am I doing here and the desire as

42
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:37,199
well if the desire is strong there's probably some tension or pressure or contraction somewhere maybe in the mind

43
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:44,199
or in the heart or something behind that desire stronger the desire is more likely you'll find a physical coraly and

44
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:52,360
then again okay there there's something there it is physically now I can connect to it speaks descrition of screen and can

45
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:58,400
be used to contr only your keyboard thank you already know voice take your

46
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:07,199
time Jo the KE if you want to learn how the volume's in the top left side on the very top you

47
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:14,280
got it great okay so

48
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:21,319
um so um anyway is that enough for this for now is that it a little bit more

49
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:27,960
satisfying yes good but what I like to be you know

50
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:34,880
please forgive me if I need to be forgiven that I turned it back on you because that's what we do in this practice we're supposed to learn to find

51
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:42,240
our own way with it and uh and you kind of did and then I was able to just kind of offer you some you um stop streaming

52
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:50,000
oh stop streaming okay well just take your time just relax and it'll you people people will log on again who are

53
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,360
online um the rafting is similar to rain which

54
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,759
is another very similar which I know about um

55
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:06,680
and I'm working on it sort of in another way with my therapist or whatever but

56
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:12,199
it's it's hard for me she's always trying to explain it to me and we're doing it in her office and I'm always

57
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:18,759
like you know and I seem to be able to get in touch with what it's about when I'm with her in her office and she's

58
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:24,599
talking me through it a little but at home or when I'm in like an obset

59
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:31,720
situation I have a harder time like understanding all four steps yeah

60
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:38,599
and like what does feel mean like physically like what does it what does it mean to feel like my

61
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:45,319
anxiety I only know how to like I mean I know it happens here but it also happens so there's so much churning in my head

62
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:52,840
that yeah so it's possible you're you're not ready to do the raft you have another step to do first and that is if

63
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:59,400
you just kind of opened up really wide to get the bird's eyee view of what's happening to you what what would you see

64
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,720
that what would you know and it doesn't have to be exact it

65
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,919
could be a very general there times in my practice where the most General thing

66
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:15,960
I can say because I couldn't figure out what's going on I would say chaos but what would what would the

67
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:21,280
bird's ey view provide you what would you because because otherwise you you

68
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,759
something's going on that you're going to therapy about yeah so so so what's the bird's eye view of that experience

69
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:32,840
for you I mean I don't know how else to say it

70
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:38,639
except for an an anxiety feeling great great so so so so that's your way of

71
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:44,080
connecting knowing what it is maybe that's enough how could recognizing it

72
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,560
as anxiety be significant step in

73
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,840
itself um well sort of noting it like you were just explaining

74
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:04,280
uh what else what else would be why how would it be significant just stay there and just continue anxiety that this is

75
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:09,840
anxiety just kind of stay with it in that simple General bird's eye view how

76
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,919
how could that be helpful for you um well I hope it can be helpful and

77
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:22,039
like not bringing back up to my head again which is great great because so so there's something about recognizing it

78
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:29,639
that way that takes you out of your head yeah fantastic and so where's the other place beside your head

79
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:36,640
where the anxiety is for for you oh just like in my stomach fantastic so then I would I would

80
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:44,360
recognize being in the stomach more and kind of take refuge there and enjoy enjoy that little bit so recognizing you

81
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:50,959
have anxiety you can do and that recognition gets you out of your head and puts you somehow in your

82
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:58,360
belly which is nice so if so then but the anxiety is still there right a little bit Yeah so so then if you

83
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:05,279
continue that same process just recognize that anxiety and what what happens

84
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:13,480
next well when I've done it and it's worked it's it's worked it um I feel

85
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:19,519
calmer I mean I don't feel as in my I mean I feel less in my head and more just with

86
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,800
my body fantastic so it's possible that the complicated thing of raft this

87
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:31,000
process puts you in your head too much yeah it does like what where am I now and remembering at all that and so it's

88
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:38,760
not that's not what its purpose is it's easy to do so maybe you're not ready to use it yet you already have plenty going

89
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,920
for you the fact that you know how to just recognize that anxiety gets you out

90
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,399
of your head it puts you in your body a little bit and you get calmer and then

91
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:55,360
then then just if there's still some remnants of anxiety do that whole process over again and you have your own

92
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:02,360
process which is quite significant and keep it simple and and not make it a project that's really helpful because I

93
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:08,480
do think I analyze it and I'm thinking yeah great thank you thank

94
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:15,200
you okay so welcome welcome back and

95
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,680
um and uh so um we'll start with the

96
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:28,519
meditation and the idea is today we're going to do mindfulness of thinking and I just want to say that for

97
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:34,279
many people thinking is one of the biggest obstacles to meditation because

98
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:41,279
rather than thinking rather than meditating we're thinking and uh and some people confuse

99
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:47,320
thinking for mindfulness if you're thinking about what's happening so it's this is not thinking about what's

100
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:54,760
happening in the moment it's a very different process of just being present and seeing without anal analysis or

101
00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:00,920
stories or thinking about it in some way but thinking is the most common thing that takes people away from the present

102
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:08,440
moment which is where we want to be for mindfulness because of that it's very easy to be frustrated and it's very easy

103
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:14,200
to be critical about it be upset and some people come to the conclusion I can't meditate because I'm drifting off

104
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,800
so much um I liked I was trying the first day if you remember how it was the first

105
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:25,000
evening we met I was trying to present this practice as a way you can can't do it

106
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,880
wrong uh all you're asked to do is to recognize what is happening not needing

107
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:38,000
to have it be different so like for you just recognizing anxiety is almost enough for you you know it's quite

108
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:45,440
powerful just oh this is what's happening and uh and if what's happening is your mind is thinking a

109
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:51,680
lot that's the thing to recognize it's that simple oh this is a thinking mind

110
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,399
you could you could go a little bit further and and calculate how much the California electrical grid could be

111
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:02,800
powered by your thinking because of the how much you think but um but the idea

112
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,639
is keep it simple so oh thinking thinking and it might only last for a

113
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:16,279
second or two that you came in the present moment to recognize your thinking but uh that is very different

114
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:21,440
than just kind of barreling along uninterruptedly in the in the train of

115
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:27,160
thoughts and what we're doing is if you use the analogy of trains for thinking

116
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:33,199
is uh you know you come you drive your car you're stop waiting at the train tracks for the train cars to go by and

117
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:38,800
the next thing you know you're on the train cars so you know you have to get off you

118
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,199
have to wait till the next stop and you get off and go back to look for your car and and U but then there's another train

119
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:49,760
and you get on again and some people stay on the car some people try to get off but they just go to the next

120
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:55,639
car and so the idea is to but every time you step off is actually quite

121
00:12:55,639 --> 00:13:01,320
significant consider you know for how however old you

122
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:08,519
are how many uninterrupted moments of thinking have you had so far in your

123
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,760
lifetime two or three four you've had a few probably probably

124
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:22,360
that's mostly what you do with your thinking mostly your thinking just barrels ahead and goes on and on and on and on and on and on and changes subject

125
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:31,040
and does different things it's uninterrupted so what's been going on for a whole lifetime is the habit of

126
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,560
thinking and that habit is well honed well developed it's become a habit

127
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:44,920
almost and um and what's remarkable so it's a habit that's built over many many years what's remarkable is how quickly

128
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:50,800
that can begin to change um compared to how long you've been doing it but it's not you're not

129
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,360
going to get to see the effects just once twice 10 times 100 times that you

130
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:05,360
step away from thinking but stepping away way is actually quite a powerful event for the mind and um and it begins

131
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:11,720
changing something in the mind radically that you're no longer always moving

132
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:17,560
along in the same track so even if all you can do for a moment is oh that's thinking and you

133
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:22,800
step away and gets a little bit quiet and then you start again appreciate you

134
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:28,519
did it you succeeded that was great and now you now you wait for the next chance

135
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:35,240
to do it and then you do it again and um and uh and then there's a

136
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:40,360
way then that as be as become we become more familiar with

137
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:46,639
thinking thinking itself becomes an object of mindfulness it's just as valid as

138
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:53,600
something to be mindful of as um the breathing as the body as emotions it's

139
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,720
actually very important to develop a mindfulness of thinking and the mindfulness of thinking is kind of like

140
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:06,120
having having an overview of it or stepping back and and turning around and looking at it from a distance so we can

141
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:12,279
start to understanding something about the nature of our thinking that's invisible to us if we're just living in

142
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:17,800
our thoughts all the time we're just going of following along and as you know there are some people philosopher who

143
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:23,839
said I think therefore I am and some people really their whole identity is

144
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:29,800
intimately tied to their thinking they would feel like they didn't exist if they didn't think and part of that

145
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:35,199
reason is thinking is one way we tell stories about who we are have

146
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:42,240
conversations that puts us into our identity and who we think we should be and uh and sometimes that's built up so

147
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,880
strongly as who I am through those stories that if we don't have this the thoughts to tell us the stories then

148
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:55,160
it's like we don't exist it can be frightening for some people but uh you're not going to die

149
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:02,800
just because your thinking mind goes quiet for a while it's like having a hybrid car and you come to the stop and

150
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,720
oh the engine went turned off isn't that nice it'll and you know it's going to turn as soon as you start your gas again

151
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:16,040
right so it's but it's so nice or the or the hum in the refrigerator stopped ah that was good so it can that can happen

152
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:22,959
with the thinking mind in different ways so the first thing is just to be aware that you're thinking and to

153
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:28,720
appreciate just knowing wow my mind is out of the control with with my thoughts

154
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:35,839
the um there's all these some people have all these stages of developing meditation and the first stage that you

155
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:42,720
know you've reached something like succeeded and you're on the on the track right track is when you realize your

156
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,759
mind is out of control you know it's it's uh much

157
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:53,720
better to know your mind is out of control than to have a mind that's out of control and not know it it's actually

158
00:16:53,720 --> 00:17:00,319
very significant even though it's very easy to be frustrated and feel like I can't do it but in fact you are doing it

159
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:08,319
you've reached the first level so congratulations and um so um and then

160
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:15,000
I'm repeating myself now then as we learn to kind of settle down and just be able to hold the thinking mind when

161
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,480
that's necessary that um we start seeing that thought thinking is not just a

162
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:27,280
unitary thing thinking is made up of many compo composite parts so I like to

163
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:35,440
make I have a new English word and that is thating there's thinking and there's thating thating is just the Mind

164
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,160
produces a single thought oh that's the hum of the heating

165
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:46,600
heating system just that's like one thought thinking is

166
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:51,720
when there's a chain of associations that happen and they one triggers their

167
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,840
next triggers their next so the hum of the heating

168
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,720
system probably people think we should have a quieter heating system in Meditation Center probably people now

169
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:09,600
are being critical and judging me for not getting the right heating system probably I'm failing as a meditation

170
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,200
teacher because of the heating system probably I need to go and move to another town and try to find a you

171
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,480
quieter place people don't know me because and the mind spins right that's

172
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:27,760
thinking and you know hopefully you're not as bad is my mind but it goes off and running right but a thought is just

173
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,360
a thought that arises but it isn't just simply that it's a thought with Associated ideas that

174
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:40,280
follow and all these things build on it but it's also that um I can have that thought there's a sound of the heating

175
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:46,600
system or I could have fear that you guys are going to judge me because of

176
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:51,679
that sound the fear then gives few food

177
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,799
to the further thoughts that I have in addition because I'm this is

178
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:01,960
such a important issue for my identity I mean my whole body is going to get tense

179
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:09,120
like oh this you know and that tension makes me feel uncomfortable and that tension then that

180
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:17,320
discomfort is something I react against and and that becomes food for more thinking and more thinking so a thought

181
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:22,600
is just not an innocent little floating sentence in the mind or image in the

182
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:29,559
mind it also comes along with a stuff that feeds it that energizes it and keeps it going

183
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:35,440
what's possible is to begin seeing the system the thinking system how it works

184
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:41,720
what feeds it what we're the physical side the tension that's part of it the emotional side that's part of it and as

185
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:50,440
we get start getting a hang of seeing what's going on we start finding that we can leave it alone we can stop trying to

186
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:59,559
fix it or get away from it or stop it and instead of and in that leaving it alone there's space for uh

187
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:06,200
awareness to be there there space just to know it in a very easy way oh

188
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,840
thinking thinking with fear thinking with tension there's the tension and so

189
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:18,640
we start seeing these component parts of it and it becomes a whole different game it's a whole different event than what

190
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:25,159
we thought it was which was just you know you know some important thought

191
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:31,720
problem we had to figure out by by thinking ourselves through it does that make some sense what I

192
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:37,480
say so we start uh so it's it's important with this practice to always

193
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:43,200
remember it's meant to be very simple we'll start this in a very simple

194
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:49,720
way uh and then as I talk like with raft it can get more complicated because there's so much so many different parts

195
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:55,200
of it but it's not meant to make it a complicated analysis it's meant to

196
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:01,960
support uh you by giving you the map of what what is going on inside of you so

197
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:08,240
you're better able to see it in a simple way if you can't if you don't know what's in there it'll come up from

198
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:16,159
behind and grab you it'll kind of you know run the show but if you start seeing how the the whole thing operates

199
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:21,799
then you can step back and find some peace and calm with it and so part of

200
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:29,000
the what might be complicated today is really meant to just give you the map so you can you can find a way to be simple

201
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:36,480
with all of it so let's start very simply so take a meditation

202
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:48,760
posture and I'm going to give you a very simple word to use

203
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:54,440
that'll help you to stay to be here with your experience right now no matter what

204
00:21:54,440 --> 00:22:00,440
the experience is you're allowed to be just as you want just as you are but one

205
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,960
word I'll offer you is kind of like a little little support like to help you

206
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:13,000
recognize what is here just allow it to be what's here just oh this is how it is

207
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:19,760
you they say this word and then just notice how it actually is and then after a while you can say

208
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:25,360
the same word again as a as a pointer as a support as a put you in the right

209
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:31,080
place to notice oh this is what it's like now and seeing that this is what it's like

210
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:40,039
now can be done simply easily like you're holding the experience you're making space for it like that so I I'll

211
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:45,640
introduce the word to you uh after we settle into the meditation

212
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:52,679
so gently closing your eyes and taking some long slow deep

213
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:55,679
breaths

214
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,559
and relaxing on the

215
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,080
exhale settling into your body as you

216
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:31,679
exhale and then let your breathing return to normal and then spend some time scanning

217
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:37,320
through your body as you

218
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:42,759
exhale relax maybe the muscles of your

219
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,320
face soften your shoulders

220
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,600
maybe softening the

221
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:32,000
belly and then centering yourself on the

222
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:43,200
breathing being simply present for a few minutes with the rhythm of breathing in

223
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,640
and breathing out maybe noticing how the experience of

224
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,960
breathing in is a different experience than breathing

225
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,360
out for

226
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:03,279
and then gently in a soft way maybe a kind

227
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:11,840
way say to yourself the word here h e r

228
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:20,279
e because you're here recognize you're here and

229
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:27,000
then notice what your experience is here in

230
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,559
whatever way it shows it self to you there's no right or wrong way to be

231
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:39,440
here here and notice how it is for

232
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:45,760
you and you can a nice relaxed Rhythm maybe every

233
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:53,520
exhale or some Rhythm you can just say gently to yourself

234
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:59,559
here and notice what is here for you

235
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:10,200
and when you've noticed it allowed it before the Mind drifts too far away

236
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:17,279
say here again again doing this again and

237
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:31,159
again for

238
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:09,120
if there's a lot of thinking here and then notice what it's like to

239
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,519
have a mind that's thinking a lot

240
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,120
here e

241
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:20,760
allow yourself to be as you are but don't go Galloping off with how

242
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:26,360
you are with your thoughts or whatever is

243
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:33,720
happening pause in the middle of it with the word

244
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:42,759
here and then recognize what here is for you at this

245
00:29:51,720 --> 00:30:00,039
moment and if here is thinking just know it as thinking

246
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,960
for

247
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:00,960
for for

248
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:36,720
and then to bring this meditation to a close notice

249
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:43,679
first if there's some way you might be different now than you were when we started

250
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:49,120
meditating has anything shifted for you

251
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:06,080
and then you can take a few long slow breaths to feel reconnected and to your

252
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:12,000
body in a fuller way and feel your body against the chair or

253
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:20,519
the floor and then when you're ready you can open your eyes

254
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:27,329
[Music]

255
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:42,480
so and and partly that was and to trying to point out to you the Simplicity of

256
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:48,360
being present for one moment without agendas without needing things to be any

257
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:54,480
different but just taking the moment to here and recognize what's here and then

258
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,679
again so it'd be interesting to hear from a few of you how how was that like

259
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:08,000
for you what what happened to you what was I like to do that what shifted for

260
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:17,799
you if uh we can have the mic here is up in the

261
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:29,600
front um so in just going back to the word

262
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:35,559
here I just initially like you know I'm thinking about the word here and like um

263
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:41,399
it's just showing up and block letters in my head but eventually it just kind of shifts to where I'm just experiencing

264
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:47,919
my body there no other way than just like feeling it I'm feeling the way my legs

265
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:53,159
are bent and I'm think like go back to thinking where I'm like oh that kind of hurts a little bit maybe I need to take

266
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:59,960
a better position um but just being able to like feel it great that's nice and

267
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:06,679
and how did did anything shift for you besides your direction of mindfulness

268
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:14,158
um I mean I I feel more calm my breath slowed down but um I don't know if that

269
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:23,679
shifted but that that seems is that nice yeah it was good what it was good it was good and and so okay great thank you

270
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:32,599
okay yeah I noticed that it did interrupt my train of thought um and

271
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:39,040
what was nice is I didn't you know yes I went back to thinking but I didn't go back to that

272
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:46,878
same train it was like a different train but then at least I didn't because often

273
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:52,638
what happens in my mind is this it does build the longer I'm on

274
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:59,800
this train of thought it does build my anxiety because I'm then I'm trying to

275
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:06,359
solve all the problems in my you know life right yeah you know on this at

276
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:15,720
least for this train but so it did help because it it did bring me back okay no you're you're here uh and then I would

277
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:22,119
be calm for a little bit and then my mind would start again but I think it's fantastic I mean to have that tool to

278
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:27,880
have that ability to do that is maybe better than the alternative

279
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:35,800
thank you and it's a skill that you build and you develop it over time and and every time that you um uh kind of

280
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:41,160
step away from those trains you're no longer feeding it and

281
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:46,520
so the more often you start just doing that simple thing the the the fuel

282
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:52,200
dissipates and after a while there's no more fuel to keep the thinking

283
00:35:53,400 --> 00:36:00,960
going but generally the way people live we're like the crazy coal shoveler on the train we're

284
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:07,240
just like you know you know just constantly we might be saying stop but we're putting more

285
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:11,000
and more coal in the

286
00:36:22,319 --> 00:36:31,200
engine um so the word here is helpful and it does does bring me back and then

287
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:38,800
there's a moment of sort of you know empty mind and then I start wondering

288
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:46,319
what I'm supposed to be paying attention to um oh I'm supposed to be paying

289
00:36:46,319 --> 00:36:53,640
attention to the sensations in my body so that I'm looking for like the sensations you know oh I've got an itch

290
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:59,119
over here or oh wait a minute here oh yeah yeah oh what am I supposed to be

291
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:07,240
paying attention to but so so if you then it said the here a little bit faster quicker then here and then the

292
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:12,680
next here would be oh here is trying to figure out what to

293
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:18,119
do so if you had done that what do you think would have happened to

294
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:25,400
you well I'd be noticing what was going on in my brain great that would be a good thing that that's completely valid

295
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:31,720
and what it also means is that um you're not going along with that thought sounds like you went along with it try to

296
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:38,440
figure it out yeah where I'm supposed to be right and but if you said oh what's here and oh it's just a mind trying to

297
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:45,400
figure it out that's all okay and then you're on to the next thing here and then there a sound of the heating

298
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:51,400
system does that make sense so I'm trying to convey how simple this can be

299
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:59,520
that can cut through a lot and uh or to say not cut through but say maybe more nicely um help you step away so you're

300
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:05,720
not in The Fray step away so you're not being pushed pushed around by the thoughts and going along with them and

301
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:11,680
that was a for me a great example of you were pushed around a little bit by that thought and what I tried to point out

302
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:17,440
was an alternative was just to recognize you are doing it oh I'm looking for what where where my attention should be

303
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:25,440
that's what's in the present moment the mind is looking for something oh okay that's it end of

304
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,440
story one more

305
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:41,760
for me actually it was very very simple it was like a medium around me and I was dissolving in this air in the room and I

306
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:49,200
was feeling so great so it was easy easier to do meditation this way right wonderful so was was totally like a

307
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:56,800
medium music Atmosphere fantastic very nice so yes please yeah yeah hi I'm

308
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:03,880
actually still stuck on the first lecture and I'm still trying to get into the body the mindfulness of the body yes

309
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:10,720
and um one of the things I've noticed is um is um you know when I come back into

310
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:17,480
the breathing um sometimes I get a little too concentrated I think I mentioned

311
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:23,520
this before when I get too concentrated in the breathing then I have to detach myself into uh becoming a little bit

312
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:30,160
more relaxed yeah uh and that's a tension that I seem to be having all the time and then I've been trying to sort

313
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:37,480
of relax it a bit um and you know so that's what my dilemma has been a little

314
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:43,160
bit so do you so so if I I understand you you're saying that you tend to want

315
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:49,079
to stay focused on the breathing in the body but if you do that it gets a little bit too intense for you yeah that's

316
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:55,640
right and you and you feel a tension in your body it's you try to relax then yes I'm trying to relax it so that I don't

317
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:01,440
get too great so to uh to a certain up to a certain point relaxing the body is

318
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:08,720
really helpful for this process uh the point where we stop we stop doing it is when relaxing has become a

319
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:14,319
project because it's not easy to do so we now we're really trying we're struggling to try to relax better

320
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:20,240
tensing to relax better and um and so at before you get

321
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:28,440
to that point you want to just kind of relax in a sense the practice and say okay what's Happening Here

322
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:36,079
here is a mind that's intense with the breathing and the body that's getting tense Ju Just keep it that

323
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:43,440
simple and and almost like you're trying to be very very simple so you can see it

324
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:49,400
well it's like I don't know the last few years has been cats somehow in my life

325
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:54,880
and um and if you if you're a stranger to a cat you don't go right up to it and

326
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:00,920
look it in the eye some cats you really want to ignore it if the first time you go into someone's house and just turn

327
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:06,480
away and ignore it and then it feels safe to come to you but if you go over and make a project to make friends with

328
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:11,760
a cat you're in trouble you know you chase it around come I'm my friend you

329
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:17,040
know so the same thing with our inner life if you make a project out of it

330
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:24,040
some things you can't it's not they're not going to stay around long enough to see clearly and well so for you to just

331
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:29,400
simply hear oh here I'm trying to be with a breath here I'm getting tense

332
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:35,480
don't relax at some point stop relaxing and just be here with how it is

333
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:40,760
and then you might see that what's what's shy inside of you might finally

334
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:47,079
show itself and I I don't know you so I'm just making something up but I know people who've done something similar to

335
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:53,319
you and underneath of it all there's some fear fear of Doing It Wrong fear of

336
00:41:53,319 --> 00:42:00,440
not getting something fear of being left behind all kinds of things fear of doing it wrong and so oh it's

337
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:05,880
fear as the cat that's shy oh that's what's driving this

338
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:12,000
tension and this intensity is the fear and now we do so now we find the fear

339
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,359
now we do we we're here okay here fear okay this is what fear is like I'm

340
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:24,000
with fear now and then what's interesting is it's probably another

341
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:31,760
cat if but if you you don't make it a project you don't don't don't up don't up to the fear to try to fix it just

342
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:38,800
here kind of say here and kind of look at it side of your eyes because it might be even really shy and then you find

343
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:45,319
something else is under that yeah just one other thing is that when I um doke end the breathing could

344
00:42:45,319 --> 00:42:51,800
you can you turn the volume sorry I okay I'll hold it closer so when I doke end the breathing it becomes um you know the

345
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:57,200
Mind becomes quite focused there's a there's a point at which you know if

346
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:04,599
it's not getting stressed then it gets very focused and that's when you can actually do the examination that you're

347
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:09,880
talking about that it's really focused then you can examine you mean yeah so for example some of the lessons that

348
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:16,559
you've been saying that is you know watch watch the body watch the body you know feel the breath going to the body

349
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:23,920
like last lecture um so there's a there's a point at which that is very successful that is I can feel the breath

350
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:29,480
flowing through the body but to get to that I have to struggle with all that tension about getting into the breath

351
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:34,720
and all of that yeah so so I mean you're I mean you're welcome to do it your way

352
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:40,319
because eventually it seems to work no it it's kind of it's iffy sometimes it

353
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:47,960
works and sometimes it doesn't well then then maybe take the slow take the slow route um and uh when it does when it's

354
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:55,760
not working take a good look at that and something needs to something needs to be settled in you mhm and once that gets

355
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:01,280
settled then you seem to have some nice capacity to get concentrated that when

356
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:07,480
when the when the CH what's challenging settles then your capacity for concentration can come in

357
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:14,400
easier and when we're really settled and we're no longer mind's not bouncing around and wanting all kinds of things

358
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:21,640
there's a natural steadiness and subtleness of the Mind where the mind gets fairly concentrated like on the

359
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:28,480
breathing oh just the breathing wow and you you you're probably not

360
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:36,760
going to believe what I say but it can be one of the most Exquisite experience of life to just be right there coasting

361
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:43,079
riding on the on the breath coming and going and it isn't necessarily because the breath is such a great thing what's

362
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:48,920
the great thing is a mind that is in harmony a mind that's unified not

363
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:54,119
fractured fragmented not scattered the everything comes together the mind

364
00:44:54,119 --> 00:45:01,160
that's come together to be centered on one thing like the breathing can be

365
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:07,240
Exquisite but you you you don't go there directly because that's the cat will run

366
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:14,119
away you have to kind of learn this process slow process patient process

367
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:22,200
here this is what it's like here is fear here this so this is this is a way to

368
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:28,079
kind of try to convey to you to keep it really simple and and

369
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:35,520
um so um now we're going to do more complicated or it's easy to think it's

370
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:40,960
going to be complicated it's going to be like the almost like the raft and uh we're going to do a

371
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:50,559
meditation where I'm going to try to help you become more familiar with your own process of

372
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:57,839
thinking not everyone thinks the same way some people think more in images some people in words some people see

373
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:02,960
words when they think some people um uh

374
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:08,920
so there's all these different ways that people think and characteristics around the thinking and so kind of to learn the

375
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:14,440
map of what we can be present for in this simple way I'm talking about it

376
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:22,119
helps to have kind of had a survey it's like someone says you know like um you

377
00:46:22,119 --> 00:46:27,440
know just just go down down if you ever been to Redwood City just go downtown it's a small little place place not too

378
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:32,559
many streets just relax you have a good time and you never been there and you

379
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:38,680
find those alleys and this way and you get lost uh so some so someone says uh it's really easy but I'm going to go

380
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:43,920
with you the first day and show give give you a tour and then next time it's easy for

381
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:51,359
you so I'm going to give you a tour and hopefully then you can build on that to be easy for some of you what

382
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:58,079
we're going to do might be challenging the what you what you'll see in meeting yourself so just know that that's part

383
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:04,319
might be part of what's going to happen and if you feel like it's uh you it's too much for you you can open your eyes

384
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:12,119
and you know look at the ceiling or you know count how many people are in the room or something that uh you know you

385
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:20,040
know helps you settle again if that's the case okay so

386
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:27,559
um so take a your meditation posture

387
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:37,599
and if you're comfortable with closing your eyes close them if you prefer to

388
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:43,640
have them open maybe half open gazing down towards the

389
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:58,839
floor and as you exhale relaxing the belly

390
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:05,960
maybe like so the weight of your torso is

391
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:11,839
settles down to your waist and [Music]

392
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:19,839
lower the weight of your body settles onto your sitting bones

393
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:28,000
here feeling the contact with the chair and the floor

394
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:35,440
as a kind of definitive statement of recognizing you're where

395
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:43,319
you are where here is you're here exactly this spot

396
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:02,839
relaxing the shoulders letting the weight of the

397
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,920
shoulders settle towards the

398
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:25,520
floor relaxing in the face as if the muscles on your face can

399
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:32,160
fall away from the skull and be held gently by the

400
00:49:52,720 --> 00:50:00,720
skin maybe relaxing around the eyes relaxing the thinking mind behind the

401
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:08,000
eyes maybe softening in the mind

402
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:34,160
and then for the next little while you're allowed to

403
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:43,798
think and let yourself think but as you think know that you're

404
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:55,400
thinking kind of like you're you're sitting at a table someplace and person table next to you

405
00:50:55,400 --> 00:51:00,480
is talking to someone and you're just there listening hearing

406
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:04,040
their voice the tone of their

407
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:13,280
voice so allow yourself to think but just know that you're thinking here a

408
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,720
person thinking

409
00:51:47,319 --> 00:51:52,559
and then notice do you think more in [Music]

410
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:57,400
words or more in images

411
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:07,000
or a combination of

412
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:21,599
both or is your thinking more a form of emotional

413
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:27,200
processing almost as you think with your emotions

414
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:40,640
or is thinking a somatic experience

415
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:48,960
almost or maybe it's all of the above but how how would you characterize your

416
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,960
thinking

417
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:08,520
and as you're aware of your

418
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:18,799
thinking you have some relative sense of the speed of your thinking are you're thinking quickly a

419
00:53:18,799 --> 00:53:24,799
lot of thoughts in a hurry are you're thinking in a slow

420
00:53:24,799 --> 00:53:28,440
relaxed easy way

421
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:51,280
if there's an inner voice that thinks is it a loud voice or a soft voice

422
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:02,520
if there are images being

423
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:09,680
projected are they in color or black and white are

424
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:13,440
they fast or

425
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:27,039
slow are they imposing or they kind of at a distance

426
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:49,160
if you think in words have inner voice what's the tone of

427
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,040
voice that you use as you think

428
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:06,240
if you think in images is there a mood that comes along like mood music or

429
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:10,640
mood to the images

430
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:44,039
if there is a tone of voice or a mood just know it here this is what it's

431
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:53,520
like for these minutes it's okay to be this way just know it here like this

432
00:56:05,799 --> 00:56:14,400
and as you think either in words or images is there any emotion connected to

433
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:20,119
them any mood State of Mind

434
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:41,359
if there is an emotion is it feeding the

435
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:48,240
thinking or is it a consequence of what you're thinking

436
00:57:18,359 --> 00:57:24,359
and when you're thinking is there any tension anywhere in your body associated

437
00:57:24,359 --> 00:57:31,000
with that thinking tension the mind in the face shoulders

438
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:39,400
belly and if it is that's okay just know it here is tension

439
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:18,720
what's the energy level of your thinking is it high energy low

440
00:58:19,039 --> 00:58:24,680
energy is it agitated thinking or is it calm

441
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:30,400
thinking whatever whatever it is it's okay just know it here this is what it's

442
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,400
like

443
00:59:24,359 --> 00:59:31,000
are there any gaps between your thoughts are there times when you're not

444
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:39,880
thinking at the end of a sentence or an end of an image and if there's a

445
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:47,079
gap what should like that gap for you

446
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:53,720
here here without thoughts is like

447
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:59,039
this for

448
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:42,519
then as we

449
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:51,160
continue can you let go of your

450
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:58,640
thinking can you let there be a pause where the thinking stops for a few

451
01:01:10,359 --> 01:01:15,960
moments letting go of your thoughts and dropping into your

452
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:22,240
breathing letting go into your body breathing

453
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:47,000
and then we'll spend a few minutes just mindfulness of

454
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:57,520
breathing that's very simple just here inhale is like this

455
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:01,279
here exhale is like

456
01:02:24,839 --> 01:02:28,880
this for

457
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:14,720
and the final thing about

458
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:22,680
breathing is that some forms of thinking final things about thinking

459
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:27,920
Some forms of thinking are more on the the surface

460
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:35,119
mind the mind that's try helping us to survive and fight and

461
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:40,599
flight there's a different source for thinking that's not on the surface but

462
01:03:40,599 --> 01:03:48,839
deep inside the thinking that helps us to

463
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:56,599
thrive thinking that connected to Joy and love and care

464
01:03:56,599 --> 01:04:04,000
and generosity kindness

465
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:13,200
wisdom that's not about surviving it's about deep sense of

466
01:04:14,599 --> 01:04:22,039
well-being can you in these last few minutes of this sitting relax into your

467
01:04:22,039 --> 01:04:29,640
body see if your attention can drop down some place deep

468
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:35,920
within can you find a different place to think from a different Center for

469
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:40,200
thinking or reference point for

470
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:53,559
thinking where thinking feels more deep and calm

471
01:04:53,559 --> 01:05:01,359
and it's more likely to have your welfare in mind your care

472
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:35,079
can you recognize that you have maybe different ways of

473
01:05:35,079 --> 01:05:43,960
thinking some more agitated some more deep calm

474
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:04,880
and then to end this sitting to take a few long slow deep

475
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:12,720
breaths again feel connected to your body remember you're in this room with

476
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:17,960
other people and when you're ready you can

477
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:27,289
open your eyes [Music]

478
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:53,480
so probably not a lot of you have had a tour of your

479
01:06:53,559 --> 01:06:58,880
thinking so I don't know how well that worked for you but I'm curious to find

480
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:04,480
out what was what was most interesting for you were you able to follow enough

481
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:11,119
and find something that was eye openening or new or something that might be helpful

482
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:14,798
here any any of

483
01:07:24,359 --> 01:07:30,799
you um um initially there was a lot of resistance a lot of what a lot of

484
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:36,880
resistance like I did not want to go to my mind um and then eventually it just

485
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:43,039
kind of happened gradually and assigning the word here

486
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:50,920
there was like a different energy from when we did the first one it was bumming me out I did not like I did not enjoy

487
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:57,000
that I did not enjoy um you know sitting at that next table

488
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:03,079
watching my mind do its thing oh um you were annoyed by your mind I was bummed

489
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:09,039
up by it it was just making me very overwhelmed is it but was it was a different mind than you usually have or

490
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:15,359
just that it's the usual mind but you got to see it better yes I think that one oh

491
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:22,080
um and then it was kind of hard to go back into the body after yeah um that's

492
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:27,278
so I might have said this before but uh in very interesting exercise or way of

493
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:32,400
approaching the mind if if it's if it's a bummer of a mind that you you have at

494
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:39,080
least for now um uh IM imagine yourself that you're supposed to be the friend to that

495
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:46,159
mind and that you're sitting on a park bench and you're there to accept your friend who's having a hard time and

496
01:08:46,159 --> 01:08:51,400
you're just there to listen that's all and it's possible that bummer of a mind

497
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:58,440
has never really been listened to and maybe something different will happen if you listen not necessarily to

498
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:05,920
the words and the meaning and what they're trying to say but something deeper than that maybe listening to the

499
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:10,440
emotion behind it underneath

500
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:32,000
it this man over here

501
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:38,080
um yeah I don't like how my mind is either so you're not alone I don't like

502
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:44,480
how my mind is either um

503
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:51,318
uh I had trouble with the idea of thinking from not a surface

504
01:09:51,319 --> 01:09:58,600
place at the very end when I said that yeah I was like I don't know what that means yeah yeah of course that's that can

505
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:03,800
might it was I don't know what that feels like or what that is like I don't

506
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:09,400
I don't know how to I don't know what that is yeah it's kind of like someone opens he shows you a map of Redwood City

507
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:16,880
and it shows you oh look at there's a place I'd never never been wow someday maybe I'll go there so I just is a I

508
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:23,120
give you the map so there's there's other more to discover yeah but uh to not like your

509
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:29,679
mind is sad actually it's not that I don't like it I just don't like the images that pop up in my

510
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:35,520
mind oh so you don't like the content of the yeah I don't like the content of my mind so it's un or what I'm drawn to I

511
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:43,280
guess I should say okay that's interesting it's a little unfortunate I mean it's a little bit you know that we have that relationship but um uh this

512
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:49,520
practice is to see that and to hold it kindly and to be with it and something

513
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:55,840
mind begins to change if we don't participate and just go along the old habits

514
01:10:55,840 --> 01:11:00,920
and if and if we it changes because if we can hold it kindly in Awareness here

515
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:07,719
oh this is what it's like oh this is what it's like not to like those thoughts but let's let let's at least be

516
01:11:07,719 --> 01:11:13,800
present for it and then something begins to shift on you know you don't you don't have to be the one who changes things

517
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:21,040
the remember the cat comes if you don't try to make it

518
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:28,840
come yeah I had a very simar sort of experience um and probably my analogy

519
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:35,360
would be more like peeling back an onion so the surface thinking was these images of things things I have to do things

520
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:40,800
that are going on yada yada yada and then as we progress towards the end and

521
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:46,719
you went deeper there's certainly I think um tapping in very similar to you

522
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:52,320
with U Less thinking more emotion um sorry what more emotion more emotion so

523
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:58,520
was it was recognizing and um I I I'm a very visual person so it was

524
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:06,920
images that were uh evocative and I think with your guidance was

525
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:13,159
helpful in just being able to sit with them um certainly kind of feel them but

526
01:12:13,159 --> 01:12:18,360
I think experience them in a different way fantastic um and I think that that's

527
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:24,320
probably part of what's drawn me to this is as a way as a practice and as a way a

528
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:32,960
tool to go and visit some of those things that I um want to sit with and as you said

529
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:40,080
right sit next to arm around it and good very nice figure it out so the opportunity with

530
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:48,600
this practice is to be able to see all of who we are eventually to and hold all of it

531
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:53,920
in this the The Gaze The Gaze of mindfulness all of it in the Gaze of

532
01:12:53,920 --> 01:13:00,000
kindness um and see and visit places we've never sometimes ever seen and some of them it's going to be difficult

533
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:06,320
everyone's going to have difficulty that's we no no one's free of that have difficult Minds in some sense or other

534
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:12,040
but to be able to visit the difficult places but also visit the beautiful places and the good places and and to

535
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:17,280
find a radical different relationship to it all and the radical relationship of

536
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:24,440
of kind awareness just here this is how it is actually begin Shifting the territory dramatically it's like if you

537
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:32,159
have a ecosystem in introduce one new species the whole ecosystem changes and so the ecosystem here

538
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:38,320
changes radically with kindness or radical with just simple awareness because what it means is you're not

539
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:44,679
going along with business as usual and it makes room for something else to

540
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:52,639
happen so one of the you know so one of the one of the important parts of this

541
01:13:52,639 --> 01:14:00,360
of this learning this non-reactive awareness that just allows things to be in in the field of awareness is that uh we can

542
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:06,320
start being with what's difficult for us in a new way we don't have to fix it we don't have to run away from it we don't

543
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:13,840
have to feel shame about it we can just oh we can just be oh this is how it is now it's just now just here for now and

544
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:16,880
then something

545
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:28,280
shifts I had kind of a um I noticed a pattern in my mind that I've noticed before but my reaction to it was

546
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:35,120
different this time I was quite excited to notice it uh which is this pattern of kind of always looking for what I'm

547
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:40,679
missing or forgetting or doing wrong or what's going to happen that I don't want to

548
01:14:40,679 --> 01:14:46,280
happen but it was kind of cool to see it and not just to have some distance from

549
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:51,840
it not to go along with it automatically right but not go along with exactly um

550
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:58,199
so that was an interesting piece and and the deeper think to me made a huge difference because it allowed me to let

551
01:14:58,199 --> 01:15:05,159
go of that because it seemed to me that was very kind of surface level thinking uh and so that shift to me I don't know

552
01:15:05,159 --> 01:15:10,360
if I was truly thinking differently or I don't know deeper I'm not sure exactly

553
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:16,239
but it felt like I was able to let go of the scanning for problems great yeah so

554
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:22,679
I love I love what you said and what I hope is that um now you don't

555
01:15:22,679 --> 01:15:28,880
take it as given how you happen to be thinking some people don't think why

556
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:35,320
thinking that's thinking is just thinking and I just have to go along with it you know I have no choice mind just thinking and that's the way it is

557
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:43,360
but there actually there are lots of choices and there's different ways to think different um uh places to think

558
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:49,120
from in a sense and um and there's a choice to watch it rather than be it and

559
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:58,199
that makes all the difference so so let me oh one more yes

560
01:15:58,199 --> 01:16:07,280
thank you um the thing that I found most surprising was it's all verbal it's all words and

561
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:12,880
um when I had thoughts that weren't driven by

562
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:20,600
emotions just kind of useless meaning meaningless chatter that was just kind of went away and then when it was fed

563
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:26,679
like you said by emotions it had a different quality to it so was that was most surprising to see the difference

564
01:16:26,679 --> 01:16:34,320
between those two yeah so yeah good so it's possible to notice sometimes that emotions are feeding the the thinking

565
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:39,880
and sometimes the thoughts are so strong that they they're the ones that trigger

566
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:46,000
the emotions and I mean it's it's been said by psychologists one of the leading causes of depression is

567
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:52,639
rumination because we're saying all these things over and over again that if I say once to myself Gil you're a lousy

568
01:16:52,639 --> 01:16:58,000
guy I mean I can get away with that once but you know but it's I don't notice the

569
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:04,159
effect but if I start saying it you know 10 times an hour 10 times a minute G

570
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:10,400
you're really lousy you're I mean it's going to start wearing me down and it's bad news and it's undermining and I feel

571
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:17,800
discouraged and this must be true and and after a while no wonder I get depressed but that's the you know the

572
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:25,159
constant thing being said and so many people are stuck in these Loops of the same Stories the same thoughts and and

573
01:17:25,159 --> 01:17:32,040
uh it can be so that's where the example where the the thinking impacts the emotions and then

574
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:37,520
there's sometimes a a circle where who knows with chicken and

575
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:43,000
egg who knows where it started but uh it just kind of feeds itself and goes around and

576
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:50,000
around but there are other ways and one way that we have in mindfulness it kind of break breaks the Cycles by just

577
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:55,199
noticing it this here is a powerful thing it's so simple that some people

578
01:17:55,199 --> 01:18:02,800
think it's ridiculous but here you break the cycles of a lifetime and uh and it's something new

579
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:08,880
can happen so now I want to review a little bit all this because this emphasis on

580
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:14,360
thinking here can seem like this is this is the project now you know you're supposed to do this for yourself now

581
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:19,840
when you meditate in fact you know this is not supposed to be a big

582
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:26,760
project uh so the idea with this meditation is uh

583
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:33,120
find something that's your home base your home and I recommend the

584
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:40,120
breathing the breathing is a wonderful place for many people not for everyone to develop the mindfulness developing

585
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:46,800
more clarity of seeing develop the capacity to be with something allowing it to be as it is some days the

586
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:52,040
breathing feels good sometimes not good sometimes you're controlling it sometimes you're not controlling it

587
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:57,960
sometimes it's shallow sometimes it's deep we're trying to be just here with this

588
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:05,440
oh here this is what a controlled breathing feels like as opposed to oh no I can't meditate now I'm controlling

589
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:12,040
it no that's not the point the point is oh here this is what a controlled breathing is

590
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:18,520
like oh here it's a shallow breathing well it's a little bit embarrassing to have shallow breath in California after

591
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:25,040
all we have esin here and the humanistic Psychology was born here and it was all about deep you know deep you know know

592
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:30,840
cathartic breathing and and not having shallow breathing so I'm a Californian fail

593
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:38,199
failure no just it just shallow breathing and um I want to tell a story

594
01:19:38,199 --> 01:19:44,719
now take if I may side one this maybe kind of drives this kind of Simplicity Point home so I I I lived at San

595
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:49,960
Francisco Zen Center for many years and uh they had uh people could come there

596
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:55,360
as guests sometimes and so someone called up back when there was telephones

597
01:19:55,360 --> 01:20:02,600
and um and uh real telephones and um and uh I like to talk

598
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:09,960
to someone becoming a guest and the woman said well uh Robert the guest manager is not here now he'll call you

599
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:16,159
back uh Robert called the guy back but he wasn't home so he called later to for

600
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:22,239
Robert but then Robert wasn't in so he heard that Robert wasn't in he said uh

601
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:27,960
to the person at the Zen Center well I guess I it wasn't meant for me to

602
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:33,810
come and the person is enter said no it just means Robert's not

603
01:20:33,810 --> 01:20:42,199
[Laughter] here so shallow breathing it just means

604
01:20:42,199 --> 01:20:47,639
shallow breathing doesn't don't don't make a whole California thing about it

605
01:20:47,639 --> 01:20:52,880
or whatever and um so we start with the breathing and but breathing also is for

606
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:59,639
many people is a settling it's a comp you get composed it's relaxing to stay with a breath it's for some people it's

607
01:20:59,639 --> 01:21:05,600
a neutral place to be able to direct the see the attention we have is food

608
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:10,679
wherever we put our attention goes feeds with that thing so if attention's always

609
01:21:10,679 --> 01:21:17,040
going into our thinking that's what we feed so we're feeding something that Buddhism calls us very wholesome and

610
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:23,400
healthy which is mindfulness of breathing staying with the breath it it it takes some of the food away from the

611
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:29,600
thinking some of the food away from the tensions we hold and things begin to relax hopefully a little bit but so

612
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:36,800
breathing is a default but it's not just about the breathing uh if something else becomes

613
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:44,080
more compelling like really grabs your attention like you know we don't want to struggle between what wants our

614
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:49,480
attention and the breathing we just let go of the breathing and we go and take

615
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:54,760
bring our attention to this other thing oh he my knee hurts so here within with

616
01:21:54,760 --> 01:22:00,320
a painful knee here not liking a painful knee here

617
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:06,040
trying to figure out what to do here with this and after a while

618
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:13,520
maybe it's no longer so compelling and then we go back to the breathing and um and then something else

619
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:21,880
happens then maybe there's an emotion and maybe I'm sad and so then oh here sad this is what

620
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:29,239
sad is like and I feel the sad maybe and then I feel it in the body and then it's maybe it hasn't gone

621
01:22:29,239 --> 01:22:35,520
away but it's no longer so compelling and then we go back to breathing and the breathing is kind of a stabilizing Force

622
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:42,320
the rhythm of breathing it's calming it's stabilizing and it can help us from getting too too reactive or too caught

623
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:49,440
up in the different things so you probably don't want to stay too long with the pain or the sadness just uh

624
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:55,320
long enough to really feel like you've been there for it and then go back to the breathing because if you spend too

625
01:22:55,320 --> 01:23:01,360
much time with any one thing that's difficult or even some sometimes good um

626
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:07,440
sometimes the attitudes come in about it like we might not realize we're actually thinking about it rather than being

627
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:13,600
mindful of it we might be in it reacting to it participating in it fighting it or

628
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:19,679
something in a way that's not useful we don't even see it if we stay too long so

629
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:25,960
so come back to the breathing so the image uh that I have for this is set of a spider in a

630
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:31,800
spider's web the spider supposedly sits in the middle of the spider web and waits for something to happen elsewhere

631
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:38,760
in the web and then when something happens the Spider goes up to visit and see what's going on maybe eat

632
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:44,400
it so it's said unfortun of the image maybe and then and then the spider comes

633
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:49,920
back to the center and waits for the next thing to happen so we just sit at the breathing at the middle of our

634
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:55,520
mandala or web and then when something happens we go out so so thinking is just

635
01:23:55,520 --> 01:24:00,800
one more thing like that so if thinking is really the predominant thing you can't really sit and pay attention to

636
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:06,400
breathing be because thinking is so strong then just in relax way now now

637
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:13,600
you can do mindfulness of thinking and it can be very simple here thinking is happening this is what

638
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:21,719
thinking is like right now but now you have a little bit of the map so just saying here this is thinking might lead

639
01:24:21,719 --> 01:24:28,400
you to say oh here there's tense thinking here there is calm

640
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:34,520
thinking oh here there's frightened thinking here there's angry

641
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:39,800
thinking or here there is you know tension in the body around

642
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:47,480
thinking so so it isn't like you go investigating it's like a project but it's just like oh yeah now I see there's

643
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:55,400
more going on here there's more to thinking than just the words or the images or the ideas the stories

644
01:24:55,400 --> 01:25:01,199
and then because of how easy it is to be seduced by thoughts and people can

645
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:07,480
telling themselves thought saying oh this is really great not to be thinking

646
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:12,920
anymore not noticing that that was a thought so you want to kind of be a

647
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:18,520
little bit protected from that so just come back to the breathing and be there for a while so there's kind of a

648
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:25,040
hopefully a nice rhythm of being with the breath being aware of something else coming back to the breath

649
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:30,119
sometimes you stay with a breath for a long time you get concentrated sometimes you're not with a breath much because

650
01:25:30,119 --> 01:25:37,040
there's so much else going on um but now you have uh what we told taught so far a

651
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:42,320
kind of a range of kind of the the map of the things that you can be aware of

652
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:47,600
hopefully in a very simple way it's not meant to be a project it's not meant to be

653
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:55,840
analysis uh it's just meant to be recognizing what is and then one day you might have this

654
01:25:55,840 --> 01:26:00,880
wonderful discovery that for yourself you discover the difference between

655
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:06,320
thinking and thought Oh the mind just had a thought

656
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:13,000
and that's all it was one thought just a simple thought arose and it went wow look at

657
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:19,199
that it came and it went wow where did it go you don't have to go follow it

658
01:26:19,199 --> 01:26:27,800
don't go don't go looking for it just oh that was a that's what Gil talked about that was a thought I was a I'm now a

659
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:35,320
ther I was a thinker but now I'm a ther and U and it's kind of fun because

660
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:42,119
that when it's just a thought it's usually because the mind is pretty relaxed pretty calm pretty peaceful and

661
01:26:42,119 --> 01:26:47,199
and it's very clear that the thought is not a problem you could have the worst thought anybody in the world has ever

662
01:26:47,199 --> 01:26:53,320
had but as long as it just stays as a thought it comes and it goes it's not an

663
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:59,800
issue as we go along with this practice um thinking uh the nature of thinking

664
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:07,760
changes in many ways one of the ways is it gets thinner thinner and softer and people

665
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:13,960
talk about it like a veil that gets thinner and thinner and thinner and that almost almost till it becomes like a

666
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:20,080
cloud or evaporating Cloud it just as opposed to thoughts being so dense and

667
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:25,440
full some people who do this uh start be paying attention to all this Works can

668
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:31,320
notice that when they're calm their mind feels very kind of luminous or clear or

669
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:38,400
open or wide but if you uh if you get have a really good intense thought about like

670
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:44,800
locked into something and you and you say what and you start look at what's the mind like now that I'm locked in it

671
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:50,199
can feel like it's gotten dark or contracted or tight or small in the mind

672
01:27:50,199 --> 01:27:55,760
and that's fascinating just see the way the mind how your mind feels to you in

673
01:27:55,760 --> 01:28:01,639
different kinds of thinking you have all these all this knowledge and understanding of thinking that's more

674
01:28:01,639 --> 01:28:06,920
than just what the words you're thinking the images you have begins to break the

675
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:13,119
hegemony of the thoughts breaks the kind of the way we're in its power or caught

676
01:28:13,119 --> 01:28:18,159
by it or believe it automatically it break breaks the kind of into something

677
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:24,280
that's easier to handle easier to be with if there's a really a lot of of

678
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:31,080
repeated thinking uh a simple process I recommend notice your

679
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:37,000
thinking see what thoughts what emotions are underneath it are driving

680
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:44,320
it and then feel those emotions in your body and sometimes the what's most

681
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:52,040
important is the emotion sometimes thoughts are like the messenger it's like a signpost that says

682
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:57,440
hey over here I need you over over here but it's pointing to something it's not

683
01:28:57,440 --> 01:29:03,000
pointing to itself it's pointing to the emotion when there's a lot of intense

684
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:10,600
thinking a going on it's usually because we have some emotional need something inside needs our attention so it's a

685
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:15,960
it's so that's one of the ways to do this mindfulness of thinking is thinking

686
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:22,520
what's the emotion and now can I feel that in the body and now that I feeled my body can I

687
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:29,679
just breathe with it in the body and then the whole thing might become so much simpler to be with just being there

688
01:29:29,679 --> 01:29:35,400
with it so

689
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:43,080
um I hope that the the the lesson of

690
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:48,320
Simplicity came through today because I did there was a lot of

691
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:54,800
new ideas maybe for some of you to hear and um

692
01:29:54,800 --> 01:30:00,679
so I suggest you try it at home this kind of meditation and this is

693
01:30:00,679 --> 01:30:06,880
something you can do with thinking for example you can just do this and you know if there's a you know if you're

694
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:13,480
standing in line rather than kind of looking at wondering about what chocolate you should not

695
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:18,679
buy you might uh just oh this I'll just look at my thoughts and what's going on

696
01:30:18,679 --> 01:30:24,920
here get to know it better might be a lot of little occasions where you can do a little bit of Discovery what's your

697
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:31,600
thinking like like we did today and and what's it like just to let it be but let it be seen clearly and what would be

698
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:39,360
like to be a friend for your thinking mind sit on the bench and just listen to it and and attend to it and let it

699
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:44,840
finally be heard sometimes the thinking mind just no one's ever listens to

700
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:51,199
it so maybe you do see what happens but listen as a friend on the bench not as

701
01:30:51,199 --> 01:30:58,280
being it so thank you and um you Tom is here if

702
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:04,199
you want to ask questions of Tom I'm here if you want to stay and ask more questions or have some something that

703
01:31:04,199 --> 01:31:11,239
came up that you want to sh uh talk about and um nna is also up there in the

704
01:31:11,239 --> 01:31:16,960
back she is's also wise about the meditation practice and so you have more
