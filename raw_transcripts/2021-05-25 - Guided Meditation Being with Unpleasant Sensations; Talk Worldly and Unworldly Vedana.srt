1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,640
good evening good evening welcome welcome

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,360
such a wonderful thing to be able to practice together

3
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:22,800
it makes a difference chances are i wouldn't come here

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,240
to this room and uh just meditate by myself if i didn't know

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:35,360
that um there's a whole community of us whether you're listening to this live

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:42,879
or sometime later probably not before but later or there's something

7
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:49,920
kind of wonderful about the reaching across space and time together

8
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,800
so we'll start with a guided meditation

9
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,719
and just finding some balance in our seat

10
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:13,760
maybe that requires a little bit of rocking a little bit of adjustment

11
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:23,520
it's worthwhile to spend some time finding a place where there can be some

12
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,840
a brightness with some balance

13
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:50,240
and allowing the spine to be upright if you're sitting

14
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:59,600
for a lying down might consider this energetically but is there a way

15
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:07,239
in which we might imagine we were just very very gently

16
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:12,319
pulled up in a way that

17
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:18,239
is not stiff or contrived

18
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,599
but a way that introduces a little bit of space

19
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:29,599
and i want to use this word uprightness

20
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:36,800
maybe there's a better word but

21
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,040
the opposite of being collapsed

22
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,840
allowing the shoulders and arms to just

23
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,480
hang and then just feeling the body as a

24
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,920
whole the posture the geometric

25
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,840
shape we are in type of pyramid

26
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,840
we're sitting and knowing that we're sitting

27
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,040
and then we might feel the body breathing this

28
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,080
movements of the chest or the belly or

29
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,040
maybe feeling the air going in and out of the nose

30
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,240
can rest our awareness on those sensations

31
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:11,840
associated with breathing

32
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:41,360
feeling the in-breaths the out breaths and the transitions

33
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:53,840
between the breaths

34
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:56,560
it might be that while we are resting our attention

35
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:03,840
on the sensations of breathing

36
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,280
but there are some compelling bodily sensations

37
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,680
it's not uncommon in fact it's quite common

38
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:28,639
for there to be a little bit of uncomfortableness in the body in general

39
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:45,840
that's why we shift postures put on sweaters take off sweaters

40
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,720
we can rather than getting all tangled up with the uncomfortable sensation in

41
00:07:52,720 --> 00:08:02,319
the body you can use a simple label unpleasant

42
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,840
unpleasant

43
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,919
it turns out it makes a difference the tone

44
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,399
that we use when we make this label

45
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:51,120
that is whether it's evenly

46
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:57,680
or comes from a balanced even-mindedness unpleasant

47
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:05,680
or with it comes laced with a lot of aversion or hatred or

48
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:12,000
dang it get out of here go away type of a tone

49
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:24,000
can we label this much ease as is available to us

50
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:37,839
with this unpleasant sensation

51
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,760
it might not affect the unpleasantness

52
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,200
our labeling

53
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:58,080
but it can disrupt the momentum of all that might happen this aversion

54
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:04,959
to aversion to aversion to aversion this buildup of

55
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:10,560
repulsiveness or type of hatred

56
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:20,800
we can undermine that with a simple label unpleasant

57
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:32,000
without worrying about how it got there

58
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,360
what we're going to do next to make sure it never arises again

59
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:47,120
can we nip it in the bond all the thinking and planning and story making

60
00:10:47,120 --> 00:11:01,839
by just noticing unpleasant

61
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:37,360
if it feels overwhelming or it's too unpleasant by all means there's no need to stay

62
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,399
there with that practice it can be

63
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:50,240
really helpful to notice a neutral part of the body

64
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,800
the top part of the right leg maybe

65
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:15,680
near the left elbow maybe that's a neutral place

66
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:25,839
place with neutral sensations

67
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,839
uh

68
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:49,839
we're only labeling as a support

69
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:59,440
if it feels too much effort burdensome there's no need to do it

70
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:17,839
but it can be a way to work with some of the discomfort that arises in the body

71
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:13,360
and this way if we can label unpleasant bodily sensations as

72
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:21,039
unpleasant we might disrupt the momentum

73
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:28,080
of this unpleasantness that might lead to

74
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:35,200
ill-will or anger or all kinds of different expressions of

75
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:42,880
aversion which might cause harm for ourselves

76
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:50,159
and for others so in this way learning to

77
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:57,279
work with or be with unpleasant sensations not only supports our path to greater

78
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:04,000
freedom and greater ease but also helps protect others

79
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:11,279
from our angry our anger our

80
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:19,600
ill will or whatever might arise as a consequence of this unpleasant experience

81
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:37,840
so may all beings be happy and free

82
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:19,760
good evening welcome welcome good evening welcome morning good afternoon whatever

83
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,519
time of day it might be for you

84
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,279
so today i'd like to continue on this series of i've done this will be the third talk

85
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:38,480
and then two earlier talks on vedana often translated as feeling but

86
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:44,640
it's not really feeling because so often we associate emotions with feelings which

87
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,720
is perfectly natural thing to do but vedana is not about emotions

88
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:58,320
instead it's about the hedonic tone of our experience that is is it pleasant

89
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:04,720
is it unpleasant or neither pleasant nor unpleasant so these three options

90
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:12,399
pleasant unpleasant neutral so it's just this um the

91
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:18,240
feeling tone or the some people kind of say the flavor of

92
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:25,518
our experience chocolate vanilla strawberry pleasant unpleasant neutral

93
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:32,640
invading arises in response to physical experiences as well as mental

94
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:39,519
experiences so every single experience that we have every single sensation that we have has

95
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:48,159
this hedonic tone associated with it for example there might be

96
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:53,440
vedana of the body if we stub our toe there's some physical pain

97
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:59,519
and the vedana is unpleasant but there's also vedana in the mind

98
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:06,799
that is if somebody says something unpleasant about us the ear

99
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:11,919
is not in pain but the mind is so this is a mental vedanta that kind of like that

100
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:19,760
little bit of an ouch and in the satipatana which is the

101
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:27,519
discourse from the buddha or attributed to the buddha at least that is on establishing mindfulness and

102
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:33,120
there's these four sometimes called the four foundations of mindfulness the four

103
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:38,480
establishings of mindfulness and being mindful being mindful of

104
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:45,679
vedana is the second one body vedana mind and then dhammas phenomena we could

105
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:51,279
say and so in the satipatana suta this

106
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:57,360
discourse on the establishments of mindfulness the instructions aren't to practice with

107
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:02,720
noticing whether all the sensations are pleasant unpleasant or neutral

108
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:10,720
and then to notice whether they are worldly or unworldly

109
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:18,079
that is pleasant worldly and unworldly unpleasant worldly and unworldly and

110
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:23,358
neutral worldly and unworldly so what does this

111
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:28,398
mean worldly and unworldly it's a little bit unwieldy to say

112
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:34,079
unworldly repeatedly but so in pali these words

113
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:40,079
are samisa and niramisa and i think literally they would be

114
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:47,200
translated as of the flesh and not of the flesh so that is is it associated with the

115
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:55,440
body or not but that's not quite right it's not quite um accurate because

116
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:01,680
there can be mental sensations that are worldly so

117
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:07,920
of the flesh not of the flesh carnal versus spiritual as i've seen that way

118
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:15,839
translated or sometimes related to the senses or related to renunciation

119
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:22,480
leading to craving versus leading to freedom so these are all these different ways in which we might understand

120
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:29,200
this expression worldly or unworldly and an example might be that might be a

121
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:35,040
pleasant sensation from eating cookies i love eating cookies there's a this

122
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:41,040
pleasantness about the cookies and there's also this pleasantness of my

123
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:48,480
time from reading or hearing some of the verses in the tarikata that is these liberation poems

124
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,680
from these women at the time of the buddha when they had some awakening experience they

125
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:59,280
are some verses that are attributed to them in which they describe their awakening

126
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,480
beautiful beautiful verses and really inspiring and touching

127
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:11,680
from thousands of years ago these beautiful verses those are pleasant also

128
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:18,480
so eating cookies hearing these verses from the buddhist nuns about their liberating

129
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:26,240
experiences are both pleasant but they're not exactly the same

130
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:32,160
and part of being mindful evade and not paying attention to vedana is to discover and to learn

131
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:39,359
how are they different how do they feel similar they're both pleasant but

132
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:46,160
maybe a little bit different they lead in different directions

133
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,440
eating cookies might lead to eating more cookies and then some revulsion oh why

134
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:59,040
did i eat all those cookies whereas reflecting on or hearing these

135
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:06,880
poems from these early buddhist women in the tarikata can be inspiring and uplifting and

136
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:12,720
might support us to practice okay like rededicate ourselves to our meditation practice to

137
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:18,560
our buddhist practice or maybe we'll be encouraged to read a little bit more another poem

138
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:24,880
and feel like um there's an opening of our understanding and for me

139
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:30,560
often there's a softening of my heart and mind when i

140
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:38,079
read some of these verses so eating cookies goes in one direction

141
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:44,880
not so agreeable whereas reading these poems of the terry gotta goes in another direction more agreeable more supportive

142
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,960
for finding more and more freedom

143
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:56,720
and when we reflect on the experience these like the difference of

144
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:04,160
these experiences cookie eating inspiring poem reading we start to

145
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:11,760
notice and as i said get a little bit more familiarity with the how it feels and if we

146
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:19,760
contemplate or allow the mind to rest in the terrigata the poem readings

147
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:27,200
the mind becomes more familiar becomes more accustomed to that type of

148
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:33,839
pleasantness that type of pleasantness that leads to more freedom and supports our practice

149
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:41,280
and becoming more familiar with that it recognizes that

150
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:47,440
we can start to recognize when this sensation arises earlier and earlier in our experience

151
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:53,599
rather than it being full-blown experience so that is right at the very beginning of the

152
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:59,359
sensation the vedana is there the hedonic tone is there

153
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:04,960
and the more familiar we are with the pleasantness associated with cookie eating

154
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:12,400
versus pleasantness associated with inspiring reading

155
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:18,400
then the mind and the body can respond accordingly like oh i know that it's

156
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:24,960
more fulfilling more satisfying to be with inspiring poems

157
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,240
cookie eating not so satisfying in the the big picture right turns out not to

158
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:35,760
be such a great thing but the more the mind and the body just

159
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:42,960
become really familiar with just that that first

160
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:49,680
taste of the hedonic tone then we can work with it while it's still

161
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:56,480
weak it hasn't been like a full-blown it's not after we've eaten 10 cookies or it's not after

162
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:02,000
we've been reading poems for hours and perhaps we should

163
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,079
have been doing something else or but we can more familiar we are with it the more we can recognize it at

164
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:14,240
earlier stance and then we can respond in a way that supports our practice

165
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:21,440
and of course it's not just pleasant vedana that's worldly and unworldly

166
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,640
but also unpleasant vedana that's worldly and unworthy and it can be

167
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:34,400
really helpful to be able to recognize when that's happening and to

168
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:42,079
when we notice that there's unpleasant vedana that's worldly that is this

169
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:50,720
maidana that's associated with a version or this um something that's

170
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:56,000
unhelpful then we can stop

171
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,280
going cultivating that or going that direction because that can only lead to something

172
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:06,800
that's not wholesome and we know about kusala akusala

173
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,880
wholesome unwholesome skillful and skillful and a big part of practice is to

174
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:20,240
cultivate the arising of the skillful and the diminishment of the unskillful so this is one way in

175
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:25,920
which we can do that is practicing at the level of vedana

176
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:33,599
and so part of the way in how this works or what's associated with

177
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:39,760
the hedonic tone are these underlying tendencies you might have

178
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:46,480
heard of these greed hatred and delusion these underlying tendencies because

179
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:52,560
they're we're not conscious of them it's not something that we are actively choosing to do

180
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:59,760
but it's a tendency to react with sensations a particular way it won't be surprising

181
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,838
that pleasant vedana

182
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:11,200
often activates the underlying tendency of greed desire lust those types of thing

183
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:18,400
unpleasant vadena activates aversion repulsion hatred

184
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:26,240
and neutral vedana activates ignorance or delusion and for me what's

185
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:32,000
interesting about this is also what so they get activated when

186
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,440
we have pleasant unpleasant neutral sensations

187
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:44,560
if we're not paying attention they just lead right into these underlying tendencies get manifest

188
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:50,400
as some forms of greed hatred or delusion but for me what's interesting also is

189
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:56,160
that whether there's greed hatred or delusion in the mind

190
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:02,160
makes it more likely that the the reaction that we will have to whatever

191
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:10,960
sensation we're having will be greed hatred or delusion that is if there's a lot of greed in the mind

192
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:16,960
than something that's just mildly pleasant we're more apt to have some strong greed associated

193
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:23,440
with it so there's this feedback loop that goes and it can build and build and build

194
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:31,760
so just being aware oh yeah this is unpleasant this is pleasant can kind of

195
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:41,839
undermine or subvert this building of this snowball of greed hatred or delusion

196
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:48,480
so just being aware of these underlying tendencies even after the fact if we aren't aware at

197
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:53,920
that moment it can be helpful just because as i had said a number of times it interrupts

198
00:43:53,920 --> 00:44:00,720
this momentum and this making of the big this big snowball

199
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:08,400
because sometimes we do unskillful things all of us and we are very good

200
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:15,359
at explaining to ourselves and everybody else why we had to do it and these big deep

201
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:22,000
reasons behind what we did but actually what pushes us to do

202
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:29,359
unskillful things is vedana the vedanan does the initial pushing and

203
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:34,560
then there's the rationalization that happens afterwards often we don't see that it

204
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:42,640
happens so quickly there's this unpleasantness and then we just say no to this or

205
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:47,280
no to that and then we come up with all these reasons why

206
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:54,560
but if we can notice that some of the vedana the

207
00:44:54,560 --> 00:45:01,680
tone the feeling tone pleasant unpleasant or neutral then it can make it less

208
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:07,520
likely that we will just fall under this way of greed hatred

209
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:14,560
and delusion desire repulsion ignorance

210
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:24,640
an example is that we might say oh i i didn't i didn't get angry because she we might

211
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:31,680
realize oh i see i didn't get it wasn't so much that i was angry about what this person said i was

212
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:39,040
actually angry because i was having unpleasant bodily sensations and there was just all this aversion

213
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:44,400
and then i just reacted in a particular way and i blamed it on what they said but it

214
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:51,599
wasn't i realized yeah if i was feeling more comfortable i wouldn't have had the same reaction

215
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:58,640
i think most of us are familiar with this this idea of being angry hungry and angry uncomfortable in

216
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:05,200
the body leads to our being angry and just recognize this recognizing this

217
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:11,040
can be sobering it can be see how important it is for us to be

218
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:18,079
aware of the feeling tone that's happening in our moment-to-moment experience

219
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:25,839
because it ends up affecting so much so as part of the benefits of

220
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:31,280
why we would practice with vedana is to aid to under mine or stop the momentum of these

221
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:37,440
snowballs to gain greater clarity into some of the actions why we want to do this

222
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:43,920
it's also an easy way to disentangle any complexity that we might have especially in daily

223
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:49,440
life when we don't have this maybe the

224
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:54,839
focus or the awareness on exactly what's happening so we might be able to say oh yeah this is

225
00:46:54,839 --> 00:47:01,440
unpleasant but i i've mentioned this and it's

226
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:07,839
the earlier two talks but i'd also like to add this um quote from nyanaponakatera

227
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:16,160
who's one of the the i don't know what word to use

228
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:21,599
one of the ancestors that doesn't sound quite right one of the founders somebody a

229
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:27,680
predominant person that's kind of at the beginning of this the mindfulness practice in tervada in

230
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:33,920
the west and he writes if we permit the three

231
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:41,119
roots of greed hatred and delusion to take firm hold in our hearts then their outgrowths will

232
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:49,760
spread far and wide like a jungle creeper like there's a plants that just grow

233
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:57,359
and like a jungle creeper suffocating much healthy and noble growth all around

234
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:02,960
it creates the conditions for unethical behavior it creates the conditions for us to say

235
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:08,559
and do things that might cause harm to ourselves or to others

236
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:15,280
so if we can be aware of the vedin as a way in which we can prevent that from happening

237
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:22,800
and another benefit for practicing with vedina is because

238
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:31,040
this phenomenon which psychologists called my side bias

239
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:38,079
i learned about this from pico anglio this my side bias which means that we always

240
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:47,040
assume that our views are correct and others views are wrong and any information that comes

241
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:54,720
in i manipulate in such a way that it confirms that my views are right and

242
00:48:54,720 --> 00:49:01,520
anybody who disagrees with me their views are wrong and the underlying cause for this

243
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:07,079
actually is because there's a pleasant sensation

244
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:12,640
associated that i'm right and everybody's wrong it's a little bit of this pleasantness

245
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:20,160
of i'm right and people hold on to that pleasantness and hold on to their views and get

246
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:25,920
pretty dogged in their views and we all know this suffering

247
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:32,160
that can happen when there's a this real clinging to views and even though there's all kinds of information that

248
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:39,359
comes in that says these views or are not accurate unable people are unable to let go of

249
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:46,880
them it comes back down to vedana this pleasant feeling tone this feeling of

250
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:51,280
i have it right everybody else has it wrong

251
00:49:52,559 --> 00:50:00,880
and so working with vedina gives us the tools in which we can learn to have views hold views

252
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:08,400
without clinging to them without holding on to them in a way that is unskillful and unhelpful and causes harm

253
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,520
to others

254
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:21,520
and as i mentioned in some of the earlier talks of course working with vedina um also just in general it helps that

255
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:28,880
there's more freedom vedana and the dependent arising is associated with um

256
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:33,520
craving and then craving it leads to dukkha

257
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:41,760
so i want to talk just a little bit how might one work with vedana i had

258
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:48,559
been mentioning just noticing in our pleasant sorry in our present moment experience

259
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:55,119
is it pleasant unpleasant or neutral but it's really helpful to have some familiarity

260
00:50:55,119 --> 00:51:02,400
with this so that it becomes really quick in the mind so one way to do this is to do a body

261
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:07,520
scan and to initially just scan from top to bottom

262
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:13,359
looking for pleasant sensations just noticing the pleasant ones

263
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:20,160
and then noticing the unpleasant ones and then noticing the neutral ones

264
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:27,200
the ones that aren't pleasant or unpleasant and then do a body scan in which each

265
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:33,200
sensation just labeling it pleasant unpleasant or neutral after you have some more familiarity

266
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:40,720
after having done it then there's this more recognition or sensitivity to it

267
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:47,920
so that's four different body scans and then opening it up so

268
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:56,480
to any feeling whether or not it's felt in the body so including sounds or thoughts

269
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:04,480
and then maybe i'll mention that we don't have to always be labeling it pleasant unpleasant neutral that might be helpful

270
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:11,040
in the beginning in the first few body scans or maybe when we're just starting this practice

271
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:18,000
but then just you using labeling just feels tiring and burdensome

272
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:26,319
so instead there can just be this recognition this flash in the mind ah yes pleasant

273
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:33,200
neutral unpleasant without actually using the words

274
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:40,800
so this hedonic tone vedana is always present

275
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:47,839
i'm getting present and pleasant is always present it's not always pleasant it is

276
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:54,880
always present though and the point is to be able to readily recognize it

277
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:03,200
so a natural question that comes up well what about this neutral vedana this

278
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:09,599
neutral feeling tone how do we work with it what is it i think most of us

279
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:17,839
probably recognize pleasant and unpleasant but i'd like to talk a little bit more about neutral

280
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:26,400
i would say that due to their bland nature they are the most difficult to

281
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:32,160
notice to pay attention to to contemplate to be aware of

282
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:39,920
but to notice them can be really supportive of our practice one

283
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:47,680
is we might notice how we tend to dramatize or

284
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:53,359
exaggerate um neutral feelings i don't know if it exaggerates the right

285
00:53:53,359 --> 00:54:00,559
word dramatize we tend to make it into something other than neutral

286
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:06,000
just so that it's easier to be with and or so that it satisfies

287
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,280
this need to be entertained or

288
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:18,720
need to be engaged in some way when there's this blandness often the mind just

289
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:26,800
starts to dart wherever it can to find something that's more interesting and exciting

290
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:33,599
so we want to quickly shift to something and we want to overlay our likes and

291
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:39,520
dislikes so this is good that's not good but when something's neutral we don't

292
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:45,920
have that this habit of liking or unliking we don't get to express it

293
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:53,280
but to learn how we are often dramatizing our experiences

294
00:54:53,280 --> 00:55:02,160
and that it's completely unnecessary we don't need to do that in fact a lot of harm can happen from it

295
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:07,599
it can be really powerful just to see this this natural inclination it's a

296
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:15,280
perfectly human thing to do but if we can not do that

297
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:21,839
and allow there to be bland experiences

298
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:29,040
and that to be okay then we can say that our life can unfold

299
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:36,319
with less drama less problems more ease more spaciousness if we allow ourselves

300
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:40,960
to linger and notice with the blandness

301
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:50,319
and as i was pointing to neutral experiences don't really support our sense of self

302
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:57,760
that is the sense of like oh i like this or i don't like this

303
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:04,480
mutual experiences don't you know we're not for them or against them so they don't really do anything for us so they

304
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:14,319
don't bolster our sense of self i'm the person who doesn't like this or i'm the person who needs that

305
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:19,680
but it can be really helpful the more

306
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:26,319
experience we have with there not being a strong sense of self i like this i don't like

307
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:32,079
this as a obvious way a sense of self gets expressed

308
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:40,559
the more familiarity the more comfort we have with not propping up this sense of self

309
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:45,839
the easier it is to find freedom

310
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:51,920
because freedom is when there's not a sense of self the highest freedom the greatest freedom is when there is

311
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:58,559
not a sense of self so any softening any moving in that

312
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:04,000
direction is a movement towards freedom

313
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:10,640
and so the more that we can gain familiarity with that or rest in that or and by abide

314
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:16,400
in just the blandness without any drama i'm using the word

315
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:22,480
drama there might be some better words without trying to make it more exciting

316
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:28,079
trying to make it more relevant to ourselves and our stories

317
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:36,079
can be really supportive and then neutral experiences if we

318
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:43,760
don't pay attention to them then we might have this mistaken idea that there's this

319
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:50,240
neutral bland experience that's the background to everything else

320
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:57,440
and this neutral bland thing is permanent while pleasant and unpleasant

321
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:02,520
are impermanent so if we don't pay attention to the neutral

322
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:09,040
experiences they might kind of like all merge into this background

323
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:14,480
this stage and then we might start to feel like oh yeah there's this

324
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:20,480
permanentness in which pleasant and unpleasant are arising and

325
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:28,798
passing away but everything's impermanent everything

326
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:35,119
and so our noticing neutral experiences and practicing with them we

327
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:42,240
might start we might start to see oh yeah a neutral and maybe it shades into unpleasant

328
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:49,920
so it's no longer neutral or maybe it shades into pleasant or maybe it just goes away

329
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:55,359
so to notice the impermanence of neutral experiences

330
00:58:55,359 --> 00:59:00,559
mutual vedina can be really powerful can help create the conditions

331
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:06,160
for us to see impermanence more thoroughly which creates the conditions for us to

332
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:15,599
let go more thoroughly which creates the conditions for more freedom peace and ease

333
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:22,640
so in this way working with vedina in so many ways can help lead to more

334
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:31,280
freedom by interrupting this kind of snowball effect of unpleasantness leads us to

335
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:39,280
fill our mind with uh aversion repulsion um hatred which then

336
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:46,319
can feed on itself and that we might do unskillful things or harmful things

337
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:52,960
which is duca of course right so if we can nip that in the bud earlier then we can find more and more

338
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:58,559
freedom so working with vade in a pleasant

339
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:03,760
unpleasant neutral something we don't often talk about but

340
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:09,359
is immensely powerful it can help simplify our experience and

341
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:15,839
can help bring greater ease to all our experiences

342
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:23,200
so may you find freedom amidst pleasant experiences unpleasant

343
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:34,160
experiences and neutral experiences thank you
