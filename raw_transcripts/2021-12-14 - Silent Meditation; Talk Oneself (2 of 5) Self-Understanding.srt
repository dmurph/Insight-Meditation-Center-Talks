1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:03,840
so this morning i'm continuing on the

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,359
topic of

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,000
oneself

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,559
that each person

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,679
is the person responsible

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,240
for their own practice

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,039
the buddha said

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,560
i only point the way

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,400
it's up to you

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,119
to make the effort

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,160
and there's a

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,399
our agency our involvement our

13
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,120
engagement with practice

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,800
is

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,800
an important part

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,879
of important ingredient

17
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,960
in walking the path of liberation

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,559
and classically i think the path was

19
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,000
you know back in the ancient world was a

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,600
path you walk on

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,840
which means we have to we bring all of

22
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,039
ourselves

23
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,399
to the path

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,000
and so

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,040
one of the important ways that we

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,920
bring ourselves

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,040
is to know ourselves

28
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,479
is to meet ourselves

29
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:15,680
to

30
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,360
and the way of meeting ourselves a way

31
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,600
of knowing ourselves

32
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,400
it needs to be done with care

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,840
and i like i love the idea of

34
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,720
hospitality think i talked about it

35
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,560
yesterday that

36
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,880
when we offer hospitality

37
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,560
it's an offering it's a gift it's

38
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,280
something we have agency in our doing

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,280
you don't just sit stay in bed all day

40
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,159
and

41
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,720
play host to the people in your house

42
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,200
you're engaged in caring for them and

43
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,720
serving them and

44
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,240
whatever it takes when you're when

45
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,479
you're the host

46
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,039
and um

47
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,360
the um

48
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,040
um

49
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,479
and there's also a kind of uh

50
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,960
putting aside of our own

51
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,920
desires for ourselves not completely

52
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,479
but there is a deference or there is a

53
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,440
letting go of self-concern to a

54
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,879
healthy degree

55
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,520
in being a host for other people

56
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,959
that they're very different if you're

57
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,560
living alone and you just do whatever

58
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,920
you want and

59
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,520
and you don't have to take in anybody

60
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,080
else into account

61
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,760
so uh

62
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,120
to be a host for oneself

63
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,319
uh the host within the host is a

64
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,680
saying in zen zen

65
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,080
to be a host to have a great house a

66
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,200
hospital and hospitable environment for

67
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,640
oneself

68
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,200
so for to do that we have agency we have

69
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,120
to engage in some way

70
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,879
and one of the ways we have to engage is

71
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,840
to show up to be

72
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,840
present and the other is that we also

73
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,440
have to get out of the way our

74
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,760
selfishness has no place when we're

75
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,840
being a host for ourselves

76
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,840
if we're caught up in our desires and

77
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,159
our wishes are passed in the future

78
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,920
so we can't really offer this

79
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,159
hospitality to ourselves

80
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,080
then um

81
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,400
you know there's no practice we get lost

82
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,560
in that world

83
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,599
um

84
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,040
and

85
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,560
but to have hospitality towards oneself

86
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,720
is a kind of letting go of self-concern

87
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,840
self-preoccupation in order to meet

88
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,599
what's there to be the host for what's

89
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,519
here

90
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,120
and one of the crucial things that we're

91
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,360
trying to be the host for

92
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,080
is is to understand ourselves to have

93
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,319
self-understanding

94
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,840
and

95
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,799
and to have it but to have the

96
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:41,760
the

97
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,159
discovery of ourselves the understanding

98
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,519
of ourselves

99
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,280
come from this hospitality where we're

100
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,280
also learning to let go

101
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,920
of selfishness in the process to be

102
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,280
selfish you can't really be a host

103
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,680
and so self-understanding

104
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,439
is a is a is uh

105
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,480
aided

106
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,959
by things like meditation by things like

107
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,400
mindfulness

108
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,280
where we're awakening our capacity to be

109
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,560
attentive

110
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,879
to what's happening within us

111
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,400
what's happening here

112
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,000
sound of course is not limited to

113
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,639
ourselves but this is kind of the seat

114
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,600
the uh

115
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,280
the beginning place often time in

116
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,280
meditation and buddhism

117
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,919
is to understand oneself

118
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,199
and what are we understanding when we

119
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,800
understand ourselves

120
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,360
we're understanding things that are

121
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,759
unique to ourselves

122
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,160
that we are contributing to our lives we

123
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,680
are doing

124
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,880
that are

125
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,080
healthy

126
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,720
and things that are unhealthy

127
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,320
we begin seeing how much we're

128
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,919
distracted

129
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,000
and all distractions

130
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,960
involve some degree of attachment

131
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,880
and so if we can become have

132
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,840
understanding about how attachment works

133
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,479
and recognize it when it's there

134
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,680
then we and we play host to that

135
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,280
what happens to our involvement with

136
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,639
attachment

137
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,520
chances are if part of who we are

138
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,840
is the host

139
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,240
that part is not

140
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,479
involved with the attachment and there

141
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,240
starts to be space for the attachment

142
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,680
there starts to be some degree of

143
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,000
non-involvement with it some degree of

144
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,560
clarity and seeing it for what it is

145
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,919
and perhaps on some idea that um

146
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,120
you know i don't believe in the

147
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,039
attachment anymore this is not where i

148
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,560
want to be it's not where i want to put

149
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,080
my life energy

150
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,479
into these attachments

151
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,080
and that's not a critique of them it's

152
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,360
not an

153
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,840
aversion to them but it's a wisdom that

154
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,919
comes from self-understanding

155
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,720
but this is not where i want to be

156
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,360
and so there's uh but i'm the host so

157
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,759
there's more opening up more kind of

158
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,280
letting go

159
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,520
and to the degree to which attachment is

160
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,160
closely connected to selfishness

161
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,000
self-preoccupation and self-centeredness

162
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,639
the as we let go of attachment

163
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,120
selfishness and self-centeredness fall

164
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,919
away and paradoxically

165
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,800
we become more self-aware but less

166
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,319
self-centered

167
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,440
more self-aware but less bounded

168
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,479
by definitions of who we are

169
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,639
trying to prove who we are or hold on to

170
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,960
who we are

171
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,880
and so we begin looking

172
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,639
self-understanding turning inward and

173
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,080
understanding

174
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,720
um how does desires work for us when am

175
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,120
i caught up in desires

176
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,639
how do aversions uh work for me and then

177
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,319
to understand that and how do i caught

178
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,199
in the grip of those

179
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,080
do i spend a lot of time in in stories

180
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,400
do i live my life in stories

181
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,960
do i live my life in opinions

182
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,880
in what's right and wrong

183
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,120
do i live my life in

184
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,960
judgments

185
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,520
and to really see this

186
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,800
and self-understanding leads to wisdom

187
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,520
and

188
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,160
one of the maybe a little bit

189
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,520
um

190
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,240
unfortunate

191
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,160
aspects of all this

192
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,919
is that wisdom comes from familiarity

193
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,479
that a lot of the wisdoms we see over

194
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,840
and over and over again we sit down to

195
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,319
meditate be mindful in our life and we

196
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,680
say over and over again oh there's the

197
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,520
desire well i had no idea i was living

198
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,440
in stories all this time

199
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,120
i had no idea

200
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,520
that i was i'm so judgmental i'm judging

201
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,440
every little thing that goes on

202
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,039
i had no idea that i'm living and

203
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,280
planning mind all the time

204
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,800
i had no idea that i'm so

205
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,319
self-referential in my thinking

206
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,160
and by seeing that over and over and

207
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,599
over again

208
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,680
something begins to shift

209
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,840
we tend not to be mesmerized or

210
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,599
enchanted with those thoughts and those

211
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,639
activities we start having wisdom about

212
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,960
this is not the place to live

213
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,360
i'm not wisdom about not being committed

214
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,639
to it not being so interested in anymore

215
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,599
the wisdom that lets us see it clearly

216
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,919
and know an alternative

217
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,520
and the alternative that i'm suggesting

218
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,599
today is to be the host

219
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,879
to be hospitable

220
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,680
have hospitality for the stranger

221
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,560
so even this parts are strange about you

222
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,319
maybe your selfishness maybe your

223
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,240
attachments maybe your

224
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,919
story making your opinions your

225
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,639
self-righteousness your

226
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,840
fears

227
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,879
your

228
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,680
and also what's beautiful about yourself

229
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,080
okay here let's hold that in a

230
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,039
hospitable way

231
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,800
not to condone it

232
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,039
not to accept it in some way like oh

233
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,200
this is good and i have to just let it

234
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,159
be

235
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,839
but a kind of way to

236
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,560
speak space and open up

237
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,279
so it's kind of like a stranger who

238
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,160
comes into your home in a cold rainy day

239
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,600
and shivering

240
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,720
and the end is has no attention to you

241
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,279
and is self-concerned with her cold and

242
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,560
their wetness

243
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,279
and as the host you put them by the fire

244
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,440
you give them a warm blanket you bring

245
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,040
them warm tea

246
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,360
and and and this stranger begins to

247
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,000
relax and warm up and it turns out that

248
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,560
as they relax more that the stranger

249
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,839
becomes a

250
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,760
wonderful person

251
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,680
so the same way with what's difficult

252
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,800
and challenging within ourselves

253
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,399
just to know it to have the

254
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,800
self-understanding of there it is

255
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,560
and to have the self-understanding to

256
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,279
know how to be the host

257
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,440
and how to hold it

258
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,760
not exactly in acceptance but with

259
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,640
hospitality without conflict

260
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,200
so that it can relax

261
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,600
and perhaps all

262
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,959
attachments

263
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:47,760
all

264
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,399
selfishness self-centeredness

265
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,200
all

266
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,200
greed and hatred

267
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,680
is just a stranger

268
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,240
that needs the chance to relax

269
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,760
to warm up

270
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,880
and so

271
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,640
and to thaw

272
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,880
and some of these things when they relax

273
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,800
and thaw

274
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,640
turn into something else

275
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,320
something that may be a surprise

276
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,160
so an important part of

277
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,839
this buddhist practice of ours is

278
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,200
self-understanding and

279
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,880
so yesterday that topic was self-respect

280
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,079
and

281
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:24,800
and

282
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,000
and

283
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,120
so to always meet ourselves with respect

284
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,560
always to cultivate respect and part of

285
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,279
cultivating respect is cultivating

286
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,920
and to be able to be a host to be able

287
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,519
to hospitality

288
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,200
to be able to prioritize

289
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,760
self-understanding

290
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,720
over

291
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,040
self-preoccupation

292
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,040
over

293
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,880
spinning or spinning along with our

294
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,399
attachments

295
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,000
is a

296
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,200
engenders respect oh i can see

297
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,880
i can understand

298
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,120
i can be the host here

299
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,240
and so as we have more respect we can

300
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,800
have more capacity to

301
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,480
look at ourselves to be present to

302
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,360
understand to be the host that makes

303
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,920
more respect which supports more this

304
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,920
capacity to be present

305
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,120
be here

306
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,360
and be fully here

307
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,800
in a way that

308
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,200
allows for greater understanding

309
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,440
and at some point this grows

310
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,240
so that there is the self-understanding

311
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,399
the self part falls away

312
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,640
and um and we just

313
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,800
live mindful and aware

314
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,320
with awareness and understanding

315
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,880
available for wherever it's needed

316
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,320
whether it's within or without

317
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,720
so self-understanding

318
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,600
so

319
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,560
you are definitely

320
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,880
worthy

321
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,600
of hospitality you're definitely worthy

322
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,600
of understanding and seeing and knowing

323
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,120
and to do it in a simplest possible way

324
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,440
maybe without analysis and

325
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,079
a lot of thinking

326
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,240
a lot of thinking about yourself is more

327
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,399
attachment so what we're talking about

328
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,959
here is not thinking about ourselves but

329
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,680
really almost like a silent presence

330
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,920
that sees and recognizes

331
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,720
oh

332
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,399
that's what's happening i'm thinking a

333
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,240
lot

334
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,480
and then we're host to that so we can

335
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,320
write some something about the thinking

336
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,839
mind can relax and settle

337
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,279
so um

338
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,240
thank you

339
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,839
and um

340
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,480
i look forward to sitting again tomorrow

341
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,639
in silence with all of you and

342
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,680
and continuing on this topic
