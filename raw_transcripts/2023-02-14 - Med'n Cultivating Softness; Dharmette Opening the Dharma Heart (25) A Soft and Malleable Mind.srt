1
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:09,540
greetings everyone I'm going to begin with an announcement

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:15,660
that yesterday we discovered that the 7 A.M teachings for this week were double

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:22,859
booked on YouTube so starting today IMC will stream them both

4
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:29,939
and I'll teach from seven o'clock to 7 45 and Matthew brinsilver will teach at

5
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:38,059
this same YouTube link one hour later from 8 to 8 45 Pacific time

6
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,800
so the theme for this week is opening the Dharma heart

7
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:53,760
and we are exploring five wholesome qualities that the Buddha used to determine if

8
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,440
someone was ready to have the Deep Insight that leads to enlightenment

9
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:09,299
so as you know in meditation we're training the mind and it's really up to us to become our

10
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:15,240
own teacher little by little we learn how to let go

11
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,820
of unwholesome qualities and to cultivate beautiful qualities

12
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:28,140
of the heart and mind so to begin again we'll start

13
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:37,460
by exploring our intention what motivates you to meditate

14
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:48,659
the Buddha encouraged his followers to practice both for their own benefit and

15
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:54,000
for the benefit of others so if your intention includes altruism

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,380
as well as improving things for yourself it will be all the more powerful

17
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:08,060
so take a moment now to articulate your deepest wish

18
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:28,680
and assuming your meditation posture see if you can lengthen the spine

19
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,720
gently stretching the base of the spine down towards the Earth

20
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:42,540
and carefully balancing the head on top of the spine so that energy can flow from you

21
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:50,000
through your body from Heaven to Earth and back

22
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,260
letting the eyes close gently

23
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,560
and now doing a quick scan from the head down through the Torso

24
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:16,739
relaxing the shoulders arms hands

25
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:22,379
relaxing the belly hips legs

26
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:29,819
and feet and softening the muscles of the face

27
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:35,480
in the forehead around the eyes

28
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:44,900
the lips and softening the contact of the jaw

29
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:54,680
take a long slow deep breath letting go of tensions wherever you can

30
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,599
because even minor bodily tensions can create blockages in the mind

31
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:07,500
inhibiting our freedom so it's worthwhile to get to take time

32
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:14,280
to get to know these areas of tension and find ways to release them sometimes

33
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:21,199
it might take years to release a particular knot foreign

34
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:29,400
to really relax something that's very tight maybe it's possible to soften around the

35
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,759
edges

36
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:48,258
so here we are the miracle of being here in this spot

37
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,759
and breathing together with a supportive Sangha from all over

38
00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:00,960
the world letting your breath nourish you

39
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,220
and everyone here

40
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,620
now as we did yesterday bring to mind a benefactor

41
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:19,500
someone who instantly brings you gladness when you're in their presence

42
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,620
it could be another human it could be a pet that you know they care about your

43
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,800
well-being just as you care for theirs

44
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:39,840
looking into each other's eyes you both smile in your own way

45
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,840
enjoying the warmth that you share together

46
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:51,840
so wishing for your benefactor may you be safe

47
00:05:51,840 --> 00:06:00,020
and protected may be happy

48
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:05,900
peaceful and free

49
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:13,500
and as you offer your wishes to them you can feel that they fervently wish the

50
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:19,320
same for you so you can light a little candle of

51
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,500
friendliness in each other's hearts

52
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:33,620
in the company of your benefactor you know that you're in a safe space

53
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:40,400
and now we resolve to leave all your preoccupations

54
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:47,880
worries concerns outside the door for the remainder of this meditation to

55
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:54,500
the best you can and if you wish you can pick them up on the way out

56
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:04,280
or the rest of this meditation we will endeavor to stay here

57
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:10,139
in the present moment with a warm heart

58
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:15,500
ready for whatever arises

59
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:25,340
bringing our attention to the breath as our friendly anchor

60
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,139
and exploring the whole cycle of the breath

61
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:40,860
letting it light up with the attention of our mindfulness which is operating in a context of warm

62
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,400
friendliness

63
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:58,220
receiving the breath with a mind that's soft and open

64
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:09,319
and letting each in-breath and out breath reveal itself to you

65
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:39,060
is there anything Pleasant in the felt sensations of breathing

66
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:50,120
if so feel free to relax into them and enjoy even a small feeling of goodness

67
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:02,660
it's really quite incredible to actually be sitting here reading together

68
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:55,260
I love the idea of kindfulness which is a word coined by ajan Abram

69
00:09:55,260 --> 00:10:00,420
so it's mindfulness that is imbued with

70
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,139
benevolence

71
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:12,779
breathing in radiating kindfulness

72
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:19,019
breathing out radiating mindfulness

73
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,899
foreign

74
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,100
foreign

75
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,180
thank you

76
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:06,740
only in birth radiating kindfulness inside

77
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:15,420
on the out breath radiating kindfulness to all beings

78
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,959
everywhere

79
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:30,720
if the mind is wandering somewhere in the past or the future

80
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,120
first of all bringing the smile okay

81
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:43,560
this is what Minds tend to do but for this meditation practice

82
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:49,680
I'm going to come back to being here in this body carefully

83
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:56,720
kindfully attending to the cycle of the breath

84
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:10,380
staying close and soft with the felt sensations of the breath

85
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,380
foreign

86
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:29,220
foreign foreign foreign

87
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,960
foreign

88
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,140
foreign

89
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,020
foreign

90
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,260
foreign

91
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,240
foreign

92
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:33,659
foreign

93
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,240
foreign

94
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:42,120
we might want to or have to appreciate

95
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:47,000
the gift that is breathing

96
00:24:51,299 --> 00:25:01,220
and perhaps enjoying carefully unwrapping this gift

97
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:06,440
in order to be with our breathing

98
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:24,980
breathing in radiating kindfulness inside

99
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:33,980
breathing out radiating kindfulness to all beings

100
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:45,419
the gift of breathing becomes even more of a gift

101
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:50,419
if it is imbued with kindfulness

102
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,620
question

103
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:45,320
foreign

104
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,880
of this sitting through the goodness of this practice

105
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,400
may we from our Center of softness

106
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:08,100
and guidefulness now gently radiate

107
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:16,278
our heartfelt wish that all beings everywhere be safe

108
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,720
may all beings be happy

109
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:30,980
peaceful and free

110
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,620
foreign

111
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:22,250
[Music]

112
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:56,159
I'm happy to be here with you all and I'll repeat the announcement I made

113
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:01,260
at the beginning of the sit um for those of you who are just arriving

114
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:06,360
that yesterday uh at IMC we discovered that the morning teachings for this week

115
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:13,799
had been double booked and uh so starting today IMC

116
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:19,500
um we'll be streaming both of them I'll continue teaching at this time

117
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:26,940
and if you're looking for Matthew Brent silver you'll find him on the same link an hour later so

118
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:32,480
uh he'll be there uh teaching uh

119
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:40,340
his meditation at eight o'clock and his little darmet at 8 30 Pacific time

120
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:50,039
so the theme for this week is opening the Dharma heart

121
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:57,179
and to be honest I have never seen the expression Dharma heart anywhere in the

122
00:31:57,179 --> 00:32:05,600
Pali Canon but these texts do often speak of opening the Dharma eye

123
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:11,640
and the Dharma eye is opened when one has the Deep insights

124
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,980
that then give rise to Awakening

125
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:23,220
so in the in the early texts there are a number of Stories of the Buddha teaching

126
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:28,740
and the person listening becomes enlightened right then and there

127
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:35,039
but this doesn't work for just anyone well it has to be ready

128
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:41,520
and the text of the Brahma yusu which I talked about yesterday gives five

129
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:46,740
qualities of mind that are necessary for awakening

130
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:52,640
in Pali these qualities are called Kala mudu

131
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:58,820
varana and pasana

132
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:04,640
and Paulie is a highly polycemic language

133
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:11,279
polysemic means um a word that often has a number of quite different meanings

134
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:17,519
which is uh great for poets but it's difficult for translators because if

135
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:23,519
you're translating you have to discern uh which meaning is meant uh in that

136
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:29,159
context and in this particular group of the five

137
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:35,899
wholesome qualities of mind they're more like variations on a theme

138
00:33:35,899 --> 00:33:42,620
rather than five clearly distinct elements foreign

139
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:49,019
Ty we talked about yesterday was receptivity getting ready and available

140
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:58,080
to wake up and that includes having the mental Fitness necessary to accomplish the goal

141
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,140
you're not going to run a marathon and start your training uh two days before

142
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:09,019
it's you know it requires preparation

143
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:22,618
and foreign Ty also includes the Nuance of a mind

144
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:29,220
that is pliant and that brings us to the second quality which we'll take up today

145
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:36,960
and the poly word for this is mudu which is often translated as soft mind

146
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:43,500
a mind that is malleable the root mood

147
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:49,040
actually means both soft and happy

148
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:56,940
and the softness of Moodle also includes being receptive just like what we saw

149
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:06,420
yesterday being flexible and pliable the commentary explains uh mudu as being

150
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:13,220
free of the defilements of fixed views and conceit

151
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:21,359
when I was 15 my father said to me if it weren't for you we'd have a happy family

152
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:27,920
foreign not only physical abuse but

153
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:34,140
psychological abuse as well and the model from my father was being

154
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:42,599
quick to anger quick to criticism and I learned to be judgmental

155
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:52,760
and the reason I share this with you is that it took me decades to learn to become a bit less judgmental

156
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:59,099
and for me if I wanted to cultivate a beautiful mind that was soft and

157
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:05,099
malleable this tendency to pass judgment all the time was one of the first things I

158
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:08,119
needed to let go of

159
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:15,599
and I learned that being judgmental has a lot to do with being opinionated and

160
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,280
having fixed views as well

161
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:27,119
yesterday I talked about walking this path as a process of emptying

162
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:34,740
uh that which is unwholesome and I've seen in myself that

163
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:42,180
what's sometimes underlies conceit is trying to overcompensate for a deep

164
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:46,338
feeling of not being Worthy

165
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:53,160
so I might look like a lion trying to reject an image of strength but really

166
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:59,640
I'm just a little tiny Mouse pushing around a big cardboard lion

167
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:04,519
to try to fool everybody that I'm strong

168
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:15,359
and probably what you know is most uh

169
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:22,260
arduous is emptying the mind of conceit and as you may know in the Buddhist

170
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:29,520
texts conceit is not just thinking you're Superior to others but it's any way that you compare yourself with

171
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:37,200
others so all that comparing I'm better than I'm worse than not as good as or

172
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:45,980
just as good as and you get to a point where you realize that this is taking me nowhere

173
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:52,800
so emptying the mind of thinking that somehow we have to measure up

174
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:59,280
and this um Fetter of conceit is one of the ten

175
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:05,900
Vetters that we need to completely uproot on the path to Awakening

176
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:15,079
emptying the mind of needing to be somebody ordering to exist

177
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:25,140
so from my experience cultivating a soft malleable mind

178
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:35,160
seeing the futility the unskillfulness of clinging to my opinions and comparing

179
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:42,839
myself with others and this Begins the gradual training of

180
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:48,660
seeing these beautiful Tendencies start to arise these I mean these unskillful Tendencies

181
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:56,180
excuse me you see that something like this uh being judgmental or uh some kind of

182
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:03,140
comparison is starting to arise and you can nip it in the bud

183
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:12,240
but um and you can say ah I see you needing to

184
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:17,880
be somebody no thank you not going there or

185
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:24,920
um oh dear boy this sounds so judgmental and then let's not go there

186
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:31,260
so if we really want to cultivate a soft

187
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:38,460
mind it's up to each of us to find out where our sharp edges are

188
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:46,200
and once we recognized and learned where we tend to be sharp rather than soft

189
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:51,720
we need strong mindfulness practice so that we can nip these unskillful

190
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:56,480
tendencies in the bud before we do any harm

191
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:05,520
and um I'm thinking that a fertile field in

192
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:14,359
which we might cultivate a soft and malleable mind is by practicing right speech

193
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:24,720
that before I say anything at all it has to satisfy the following criteria

194
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:31,500
it has to be true it has to be useful or helpful

195
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:40,320
it has to be kind and the tone must be soft and gentle

196
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:46,700
and it must be at the right time for the person receiving it

197
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:55,680
and if any one of those criteria is not fulfilled then it's better to keep silence

198
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:02,339
so that right there is a is a very strong uh

199
00:41:02,339 --> 00:41:10,680
uh it's a it's a practice that can evolve over a

200
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:17,460
long long time we first of all have to learn to be less

201
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:23,460
impulsive and to not speak as as soon as we want to say something and to catch

202
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:29,960
ourselves before the reactivity is already sent the words out

203
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:40,140
so the federal of conceit

204
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:44,660
and not needing to prove oneself

205
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:53,339
has been a big one for me and also when I see the tendency to be judgmental

206
00:41:53,339 --> 00:41:58,380
uh of myself and judgmental of others

207
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:03,540
you know for a long time I saw how unskillful that was I and but yet it

208
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:09,500
kept happening you know so at some point um

209
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:14,760
we need to really see that this is this is not

210
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:21,680
something that we want to keep doing and and this is where uh mindfulness is our very best friend

211
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:28,320
so the more that we can cultivate mindfulness in every moment of the day

212
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:35,460
not just in meditation the better chance we'll have of avoiding

213
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:40,560
unskillful Behavior which keeps us trapped

214
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,160
foreign

215
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:53,760
like a little homework practice for the next 24 hours you might try investigating where your

216
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:59,819
sharp edges your prickly is prickliness is

217
00:42:59,819 --> 00:43:06,599
and also what would be in the most skillful ways for you to soften them

218
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:12,119
and if you have a Dharma buddy or a good friend that you feel that you can

219
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:17,819
confide in it might be interesting to to share what you learn about yourself

220
00:43:17,819 --> 00:43:24,480
in terms of where those hard edges are and your ideas about how you might

221
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:29,700
soften them so

222
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:38,280
yesterday we cultivated receptivity a day we're cultivating softness

223
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:45,920
and malleability in the mind thank you for your attention
