1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:11,719
so uh so welcome folks um yeah I'm glad um we can be together

2
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:17,439
this evening so

3
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:24,960
um yeah I'll talk about um this uh this moment or how how it's

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,720
um yeah how it how it plays out in my heart for whatever that's worth

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,960
but um but let's sit let's remember

6
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:45,920
um what hasn't changed about this practice even today day like this

7
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:21,438
so maybe um you begin just

8
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:30,439
uh kind of um gently uh massage

9
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:38,520
M some part of your body it might be as simple as your thumb and your index finger

10
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:48,320
gently rubbing against each other might be a hand to your uh your

11
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:56,399
belly face or just a gentle massage

12
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,399
for leg

13
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:10,600
just uh anchor anchor to the subtle pleasantness of that sensation

14
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:53,400
and maybe the the warmth of that uh

15
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,840
Sensation that kind of expression of uh

16
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,360
care sensitivity to your own

17
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,879
body maybe that warmth the warmth of the

18
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:18,360
S just kind of ripples out thaws

19
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:24,040
out whatever may be braced or

20
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,760
Frozen for

21
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,720
and breathe

22
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:46,440
sensing uh your your breath expanding your belly

23
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:51,960
up into your shoulders the effects of your breathing

24
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,800
on your the back of your

25
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,639
body

26
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,680
e e

27
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:31,560
we sort of En liven our body and Al livening it uh

28
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:47,599
makes more room to uh to feel our way through this

29
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,560
moment e

30
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:05,599
I'm there's a certain kind of eerie calm that's uh settled over

31
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:17,319
people but when that um frozenness thaws

32
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:25,280
out it's actually just some clarity and calm left

33
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:46,560
and so maybe it feels natural just to let the Mind

34
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,040
get very

35
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:05,560
vast maybe we say recognize

36
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
fastness

37
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
for

38
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

39
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,279
e e

40
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:51,079
you uh don't need to uh create the

41
00:11:52,760 --> 00:12:00,160
vastness doesn't depend on whatever you call

42
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,160
me

43
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:36,560
a sense that uh we arise within space we

44
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,000
arise as space

45
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,680
don't fight the solidity within

46
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:30,079
space certain zones of density body or feeling

47
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:42,079
don't need to melt that down into space

48
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,079
stay

49
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
open

50
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

51
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,040
e for

52
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:42,759
maybe it sounds remote in this moment but we can experience ourselves as a kind of

53
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:50,920
gust of wind the world is a gust of

54
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:03,759
wind and when those guts meet there's a very

55
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,000
subtle kind of

56
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,600
collision when those two gusts

57
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,959
meet it's called

58
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,920
love for

59
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:08,520
so maybe we attune to love in some way to the the poignancy of of

60
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:26,319
life it's almost like we're massaged by

61
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
that

62
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

63
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

64
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,760
e e

65
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:52,640
maybe there's uh other things arising maybe there's

66
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,640
fear Rising

67
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,559
grief or

68
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:18,000
anger that's all good but uh give it

69
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:26,679
back to love kind of arose out

70
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:31,559
of love and give it

71
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:36,200
back give it

72
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
back

73
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

74
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

75
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

76
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

77
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

78
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

79
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

80
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

81
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

82
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

83
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

84
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

85
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
e

86
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,158
e e

87
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:50,880
okay um yeah it's good to uh it's good to

88
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:57,080
practice with you um yeah you know it's like I don't

89
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:04,519
know I didn't know what I would guide or what I would say or something and it's just like uh yeah we got to find find

90
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:11,880
our practice um

91
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:18,960
so no matter um yeah how you're you're feeling I

92
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:26,840
think it's it's good that uh that we're here uh together

93
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:33,600
now me meaning it's a time for uh for Spiritual friendship

94
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:39,360
K and um it seems like something more

95
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:45,919
has to happen than just feeling kind of bad

96
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:51,440
together but I I don't think so it's actually enough for right now at least

97
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:58,480
that that is enough and kalana

98
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:05,200
that doesn't mean we all have the same views this is not a political action committee If This Were a different

99
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:13,519
election I would be saying different things uh but uh given the the what was

100
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:21,279
kind of that we're really yeah uh voting on Greed hate and

101
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:28,279
delusion that makes it a special moment I don't assume we're all all

102
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:33,440
United by ideology but we are united by

103
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:42,760
a certain orientation to suffering we are united by knowing the danger of greed

104
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:49,679
hate and delusion we're United by our wish to

105
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:55,799
alleviate suffering in self another and that's

106
00:30:55,799 --> 00:31:04,639
kalana that's enough that's enough now of course I'd I'd love

107
00:31:04,639 --> 00:31:10,240
to say that um everything will be

108
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,759
okay but cannot because it

109
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:23,559
won't but something will be okay and something very

110
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:33,440
important I I've been tracking my mind mind carefully um in the last 24 hours

111
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:41,279
you know partially just for my own well-being and practice and Clarity partially so I

112
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:48,720
could teach so I could say something Michelle uh Michelle McDonald

113
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:55,360
um said uh said the line between things being all right and things being very

114
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:00,519
bad is thin and the thinness of that

115
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:06,840
line is called a Nicha

116
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:16,639
uncertainty years ago a student said to me I think I don't know maybe it's from

117
00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:23,919
the 12 step tradition but um they said to me something like we teach from our scars

118
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:29,240
not our wounds and that's very good advice you

119
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:34,639
know uh I he it I don't want to spill my

120
00:32:34,639 --> 00:32:40,720
pain on you I don't want to enlist you in some

121
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:48,760
uh way in which I'm working out my own Karma but sometimes you just got to show

122
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:58,039
up you know and uh there's certain kind of freshness in sensing the unprocessed

123
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:05,799
pain speaking from it so I I've cycled through a kind of

124
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:14,639
range of Mind States um shock even though I knew it was like

125
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:20,440
in my mind 6040 or something like that so there's no whatever happens there

126
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:27,480
shouldn't be a shock but it's a shock and it takes time for the mind to catch

127
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:33,760
up with anicha you know to catch

128
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:40,480
up and so uh we are sensitive to the kind of

129
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:49,159
cool or cold Frozen you know just a little static that buffers us from

130
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:55,760
contact with Body Mind Dharma it's been cynicism you know like

131
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:04,600
just like oh my goodness we're just you know a terribly designed

132
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:09,878
animal given the challenges of being human given the challenges of living

133
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:16,560
with other Human animals just not welld designed you

134
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:23,079
know and then there's been energies of just like sort of laying down you know

135
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:30,000
kind of like uh sort of like an animal that knows it's the end or

136
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:39,200
something and there's been a certain kind of relief you know like no more waiting for the biopsy I know the

137
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,919
results okay malignant now

138
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:53,000
what and of course a kind of cascade of grief you

139
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:00,680
know just like uh this is what we do to each

140
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,480
other the heart um is designed for love

141
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:15,800
and designed to um to be uh to be broken

142
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:23,880
um and uh again Michelle I I call on her these

143
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:30,079
moments you know think one time she said something like like the near enemy of

144
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:37,200
meta is na the near enemy of of meta loving

145
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:42,320
kindness is na yeah

146
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:48,400
well our love just became a little less

147
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:59,078
naive and groundlessness as we know can make us uh love or or hate

148
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:07,160
beautiful line from Mother Teresa you know uh may God break your hearts may

149
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:14,400
God break my heart so completely that the whole world Falls in I God break my

150
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,599
heart so completely that the very beautiful line I went to her website and

151
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:25,760
there's like a whole page on her website that says like stuff Mother Teresa

152
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:32,160
didn't say that was on there that was like at the

153
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:40,160
top but I want to give her credit for it even if that's just a meme on

154
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:51,079
Twitter that's a good line there's a there's a grief that's uh

155
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:57,680
debilitating and uh and a grief that's that sweetens you know that

156
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:06,520
that's that's the opposite of navite so um Leonard Cohen's song uh I I

157
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:12,280
greet you from the other side of sorrow and despair with a love so vast and

158
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:18,839
shattered it'll reach you everywhere I sing this for the captain whose ship has not been built for the

159
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:26,400
mother in confusion her cradle still unfilled for the heart with no companion for the soul

160
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:33,280
with no King for the Prima ballerina who cannot dance to anything I greet you

161
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:40,240
from the other side in

162
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:47,440
the successive breakings of the heart

163
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:57,559
um there's there is more and more light that gets in I do know that

164
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:06,280
and I've been trying to to sort of sort through the elements of my pain that

165
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:13,400
arise Crystal Clear Pristine from

166
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:21,960
love there's love binds us to a certain measure of

167
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:29,440
pain but I want to distinguish that from the pain of my own

168
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:35,880
righteousness or aversion or vindictiveness or lack of

169
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:42,480
Courage I want to I want to be Discerning I kind of uh we become

170
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:48,920
connoisseurs of our own pain and

171
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:57,880
uh and those threads of the pain that um involve the

172
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:05,880
purity of uh love and care we don't have to do anything about those

173
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:15,720
threads one of the um the effects of of practice I it's we don't talk about so

174
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:20,880
much but it's been so so prominent to me is it just

175
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:27,920
I I I just think about my life much less you know my life as an object you know

176
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,800
know and it's not like I'm trying to be a good Buddhist or ignore myself or be

177
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:39,680
selfless or something like that it's just just doesn't arise so

178
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:47,000
much but I think about others a lot and sometimes it seems to me I think about

179
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,960
unknown others in the same entangled way I used to think about

180
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:59,359
myself like my you know kind of the ways in which

181
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:06,800
the energy of the self system have been freed up to flow outwards into the

182
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:13,000
world um it still holds a kind of trace

183
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:22,160
of the same slightly entangled forms of care that I would

184
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:27,599
before practice direct towards myself and it's like okay what what

185
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:34,440
Matthew is like a mature differentiated way of

186
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:44,160
caring you know comprehend Dua the Buddha

187
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:49,319
says comprehend Dua suffering what what

188
00:40:49,319 --> 00:40:57,839
on Earth did he mean what did he mean I want to know what

189
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:03,599
Illusions you know what Illusions must perish in order to truly

190
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:10,559
take in the enormity of the this truth of

191
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:18,280
dukka what to do with the power one has

192
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:25,560
what does love ask of us and how to

193
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:33,760
refine or relation ship to helplessness how to refine

194
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:40,280
that is there a way to keep

195
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:46,359
uh your heart from collapsing even on the other side of

196
00:41:46,359 --> 00:41:55,760
your power is that possible we explore that together

197
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:04,359
and I wondered you know is the Dharma the same on a day like this or is it

198
00:42:04,359 --> 00:42:10,119
different it's been a perennial question for me there have been a lot of days

199
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:15,440
like this is it the same or different to say

200
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:21,520
it's the same feels cold and misat tuned and like a a

201
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:27,800
lack of empathic courage right and I really want

202
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:34,280
to give deep permission to feel your pain and mine

203
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:40,640
and I don't want a Leap Frog into a kind of fake brittle

204
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:48,079
equinity but to say that it's different forgets all the

205
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:54,920
things love has already seen all the upheavals the dharma's

206
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:01,119
already observed and so we probably need to ask the

207
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:09,680
question of ourselves how is the path the same and how has it

208
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,000
changed what's

209
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:22,240
deepened on Monday night I had the thought there might only be one consolation for a

210
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:27,960
day like this and for me for me for my heart

211
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:37,880
and it was the sense that a a Harris Victory might have induced a certain sense of moral complacency in

212
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:45,280
me you know and uh shinzen yangang said that you know

213
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:50,920
don't get stuck in a good place in practice don't get stuck in a

214
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:58,119
good place and I I don't know say I'm stuck still growing and practicing in

215
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:03,640
heart very alive but um there's some deeper

216
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:12,000
expression of care that uh needs to be born I don't know exactly what shape

217
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:22,839
that takes but um it it sort of crystallized in the the

218
00:44:22,839 --> 00:44:28,119
phrase that I want my whole life

219
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:31,880
to be a nonviolent

220
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:48,920
protest so I offer this uh for your consideration and uh take whatever is of

221
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:57,880
value leave the rest behind will um keep going quite um

222
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:04,040
grateful to uh know the Dharma to know

223
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:12,160
you to be together practice okay
