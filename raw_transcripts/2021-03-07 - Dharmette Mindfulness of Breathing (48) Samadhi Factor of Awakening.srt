1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,679
so the topic of today is the samadhi

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:06,799
factor of awakening

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,519
and

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,440
tomorrow's topic monday will be

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,360
equanimity

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,920
and we are one day behind because of the

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,760
technological glitch that happened on

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,320
tuesday

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,000
and um we will

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,119
um and then

11
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,439
for the youtube we'll be back meeting

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:32,880
again at 7 00 a.m

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,320
california time tomorrow

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,480
so samadhi is uh commonly translated as

15
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,120
concentration in english

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,719
the the prolific translator

17
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,840
tanissero tunisirobiku

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,960
an american who lives in san diego

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,359
he um translates it as serenity

20
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,600
and so it's a very different feeling

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,640
between

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,760
concentration and serenity

23
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,600
when it's translated as serenity it then

24
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,200
raises the question how's that different

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,680
than tranquility

26
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,920
the fact of awakening that's listed just

27
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,960
before

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,600
samadhi

29
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,439
and i see that um

30
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,200
that samadhi is characterized by

31
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,040
stillness

32
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,360
serenity for me is characterized so i

33
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,320
don't know if the english

34
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,079
english word serenity and tranquility

35
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,600
are maybe

36
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,640
almost complete synonyms of each other

37
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,720
but if you look at the pali words the

38
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,560
ancient language words

39
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,560
that um pasadi the word for

40
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,960
tranquility i think has more of a

41
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,079
connotations of

42
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,439
brightness of

43
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,320
of a kind of a bright quality a soft

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,600
quality

45
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,799
a very light feeling the body can feel

46
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,840
very light and soft when there's

47
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,479
tranquility

48
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,840
whereas in samadhi the

49
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,800
the the when the primary characteristic

50
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,239
could be more a stillness than samadhi

51
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,400
there's a very of deep stillness things

52
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,319
have gotten very still

53
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,680
the greater the samadhi the more

54
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,680
stillness there is

55
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,480
and um and also with with somebody it's

56
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,200
a very clear

57
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,120
the stillness of it this sometimes can

58
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,360
feel very strong

59
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,959
there's a strength can be a strength to

60
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,400
it at times

61
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,959
and the mind has is not destructible

62
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,040
mind won't wander away at all just

63
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,879
it's like the mind is kind of sometimes

64
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,480
there's a feeling people describe as

65
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:46,800
being

66
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,599
locked in in samadhi it's so strong and

67
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:50,800
the stillness was

68
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,760
boom we're locked in and then the mind's

69
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,360
not going to move anywhere

70
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,080
into anything whereas in a tranquility

71
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,720
the mind

72
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,959
very tranquil and peaceful but it's not

73
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,400
really 100

74
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,599
still maybe i associate um

75
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,720
tranquility as i did mentioned yesterday

76
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,760
about with

77
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,360
a quiet very peaceful morning lake

78
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,080
completely placid and still not a ripple

79
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,440
of wind on it

80
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,080
and um and the morning you know the

81
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,760
morning light is just very clear and

82
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,640
bright and still

83
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,440
very stillness in the air the birds

84
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,120
haven't come out yet

85
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,239
and um and so this but this body of

86
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,319
water it's very flat

87
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,440
and um and so

88
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,120
so tranquility is you know

89
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,040
it's kind of like a body of water and i

90
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,400
associate it with

91
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,239
much more with the body than the mind

92
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,560
somehow

93
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,400
and then um in samadhi

94
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,159
um at least for me it is it's uh it can

95
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,280
be very embodied

96
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,799
feeling that comes with it but it's much

97
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:01,840
more like

98
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,480
the stillness of the mind there it's not

99
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,080
like a body of water

100
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,840
but it's more like the stillness of

101
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,319
space

102
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,599
and then where there's

103
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,680
you know everything is still in in space

104
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,720
space in and of itself is stillness

105
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,600
uh kind of and uh and there's but

106
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,000
there's

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
space like if you look up at the scott

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,960
knight at the sky you know space has no

109
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,639
boundaries it

110
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,759
goes on forever it's you can you don't

111
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,160
you can say that space is soft i guess

112
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,199
but

113
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,960
you know it's not a quality that has

114
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,680
softness or lightness as part of it

115
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,440
it's more porous or just

116
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,639
it's the openness or something so the my

117
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,479
and i associate samadhi a little bit

118
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,560
more with the mind becoming still

119
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,880
and porous open has no boundaries to it

120
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,240
and um but you know definitely it's

121
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,160
landed it's here

122
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,759
and then it landed here and then

123
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,919
sometimes the place sense of a landing

124
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,600
place disappears

125
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,120
it's just here but with this openness

126
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,320
kind of an openness and it's not exactly

127
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,120
embodied

128
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,880
body sometimes disappears in deep

129
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,360
samadhi

130
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,280
so the primary function of samadhi

131
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,560
one of the primary functions of

132
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,400
tranquility here is to support samadhi

133
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,520
and so when the body is tranquil

134
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,000
it really supports the mind to become

135
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,120
stiller

136
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,280
it's kind of like if you try to land

137
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,400
that

138
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,560
you know drone on top of a moving train

139
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,240
that's going along fast

140
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,680
it's you know it's a little hard but if

141
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,360
the train stops

142
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,800
then you can land it on the roof of the

143
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,400
train perhaps

144
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,080
so the same thing if you try to land in

145
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,240
a body that's all agitated

146
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,639
it's hard for the mind to land and be

147
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,960
here

148
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,840
so that tranquility supports it creates

149
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,639
a nice home and nourishment and support

150
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,080
for this to be settled to be

151
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,160
settled on our experience more than

152
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,759
being focused on our experience

153
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,199
the idea of of focus in samadhi

154
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,960
sometimes this idea of one pointedness

155
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,160
maybe that's a good metaphor a good good

156
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,240
for some people that really works today

157
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,919
okay i'm really going to be focused one

158
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,520
pointed on something

159
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,840
but i think of it this this so-called

160
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,280
one-pointedness

161
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,080
as a gathering together so all of

162
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,800
ourselves

163
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,560
are all of us is centered on something

164
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,680
it's being centered on the breathing

165
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,280
and so uh rather than being one pointed

166
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,479
with the mind

167
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,720
it's coming to rest at the center point

168
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,120
of the concentric circles of our life

169
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,280
and we're just really right here so with

170
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,960
the breath completely with a breath for

171
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,160
example if the

172
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,400
focus is the breath but there's more

173
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,360
feeling of

174
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,000
being centered on it than it is being

175
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,599
focused on it at least that's how it is

176
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,840
for me

177
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,120
the buddha said that the nourishment

178
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,319
for samadhi

179
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,120
is serenity and the word there now is

180
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,240
samatha

181
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,880
so it's not the same word as samadhi but

182
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,960
samatha in particular has that i

183
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,880
in my rudimentary understanding of

184
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,160
poly etymology is that it's um

185
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,039
even closer to the city of stillness of

186
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:35,840
landings

187
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,840
stan taking a stand where we're really

188
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,440
still and quiet

189
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,360
so it so it's a kind of serenity of

190
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,520
stillness not the serenity of us

191
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,560
of of softness and lightness

192
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,479
and so the nourishment of samadhi is

193
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,639
is stillness and that means that uh

194
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,479
to be nourish yourself with stillness

195
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,840
so to notice the places where the you

196
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,400
are still where there is stillness

197
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,879
and um and perhaps that's within

198
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,599
there's a woman nearby a local woman who

199
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,120
wrote a

200
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,120
compose this she's a mindfulness teacher

201
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,440
and she did a little cd for children

202
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,720
called the still

203
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,120
quiet place within i love that little

204
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,080
title

205
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,759
the still quiet place within and so to

206
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,320
uh to recognize and find a place of

207
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,599
stillness

208
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,719
but not that we're being held still or

209
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,039
kind of a trapped being still but

210
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,959
something that actually feels nourishing

211
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:44,880
it feels wholesome

212
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,760
and if you're able to touch into that

213
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,959
inner place of

214
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,240
nourishing stillness allow yourself to

215
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,880
be nourished by it

216
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,480
and this is one of the wonderful

217
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,000
characteristics of these teachings of

218
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,160
the buddha around meditation

219
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,080
it's not just kind of this dreary

220
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,839
dry you know focus on the breath and

221
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,279
stay with the breath and count the

222
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:09,760
breath just

223
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,240
you know zero in on the breath and and

224
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,800
um

225
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,000
like a little technique of you know of

226
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,680
i don't know of mental focus

227
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,600
it's a it's uh it's a

228
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,959
it's a settling into allowing and

229
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:31,519
touching

230
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,880
into all kinds of ways in which we feel

231
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,600
nourished wholesome feel the

232
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,200
wholesomeness of something feels a

233
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,720
nourishment of something

234
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,360
feel the goodness of something allow

235
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,000
ourselves to

236
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,399
we're allowed to feel joy we're allowed

237
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,399
to feel happiness

238
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,240
and one of the characteristics of the

239
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,000
the buddhist community in the time of

240
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
the buddha that apparently was a little

241
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,399
bit

242
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,640
unusual for the religious circles of his

243
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,839
time

244
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,279
was that the buddhist disciples were

245
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,519
smiling a lot always kind of kind of a

246
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,160
joyful group

247
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,560
so it's not meant to be a grim practice

248
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,959
this meditation

249
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,920
don't take meditation too seriously

250
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,279
meditation is much too

251
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,480
important to take seriously because

252
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,160
uh if you take it too seriously i think

253
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,760
you kind of like squeeze some of the

254
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,120
life out of it and

255
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,120
makes it harder to feel the nourishment

256
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,959
and the and the

257
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,440
wholesomeness and the joy the pleasure

258
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,680
of it all

259
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,480
not to indulge in those things and not

260
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,279
to hold on to them and expect them and

261
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,399
huff and puff for it but

262
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,440
in the very even in the smallest ways

263
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,200
in the course of a day or in the course

264
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,640
of meditation

265
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,600
you're allowed to tap in and discover

266
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,360
the places that feel wholesome

267
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,560
places field where there's inner

268
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,200
goodness nourishment

269
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,720
each of the seven factors has a

270
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,519
nourishment for it

271
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,720
and um so um

272
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,320
so what how would it what how does

273
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,480
samadhi come about

274
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,360
if that's the orientation not this one

275
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,040
pointed focus

276
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,240
but rather imbibing

277
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,079
the nourishment that's here even if it's

278
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,440
just like if

279
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,320
one percent of yourself feels has this

280
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:24,720
good

281
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,880
nourishing quality um

282
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,360
then um maybe that's worth a lot more

283
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,600
than the five percent of your of who you

284
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,000
are that's neurotic

285
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,680
but if you give a hundred percent of

286
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,040
your attention

287
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,320
to your five percent that's neurotic

288
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,800
then you're not going to be nourished

289
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,079
but if you give

290
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,079
a hundred percent of your attention to

291
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,839
the one percent that's

292
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,959
wholesome then you can be nourished by

293
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,440
that and then things begin to relax and

294
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,360
open

295
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,680
and something like that i don't know

296
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,279
what percentage you are

297
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,639
of all these things but uh

298
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,360
chances are that if you're a regular

299
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,120
human being

300
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,920
that you probably give more attention to

301
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,000
what's not nourishing

302
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,920
than to what is nourishing and

303
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,160
so sit down meditate in the nourishing

304
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,360
stillness

305
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,279
the nourishing awareness the nourishing

306
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,399
tranquility the nourishing joy

307
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,760
the nourishing mindfulness

308
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,839
so samadhi the samadhi factor of

309
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,519
awakening

310
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,920
and when that it becomes well developed

311
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,240
meaning they're well nourished by it

312
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,160
supported by it to feel the goodness of

313
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:48,959
it

314
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,440
that creates the wonderful conditions

315
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,680
for the mind to have equanimity

316
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,399
to develop equanimity so it's not

317
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,399
enforced equanimity where you hold

318
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,399
yourself still

319
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,399
but it's an equineme that comes because

320
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,000
there's a feeling of being really

321
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,040
settled and

322
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,079
at ease and in this nourishing place of

323
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,639
stillness

324
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,920
so the so the samadhi factor of

325
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,680
awakening

326
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,959
so until we do equanimity tomorrow those

327
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,000
of you coming back

328
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,160
for that you might

329
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,079
spend some extra time today

330
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,560
seeing if you can become more familiar

331
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,600
with whatever capacity whatever

332
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,880
ability you have to discover

333
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,920
a nourishing inner stillness quiet

334
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,000
unwaveringness unagitatedness

335
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,040
within and see what it's like to

336
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,680
let yourself enjoy it and be nourished

337
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,680
may samadhi be a delight for you

338
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,839
thank you
