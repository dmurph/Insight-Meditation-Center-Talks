1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,200
to this morning meditation in

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:12,200
California and as a gathering of a community here to meditate together and

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,800
a gathering of each of us uh Gathering all the desperate parts of who we are

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:26,800
into some kind of hole some kind of uh Gathering into the present moment

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,080
so all of us is included

6
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:41,480
and the way that we include it all is um different ways but I like to suggest that um the

7
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:50,719
most valuable place to uh at the kind of a maybe at a

8
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,960
center of our inner life that can grow in a certain kind of

9
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:04,360
warmth or pleasure or in kind of an inspired feeling

10
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,880
of of um The Source within us the

11
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:15,200
home is not something to focus on

12
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:23,880
directly but rather somewhat indirectly kind of like it's on the periphery of

13
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:33,560
awareness and that on the center of awareness is is uh a number of different

14
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:41,439
experiences within of stability to feel stable here and

15
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,560
now and it can be a stability in the

16
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,719
body and it can be a stability in the

17
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:58,439
mind and it can be a stability in Awareness that thew awareness is softly

18
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:06,079
gently stable here without having too much of a sense

19
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:11,920
of awareness is focused on something if anything it's focused on this feelings

20
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,160
of stability and then on the

21
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:24,640
periphery as we breathe the source of breathing the or

22
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:31,200
this or some inner sense of where the source of Life source of

23
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:38,959
of uh Vitality of Love of warmth some inner place of goodness that

24
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,040
we might have and if we have no such place then

25
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,400
maybe just a uh uh a simple kind of

26
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,120
peripheral awareness of breathing where the breathing what we kind of become

27
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,360
aware of in breathing is an easy breath a soft breath

28
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:07,080
the parts of breathing that just that breathes itself even if you control your

29
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:14,560
breathing and breathing is forced or whatever kind of rest with where the

30
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,280
breathing feels relaxed maybe not forced it could be in

31
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:26,080
the movements of the back rib cage it could be the movements of the

32
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,480
shoulders as you breathe or something deep in the

33
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:37,159
abdom so hopefully uh as we go along here you'll understand what I

34
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:43,599
mean so to assume a meditation posture that for

35
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:50,799
you gives you a feeling of stability so if you're sitting in a

36
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,079
chair or a couch adjust yourself so that

37
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:01,120
some parts of your body are against the surface maybe the the chair the seats of

38
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:08,439
the chair that you feel some that could supports you as a stable

39
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,400
base if you're sitting on the floor maybe whatever way you're sitting

40
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:21,639
maybe cross-legged that you feel the stability that the three points of the cross-legged

41
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:26,360
posture provide at the base

42
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:38,280
if you're sitting on a couch resting against the back rest maybe there's a way

43
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,880
of sitting up a little straighter still resting your back

44
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:49,160
against the back rest but sitting a little straighter so that the chest is a

45
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,479
little bit more open rather than

46
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:04,560
collapsing if you're laying down then to adjust your body in such a way

47
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,080
that you feel the points of contact with bed the

48
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,960
floor provides kind of a feeling of strength or stability or

49
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:23,080
groundedness if you have your knees up uh and your SES of your feet on the

50
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:29,960
floor The Souls of the feet can provide stability as The Souls of the Fe feet

51
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:36,280
can for people sitting in a chair so feel the physical

52
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:44,440
stability that's available to you doesn't have to be dramatic could be

53
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:49,039
subtle stability

54
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:01,639
steadiness and then as you exhale let go into that

55
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:12,599
stability almost as if all the tensions of your body can

56
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:17,880
soften and help with a settling into the

57
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:24,759
stability spreading a sense of stability through the body

58
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:38,520
and then as you exhale see if you can do the same for

59
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:45,199
whatever tension agitation restlessness there might be

60
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,880
in the thinking

61
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:56,800
mind let the thinking mind relax

62
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:04,360
soften so the mind also begins to rest and spread out into some kind of

63
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,638
inner mental place of stability or

64
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:19,680
steadiness or a sense of supportive Stillness

65
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,319
you don't have to let go of your thoughts as much as behind the thoughts

66
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:50,919
or driving the thoughts together with the thoughts any tension

67
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:56,440
pressure tightness activation in your body

68
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:03,800
associated with thinking as you

69
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:11,560
exhale soften relax let the

70
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:19,560
Mind settle into a stability as if gravity

71
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:26,479
gently receives pulls on the mind

72
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:46,200
and then without ambition or idea that you

73
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:52,200
can actually do this maybe it's just a little bit an act of imagination for some of

74
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:58,600
you turn your attention around so that you're aware of being

75
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,440
aware

76
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:17,120
and the kind of weightless weight of awareness can the awareness be somewhat

77
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:24,640
still not jumping around not chasing

78
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:34,839
things maybe this Stillness of an open window where

79
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:41,680
whatever Breeze or wind or warmth or insects there might be

80
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,480
outside comes to the window with no effort from the

81
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:55,360
window so let your awareness be still and open

82
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:13,000
and with these three reference points of stability

83
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:20,079
Stillness either all three at once kind of like they're a

84
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:29,240
big something big circle of stability that work together

85
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:39,120
with your peripheral awareness become aware of breathing but

86
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:45,600
don't focus on the breath it's almost like you're aware of

87
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,760
a shy cat on the edge of your peripheral

88
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,920
vision and you know you can't approach it directly or stare at

89
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:03,720
it so you kind of ignore it and kind of aware of

90
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:09,279
it and so become aware of

91
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:24,800
breathing becoming aware of the source of breath where it begins

92
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:36,320
in the way that one way or the

93
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:43,800
other the body breathing is caring for

94
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:50,399
you is is engaging you in a process of

95
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:57,480
respiration which keeps you alive and then that peripheral awareness

96
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:03,800
of breathing maybe you can feel the inner

97
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:11,360
goodness or warmth with

98
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:25,199
breathing staying at rest with the stability in the body mind and awareness

99
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:40,639
not making the breathing the central focus of attention but more as something which

100
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,880
you see on the edge of

101
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,800
awareness without expectations of breathing or trying to make it

102
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,760
something without trying to make anything out of

103
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:13,360
it just allowing yourself to

104
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,880
breathe so that cat can become comfortable and feel safe with

105
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
you

106
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
e

107
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
for

108
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
e

109
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

110
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,959
e e

111
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:53,480
leaving your breathing alone but

112
00:16:53,839 --> 00:17:01,959
peripherally aware of how breathing the experience in your body of

113
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:10,400
breathing moves through your body touching

114
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:17,079
moving Awakening different areas of your

115
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:25,559
body with each in breath and each out breath but not focusing

116
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
directly

117
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,840
e e

118
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:58,039
letting your thinking mind become quieter Stiller

119
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,520
so that the shy

120
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,000
breathing like a shy

121
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:22,799
cat feels more comfortable to be present to show itself to

122
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:30,720
you without you looking at it directly

123
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
for

124
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

125
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

126
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

127
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
for

128
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

129
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

130
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
for

131
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

132
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,360
e e

133
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:07,440
as we come to the end of this sitting to once

134
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:13,600
again feel whatever degree of stability or

135
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:21,760
Stillness there is in the body and take a few moments to breathe

136
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,039
with that

137
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:46,120
and to take a few moments to feel whatever stability or Stillness is find

138
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:54,559
in found in the mind maybe in the thinking mind underneath your

139
00:25:54,799 --> 00:26:00,039
thoughts and breathe with that

140
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:24,559
and if it uh it makes sense to you feel whatever stability or

141
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:32,000
Stillness steadiness there is in attention in your

142
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:40,200
awareness and not so much focusing on the breath but allowing

143
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:46,840
breathing to arrive and gently

144
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,080
touch awareness

145
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:19,039
and feeling the overall the wholeness of stability

146
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:29,559
within with your peripheral attention the edges of a

147
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:35,200
awareness be aware of whatever

148
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:42,600
inner well-being there might be or feel the

149
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:47,440
source maybe a little dot or

150
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:53,279
spot of tenderness or warmth or goodness

151
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,880
that's within you

152
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:07,080
and let that softness warmth goodness the feeling of

153
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:13,200
it gently have room to grow in your

154
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,720
body without focusing on or

155
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:25,840
trying almost allowing the peripheral awareness to make more

156
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,120
room for a natural process

157
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:01,120
and without focusing on some inner place of

158
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:08,080
well-being but allowing it to be there trusting

159
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:15,120
it turn your gaze out into the world with your

160
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:22,440
imagination of the day the people you'll meet and see and the strangers you'll

161
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:31,600
pass by andage upon them with Good

162
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:38,320
Will with well wishing that each person that you

163
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:45,720
encounter you wish them a good day you wish

164
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:52,279
them happiness and love and friendship and

165
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:58,279
peace you wish that they able to have a day that's

166
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:02,240
satisfying and meaningful

167
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,039
and may all

168
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:21,919
beings be happy may all

169
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:29,080
beings be safe may all beings

170
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:37,120
be peaceful and may all beings be

171
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:56,639
[Music]

172
00:30:56,639 --> 00:31:01,159
free thank than you

173
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:53,080
so good morning everyone or good day and welcome to this third

174
00:31:53,080 --> 00:32:00,840
talk on the road L uh taken and and uh the idea being that in

175
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:06,080
Buddhist practice there's always we're always standing at the

176
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:13,000
junction of two directions we could take we could either do something in the wide

177
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,600
realm right variety of ways that are wholesome or we can go in the direction

178
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:24,000
that's UNH wholesome and it's rare that there's a third way right down the middle of

179
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:31,679
neither wholesome or unome and even if there is it's a lost

180
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:39,200
opportunity every step we take can be done with a kind of attention and warmth

181
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:46,639
and uh that it makes it wholesome it makes it good nothing we do needs to be

182
00:32:46,639 --> 00:32:51,760
either neutral or UNH wholesome everything we do that with the step we

183
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:58,039
take what arises within us that we have no

184
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:06,440
volition personal volition they didn't choose to do it may be UNH wholesome um but then to meet that with

185
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:13,440
wholesome to recognize it wholesomely to avoid participating in it in a Wholesome

186
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:20,679
Way not to reject it or be aversive or just oh this too wow I'll think I'll

187
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:25,760
leave that alone and that would be could be done wholesomely out of care for

188
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:32,159
yourself so we always have this so learning about this this uh the path and

189
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:38,279
that here we calling the road L less taken but it's also can be understood as a whole different operating system

190
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:45,760
there's two operating systems within us and uh and one is has to do a lot with

191
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:51,679
the world we make up and live and the constructs of self and the future and

192
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:56,880
other people that uh is not really there but is a projection on to ourselves or

193
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:02,399
others and there's a whole different world we can walk in operating

194
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:08,440
system and here I'm going to read a story from my my my book of tales called

195
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:14,440
a monastery within the title of this uh this story

196
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:21,118
is inside out an engineer had been a regular and devoted

197
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:26,280
visitor to the monastery for many years the meditation practice taught at the

198
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:32,040
monastery was the only thing that made sense to him in fact the pragmatic logic

199
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:37,079
of the meditation teachings gave him hope that he could overcome his chronic

200
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:43,200
unhappiness and deeply felt pain he tried all the meditation practices that

201
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:48,320
the abbis taught him he began each practice technique with

202
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:55,520
enthusiasm only to have each end with the same frustration he would encounter a wall he

203
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:01,920
couldn't pass the closer he came to the wall the more he would recoil back into

204
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:09,200
trying to think his way out of his pain offering him much support the abis

205
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:15,359
encouraged him to relax trust the practice and simply feel his inner pain

206
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:22,400
without reacting to it after many years the abbis decided a different approach

207
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:28,720
was needed during his next visit to the monastery the abis told told him that he

208
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:33,760
wanted to continue being her student and to be able to return to the

209
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:39,880
monastery he would have to take on a special practice once he had completed the

210
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:47,160
assignment he could then return for deeper teachings once more feeling hope the

211
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:54,079
engineer quickly agreed the Abba said for 2 years I want

212
00:35:54,079 --> 00:36:01,040
you to volunteer 10 hours a week at the Maternity Ward at the local hospital the

213
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:06,480
hospital needs people to hold babies who are born prematurely if these babies don't

214
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:12,760
receive enough physical contact the babies will not grow healthily when you have finished these

215
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:19,400
two years please come back to see me the man was quite perplexed by this

216
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:26,839
instruction but because of his trust in the abbis and his failure to find any relief elsewhere he plunged into

217
00:36:26,839 --> 00:36:32,440
volunteering in the maternity ward he was surprised by how small and

218
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:38,640
fragile the babies were that he held he would hold them ever so carefully he

219
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:45,880
would watch their every breath because they all seemed in danger of stopping breathing he spent a lot of time

220
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:51,000
thinking about how he could more effectively care for the babies he held

221
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,680
but there was nothing more effective than simply holding them against his chest

222
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:02,839
after about 6 months he started feeling something quite new he started to feel a

223
00:37:02,839 --> 00:37:08,839
little spot of warmth and softness in the very center of his being since this

224
00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:14,119
was a foreign experience that didn't fit any of the ways he taught about

225
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:20,359
themselves he ignored it ignoring it was the best thing he could have

226
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:25,880
done because it prevented him from interfering with the warmth by thinking

227
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:32,359
about it too much over the following months this tender spot grew until it

228
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:38,599
pervaded his body as it did the cold dark wall around his heart slowly

229
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:43,960
relaxed thawed and dissolved when he had completed his two

230
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:49,480
years of volunteering in the Maternity Ward the engineer returned to the

231
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:55,920
monastery the abis saw immediately that he was a changed man he was no longer

232
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:02,319
desperate and he was no long longer trying to fit everything he experienced into a conceptual

233
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:10,520
framework now he wanted to learn what else the Abus had to teach giving him a new instruction the

234
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:16,319
abis said to him when you meditate don't think about

235
00:38:16,319 --> 00:38:21,359
what is happening rather let your awareness be

236
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:28,599
seated in the tender warmth you feel in your body if you do this any meditation

237
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:35,680
practice you do will be fruitful and the man found this to be

238
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:42,599
true so uh there's this other operating

239
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:51,880
system within us there's the operating system of consentual conceptual Frameworks um uh ideas madeup stories we

240
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:57,200
have about ourselves judgments the swirl of kind of the mental activity that is

241
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:04,560
an an operating system that often can be based on things which are not healthy for US based on fear and anxiety it can

242
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:11,720
be based on conceit and delusion it can be based on Greed and and uh it can be

243
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:18,480
based on hatred and anger and these things uh come from an operating system

244
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:26,160
which tends to kind of reinforce itself the more we do it and create a lot of tension and fragmentation within us

245
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:33,160
there's another operating system system that um is the one that was operating for this uh

246
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:39,960
engineer that uh he didn't know about that uh he was he was offering his

247
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:45,359
tender care for these little babies and there's something about that contact

248
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:53,280
that touched something deep inside of himself some source of of of um of care

249
00:39:53,280 --> 00:40:01,560
of Love of warmth of simple tenderness that um because it kept re

250
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:07,240
returning there started to grow and expand and open and this other operating

251
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:15,000
system that he didn't know about began to fill him and uh and uh he became a better

252
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:22,160
person because of it he was able then to learn to meditate um he learned something about meditation that was not

253
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:29,359
doing meditation like an like a uh technical problem to accomplish um to

254
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:36,720
meditate by the numbers and to focus and and put everything into place like an engineering uh

255
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:42,240
construction um there's nothing wrong necessarily with doing meditation by the

256
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,560
numbers by having a technique that we do but as he learned now any meditation

257
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:53,040
practice he did will be successful any meditation practice you do if you have

258
00:40:53,040 --> 00:41:00,079
this other source other operating system in which you do it from which it uh it'll be

259
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:07,640
successful and this second operating system uh is less to do about doing than

260
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:15,200
it is about allowing less to do with uh accomplishment than it is to do about

261
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:23,400
appreciation less to do with um striving as it is to do about being soft and

262
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:29,480
accepting and um and it's so it's not just doing this naively and you can't do

263
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:35,880
this necessarily with the this second operating system uh you can't think your

264
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:42,880
way into tenderness you can't think your way into it necessarily if that's where the

265
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:50,319
solution is you might have thoughts that allow to touch into this deeper place

266
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:59,400
even just imagining you're holding pries might be enough for some people to kind of drop down and really be here in a

267
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:06,800
tender way um but uh uh you can't construct all that you have to allow

268
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:12,839
something within and each person will have a different Source inside for this

269
00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:19,640
other this is inner operating system some people might feel it intimately connected to breathing some people it

270
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:25,800
might be in the heart some people will find it deeper than the heart um that

271
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:31,079
there's a long history in Budd to find something really uh valuable

272
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:38,040
deep profound somewhere in the belly area deep down the abdomen Japan they call it the

273
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:44,559
Hara um maybe it's okay to call it uh you know associated with where the Boom

274
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:51,559
is in the body that the place of there something gestates something grows and

275
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:58,280
that you can't make a human being uh a um

276
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:04,760
a mother cannot make the child grow in the womb but

277
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:12,800
creates the conditions for it and allows it and can feel tenderness and warmth towards it but um and then it then the

278
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:19,880
thing Grows by itself the person grows so it can be

279
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:28,319
um uh so may it be that today that uh

280
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:36,400
every thing you touch with your hands the the keys of a computer board

281
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:42,480
or a device the utensil in the kitchen steering wheel of your car what

282
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:49,520
everything that you're actually touching with your hand touch it be with it with a kind of

283
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:58,920
care that you would be with a prei if you were holding it uh and see if that's kind of

284
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:07,880
everyday in your everyday activities that the objects of touch what comes into your hand if you be with it

285
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:14,760
caringly not casually not off hand not pref not kind of kind of doing it you

286
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:21,559
know half consciously you know you're thinking of doing doing it for another purpose and just doing it opening a door

287
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:27,200
to get someplace else you know you can do it you open doors so many times

288
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:34,880
Everything You Touch today let it be a place for your care for your attention for something deep

289
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:40,880
inside to come forth uh as you live your life of course the other things you're

290
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,520
doing might be important and so it's easy to overlook the opening the door

291
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:52,280
but nothing can be more important than Awakening this beautiful

292
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:59,800
operating system we have and having that come forth in into our life so that

293
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:05,079
everything becomes

294
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:10,599
sacred so thank you very much
