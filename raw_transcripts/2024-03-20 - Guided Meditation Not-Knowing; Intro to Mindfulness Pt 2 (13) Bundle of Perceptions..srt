1
00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:10,559
so warm greetings and happy to have this next

2
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,320
half an hour together for

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:21,880
meditation one of the frequent teachings in Zen Zen

4
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:30,679
Buddhism being the first Buddhist practice that I engaged in uh was the idea of not knowing

5
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:37,640
there's even a saying that not knowing is most intimate and I think it means that if

6
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:44,879
you don't know then you can really see clearly what's there you can know what's there in a closer way Fuller way but as

7
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,680
soon as you have we we in Zen the idea if you put a filter of knowing

8
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:56,920
understanding expertise uh opinions between you and the experience or the person you're with

9
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:03,839
that you can't really know them it's not very intimate and uh so not

10
00:01:03,839 --> 00:01:12,680
knowing another uh teaching is uh something called great doubt a certain kind of spiritual doubt

11
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:19,240
that is not indecisiveness it's not uncertainty

12
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:27,479
exactly it's uh it's a questioning our assumptions questioning our perceptions

13
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:34,399
even our understandings and maybe it's like adding at the end of a some

14
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:39,880
understanding we have Maybe not maybe maybe it's not like

15
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:46,280
so maybe not so that we're more open because many times we have these

16
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:53,320
understandings interpretations and they close things down they limit us rather than making us fresh and available for

17
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:59,320
what happens next and so this idea of not knowing so

18
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:06,320
that we can be more fully present for our experience can be very helpful in

19
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,640
meditation that even if we might recognize something like recognize an in

20
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:17,319
breath as an INB breath um it's like you know I don't

21
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:22,440
really know what the breath is I don't really know what this experience is not

22
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:28,280
knowing and if you come to a conclusion that during meditation uh I'm not

23
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:34,080
meditating very well then um you know maybe not maybe it's

24
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,920
different maybe not that way so always kind of putting a question mark not to

25
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:49,239
seow the despair of Doubt or the uncertainty of doubt the confusion of Doubt but rather to do the opposite to

26
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:57,080
let go of the overlay of Concepts interpretations stories predictions

27
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:03,879
judgments we have on our experience um not knowing maybe not

28
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:08,920
judging not interpreting not making a story out of

29
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:15,680
it maybe it's not the way I'm thinking about it let's instead let's be more present

30
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,120
here so that would be the meditation today so to make it simple you can just

31
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,920
say not knowing when your mind says it knows something um more than just a

32
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:35,040
simple simple recognition of you know breathing in or an itch or something like that uh anything you add to that I

33
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,439
don't know don't know don't know and it happens and then we I Wonder

34
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:47,040
If that's poison oak from hiking in the Hills here yesterday don't know not

35
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:53,200
knowing let's just not know for now later you can investigate later you can

36
00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:00,640
find out what things are maybe if it's appropriate but try in this meditation to practice not knowing m

37
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,840
mind and not knowing mind that helps you to be here and now in the middle of your

38
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,000
experience directly being with it as it

39
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,680
is so assuming a meditation

40
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:26,360
posture a posture that's appropriate for you that helps you to be both relaxed in

41
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,720
your body and Alert in your body

42
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:48,919
body to softly close your

43
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,720
eyes and maybe breathing a little deeper than

44
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:10,160
usual but not completely full maybe half full compared to usual half

45
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,400
more so there's a gentleness in the breathing in

46
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:22,120
deeper letting your belly expand as you breathe in

47
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:33,159
deeper and then relaxing your whole body as you

48
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:47,319
exhale softly

49
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,280
relaxing letting your breathing return to

50
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:03,880
normal and becoming aware of the Rhythm of breathing in and breathing

51
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:14,759
out if your belly is relaxed if your chest can be

52
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,759
relaxed maybe the breathing the rhythm of breathing is a little bit like waves

53
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,759
maybe not waves crashing against the coast but waves out in the ocean

54
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:55,759
swelling up and down lifting up and down

55
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,319
that the experience of breathing creates a kind of wave

56
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:14,840
throughout the body certainly in the Torso and

57
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,840
expansion

58
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:31,520
lifting and the inhale a contraction settling

59
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,319
releasing and with a wave of breathing in and

60
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,120
out relax your body on the

61
00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:00,039
exhale relax different parts of your body

62
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:27,960
the waves are breathing in and out the massage of

63
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:35,279
breathing let those waves that the undulation spread out into your

64
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:43,360
heart center maybe feeling the Heart Center

65
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:49,120
emotional Center expand as you breathe in

66
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,600
lifting and relaxing as you exhale

67
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:20,360
and letting the rhythm of breathing spread up into your thinking

68
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,440
mind feeling the thinking mind as you

69
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:39,240
inhale and relaxing it on the exhale

70
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,920
being attentive to any softness or

71
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:16,480
gentleness that's found in the breathing or around the

72
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:27,720
breathing or in the global experience of the

73
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,320
Torso e

74
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:31,240
and then at the end of the or as part of the exhale

75
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:38,639
if anything any thinking has crept in

76
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,959
whatsoever let there be in you a not knowing don't

77
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:53,120
know don't know if this is true or

78
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:59,040
false maybe it's not the way I'm thinking about it

79
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:08,959
don't need to know not

80
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,639
knowing so you're fresh for the

81
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
inhale

82
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
for

83
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120

for for

93
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:57,039
practicing not knowing because

94
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:04,480
perhaps for this meditation you're better

95
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:12,760
off thinking about things you think you know don't

96
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:17,520
know so you can be intimate with

97
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
here

98
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
for

99
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640

e e

109
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:52,080
Can You Feel the force or weight of the

110
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:58,799
knowing the certainty in what you're belie leaving

111
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,120
or

112
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:31,600
thinking or the force or the knowing of the aversion to what you're thinking

113
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:46,679
imagining and if you can practice not

114
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:57,320
knowing so there's no Force no force of certainty and no force of uncertainty

115
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:04,200
just here with

116
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:31,159
this e

117
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:17,278
and then to bring this meditation to a

118
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:23,159
close to gaze upon others to gaze upon the

119
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:30,080
world without the burden of having to know

120
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:36,080
having to understand having to interpret or to

121
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:44,799
judge to gaze upon the world free of responsibility and

122
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:51,480
duty to gaze upon the world with a not knowing

123
00:28:53,559 --> 00:29:00,519
mind because you don't need to know it's enough for a few

124
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:09,000
minutes just to gaze upon the world as it is not taking

125
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:18,640
responsibility not judging not knowing is most

126
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:26,480
intimate and imagine meeting the people you'll meet

127
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:32,158
today where you begin this

128
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:41,720
way you don't start with your assumptions about who they are what's happening to them you don't start with

129
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:48,519
your judgments but you

130
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:52,039
start being

131
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,960
upright not knowing

132
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,960
so you can know them in a deeper

133
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:16,919
way may our ability to [Music] see without the overlay

134
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:25,600
of ideas help us promote the welfare and

135
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:30,640
happiness of others may all

136
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:37,519
beings be happy may all beings be

137
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:46,360
safe may all beings be peaceful may all beings be

138
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:52,960
free at least free of our judgments and assumptions

139
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:58,390
[Music]

140
00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:09,880
thank

141
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:30,919
you e

142
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:18,840
so hello for this third talk

143
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:25,919
on the bundles of grasping the bundles of

144
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:31,679
clinging so the Buddha um puts a tremendous emphasis in being free from

145
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:36,840
grasping clinging attachment but you don't want to be in a

146
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:42,200
hurry to do that do that to do it automatically and quickly you want to

147
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:47,960
understand well what it is that you're attached to and how you're attached you

148
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:53,399
want to become a student of grasping of clinging take a time with it to really

149
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:59,320
know it well because if you know it well then you'll see its tricks in the future

150
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:04,440
you'll see how it operates you'll see it coming and you can leave it alone but if

151
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:09,519
you haven't really understood it um all kinds of attachments will creep up on

152
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:16,720
you and catch you by surprise and then you have to do the de the much more difficult work of learning how to let go

153
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:22,279
or how to not have them interfere with the the full freedom of

154
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:28,080
your life and um

155
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:36,480
the um so he has the Buddha talks about uh five areas primary areas for

156
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:42,919
attachment for clinging and because we have multiple attachments to these and we keep those

157
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:49,399
attachments we keep them close to us we're we're attached um he calls them bundles we bundle them up together and

158
00:33:49,399 --> 00:33:56,360
there's five different bundles and Monday I talked about appearances physical

159
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:03,120
appearances that we perceive through our senses the attachments to that yesterday

160
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:09,960
it was about feelings V Pleasant and unpleasant and today it's about

161
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:18,720
recognition perception Sona and poly and uh this is the simple acts of

162
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:26,480
perception that involve a recognizing a recognition uh Rec

163
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:33,440
recognition of of what we're seeing and what we see is not the raw basic sense

164
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:39,839
data coming in what we see is based on often about memory and Concepts and

165
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:45,839
ideas and a process of selection that we select what we want to focus on and we

166
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:51,800
have preconceived ideas of what we're seeing and um and it's very innocent

167
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,839
some of it and we do it kind of in a subvocal sub almost subconscious way

168
00:34:56,839 --> 00:35:02,640
throughout the day where um if you're at a having a meal

169
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:08,599
and it's a soup and so you don't pick up the fork you pick up a soup spoon and

170
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:16,160
you know you recognize the difference between them you know what one is different than the other and it's an automatic kind of to

171
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:23,760
do that and and because it's automatic we can do so much more in our life than we can if we had to consider what

172
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:31,800
everything was every time we were going to deal with something however uh because it's on automatic

173
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:37,040
it's kind of subconscious that we perceive we recognize things we don't

174
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:42,480
see that the recognition is a a factor of the mind that we're contributing it

175
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,640
to it and um and there are things you can see it clearly sometimes when you

176
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:52,720
see that there are things which um can be different can be perceived as

177
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:58,760
different things in different contexts so here at IMC we we have this

178
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:06,640
Bell and here we recognize it as a bell a very similar Japanese solid Temple

179
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:13,240
Bell about this size I saw in downtown San Francisco one day and uh it was a

180
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:19,119
homeless person using it as a begging Bowl so for him it wasn't a bell it was

181
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:25,000
a begging bowl for someone else they might find it useful as a place to store

182
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:31,680
pens and they have you know all kinds of things in on their table you know their desk with pens coming out and it's a pen

183
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:41,880
holder someone else might use it as a soup bowl and uh and um a um and they're

184
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:48,920
things this size in Asia which kind of look like a bell like this and this could be that used for this function is

185
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:54,240
a spatoon it could be that we someone turns it upside down and uses it as a

186
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,640
door stop and so they see a door stop so there's it could be many many different

187
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:07,400
things and um and uh uh and so the function is often how

188
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:14,520
we see something however it's not just the different functions our acts

189
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:19,560
of recognition comes along often enough

190
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:27,960
with associations judgments assumptions bias with it so that um uh we don't just

191
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:33,599
see the person in their wholeness we select we recognize them by some feature

192
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:40,720
of what they are so for example if um some person uh is coming

193
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:49,200
down the sidewalk and the person is not just a person for you you recognize them as being tall or short and with the the

194
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,880
recognition of tall and short comes associations with that what it means and

195
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,720
uh maybe if you're short it's like oh one of my people and it's I'm so glad because it's so awkward with all these

196
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:06,000
tall people around um if it's a tall person and uh

197
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,680
but they're really tall they're 6'8 or something um uh it comes maybe with a

198
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:16,720
sense of intimidation like oh this is a little bit dangerous now for me and so

199
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:22,079
the perception can be one hand can be familiarity can be comfort and the other

200
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:27,280
hand can be discomfort we have bias around people

201
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:32,960
that those people look to us like if someone looks to us like an enemy then

202
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:40,720
we treat them in a we see them in a certain way and the perception is Not Innocent we're perceiving them now as an

203
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:47,119
enemy if we see someone as a potential friend uh then now you know they may or

204
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:54,359
may not be but it's it's a we're adding something more than just the raw data of seeing them we're seeing them through a

205
00:38:54,359 --> 00:39:02,520
lens of interpretation so uh the is these ideas that we add on

206
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:08,240
top of the raw basic data and there can be a lot of attachment to those ideas

207
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:16,440
there could be clinging to them there can be a force force a forcefulness to them a a

208
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:23,200
um a certainty in them a kind of uh that come along with all kinds of things if

209
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:30,240
there involve fear it's a certainty of fear it's a force of fear that's operating that's contributing to the

210
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:38,079
attachment if it's desire if it's hatred all these things come along and the

211
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:43,880
perceptions are not innocent there's attachment there's clinging and a lot of

212
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:49,800
a tremendous amount of suffering in this world uh has to do with how how human

213
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:55,960
beings perceive each other and uh with bias with prejudice

214
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:01,920
with racism with class ISM with ableism but we see people through a particular

215
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:07,240
lens we perceive them through a particular lens that limits them that diminishes them that makes it

216
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:13,440
problematic we don't see the wholeness of the person or we don't see them where we give them the freedom to be who they

217
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:20,200
are with respect and care and love same thing towards ourselves there

218
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:26,079
can be negative bias towards oneself and we see ourself through that lens you

219
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:31,680
know I'm I'm a loud ly person I'm a inadequate person I'm a unsuccessful

220
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:38,960
person I'm an unwanted person and so there's a kind of perception it's a judgment that becomes a perception and

221
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,319
this is what we see and Ne negative self- percept

222
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:50,760
perceptions there can be a lot of attachment a lot of clinging a lot of forcefulness compulsivity to it it's

223
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:59,280
like there's has a it has a force of its own that's in US driving along and it just seems so authoritative and

224
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:07,359
full so one of the primary teachings in much of Buddhism is to be very careful about

225
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:15,160
perceptions perceptions are not innocent they're not perceptions are not innocently what we out there we have a

226
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:20,599
contributing factor in constructing our perceptions constructing our

227
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:27,599
recognitions constructing the way that we understand the simple understanding of what something is

228
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:35,160
and um and uh we select out of something out of the hole we're partial we see

229
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:43,480
things for a certain purpose we see things for how it relates to me we see things um you know and

230
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:50,200
so uh this is one of place the bundles of clinging and so we can feel the

231
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:56,200
forcefulness behind the ideas we have we can feel the weight of them or this the

232
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:04,560
largess of them or the the clinging the attachment comes with a sense of uh Authority like this

233
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:09,760
is the way it is and a sense that it has to be this way and a sense of like

234
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:17,119
pushing it Forward into the world and um and um and there's you know as I said

235
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:23,319
there's a lot of suffering because of this so to practice not knowing to

236
00:42:23,319 --> 00:42:29,319
practice a healthy kind of doubt maybe it's not this way this person's coming down the street and

237
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:35,760
they look like my enemy and then oh maybe not let's just see let's maybe

238
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:42,599
step off a little bit to the side to be make sure I'm a little bit safe but let me look more clearly and make sure that

239
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:48,119
uh I'm not just projecting fear onto this person

240
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:55,960
and sure enough as a person gets closer you see the person's actually looks very friendly and gentle in fact when the

241
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:02,760
person come and so you smile and the person smiles and says hello and wasn't nice hello as the person

242
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:09,040
goes um and we feel so glad that we took the time to doubt our initial perception

243
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:15,079
it's not always that way so today if you like you might spend the

244
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:22,559
day uh so one way or the other taking time to question your

245
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:28,440
perceptions to look at when you perceive someone or something through what lens

246
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:36,480
are you seeing it is it what it can do for you is it the function is what your relationship to it is um and what you

247
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,680
need to do your history your past

248
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:47,000
experiences and do you limit your your whatever is you're

249
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:54,000
seeing by perceiving only part of the whole or is it limited by a judgment you

250
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:01,400
have or an interpretation or an association take some time questioning perception

251
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:09,079
and this is a fun thing to do with another person um maybe you're sitting on a park bench or in someplace in

252
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:14,240
public and uh you kind of do the exercise of explaining to the person

253
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:19,599
your what your first percept perceptions are of something or someone or something

254
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:24,920
going by and then the two of you kind of questioning that and saying well is that

255
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:30,200
really all there is is there more is that limiting try to kind of get a

256
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:36,839
handle on how much perceptions are

257
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:46,440
projections and maybe in understanding that you'll understand how valuable it is from time to time to practice not

258
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:54,920
knowing not knowing is most intimate so thank you
