and giving some attention to the body maybe the body needs to be just a little

30
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:31,500
stretched ah maybe the shoulders need to be rolled a

31
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,600
little bit as mine do or or this or weight needs to be shifted

32
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:42,539
back and forth side to side to find your center of gravity to really come into

33

konyenby Paragon of compassion

83
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:35,580
or some other archetype maybe the being of light represents

84
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:42,480
complete acceptance for you they see you they know you through and

85
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,179
through all the cause and conditions of your life

86
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:58,020
and in fact they invite you to take their perspective with them so you're taking their perspective

87
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:04,260
looking at yourself looking at your life looking at your body

88
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:09,299
sensing your body your thoughts your mind State heart state

89
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:18,320
from their perspective you're joining them making a third person perspective

90
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:27,380
of compassion and kindness wisdom and kindness towards yourself

91
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:50,360
so say if there's crankiness in the body and the heart mind

92
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:01,740

93
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:08,539
compassion so many causes conditions in your life

94
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:25,919

95
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:31,440
background genetics Life Experiences

96

everything that has happened

97
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:46,759

101
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:59,059
conditions habit pattern not personal

102
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,919

103
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:07,519

it was near and dear those we have challenges with and we've hurt people

146
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:33,480
also Through The Eyes of the Buddha being of light

147
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:39,440
with benevolence they're all doing their best

148
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:48,560
given the causes and conditions that each and every one of us has

149

[Music]

157
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:59,160
thank you thank you for your practice everyone okay

158
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:07,200
so that third person perspective that we worked with tonight can be very powerful

159
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:13,740
when when we see it when we try to play with this perspective and see ourselves

160
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:20,579
with benevolence with kindness or the eyes of of the Buddha Kuan Yen

161
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:27,300
um some some being that represents kindness and compassion and seeing ourselves from that perspective can open

162
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:34,619
open something up can open the sense of oh oh what what does what does this

163
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:39,900
person knows me need and am I making it worse with the judgments how can I be a

164
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:46,980
kind friend to myself so it can open up a new perspective that's often when we

165
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:53,280
are in our own mind and around maybe judgments are coming up or our regular habit patterns may not be

166
00:37:53,280 --> 00:38:00,720
accessible so and um with that I'd like to invite us

167

168
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:14,480
um the invitation tonight with the small groups uh the small breakout groups is um

169
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:22,079
how have you tried the third person perspective in this way what about it

170
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:28,380
works what about might be challenging what can support you uh what about taking the perspective of the Buddha

171
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:35,820
Kuan Yen Etc so so just playing around with perspectives sharing your aha moments or

172
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:42,540
or challenges or or maybe you fell asleep which is perfectly fine or maybe the whole time you were distracted which

173
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:50,160
is perfectly fine just checking in just a brief check in with each other in order to support and the invitation is

174
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:57,839
just speak from your own experience just a short nugget there's no right or wrong and then the next person will go

175
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:04,680
alphabetical order we share nugget and then the next person there is no asking questions or directing it's just we show

176
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:10,920
up and also when near turn comes you can just say pass perfectly fine to pass

Marianne thank you Nikki

187
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:22,980
um I just wanted to say that the third person perspective is very helpful for

188
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:28,859
me both in giving myself meta and in concentration

189
00:49:28,859 --> 00:49:34,440
because it seemed like the the uh I had more freedom to just let myself

190
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:41,880
concentrate and stop thinking because somebody else really important the Buddha was saying it's okay

191
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:48,300
yeah thank you beautiful thanks for sharing that lovely both and giving

192
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:53,339
kindness and in concentration just the sense of he's letting go yes the Buddha

193
00:49:53,339 --> 00:49:58,800
the invoking the external and yet the Eternal Buddha the inner Buddha whatever

194
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:04,140
then beautiful thanks for that Marianne Jerry says I was kinder to myself and

195
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:09,180
then more kind to others as I am very good at self-criticism yeah

196
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:16,740
thanks Jerry yeah this third person perspective can really be helpful with criticism especially for for everyone so

197
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:23,880
Misha loses helpful to sense when Ian's warmth loving but not caught by my

198
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:30,300
personality the relief to be beyond my personality yay and then what a relief

199
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:35,640
right to have the wisdom and kindness and and not be caught beautiful just I'm

200
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:42,359
loving the practice reports and and one of you also sent me an email earlier today because this is a similar theme

201
00:50:42,359 --> 00:50:49,140
that we worked with on Wednesday and then and one of you emailed and said yes this is

202
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:56,780
working for me great and and just things are easier with the third person perspective and just yeah yeah so

203
00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:02,520
beautiful delightful lovely um any other Reflections before we close

204
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:07,400
this feels complete to me and um

205
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:14,040
and uh one of you says a new person wanted to know about the third person

206
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:20,220
is is that a mill confused by this comment does that mean when you became a

207
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:26,220
third person the new person wanted to nobody a new person in happy hours I'm

208
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:33,559
not quite sure but the the context of that question um yes

209
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:39,559
there there was a new person who has never been to a happy hour ever ever ever ever

210
00:51:39,559 --> 00:51:46,800
and she was very confused and she wanted to know what it meant to have the

211
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:51,839
perspective of the third person oh okay got it thanks so so thank you for that

212
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:59,579
Serena and and I did explain it in the guided meditation I wonder if this person a joint leader uh in in the

213
00:51:59,579 --> 00:52:06,300
middle of the guided meditation or or maybe but but the idea of the third person perspective is is the way I

214
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:11,579
guided it tonight was first we sit on the body and then we have a sense of oh

215
00:52:11,579 --> 00:52:17,339
yes the Buddha the Buddha the kuanian externally that is just giving us love

216
00:52:17,339 --> 00:52:24,359
and kindness and acceptance and then we take the perspective We join them looking at our own lives that's kind of

217
00:52:24,359 --> 00:52:30,380
we take the third person perspective together with with kuanian

218
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:36,359
[Music] um with Kuan Yin or the Buddha so that's how we take the third person perspective

219
00:52:36,359 --> 00:52:41,760
onto our lives so we're still us but so we know our own history our own life but

220
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:48,780
with this from this perspective of complete kindness and and generosity that's what that means

221
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:55,619
another person uh says hi Nikki one of our members felt more grounded from the practice after dealing with the

222
00:52:55,619 --> 00:53:02,280
difficult news from the police officers in Tennessee yeah difficult difficult news

223
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:09,599
difficult times and they continue in in our country in our world and I'm glad to

224
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:15,319
hear that this practice that police could offer some support and some grounding

225
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:23,220
yeah yeah so yes uh

226
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:28,260
recording is available and uh I'll post it tonight

227
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:34,920
and um yeah and what I'm also just to let you know since I've been I'm

228
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:42,300
experimenting tonight with with a different length of happy hour not the whole hour but to see if it's actually

229
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:51,059
it's a little shorter if the guided if the guided meditation is the 30 minutes would keep that but the the um uh darmet

230
00:53:51,059 --> 00:53:56,460
that Dharma talk is shorter if the reflections are briefer so that maybe instead of a full hour it'll be 15

231
00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:02,880
minutes or something how does that feel um overall and it's 15 minutes now so

232
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:09,119
let's give that a try so let's let's close let's close our happy hour tonight
