2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,840
very formal welcome warm welcome to happy hour lovely to see you all

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:21,840
and for our practice theme for today we've been practicing the past week with

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:29,760
the third of what's called the brahmaviharas the practices of the heart the heavenly

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:36,800
abode and the third one is empathetic joy translated as sympathetic joy um

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,000
also different ways is translated but basically this translation of the word mudita

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,079
in pauli m-u-d-i-t-a it's about cultivating our heart and generosity of

8
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,120
happiness for other people's happiness to feel happy for other people's

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,399
happiness and they can be just a lovely practice of

10
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:04,478
of feeling happy for good fortune of others or ourselves it's a very happy

11
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:11,600
making joyous practice as many of you have noted it can be difficult and challenging at times too

12
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:18,880
we acknowledge that in different ways it can be challenging and this is a purification practice and challenges

13
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,320
come up that we didn't know were there we work with them

14
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:31,759
so we have made our way working through the categories uh little by little this these

15
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:37,600
concentric circles that we practice with in

16
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:44,159
the brahmaviharas with loving-kindness compassion vicarious joy

17
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,560
sympathetic joy from where it's easy we extend extend extend extend extend to

18
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:57,439
include more and more beings extend our heart and we have made our way to this

19
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,040
category of all beings everywhere feeling for the good fortune

20
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:11,360
feeling happy for the happiness of all beings everywhere so

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:20,840
say a couple of words before we get started before we do the practice together the meditation

22
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,400
so in many ways we've been working up to this in the past few days and even

23
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:33,040
if you're joining for the first time tonight is your first time no problem no worries all you need to

24
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,800
know will be shared with you all good so the invitation will be as

25
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:45,360
as i will invite you in the meditation gently little by little is to

26
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,280
feel that beings all beings they have some good fortune they have

27
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,400
all have challenges we all have challenges and we also have something we're grateful for

28
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:04,640
something we're happy about and can we celebrate can we celebrate other beings

29
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:11,519
happiness and good fortune whether it's another human being who's happy for some reason for whatever

30
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,560
gift they have or another being could be a pet

31
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,599
a dog or a cat who is well loved well taken care of or could be some

32
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:28,080
some bird who can imagine that who's got a yummy meal and is celebrating but can

33
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:35,360
we be happy for other beings good fortune and happiness and again if the mind turns too well but not

34
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,799
everything is okay in the world and while they're going extinct yes yes yes that is

35
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:47,440
absolutely true and and in this break we'll save that for compassion practice so

36
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:56,720
so we'll turn our mind to to that with kindness when we're doing compassion practice and here we choose to

37
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:03,920
again i'm going to emphasize this underline it we choose to turn

38
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:10,319
our hearts to the goodness to the good fortune very well knowing that there is plenty

39
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:17,199
of challenges and all that in the world but right now we choose to turn our minds

40
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:24,160
to the goodness and cultivate our heart in the gladness in the goodness of others knowing that

41
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,680
yes there is a time and place for different practices and this is an

42
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,040
intentional practice that we cultivate we choose to and again if you find your

43
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:41,360
mind going other places you can very gently lovingly bring it back okay sweetie it's

44
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:48,080
all right let's let's stay here and if it becomes too challenging and too conflictual just turn to it with

45
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,680
kindness just hold yourself or hold whatever is coming up with kindness with warmth with

46
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,919
compassion and that's okay too no problem so those are the

47
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:07,039

[Music]

189
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:14,880
thank you all for your practice

190
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:23,200
so let's take a few minutes for reflections questions

191
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:28,800
what came up for you you're welcome to type in chat either

192
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:35,440
privately to me in which case i won't say your name or publicly to everyone in which case

193
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:41,040
i'll say your name or you can raise your hand your zoom

194
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:46,640
hand uh to share your reflections your questions your comments your

195
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:54,160
complaints what worked what didn't what did you discover how was this practice for you and

196
00:39:54,160 --> 00:40:02,079
it's all okay this can be a challenging practice can bring up various emotions to work

197
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:08,079
with and it can also be happy making an exuberant it's just a lovely

198
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:13,520
practice of not being you won't be able to smile at some point just doing this

199
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:20,319
practice you can be very happy making him joyous so it's all good so if you like to share

200
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:30,720
reflections your wisdom your yourself with the sangha here is the invitation

201
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:39,839
especially if you haven't shared recently

202
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:53,680
says i often struggle with being emotionally porous like if i speak to someone who's sad or

203
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:59,520
anxious i feel their sadness or anxiety as if it's my own so your instruction to

204
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:06,160
feel someone else's happiness as if it were your own seems like a slippery slope to me

205
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:11,680
is the point to be selective about it ah violet i'm going to ask you to unmute

206
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,880
yourself if you would i want to ask you a little more detail about

207
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:25,200
what you mean uh fury oh so

208
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:33,040
yes can you can you unmute yourself please hi hi um so one example of this

209
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:38,400
one time i was meditating feeling good and i felt or i heard someone outside my

210
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:44,480
door anxious because they spilled something and i got this like hit of anxiety to my

211
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:50,400
chest like in my chest in my throat like i'm not anxious i don't care about this thing that they spilled but now it's

212
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:58,400
like in me and it's mine even though it's not yeah yeah yeah great great

213
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:03,520
that's a great question so

214
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:10,400
so yes and so yes and this practice does make you

215
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:16,880
more more resonant with other people it does and that's a beautiful thing

216
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:23,599
about it and there is how to work with it so that it's not overwhelming which is

217
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:30,079
where you're leading into like wow if i feel if i resonate with everybody's anxiety then

218
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:35,280
wow i'll be a nervous wreck every day yeah so so the beauty of it

219
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:41,119
that you become more resonant you become more i would say more sensitive i think that's a better way to say you

220
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:48,880
become more sensitive so feeling somebody's cry or anxiety oh yes you're sensing instead of your heart being closed like

221
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:56,319
no feelings here like yeah we don't want to live that way to having a wall

222
00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:02,560
up like you can't touch my heart it's not going to resonate so it is beautiful for our heart to be

223
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:08,160
sensitive and that's the first part of it now the second part is okay how do we

224
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:14,480
work with that and it's resonating with joy it's lovely yes we feel their joy and when it's sadness

225
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:22,400
that's when we bring the all the other practices so we bring the stability of equanimity

226
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:30,160
as a as a bedrock and physicality of the body for example

227
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:36,640
to can support it so as i keep talking about ground in your body ground in your body

228
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:43,280
settled in your bodies and that can support with a sense of equanimity to hold what's coming up and then turning

229
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:49,839
kindness to it turning kindness if it's challenge your suffering okay then becomes compassion

230
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:56,960
holding it with kindness and stability so that this resonance the sensitivity doesn't topple you over but

231
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:05,440
you can be stay resonant to your own suffering and to other people's suffering with care with compassion so that

232
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:11,839
is how all of these practices now are connecting together does that make sense violet

233
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:20,839
so it's like you're simultaneously building increased sensitivity with like increased groundedness or

234
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:28,319
strength exactly and as we talked about it uh when we were working with compassion

235
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:35,359
last week's there's a sense of stability and strength and compassion it's not weak or

236
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:41,839
there's a sense of empowerment and compassion so exactly yes we're building all of those together

237
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:47,440
yeah it's it's a more alive way of being in the world sensitive

238
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:53,920
and stable and empowered thank you for that question many many

239
00:44:53,920 --> 00:45:01,860
resonated with you thanks susan [Music]

240
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:10,160
thanks um thanks everybody and nikki thank you um

241
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:17,680
and violet wow that was really helpful i appreciate this topic being being raised i've been

242
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:23,200
working with this well for a while and i'm so happy to know the term toppled

243
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:29,520
because that's what happens and i've been aware of how i can get toppled it like the

244
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:34,720
sadness can topple me but lately i've been tripping on

245
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:40,319
how with mudita i've been aware that like due to my

246
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:45,520
trauma i'm sometimes too leaned out forward

247
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:52,160
and i'm too it'll blow my nervous system out like i get so excited like a little

248
00:45:52,160 --> 00:46:00,960
kid about some something going on that i'm really aware oh dear i've gone too far um

249
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:06,480
but yeah so it's just really nice to have people who understand this process

250
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:13,520
because it's weird a little bit thanks yeah thank you susan i am so glad that you

251
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:19,599
said that articulated that as clearly as you did just now

252
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:26,480
because that is i think some previous times maybe people are asking about this what's called the near enemy

253
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:31,599
of modita that i said is exuberance and people say well what does that feel like

254
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:38,160
and you described it beautifully that is the near enemy of modita when it's toppled it's just like too much it's

255
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:46,560
just too exuberant it's not it's not stable it's not grounded and that's what you're describing um

256
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:53,520
when he loses its stability becomes the near enemy it's not the far enemy which is envy which is the opposite but the near enemy

257
00:46:53,520 --> 00:47:00,240
like it masquerades as the real thing but it's not the real thing because it doesn't have the stability of

258
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:05,680
equanimity to hold it yeah so thanks for that description susan

259
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:12,319
perfect right okay all right dear one so

260
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:18,079

267
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:03,359
mudita for each other's joys just silently looking at the other two people in the group with

268
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:08,640

272
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:33,040
in action mudita in real time see what it's like you've been doing it silently in your heart

273
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:39,839
and now do it in real time see what it feels like when you actually feel happy for somebody else's happiness how

274
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:46,160
how profound that is and then you can share whatever you like about your practice

275
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:52,400
so so those are the invitations and i will create the

276
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:58,960
break out rooms and it will be here we let's see here

277
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:06,480
no it's one more time okay so i'm gonna open the rooms here we go

278
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:12,720
okay welcome back everyone and we have a couple minutes if any

279
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:18,000
questions or comments and i just saw

280
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:24,640
actually something typed by um by aria

281
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:29,839
about when i feel good with the lot of others i feel sad for people who are

282
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:36,160
poor sick and sad is there any way to balance this i think that what comes up as i was inviting you

283
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:41,200
is is both turning into intentionally turning into the goodness

284
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:48,960
and and also you could then if it becomes overwhelming then practice compassion for for

285
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:54,240
the challenge and difficulty that you feel for others but also working with intention

286
00:49:54,240 --> 00:50:00,640
of choosing to do this practice right now and you can practice compassion there we have um that's that would be

287
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:05,040
what i would invite you leena yes

288
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:13,440

292
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:38,400
my question to you was nikki is there any way if people do want to share their emails

293
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:44,160
and numbers is it possible to do that so that if somebody really wants to reach out to someone

294
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:51,440
and vice versa then we can do that that's the google groups that's what neo shared at the beginning

295
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:57,839

296
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:04,640
you can you can join that and then reach out to people individually you know yeah through that did that that

297
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:10,800
is the way lena that's the way we have exactly for the question you asked so that people can join and then reach

298
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:16,720
out to each other through there and make connection through through the google groups
