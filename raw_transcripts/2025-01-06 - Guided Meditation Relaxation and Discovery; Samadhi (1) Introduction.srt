1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:08,840
yeah so I'm here at IRC the our Retreat Center in Santa Cruz California and um

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:17,560
I'm here for a two-day program that I'm helping to teach with Andrea fella and um 15 people we training to

3
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:23,000
be inside teachers then uh we're coming to the end of the four-year training and

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,439
it's been quite special to be here and special to be here with the volunteers

5
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,440
the residents and it's a really a special place to be in some of you maybe

6
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,520
have been here some of you maybe will think of coming on Retreat

7
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:48,000
here so so welcome and happy New

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,960
Year and here at the beginning of the year uh I'll start a extended series on

9
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:02,280
samadi on it's a kind of provisionally we it's called

10
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:08,280
concentration practice concentration states of concentration and um I almost prefer not

11
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,680
to use that word because it often associations with it are very different

12
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,720
than what is being cultivated when we cultivate Samar and then uh so there'll be what

13
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,079
we'll do in the med the meditations and the 15minute talks will kind of very

14
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:31,240
slowly um kind of build up the foundation foundational element ments for

15
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:37,560
somebody and um and uh whether you get

16
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:44,159
concentrated in the way that we call samade or not I'm hoping that in the process of this you'll learn a lot about

17
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,920
uh your capacity of attention and how to harness attention uh for yourself rather

18
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:56,280
than having it uh hijacked by all the different forces growing forces in our

19
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,759
society that um that are trying to uh keep your your attention hostage keep

20
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:10,200
it busy keep it activated um there's a whole attention economy now that I never would have

21
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:16,440
imagined could have existed so for the meditation this

22
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:22,239
morning uh as a beginning for this whole Adventure in

23
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:30,319
samade uh meditation a good way of beginning all meditation uh and then um you know

24
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:38,160
getting a foundation for meditation and mindfulness meditation and concentration is first to uh take a

25
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,200
little bit of of uh Initiative for the state the way that

26
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:50,800
you are not to just go along uh captivated by whatever state you're in

27
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:57,680
and one way to do that is to uh relax a bit to begin a meditation with uh and

28
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,840
it's not just the the value of relaxing but it's also the value of

29
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:11,879
lovingly um uh um kind of uh engaging or taking

30
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:18,920
control or being responsible for how you are rather than the forces of the world

31
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:25,680
dictating uh or the forces of your of uh of a unsettled mind dictating how you're

32
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,000
going to be so to begin harnessing your capacity sa your attention by

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,560
relaxing and that's a standard way in which I teach meditation is to relax the

34
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,840
body the mind the heart and then for the rest of the

35
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:49,239
meditation as a as a kind of a be a very important beginning for these weeks

36
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:56,879
we're going to be exploring somadi that uh the focus today will be on Discovery

37
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:02,360
not after the initial relaxation not being so focused on trying to do

38
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:10,319
anything yet uh getting but to really just spend the time discovering how you

39
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:17,040
are discovering State and quality of the Mind the heart the body with a

40
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,320
willingness to stay that simple to only oh it's like this now it's like this now

41
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:30,880
with no need to oh it's like this now and I have to fix it I have to stop it I have to be different this is not right

42
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,120
all that to put that aside for now so it's a process of

43
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,320
discovery what you might discover is you have all those kinds of ideas it

44
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:49,120
shouldn't be this way I have to make it different I'm not doing it right it should and um but in the process of

45
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:55,840
discovery it's like oh and here again you're beginning to take a certain um

46
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:03,039
initiative or certain control or certain overview of yourself without getting caught in anything and

47
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:08,840
just to discover oh it's like this now it's like this now it's like this now

48
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:16,039
and what you discover about yourself then will be the foundation that you use

49
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:23,400
for uh developing samadi and without that Discovery uh you won't have the raw

50
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,759
material that's needed to gather together for uh these concentrated

51
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:34,440
States so to begin then uh to assume a

52
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:41,479
meditation posture and uh and maybe there's a way

53
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:48,639
of having a somewhat alert posture that allows a deeper

54
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:55,319
relaxation than if you start with a relaxed posture if you have already taken put

55
00:05:55,319 --> 00:06:02,360
yourself into the most relaxed posture you can be uh that might be nice sometimes but for

56
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:10,880
the purposes of samade and Discovery you want to have also some modum of being

57
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,400
alert and so to adjust your body in some way whether you're sitting on a chair

58
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:22,120
the floor lying down um that there's a kind of a an

59
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:28,919
intent intention intentional body to be yes

60
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:38,440
here now and then gently closing your eyes or if

61
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:44,680
you want to keep them open to gently clo lower your

62
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:52,919
gaze and then to take a few long and slow gentle

63
00:06:52,919 --> 00:07:00,240
deep breaths and deeper breaths

64
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,199
expansion of the chest maybe expansion of the

65
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:13,199
belly maybe a certain kind of lifting around your shoulders as you breathe

66
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,440
in allows for a longer

67
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,439
exhale and that longer exhale

68
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,280
to

69
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:56,080
relax or soften in the body

70
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:22,080
and then allowing your breathing to return to normal and to continue

71
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:30,360
relaxing continuing to take a certain degree of initiative or control even

72
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:39,159
over your experience in this very simple way of continuing to relax

73
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,360
soften the Buddha didn't use the word relax though he used the word

74
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,480
calm calming of the

75
00:08:53,959 --> 00:09:02,880
body in with the exhale let there be a calming a away of come through your

76
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:14,600
body that might allow the shoulders to soften

77
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,800
relax the belly to soften

78
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:54,279
and perhaps there can be a calming of the face a loosening relaxing of the muscles

79
00:09:54,279 --> 00:10:02,360
of the face with every exhale for

80
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:46,399
maybe a softening around the eyes if the eyes feel engaged even with

81
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,560
the eyes closed letting the eyeballs rest in

82
00:10:51,560 --> 00:11:00,800
their sockets maybe even by imagining that you're looking backwards and down

83
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,480
into your

84
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,880
body and then your

85
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:31,680
mind you don't have to go along with how the mind is

86
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:37,160
completely you can also begin softening relaxing the

87
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:42,680
mind the thinking mind the thinking

88
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:49,720
muscle maybe with a loving reassuring

89
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:58,839
attention maybe with the attitude it's okay with the exhale let the thinking

90
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:05,880
mind settle soften

91
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:25,680
relax almost as if as you exhale you're allowing the gentle pull

92
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:35,440
of gravity to settle quiet the thinking mind

93
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:42,879
[Music]

94
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:15,800
and for the final relaxation if notice that there's

95
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:23,320
somewhere in your body mind heart that is activated by whatever

96
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:29,120
emotional state you have whatever mood you're in

97
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:37,160
and not necessarily to go to try to stop being the way you

98
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:43,720
are but also not to go 100% along with how you

99
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:50,680
are but to engage in a certain degree of

100
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,360
sovereignty over how you

101
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:05,199
feel by relaxing any way that you're activated by how you

102
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:11,160
feel any place where there it's energized or

103
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:17,920
agitated as you exhale softening relaxing a

104
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,199
bit without ambition to do it a lot just a gentle

105
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:32,319
softening calming of how you are are emotionally

106
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:16,639
and then for the remainder of the meditation have this period be a time of

107
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:22,000
Discovery put aside any ideas of what you're supposed to experience as a

108
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:30,360
meditator or make happen as a meditator with every inhale

109
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:36,959
will discover recognize what's happening for you how you are in your

110
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:43,440
mind your body your heart whatever shows itself to

111
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:51,120
you and with every exhale very simple

112
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:58,920
discovery that does not involve stories explanations

113
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:06,360
reasons and causes just a simple Discovery like

114
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:13,519
you're a naturalist of your own inner life sitting

115
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:21,399
quietly noticing whatever way you

116
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:29,600
are and naturist who watches the animals in the wild without disturbing them

117
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:38,440
allowing them to be as they are to sit quietly naturalist of your

118
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:44,519
own inner life discovering seeing

119
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:53,360
recognizing without any other idea that of what meditation

120
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
is

121
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

122
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

123
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
for

124
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
for

125
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
for

126
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,679
e e

127
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:48,919
one way to practice this discovery is simply to discover where

128
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:51,960
your attention

129
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,360
goes almost as if you're following

130
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:10,240
attention now it goes to a sound now to thinking now to a feeling now to a body

131
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:16,960
sensation back to thinking

132
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:25,159
discover the pulls and pushes on attention and where it

133
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
goes

134
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
for

135
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,520
e for

136
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,440
e e

137
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
that

138
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,320
e e

139
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:26,039
can you discover the difference

140
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:34,240
between discovering what's happening and being lost in what's

141
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
happening

142
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
e

143
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,120
e

144
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,120
e e

145
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,080
and then as we come to the end of this

146
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:21,200
sitting I would like to mention that this process of

147
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:28,600
discovery of Buddhist practice is to discover that we we have

148
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:33,799
a treasure within

149
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:41,360
invaluable goodness possibilities for invaluable

150
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:48,279
Treasures of peace and happiness that can be found

151
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:53,880
within not only ourselves but they can be found in

152
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:59,960
others everyone contains Treasure of goodness

153
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:07,600
the spark of Life on which it's possible to

154
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:14,080
settle be at peace free of

155
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:24,360
unsettling and as we end this sitting May our process of

156
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:31,320
discovery help us appreciate the treasure that's found in everyone we

157
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:38,039
meet everyone is precious everyone is sacred everyone has the

158
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:44,200
capacity for an inner peace and freedom

159
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:54,080
happiness and may we live in such a way that we shine a

160
00:30:54,080 --> 00:31:03,159
light on the goodness in everyone even those for whom their their public

161
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:08,760
display is not that of goodness let us discover and see what's

162
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:14,720
good in everyone so that is what grows in our

163
00:31:18,639 --> 00:31:24,039
world may we see everyone's capacity to be

164
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:29,679
happy so everyone grows in happiness

165
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,919
may we see everyone's ability to feel at

166
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:45,080
ease safe so that they may feel at ease and

167
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:50,960
safe may we see everyone's capacity for

168
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:58,120
peace so we can support the capacity for peace

169
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:04,519
and may we appreciate everyone's ability to discover an inner

170
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:11,000
freedom and may we live in such a way to

171
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:20,120
support the growth of that inner Fe Freedom may all beings be happy

172
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:38,469
[Music]

173
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,760
thank you

174
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:28,720
so hello on this uh first Monday of 2020

175
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:35,600
and happy New Year to all of you and welcome to this new series that uh I'll

176
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:41,600
be doing on titled samadi and the last few years I've been

177
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:47,240
doing a long series some of them 50 60 um sessions

178
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:53,200
long on different uh basic meditation practices that

179
00:33:53,200 --> 00:34:00,279
uh our Buddhism offers I I've done it in anapanasati mindfulness of breathing the

180
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:09,200
four foundations of mindfulness and so today this year I'm going to do uh a whole series on basic

181
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:16,720
instructions and practice of samade the word samade is generally translated into English as

182
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:22,919
concentration and um it's not uncommon for people to not be very satisfied

183
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:29,000
calling it concentration because it it limits it too much and Narrows the scope

184
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,280
of what somebody is and also sometimes it suggests a kind of laser focus and

185
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:41,679
kind of a intensity that's a little bit intense to really um stay focused and

186
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:48,560
one pointedly focused whereas the uh samade is not a particular way of

187
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:57,118
focusing the mind it's a whole state of being it's a whole qualitatively uh uh

188
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:04,280
state of being like if you felt deeply at peace and uh the peace wouldn't be a

189
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:10,200
particular you know activity of the mind it would be something that would be integrated into your whole sense of

190
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:16,839
being your body your heart your mind so in the same way some is something that's integrated and complete and whole and

191
00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:23,680
all of who we are it's a state and to call it kind of a laser

192
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,839
focus of the Mind actually interferes with the relaxing opening to this

193
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:36,359
General whole state and um so today it's a little bit to make some introductory remarks about

194
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:42,839
uh somat and this series we're doing and then um and then we'll just continue and

195
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:53,359
and one of the introductory marks to say is that um is that samadi is a very important uh uh uh state for deepening

196
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:58,760
Buddhist practice uh and it's very important for mindfulness practice ice

197
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:07,480
that uh the depths of mindfulness practice the full potential of it actually um requires uh a degree of

198
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:12,920
samade and the way that I understand teachings of the Buddha that uh

199
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:18,520
mindfulness practice and Samari practice Sati and Samari practice are practicing

200
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:25,160
and in integrated together as being not really two distinct practices but uh

201
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:30,640
they come along sometimes we might emphas excise more uh

202
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:35,960
the the Sade aspects of the mind sometimes more the attentional aspects

203
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:43,119
of the mind of it of mindfulness but they're both going together and they need each other and um they're both

204
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:49,000
accompanying each other um maybe not any maybe not if there the best analogy but

205
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,880
um the left and right foot when you're walking sometimes you step with the left

206
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:02,400
foot sometimes with the right foot and you need them both both in order to walk um if you have an inj I've had an injury

207
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:11,599
in my foot and um and it was very hard to walk um with the you know with the

208
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:17,240
one of my one of my legs so it was like I could bring the back leg when the the

209
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:22,920
the injured leg leg uh up to where my uninjured leg was but the stepping

210
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:30,000
forward always happened with you know the the uninjured leg and it was very awkward and slow to walk that way but to

211
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:37,359
walk in a fully integrated easeful way was to be able to go back and forth between the two so

212
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:46,000
um so both are needed both you both use the other and um in sod and

213
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:53,119
mindfulness so I don't want to set up a sharp dichotomy or distinction between them but for this series it's going to

214
00:37:53,119 --> 00:38:00,520
be focusing on the samade mostly but a lot of mindfulness will be needed in order to engage in the samade activities

215
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:06,000
that we'll be we'll be exploring um and as we go through this

216
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,240
uh the plan is to do this very gradually in very very small steps some of you are

217
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:16,680
already fairly familiar with meditation practice with concentration practice and

218
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:22,920
I'm hoping that if that's the case that uh the slow steps we make putting down

219
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:29,280
the real simple elements that add up to the whole um it will be informative to

220
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:36,000
some of you who maybe never kind of never really tracked this so carefully what it took to be to enter into somat

221
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,960
you understand much better the Dynamics the different elements and pieces that come into

222
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:47,440
play some people have Minds that can naturally drop into deep

223
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:54,040
somat and uh and some people have Minds that are more oriented towards mindfulness and never really kind of

224
00:38:54,040 --> 00:39:01,000
appreciate both of them if it's easy one or the other might not appreciate some some of the different Dynamics in the

225
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,240
mind and the heart that come into play that uh maybe you take for granted and

226
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:13,440
so to go through this very slowly those of you who are new to all this the slow slow steady pace of little drops of

227
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:19,000
pieces of instructions at a time maybe will allow you to follow and go along at

228
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,280
some point as we do this uh you might not follow the instructions but maybe

229
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:31,920
then you use your imagination to get a sense a feel for what talking about so that uh you you have a general sense of

230
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:37,839
what's going on and some point in the future this will become relevant for

231
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:44,440
you so um the um the word

232
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:51,760
samadi uh is U literally the atmology of it uh in

233
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:58,240
Sanskrit and P means more a a collecting a gathering together

234
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:06,240
a um a settling together and there are uh words that are variations of samama

235
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:13,040
that uh specifically means um collecting um sometimes uh collecting

236
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:19,119
fire wood to make a fire you're collecting that sometimes these uh uh

237
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:25,160
related words you know just grammatical variations uh can also mean uh to

238
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:33,880
settle uh to steady and so there's a settling a steadiness of the Mind a gathering of the mind and

239
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:39,240
the idea of gathering is probably one of the most important aspects of samade is

240
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:45,839
that it's not an exclusion of uh uh as it is a is

241
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:51,560
inclusion there's a feeling that all of who we are uh is now

242
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:57,359
included uh but not in a way that's fragmented not in a way that's um uh

243
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:02,839
going off in different directions but rather it's gathering together to work

244
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:10,640
together and be coordinated uh doing the same for the same purpose the same intention everything is here and

245
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:20,280
present but the um uh it's a it's a huge process to man to to settle in to steady

246
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:26,920
in to gather in everything and part of the reason a big pro project is that uh

247
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:35,760
It Go so much against uh the grain U of how Minds often work even in time of the

248
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:43,119
Buddha it was hard for people to develop samade because their minds was uh he used the word monkey mind that just the

249
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:49,440
mind was constantly uh the idea of a monkey mind is that um it's like a

250
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:56,280
monkey that's swinging from the trees that uh as soon as it grabs one branch it's already reaching for the next

251
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:01,640
branch and so it's the mind as soon as soon as it's one place it's reaching for the next

252
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:07,240
place and um so even the time of the Buddha that was true and I imagine it's

253
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:14,440
even more true now in the last 20 years with the Advent of uh te these these

254
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:21,160
smartphones and screens that were on tablets and um that have in some ways

255
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:28,680
unsettled the mind that have activated the mind so it's always searching always surfing the web the next thing the next

256
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:34,920
thing and uh many people have pointed out that the modern mind has lost its

257
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:42,040
capacity it's lost its span of attention the attention span has decreased get bored more there's more

258
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:48,520
like an Impulse like what's next you what's else is there and and rather than settled on one thing and just doing that

259
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:56,680
one thing it's like what's next next next and um and uh it's now there's been all

260
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:03,520
kinds of studies and research done on uh the economics of attention the the

261
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:08,680
attention economy that uh there's people who are paid a lot of money to plan and

262
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:13,920
organize and create a Content that will

263
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:20,040
get you to click get you to look get you to move on um to keep your attention to

264
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:25,480
have you return to look again what's happening what's happening and um you

265
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:33,480
know I've noticed and myself I'm sure some of you as well have this issue that uh um there's an idle moment and to grab

266
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:40,559
for the phone to see is there an email is there a news or something they're constantly being stimulated by what's on

267
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:47,920
a screen and the idea that of sitting and doing nothing and being quiet which

268
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:53,000
uh I think human beings had much greater capacity to do in outside of these

269
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:00,559
modern technological worlds that many of us live in is becoming a uh unavailable

270
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:10,000
State and so somi is uh is a return to a deep natural

271
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:17,680
state of wholeness of subtleness of an open attention which is not being driven

272
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:24,200
by a thirst for more thirst for thirst for content thirs for experiences thirds

273
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:31,559
for search for um serot rush or dopamin rush or something that you get get get

274
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:38,079
discover discover discover want want want and I like to think of it as a

275
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:44,280
process of being turned inside out uh it's a challenge to turn the the the

276
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:50,880
stream the flow of the Mind from wanting and attention going and moving and being

277
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:56,400
outwardly directed or directed towards fantasy and thoughts and anxieties to

278
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:02,280
turn it around around and inside out almost to settle deeply into ourselves

279
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:08,000
and to discover that we get turned inside out and there's a whole new way

280
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:14,640
to live in the world a way where the mind's anxiety the mind's reactivity the

281
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:22,720
mind's overactivity uh is completely settled and quiet and the source of our life

282
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:28,079
arises for some deeper place of peace and well-being and wholeness Within in

283
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:36,359
and the mind is now a vehicle of support a ve a channel for this deep settled

284
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:46,000
peace and happiness that we're capable of rather than the mind being what drives us so maybe the analogy could

285
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,599
be uh rather than having what's on our smartphone

286
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:58,640
screen be where we live uh uh we actually

287
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:05,480
live settled in a very deep steadied way in our inner life in our hearts and our

288
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:11,000
bellies and our mind here and that's what drives that's where the engine

289
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,640
that's where the source of Vitality comes from that's where we find our peace and

290
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:23,319
well-being and to make the transition from a scattered activated

291
00:46:23,319 --> 00:46:29,640
agitated um fragmented mind to a mind that's steadied

292
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:36,760
stable uh gathered and whole uh can be a slow process and a sometimes a very

293
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:42,880
challenging POS process but it's a really worthwhile process and so we'll

294
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:51,359
go through this and maybe discover um some you'll discover something more about what I like to call the Natural

295
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:57,440
State a healthy state that many of us have lost tract with that uh is

296
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:03,400
invaluable for living a wise life so this will be the focus

297
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:09,880
Sadi uh the Gathering Together the healing of the fragmented self into the

298
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:15,200
whole self for the purpos of a deep

299
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:24,760
peace so thank you and um tomorrow I'll be back at IMC and um and I'm happy to

300
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:28,838
be with you on this beginning of the year
