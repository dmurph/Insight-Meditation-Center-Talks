1
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:11,120
well good morning at the

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:18,640
moment I feel a little reluctant to speak I think

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,000
uh sometimes sitting sitting down in this meditation posture I already start

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,759
feeling settled and I also seeing the chats and

5
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:37,079
reflecting on this community on YouTube and our time

6
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,878
together I just feels happy and happy and

7
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:55,120
contented and so words don't seem so I don't know

8
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,879
present so sitting here this way the

9
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:11,400
Highlight or the orientation that becomes clearer than

10
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:18,640
when maybe I'm a little bit quicker to speak or have something

11
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,880
on my mind to speak is that what's also close by is a

12
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:31,840
feeling of Freedom a freedom of

13
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:41,240
it's more like I'm aware of the the pauses and silence in the music

14
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:47,680
more than the notes being played or aware of the space in a large

15
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:55,119
room more than the people and things in the room and I'm more aware of a sense of

16
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,560
freedom from pressure and tension and clinging

17
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:07,360
then I am the kind of things that I would be thinking about speaking

18
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,280
about what I'm doing in the

19
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:23,519
moment so to sit with an orientation to meditate

20
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:31,480
with an orientation of what's not here the of one wonderful

21
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,480
absence not because we're remembering what's not here but because we

22
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:45,319
feel the peace that's right here the space that's right

23
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:54,879
here to see a door that's wide open and to freely walk through it is to

24
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:01,480
appreciate the empty space of the doorway

25
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,760
so to begin our

26
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:11,720
meditation assuming

27
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,640
a meditation post posture which is appropriate for

28
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,080
you and every time we go to

29
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:32,239
meditate what an appropriate posture is changes even ever so

30
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:38,040
slightly and the longer we meditate the more we're attuned to the

31
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:45,080
subtleties of the choices the way of sitting the adjustments to be

32
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:57,120
made the longer we sitting the more it's a homecoming to go into this

33
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,560
posture and gently closing your

34
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:15,920
eyes and regardless of if there's tension or pressure or

35
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:24,479
preoccupation can you also find in your body or heart or

36
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,600
mind an appreciation

37
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:38,198
allowing your yourself to become

38
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,520
quieter

39
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,840
Stiller the absence of busy

40
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,360
activity maybe an absence

41
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,560
of a busy mind

42
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,000
the mind that begins to quiet and

43
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:35,800
settle and then I C easy way in a way that feels just right for

44
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:45,759
your breathing take some deeper breaths deeper inhales longer

45
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,160
exhales just deep enough that you

46
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,560
enjoy and if you enjoy the deeper

47
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,599
breathing enter into that pleasure as you

48
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,240
breathe stay close to

49
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,240
it as you exhale see if you can find some pleasure

50
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,520
enjoyment in relaxing the

51
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:04,840
body letting the breathing return to normal and is there any enjoyment or

52
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,039
pleasure however

53
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:15,160
subtle in a simple ordinary

54
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
breathing

55
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:46,000
and then as you breathe as you exhale to go through different points of

56
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,680
your body face shoulder belly

57
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:58,319
elsewhere and soften relax your body and see if there can be

58
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:05,120
some small pleasure in the

59
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:14,639
relaxing even if otherwise you're challenged with some emotion or

60
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:22,800
state there on the edges of how you are feel the enjoyment of

61
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
relaxing

62
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
e

63
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:23,279
and then centering yourself on the body's

64
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:31,120
experience of breathing

65
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,560
and in the most immediate here and

66
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:48,959
now as if there's no future things to do or past to

67
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:57,640
remember here and now is there any feeling or sense of

68
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:06,399
contentment appreciation of just this

69
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:27,240
here any pleasure of just being present

70
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:33,880
here enter into that

71
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:41,440
enjoyment however small it is as a

72
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,320
doorway to not prioritizing other things that you tend

73
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,200
to be caught up

74
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
in

75
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959

if

85

meditation is a practice of

86
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,560
contentment a contentment that's

87
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,839
found in the Silence of the the

88
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:08,040
mind like the silence between notes in

89
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:30,519
music or the spaciousness of a large open space

90
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,279
where there's lots of breathing room just to

91
00:16:51,279 --> 00:17:00,480
be we a Stillness of an early morning

92
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,520
before there's any feeling of needing to do

93
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:26,839
anything a full contentment is a Stillness of the body and

94
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:30,919
mind in here and

95
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:42,440

alive enter that contentment and

97
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400

for

108
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:19,000
during meditation there doesn't have to be a

109
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:26,120
reason to be peaceful to be

110
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,278
content to be

111
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:43,279
happy these States can be allowed to arise and

112

be for no

113
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:55,320

114
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
breathing

for

120
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,880
and then as we come to the end of this

121
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,760
meditation to once again relax on the

122
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:02,480
exhale relax the whole

123
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,720

soften soften the thinking

126
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:45,840
mind releasing tension associated with

127
00:27:55,399 --> 00:28:00,960
thinking releasing any a contraction

128
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,278
around your

129
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:23,960
emotions and perhaps quietly sitting here for a

130
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:29,039
minute or so attuned

131
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:36,279
to a freedom of heart a freedom of mind that allows all things to be as

132
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:40,279
they are just for

133
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:49,399

contentment

135
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:25,320
and then preparing yourself for the end of the meditation turn the Mind's Eye

136
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:32,360
outward to gaze up on the world that you'll return to from your

[Music]

147
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,518
free and thank

148
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,159
you

149
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:09,720
warm greetings for the last Fifth and last Talk of the series on

150
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:18,080
attitudes and today the topic is going from stress to

151
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:23,600
freedom and I want to propose that stress might be seen as a kind

152
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:30,039
of uh attitude in that it can be pervasive it can be chronic that we

153
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:37,639
carry stress in our bodies and hearts and minds and it also um it's kind of like a

154
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:44,440
mood in that it has an influence on us uh we're not stress if we're uh stressed

155
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:49,480
there's no there's a cost to being stressed it's not without an impact that

156
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:54,600
it has on us and one of the impacts a stress can have especially ongoing

157
00:32:54,600 --> 00:33:02,360
stress is that it self- reinforces that uh ongoing stress is

158
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:09,279
stressful ongoing stress is uncomfortable and then how we react to

159
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:18,240
discomfort is sometimes with more stress so uh if we are afraid that's stressful

160
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:24,840
to live with chronic anxiety and but that discomfort of that anxiety uh makes

161
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:33,320
us want to somehow respond react do something um that reinforces it because

162
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:38,440
if we feel stress around being anxious or anxiety produces stress that creates

163
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:44,600
discomfort and then we have more reason to be or more fuel for being anxious

164
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:53,519
same thing with being angry and resentful or envious same thing with having full of um craving and

165
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:59,000
ambition uh same thing with being confused used there's a many things

166
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:06,240
which feel very uncomfortable and uh and in that discomfort there's a birth of stress

167
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:12,480
which makes us more uncomfortable which gives birth to more stress so for this reason I think of

168
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:18,358
stress as being like an attitude we have an attitude of stress almost as if we go

169
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:25,000
into any situation at all and the attitude is this is going to be challenged for me and this is going to

170
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:33,320
be uncomfortable and so I tense up I contract I feel internal pressure uh

171
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:41,878
pushing leaning forward holding back um making myself small making

172
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:47,320
myself big in an assertive way uh to get what I think I need to do to protect

173
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:53,240
myself or get what I think I need to have so all these things this kind of forcefulness

174
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:59,440
stressfulness um uh becomes chronic and becomes kind of continually reinforcing

175
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:09,160
a discomfort which drives more of the same the alternative is uh to search for

176
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:16,000
the freedom in any circumstance we're in the freedom from stress the freedom from

177
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:24,040
reactivity the freedom from pressure or tension the freedom from straining and

178
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:30,480
um or or pulling back or making ourselves all or or asserting

179
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:37,960
ourselves that um there's a freedom that comes from not asserting

180
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:45,599
ourselves in some aggressive way and not um diminishing ourselves in any kind of

181
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:52,119
way a uh freedom of just being able to breathe as if you have complete

182
00:35:52,119 --> 00:36:00,440
permission to be alive to be present to breathe to to be valuable and important

183
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:05,640
that no one can take away from you no one can take away your

184
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:12,640
basic capacity to find that middle way between

185
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:20,359
assertion and collapse pushing forward pressure and pulling back and giving up

186
00:36:20,359 --> 00:36:25,720
and having maybe apathy even apathy is also kind of

187
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:30,920
stressful its own way but that middle way of just like here I

188
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:38,680
am here I am and I'm allowed to breathe I'm allowed to have my eyes be relaxed and not

189
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:46,160
straining or trying to figure something out I'm allowed just to be relaxed and present

190
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,440
in my body and a a milestone or turning point

191
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:57,319
in the practice of Buddhism and meditation is to have a visceral feeling

192
00:36:57,319 --> 00:37:02,359
of freedom of an absence of stress of an

193
00:37:02,359 --> 00:37:07,720
absence of the Mind straining or pushing or collapsing or pulling

194
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:15,560
back uh a sense of ease and just Simplicity that is almost as if there's

195
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:24,520
an absence of any demands on us absence of any demands we put on

196
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:30,800
ourselves we can still take care of of things we can still do things and accomplish things but we do it without

197
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:36,440
stress we do it without any sense of demand a sense of should a sense of Duty

198
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:42,720
that is burdensome to carry with us that we do it in with

199
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:48,359
freedom some people that idea of fre doing things with freedom means that we

200
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:56,200
do it without expectations or measuring ourselves by the results we do it because we do it

201
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:02,880
complete completely fully freely and we deal with the results when

202
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:10,359
the results occur whether they occur or not uh it's in the doing in a free way

203
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:16,240
that we find our joy or happiness so at some point in meditation

204
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:22,319
there starts to be an inkling a small it's kind of like the you know the just

205
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:27,560
the beginning of light of the Dawn as the dawn begins to show a little inkling

206
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:35,680
a little hint of what it's like to be free what it's like to be unattached or

207
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:41,520
non straining what it's like to be without stress maybe there's still

208
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:49,880
stress in our system but there's some place where some chronic stress is beginning to relax ah look at that

209
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:57,200
that's possible and as that sense of nonstress non strain non non-

210
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:05,079
contraction non pressure begins to get stronger a point comes where this

211
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:11,640
becomes compelling this becomes a reference point for how we live our lives this

212
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:17,520
becomes a kind of an attitude of Freedom an attitude that is an

213
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:24,079
orientation towards the freedom that's always here always available here and

214
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:29,240
now and maybe that you have most most of us will have more freedom in the moment

215
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:34,599
than we Avail ourselves of or more freedom that we're living in than we

216
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:41,440
notice because the mind has a selective uh attention where it's focuses on what

217
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:48,200
it's afraid of What It Wants What It doesn't like and tends to be absorbed and then spin out and be caught up in

218
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:56,119
its own little world but at some point there's an attitude that we live in a mood that we

219
00:39:56,119 --> 00:40:01,280
live in in or a orientation or a view that

220
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:08,280
um of freedom of uh absence of strain of and

221
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:13,480
there's many uh things that come with this sense of

222
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:19,200
Freedom today I'm thinking of contentment kind of just a Content just

223
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:27,280
to be alive just to be here just to do what we're doing when we're doing it and um

224
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:33,760
sometimes it's comes along with a sense of love or care for the world around

225
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:41,119
us not having stress does not mean we don't care in fact care that's done

226
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:48,319
through stress is probably not done with love but more maybe a sense of Duty

227
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:55,040
maybe and um or something else but the the love that comes out of

228
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:02,720
Freedom that Joy the contentment so to go from

229
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:10,040
stress to Freedom not just assume that the

230
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:17,480
alternative to stress is being D being without stress

231
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:23,480
de-stressed but that the alternative to stress is a certain kind of Freedom that

232
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:29,240
gives us lots of breathing room Freedom that gives us a sense of fresh air for

233
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:36,280
the heart or the Mind an openness a brightness a

234
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:41,319
peacefulness that's the what's available when there's when we figure out how to

235
00:41:41,319 --> 00:41:47,960
release our stress as we become more relaxed as we

236
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:55,640
living less stressful look for the freedom become let this let's Freedom be

237
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:03,359
recognized so that it starts becoming the attitude with which we live an attitude of

238
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:09,078
staying free staying not caught

239
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:17,720
up and in so be in so doing being wonderfully available to the world as an

240
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:27,160
emissary of Freedom as a model of Freedom as a

241
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:33,520
in it's in a certain kind of way a giving the gift of

242
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:41,839
freedom because we're not imposing our stress on anyone else we're doing the

243
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:47,880
opposite we're imp we're offering others space to be who they
