1
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,840
so welcome another warm welcome to everyone from everywhere

2
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:21,600
joining here together in this 7 a.m pacific time sitting

3
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:29,199
and so i'm going to begin so just allow yourself to settle in

4
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:36,800
maybe take some generous moments to settle into a sitting posture as conducive for

5
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,280
a little bit of a meditative practice

6
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:49,520
and this week i wanted to maybe offer a

7
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:57,199
guided meditation that starts with what i call the arriving sequence

8
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:03,039
and this is something i learned from some of my teachers

9
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:09,520
dana de palma and tuarey salah and then philip moffat

10
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:16,720
who's their teachers our teachers and so this arriving sequence

11
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,479
uses the three a's arriving

12
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:30,000
and then uh being available

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,840
um and then becoming becoming available

14
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:43,680
and then aligning so those are three words and you probably will begin to hear

15
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:51,600
repeatedly as we go along in this five days of a meditation practice

16
00:01:53,200 --> 00:02:00,079
and so we'll begin with a writing sequence and then uh in this week i wanted to

17
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:05,119
offer some words using the elements

18
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:11,120
elements that make up our body as part of our meditative practice

19
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,560
so earth air water fire and space

20
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,200
and this is going to be a build up from the first day and all the way to

21
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,520
on the friday and so if you join in between you will

22
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:37,840
pick it up because we will be repeating some of this as we go along

23
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,200
so let's begin

24
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,560
arriving

25
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,599
arriving here and now

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,280
maybe the word arriving evokes some sense of

27
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,800
beginning to settle in

28
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,720
and sometimes i have the sense of coming back home

29
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,000
after a long trip arriving home

30
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,840
maybe putting away the bags add

31
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:43,680
a big jacket in the same way as we arrive

32
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:51,360
maybe we put away the plans the projects memory

33
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,360
we arrive at the present moment

34
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,599
experience over here and now

35
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:22,120
maybe that's felt as the contact of the body with the chairs and the floor

36
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:38,599
there's some long deep breath that's happening right now

37
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,880
arriving home the home of this body

38
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:16,720
take a few moments to just checking into yourself

39
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,639
maybe the sitting posture

40
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,680
maybe how you are in your mind

41
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,520
not as a way to evaluate judging it

42
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:45,719
just to receive what is happening here now

43
00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:00,240
as you arrive make yourself available

44
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:09,520
to the lived experience that's happening right now right here

45
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,080
in this body

46
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,280
being available is pointing at

47
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,240
the sense of receiving experience

48
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,960
as they arrive and pass

49
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:16,319
and not demanding it to be any way just making ourselves available

50
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:23,800
to whatever is happening right here

51
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:44,879
and then we align align our being with a wholesome

52
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,759
cultivation

53
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:59,840
aligned with our inner integrity inner dignity

54
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:09,440
sometimes for me aligning may be experienced as

55
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:16,680
i throw so slightly a little bit of uplifting in my torso

56
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:03,600
making ourselves available to the physicality of our bodies

57
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,440
i invite you to maybe turn attention to the third sense of earth element in the

58
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,440
body

59
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,120
maybe you're feeling the firmness

60
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:37,320
as you make contact with earth and floor chairs

61
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,560
hardness of the bones

62
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:55,959
your tongue pushing against the teeth partners of the teeth

63
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,120
earth element is a heavy

64
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,560
maybe subtly that settling downwards

65
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:44,680
making ourselves available for the felt sense of earth element

66
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,519
letting go of any big ideas about what this is

67
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,440
however it's about in the body

68
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,040
it is okay

69
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,800
the earthy body resting on earth

70
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,959
maybe you feel some sense of the steadiness as you rest in

71
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,839
the earthy body

72
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,839
there is a stillness in the earth element

73
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,959
on moving

74
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:01,240
look at foundations of a building

75
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:44,399
and the mind wanders away and always invite ourselves to arrive

76
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,399
again

77
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,799
being available to the first sense of earth element

78
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,279
in this body

79
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:54,880
being available is like letting go of any exertion or

80
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:02,480
control rather open our heart and mind to

81
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,480
receive

82
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:23,440
noticing our experience that may be pleasant and

83
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,320
unpleasant

84
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,960
maybe pain or discomfort in the body

85
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,160
and pay careful attention to see

86
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,240
how are we reacting or responding

87
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,799
to the experience of a pleasant and unpleasant

88
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:19,320
or they are pushing away resisting wishing the unpleasant to go away

89
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:27,520
are their signs of ease openness

90
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,080
kindness

91
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,960
do all of this

92
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:15,880
the buddha offered a teaching to his son rahula

93
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,840
you said to your son young son

94
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:31,840
meditate like earth when you meditate like earth

95
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:39,440
pleasant unpleasant experiences will not occupy your mind

96
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:51,520
so we won't get caught when we meditate in the stillness and stability

97
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:58,799
that's manifested in the earth meditated like earth

98
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:04,559
steady stable

99
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,919
unmoving

100
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,840


101
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:38,240
as we transition into the short tarmet

102
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:43,679
for this mornings i invite you to continue

103
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:51,559
maybe to stay in a meditative mode if you like

104
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:58,000
and so i intentionally didn't ring the bell

105
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,320
as an invitation for you to maybe receive this teachings

106
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,158
in a different way maybe

107
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:18,120
and so this week i wanted to share

108
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,398
some words about selah

109
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:32,919
i called these mornings of the teachings the blessings of vasila

110
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:39,440
sila is a pony term that's often used to translate as a virtuous conduct

111
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:46,559
a virtuous behavior and one can think of it as

112
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:54,000
behaving virtuously through one's bodily and verbal actions

113
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,120
and so there is an outer expression of sila

114
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:05,760
and that may be an um natural extension of our inner being

115
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:11,840
and the inner integrity i have mentioned in our sitting

116
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,799
the inner care inner tenderness

117
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:24,640
and so this week i wanted to offer the exploration of vasila from

118
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:31,120
this inside out kind of orientation

119
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:37,840
and this is not the only way that we used to explore sila

120
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:43,440
and i thought i try something different in fact

121
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:51,039
the classic teachings of facilla often began

122
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:57,519
from refraining harmful actions externally

123
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:02,880
and then kind of from outside in but i thought that

124
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:08,320
many of you have been uh practicing and this is 7 am

125
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:13,840
sittings and maybe many other ways so i thought maybe we'll do something a

126
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:21,679
little different about sila just an inside out kind of orientation

127
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,760
and also wanted to offer a free framework for us to explore this

128
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:35,600
and that is the framework of triple a and i'm calling again another

129
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:41,600
aaa 3a that's different from our meditation triple a

130
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:48,559
so this is three a's are aware ab sting

131
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:54,240
and a line oh i see uh there's some um messages

132
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:01,519
about whether the sound is okay um and if there is a couple of people can

133
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:08,559
just type in the chat box and see if my volume is okay and now

134
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:13,839
okay so i do see a few people saying okay

135
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:20,079
um i'll speak louder hopefully that'll help

136
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:26,320
you for letting me know also and so this triple a aware

137
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:33,320
abstinent and align um

138
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:44,320
okay so aware means that um

139
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:50,158
as we cultivate mindfulness we become aware of our inner dynamics

140
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:56,560
and inner forces and that operate inside of us

141
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:02,400
we notice some dynamics and forces that may lead to

142
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:08,960
harmful consequences harmful outcome and then we abstain

143
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:14,000
from the harmful actions and harmful forces

144
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,040
and then line says that we align with

145
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:26,400
wholesome qualities so as we become aware we can also pay attention and see

146
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:34,640
how the whole sum can come about and so as we begin to notice this

147
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:39,680
and we can cultivate align ourselves with the wholesale and skillful

148
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,720
in our actions in our behavior and so this is the framework i'm going

149
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:50,960
to use and to explore this aspects of fasila

150
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:57,280
the classic teachings of sila especially for the lay community

151
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,320
are often as referred to as undertaking the training

152
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:08,800
rules of five precepts and today i'll share some reflections of

153
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:15,200
the first one which is undertaking the training rules of

154
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:21,839
not taking the lives of a living being or not killing living beings

155
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:27,680
and so you may all wonder why bother right especially right after

156
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:33,680
a meditative practice and none of us are killing anybody or

157
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:40,680
any living beings so why would we explore this

158
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:46,960
uh well and to answer this question i wanted to

159
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:53,280
maybe unpack on the poly term that's related to this particular precept a

160
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,720
little more the pali term on

161
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:05,040
panettipata in particular has this sense of the very vivid sense

162
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:10,160
of exerting some kind of violence kind of

163
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:16,320
like a striking down um a living being which would lead to

164
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:25,599
um taking the life of a living being and so for me uh the sense of

165
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:33,359
violence aggression is what this precept is also pointing at

166
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:41,040
and so let's explore this uh from the uh the inner perspective we talked about

167
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:46,320
in our guided meditation i invited you to

168
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:55,839
maybe take pay attention and becoming aware how we might relate to our

169
00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:02,000
inner experiences that pleasant unpleasant experience that happened in us

170
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,280
in particular the unpleasant experience

171
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:16,000
i'm just kind of curious what you might notice it's very often that when

172
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,400
there is unpleasant whether it's pain and discomfort in the body

173
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:30,079
often there can be an attitude of pushing it away wanting it to go away

174
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:35,200
or sometimes we even have you know maybe subtle sense of

175
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:40,560
aggression towards it if we had a um

176
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:46,920
an option to somehow get rid of that we would have done it right

177
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:56,079
and so there are some of those kind of anger forces that can happen and as we become aware of them

178
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:01,838
we see oh you know this can happen within us

179
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,160
and this kind of forces when it gets manifested externally

180
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:14,720
it can express itself as aggression or violence version

181
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:21,119
and so for example now we may all have had this experience

182
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:30,240
that um you know a bee or a fly is a buzzing around us non-stop and it's not going away

183
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:35,599
so yeah and we all kind of abide to this

184
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:42,720
first precept and not wanting to kill kill the bee or kill the fly but we can

185
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:48,480
act um maybe at some point we get really frustrated and we'll kind of pull we

186
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:56,880
throw our hands up and and you know what uh from the perspective the b and the fly and this

187
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,560
gesture might be life-threatening or

188
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:08,800
some sense a little violent

189
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:17,599
so as we tune in to our inner dynamics we can begin to see oh

190
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:24,000
how we relate to unplugged unpleasant experience

191
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,960
internally can get manifested externally

192
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:37,440
and so this preceptor invites us to begin to really tune in to some of these forces

193
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:46,000
and abstain from externally externally not killing living beings

194
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,040
but also maybe pointing internally are there some

195
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:57,200
different ways to relate to unpleasant experience

196
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:03,920
in the sutta that i quoted on about the teachings of

197
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,520
the buddha offered to his son rahula and it reads like this

198
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,520
i'm going to read this piece again

199
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:21,200
rahula meditated like the earth when you meditate like the earth

200
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:27,280
pleasant and unpleasant contacts will not occupy your mind

201
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:33,440
so what is pointing at is that as we cultivate

202
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:40,559
mindful awareness our inner capacity grows

203
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:50,000
we can begin to have a choice of not being moved by the experienced and pleasant of

204
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:58,160
unpleasant maybe we you know use the word um

205
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:03,359
equanimity for it maybe we can be equanimous to our

206
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:08,720
experience that are pleasant and unpleasant

207
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:15,440
and so this is a form of alignment a line with a whole sound qualities

208
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:22,560
kindness compassion equanimity i remember that many years ago when i

209
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:28,560
was learning meditation from a chinese numb

210
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:34,000
once she was offering me a meditation instruction

211
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,839
right in the courtyard of um tatakata meditation center

212
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:45,599
and we were standing right under a uh a tree

213
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:51,280
and then there was a bug falling off right on hero

214
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:57,599
and i was about to jump out but she very gently using the cup of the hand

215
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:03,920
picked up the bug and gently put it on the ground

216
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:12,720
that was a very powerful teaching for me i thought to myself at that moment wow

217
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:20,000
there's something very precious and beautiful in her

218
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:31,359
and so this brought me much trust and confidence in the teachings of the buddha in the

219
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:38,839
buddha dharma and sangha also lots of trust in this teacher of my own and chinese

220
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:44,079
nun offering the teachings because the way that she expressed to

221
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:49,200
herself offered such a possibility of the kind

222
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:54,680
of a heart and mind in each of us

223
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:02,720
and so the flip side of not killing is to offer our deep respect

224
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:10,240
and the appreciation to all beings all living all lives around us

225
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:15,838
and all lives are wonderous on this planet

226
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:24,560
we are only an aspect of this whole ecosystem

227
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:30,560
so our lives are intertwined with the different species and nature

228
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:38,480
so who are way to decide on how other lives must live or not

229
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,240
and so align with kindness align with

230
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:52,480
gentleness align with respect

231
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:01,920
and so this is three aspects of aware becoming aware of our inner dynamics

232
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:08,480
and um taking actions to abstain from that is

233
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:14,960
unwholesome unskillful and harmful and then um

234
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:22,240
aligning ourselves with that is wholesome and so the practice of this first

235
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:30,079
precept offers much protection and safety to oneself and to all beings

236
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:35,280
so as such this precept is a true blessing

237
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,560
very very much true blessing for all beings

238
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:47,680
and so i want to share this a few words and to end today's tarmet and this is from the

239
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:55,200
mankala suta and the suta for blessings and it says the buddha said that

240
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:02,160
desisting and abstaining from evil diligence in good qualities

241
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:08,640
respect and humility this is the highest blessing

242
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:16,319
so may you all be blessed by your virtuous conduct and you practice

243
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:23,839
so thank you all for being here and um i see there are maybe some challenges in

244
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:29,359
terms of a volume and sound and i hope i'll do something uh today to

245
