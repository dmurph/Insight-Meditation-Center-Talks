1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:10,320
okay hello and welcome everyone to happy hour lovely to be with you and and uh hear

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:18,180
your hellos see your faces so for tonight's practice um I wanted to

3
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:24,840
bring in this framing um something that I learned um

4
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,240
uh recently so

5
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,800
so um and it has to do with Natural Sciences it has to do with the way that

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,660
our minds work our minds work our brains work our body works

7
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:50,280
so uh the visual system as as an example of how we process information in the past

8
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,520
scientists thought and and you know when we do naive reasoning we think that okay

9
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:03,000
there's an object in the world and the visual processing you know the the road

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,920
the cones and rods and you know we process the shapes and colors and lines and it's all sent to the brain for

11
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:18,360
processing and we go aha it's a cat right that's the way naive uh biology

12
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,000
but it actually turns out that scientists have discovered that there

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,140
are more um uh uh uh what is it called uh

14
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:37,500
um uh not neurons but these long um there's more information sent from

15
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:44,159
the brain to the eyes instead of from the eyes to the brain there are more Pathways that's the word I'm looking for

16
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,720
there are many many more uh Pathways from the brain sending down information

17
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:57,119
to the eyes instead of eyes to the brain like okay so scientists first realize

18
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:04,740
this it's an interesting quandary like why is that like that's surprising And yet when you think of it it makes sense

19
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:10,679
because if if our information processing is humans we have to process all pieces

20
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:17,220
of information fresh and fresh and fresh it would be so inefficient and nature is

21
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,620
very efficient so guess what the brain actually is sending down

22
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:29,160
expectation for what it expects to see what it expects to see to the eyes and

23
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:36,599
the eyes are just seeing the difference it's it's actually very similar to many computer algorithms for image processing

24
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:43,560
that you don't always process if you're processing say video you just process the differential you know if there's a

25
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:50,519
movement like oh you only process that or you're uh you don't have to process every frame over and over so it's just

26
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:56,340
your expectation so basically with the implication that this has for us as

27
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:02,760
human beings is that we construct our reality we know this and yet this is

28
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:08,340
such an interesting example where our brain is constructing our reality

29
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:13,440
through its expectations we expect to see maybe a cat because we just perhaps

30
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,480
process the cat or this is the you know this is the animal we expect to see when

31
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:25,739
we open the door and and that's and and not only with our visual system in in

32
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:33,060
the world the brain sends us to our processing systems what it expects to see and then our processing system oh

33
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:40,379
gleans the information to kind of to support the the suggested delusion that

34
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:48,120
our brain has so so this example of the visual system is is so interesting and radical and yet

35
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,159
it's the same it's the same with how we process information otherwise in the

36
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:58,560
world so if we are looking at the world the sense of okay this person is mean to

37
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:05,040
me and the world is a mean place an unfriendly place an unkind Place well guess what we're going to see guess what

38
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:13,019
we're going to pick up and yet if we expect kindness oh yes the

39
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:18,900
world is a kind place this person is kind I am kind I see my own goodness

40
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:25,800
gets guess what we see guess what we perceive so our perception is based on

41
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,440
our expectation is the in the most fundamental way in many ways of

42
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,199
processing I just bring up the visual system as an example so we create our

43
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:43,259
own reality and um and not only physicists and and

44
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:48,660
natural scientists um this is the new way of thinking but also

45
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:54,780
of course philosophers and and and um contemplatives we create our own

46
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:03,780
reality so let's create a reality that is kind let's set up these expectations that are

47
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:11,820
kind that are generous that are onward leading let's set these expectations for

48
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:17,520
kindness for goodness for Goodwill so that is the part of our training

49
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,860
um in this practice at happy hour we we train ourselves our our habitual

50
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:29,400
patterns our expectations our set point however way you want to relate to it to

51
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:35,940
be one of Goodwill kindness so that that's how we act that's what we perceive that's

52
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:41,220
how the world becomes through our perceptions through our set point so

53
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:47,100
enough of a framework tonight so let's let's uh

54
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:52,320
let's set the conditions for Good Will and kindness that's actually tonight I

55
00:05:52,320 --> 00:06:00,199
think I want to do gratitude and appreciation seeing the good in the world so let's do that so

56
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:06,419
so so let's practice let's settle let's arrive in our bodies

57
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:09,419
foreign

58
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:21,539
settling it's always first with the breath

59
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:29,060
with the body arriving arriving

60
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:54,360
receiving the breath with appreciation all the sensations of sitting

61
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:03,979
feet touching the Earth hands touching our lap said bones

62
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:11,100
on the chair and let's be silent and just settle

63
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:18,180
relax the body connect with the breath appreciatively

64
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:30,539
foreign

65
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,940
foreign

66
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:45,560
thank you not now giving my heart to this practice right now

67
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,820
just letting the breath be received in the abdomen

68
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:29,640
how lovely to be able to sit in and breathe

69
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,420
Sublime

70
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,580
and receive each breath in this body with appreciation

71
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,800
as if a new beginning

72
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,620
foreign

73
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:36,420
receive the sensations appreciatively

74
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,680
throughout the body

75
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,860
this feeling of being alive

76
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:14,940
through these Sensations we know you're alive foreign

77
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:56,279
foreign exhale letting go

78
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:02,420
a little bit into relaxation

79
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,240
foreign

80
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,560
foreign

81
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:48,839
how can we turn expanding expanding the sense of

82
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:56,060
presence as if her breath was a little

83
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:01,079
wider not just through our body but a little wider

84
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:05,000
the breath is breathing us

85
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,959
we're sitting in this

86
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:21,500
space spacious being calm soothed

87
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:26,600
through the reverberations of our breath

88
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,459
Beyond

89
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,339
our skin

90
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,620
thank you

91
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,040
and now as we said

92
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:45,139
feelings Sensations spaciously being breathed

93
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,039
a spacious container

94
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,740
opening our heart

95
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:14,240
inviting something that we appreciate to Walt's end

96
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:22,340
not going out and searching for it but just opening the door

97
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,000
letting it

98
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:33,860
gently saunter it

99
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,840
be something close near just maybe your breath

100
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,240
with the sense of being able to sit upright

101
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,799
something we usually take for granted or let this goodness

102
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:07,860
whatever it is as Waltz whilst in let it fill your heart

103
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:14,460
relish with each breath keep connected to the breath

104
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:18,740
relishing appreciating

105
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,120
foreign

106
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,640
with the breath and Sensations foreign

107
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:24,059
container relax the body with ease inviting is something else

108
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:28,039
it wants it to your heart

109
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,840
foreign

110
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:12,840
so there's not too much switching here and there it can

111
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:18,480
imbalance the Mind settle stay with something for a little while

112
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:25,400
and in your own time [Music] in hide another guest

113
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:34,100
come in and be appreciated another gift into your heart

114
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:35,039
foreign

115
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:03,299
foreign

116
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:40,519
foreign

117
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:50,340
something about ourselves to appreciate

118
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:58,020
appreciate we often focus on we don't appreciate we judge ourselves but turn invite

119
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:04,880
something we appreciate about ourselves what we're doing we're not doing

120
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:19,519
or being and not being foreign

121
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,720
foreign

122
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,039
foreign

123
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:19,669
[Music]

124
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:39,600
this person owes me doing their best

125
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:45,740
and thus appreciating this effort

126
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:35,520
and now turning opening up to perhaps aspects that

127
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:41,899
are somewhat challenging or have been challenged

128
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,059
be not the most challenging items but

129
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:50,960
some things

130
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:01,039
challenging and seeing the gift seeing the good

131
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,399
in between

132
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:23,120
at night I feel grateful for this too can I is it possible and if the answer

133
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:29,760
comes back no it's okay don't push it move on to something else

134
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:35,059
and ask the question can I not possible

135
00:32:09,539 --> 00:32:13,700
imagine the situation that

136
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:20,419
it may not be the easiest for you right now

137
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:27,779
for someone else in a completely different situation this would be an absolute blessing

138
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:33,000
for example if your work is very heavy very demanding

139
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,880
you're tired someone else doesn't have a job would

140
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,140
love to be in your shoes

141
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:50,179
can you appreciate the good

142
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:58,460
not to condone the challenges but the good

143
00:33:54,360 --> 00:34:02,220
and as we bring this meditation session to close

144
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:07,980
and we appreciate ourselves this opportunity

145
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:15,898
offered the community through technology all the amazing

146
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:21,720
causes and conditions that have to be

147
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:29,280
appreciate all of this and are showing up we open our hearts wide and appreciate

148
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:36,019
all of that giving it a big appreciative hug

149
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:47,240
and sharing our blessings our goodness for gladness with all beings everywhere

150
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:58,020
may all beings be happy may all beings be free

151
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:01,980
including ourselves

152
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,740
foreign

153
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:42,420
I think there was still problem with the audio did you hear the Bell no no okay

154
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:48,200
let's try that again yes

155
00:35:56,099 --> 00:36:02,660
lovely thank you all for your practice

156
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:13,260
so let's let's move things around a little bit I'm going to uh open the chat but

157
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:18,900
what I'd like to invite us to do actually instead of sharing Reflections inviting your Reflections now

158
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:26,339
let's move into the small groups now and we'll save space at the end for Reflections just trying something a

159
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:33,180
little different so the invitation for the small groups

160
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:39,240
is um is we'll do a round robin going around and around and actually this

161
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:44,640
practice can be so joyous yes thank you Neil also for posting the survey

162
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:51,900
information again uh in case you lost the previous link

163
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:59,820
um so that there um invitation for the small groups is

164
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:05,520
um what what are you grateful for you can share one thing what are you grateful

165
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:11,640
for it can be anything what are you grateful for the next person will share something and then the next person I'll

166
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:20,579
come to you and just go around and around and this practice can be so happy making so such a sense of yeah abundance

167
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:26,339
such a sense of abundance both holding one's abundance and and uh and

168
00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:31,619
witnessing others supporting others and of course you can say pass just the hell

169
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:38,520
hold space just offer offering from your own experience not asking not querying

170
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:44,190
not directing but just offering something from your own experience if you wish and

171
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:49,680
[Music] um and let's do reverse alphabetical order

172
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,720
just for the fun of it and um

173
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:00,960
yeah so going to create the rooms and take care

174
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:07,440
of yourselves take care of each other okay all right check the rooms up we switch

175
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:15,140
something around hold on a sec can I recreate them it's all done

176
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:23,720
okay let's try that give me a moment

177
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,859
uh okay here we go

178
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:39,060
okay rooms are closed everybody's back so

179
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:44,099
um so the first question that I have for you was did that feel like enough time

180
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:51,839
or not if you if you feel like it was enough time raise your hand and I'll go through yes feels like enough till I see

181
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:57,720
a few hands okay if okay if it feels like it that was not enough time raise

182
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:03,000
your hand how many hands do I see not enough time

183
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:09,020
okay all right I see half and half okay we've got all right

184
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:15,480
okay great ah great so um do we have time for uh

185
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:20,640
for Reflections now a few minutes either about um

186
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:26,099
the uh meditation well if any aha moments

187
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:31,980
surprises questions or about doing this practice in in the group this gratitude

188
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:39,540
practice around about what you might have noticed red and Barbara

189
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:44,579
red or Barbara or both well I'm the one who raised my hands jumping unless you

190
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:51,359
want to say something too but um I was just feeling how well this this practice goes with the loving

191
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:57,599
kindness it feels like a very natural fit and the three of us who were together

192
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:05,220
um I think we all really enjoyed just bringing to mind things we are grateful for and it's like a little a little

193
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:11,460
Thumbtack note on the wall of Consciousness here that oh yeah there's so much to remember

194
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:16,560
um and and it has to you have to actually do it uh you have to do it consciously

195
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:21,780
you have to to Remember to Remember and then there is so very much to be

196
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:29,460
thankful for in every day um and it seems like it it builds on itself it seems like you you uh you

197
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:36,660
erect the kind of pyramid of of of conscious thankfulness about the day and that makes it a better day

198
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:43,920
so thank you yeah thank you Fred and I appreciate the many officer relations you made one being this this sense of

199
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:50,579
pyramid this is what I like to also call The Virtuous cycle because when you start to pre-con condition yourself to

200
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:57,180
see the good then you start to see the good and then you see more good and then it just it becomes a virtual cycle

201
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:02,280
um yeah and when you said that um one practice I usually do in the

202
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:08,520
evening when I lie in bed I before I sleep I think of a few things uh I'm

203
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:14,099
grateful for it for today I can't go through the day from the morning maybe to the evening or this happened and this

204
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:21,300
happened or that Oh that's oh that was lovely that was oh wow so it really brings a lot of Joy uh to my heart

205
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:28,460
before I fall asleep so I share that if you may want to try it on for size

206
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:35,339
any other reflections and you can also type them in chat as

207
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:41,280
you know if you type them to me privately I'll only read the reflection not your name so

208
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:47,820
it'll be private and if you can if you like to type it to everyone you're welcome to any other

209
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:53,760
observations about this practice shaping our own reality through

210
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,859
through appreciation and gratitude

211
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,480
okay Barbara

212
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:15,200
um what I wanted to add to what Fred said was that

213
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:21,300
he and and another person in the breakout session said that they had done

214
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:28,740
the Gratitude email to someone else in the group that you get pitched as an

215
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:33,960
assignment two years ago and they're continuing to do it

216
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:41,280
and that was something that they were grateful for and so this virtuous cycle you you've

217
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:48,500
got yourself to thank for that just saying [Laughter]

218

great that's so great hmm Diana

224
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:37,819
I was just happy and astonished to hear about the visual system

225
00:43:37,819 --> 00:43:44,040
and about the brain um with many many more Pathways than the

226
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:51,000
eyes it goes a long way to explaining why especially in the recent past I've

227
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:59,760
been looking for something looking for something an important document I think and I can't see it and it is absolutely

228
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:05,700
right in front of me in an envelope with its name on it and the next morning it's there there's

229
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:12,660
no been nobody around there's something else happening in the brain attention wise whatever we're looking

230
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:17,880
for or not and it's happened several times recently seeing uh

231
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:25,260
not seeing what's right there um with distraction whatever else is coming

232
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:32,160
in the brain those important scientific discoveries so yeah yeah it's it's thank

233
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,200
you you're so welcome it's so remarkable really just the way that we actually

234
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:42,599
shape our reality the way we perceive is not it's not what we think it is and has

235
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:49,319
so many implications um maybe actually what I'll share and and there's so much more in this book

236
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:55,500
The the book where I learned this um there's so much in this book it just

237
00:44:55,500 --> 00:45:03,480
it's been it's been blowing my mind maybe I'll just share the name um it's called helgoland uh

238
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:09,359
h-e-l-g-o-l-a-n-d um and I trust Neil will send it to the

239
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:15,720
group by Carlo Carla ravelli called car I think it's called the ravelli

240
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:21,180
um and um it's it's actually the book is about

241
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:26,339
he's a physicist and the book is about [Music] um

242
00:45:26,339 --> 00:45:33,359
um the um not String Theory but the um uh anyway without getting into too much

243
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:40,500
detail it's it's it's maybe I'll bring some other uh details uh about the book

244
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:47,280
in in the next few sessions but it's it's it's it's pretty awesome pretty wide let's see if I'm trying to find yes

245
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:53,060
it's Carlo robelli r-o-v-e-l-l-i anyway

246
00:45:53,819 --> 00:45:59,819
um so let's see I think I saw another hand I think that's it I saw oh yes it's

247
00:45:59,819 --> 00:46:06,119
seven o'clock um yeah um oh yes it's about Quantum Theory

248
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:12,839
that's what I wanted to say the book is about Quantum Theory and it's it's very accessible and it's it's pretty awesome

249
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:18,900
and pretty wild really pretty wild so so thank you all thank you for your
