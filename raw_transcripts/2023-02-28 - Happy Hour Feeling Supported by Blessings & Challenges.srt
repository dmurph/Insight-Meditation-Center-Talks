distracting they get chats and I'll open it up afterwards and last but not least

32
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,120

33
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:24,360
whether there is a difference from say five minutes ago 10 minutes ago when you

34
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:30,780
were on your own or whatever you were doing in your space but now actually yes you are here you are

37
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:49,800

38
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:57,419

39
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:03,060

40
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:08,900

41
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:16,380
even if the day might have been hard or 10 minutes ago oh this has been tough or

42
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:21,660
hard day in your body and your life but still

00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,280

then do it right you were sleepy distracted Let It Go Let It Go

142

143
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:16,920
helpful I don't have to believe you all thank you you know you're trying to be helpful

144
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:22,980

146
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:41,099
and together all these moments of mindfulness kindness that

147
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:47,880
we've planted the seeds for turning and

148
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:55,020
offering offering goodness the goodness to ourselves to

149
00:36:55,020 --> 00:37:01,680
others to all beings everywhere trusting there is goodness in this cultivation

150
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:08,180
may all beings everywhere be well may all beings everywhere be free

151
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:11,660
including ourselves

152
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:32,480
so much thank you for your practice everyone

153
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:39,859
so say a few words

154
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:46,260
um so in this practice at first I invited us all to

155
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:55,460
to settle with the breath receiving kindness knowing kindness and

156
00:37:55,460 --> 00:38:01,920
knowing awareness imbued with kindness awareness imbued with kindness nothing

157
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:08,099
not something separate practice of meta not something separate but but imbued

158
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:13,740
and and we also played with the breath being intertwined with kindness

159
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:19,980
breathing through there were challenges in the body and the heart and the mind making space and

160
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:27,900
then and I invited you to imagine to have the perception of of knowing as

161
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:33,200
spacious just knowing it's not so much incisive going to knowing this and that

162
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:40,800
and kind knowing is very spacious to know to know it's kind gentle and then I

163
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:49,079
invited you to take on this perspective as if you were taking a drop of ink and dropping it in which is

164
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:54,720
oh this this consideration of what if what if the universe is conspiring to

165
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,359
support me in all the gifts and all the challenges included to become

166
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:06,480
fully myself to expand my heart and kindness and compassion and humility all

167
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:12,260
the ways I need to grow to become fully fully the being

168
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:19,260
I I need to become to be of service to myself and to others just to put that

169
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:25,320
perspective on but not ruminate on it not to start thinking but just drop that in and then go back to to this kind

170
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:31,500
knowing and see what shift that might make maybe something maybe nothing that was the invitation

171
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:39,420
so what I'd like to invite us actually in our exploration in in the uh Smalls

172
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:44,940
in the groups into small groups and instead of actually uh it's both we're

173
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:50,280
trying to provide and create safe spaces for each other as well as Brave spaces

174
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:58,380
for each other to be brave with one another to be brave with one another and explore together we support each other

175
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:04,500
um so they save slash Brave spaces the invitation is to explore

176
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:10,859
um if you take this Pride this perspective on even for a moment even if maybe there's some aversion towards it

177
00:40:10,859 --> 00:40:17,460
you can say it that's perfectly fine and if you take it on then how might it transfer something that you're

178
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:24,720
struggling with or seeing some gift that you haven't appreciated or um so so it's an interesting perspective

179
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:30,839
you don't have to believe the perspective I'm not offering the perspective for you to believe it and say this is the way it is but we're just

180
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:37,619
playing around it's sandbox there are million perspectives you can take right this is just another one let's see how

181
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:43,320
we can shift and and and um and change our perspective being a

182
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:48,420
scientist of your own mind how might something shift with this perspective so

183
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:53,520
the invitation is Let's Go reverse alphabetical order you can offer

184
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:59,160
something like this perspective wow I loved it when I brought it on then I see

185
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:04,260
this in that you know this challenge I'm having this this net this neck pain I'm

186
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:10,740
having yeah can I show up with kindness It's stretching me because I usually lose my patience with it but it's really

187
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:18,180
stretching me in a way that I don't want to be stretched but I can see the goodness in it or I can see how I'm

188
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:24,599
becoming more compassionate towards others with physical pain that I didn't have before something like that or no

189
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:32,400
I'm just aversive I don't feel like the universe is conspiring to surprise it's all fine or just I didn't even hear it I

190
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:40,520
was distracted when Nikki introduced that it's all good so the invitation is share one nugget a very short brief one

191
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:46,260
make sure others have time to share whatever they want to share you can also

192
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:52,980
say pass say pass I'm here holding compassionate space for others later you

193
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:59,760
can add something but make sure everybody has time to say something maybe just offer one nugget not a long

194
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:05,820
monologue just maybe 30 seconds or a minute say something and then the next person and then next person then I'll

195
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:11,400
come back to you okay so be kind take care of yourselves take

196
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:17,579
care of each other and explore this perspective there's so much to learn from different perspectives we can take

197
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:25,140
on like different cloaks we can wear some of them are helpful maybe something should some of them like no not this one

198
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:31,619

214
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:28,260

216
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:40,440
please hi yes you know I've dialed in a few

217
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:47,819
times and I have to say it's very inspiring and comforting when we share

218
00:53:47,819 --> 00:53:54,180
our thoughts about what has you know this session has been about and other

219
00:53:54,180 --> 00:54:01,980
people have had the same experiences difficulties and thoughts that's so

220
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:07,319
affirming and it just makes me feel a lot better

221
00:54:07,319 --> 00:54:15,599
so I thank everyone for that beautiful lovely thanks Susan yay it's the power

222
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:20,940
of community really the power of community is so special and that's one

223
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:26,579
of the things I love about happier because we are on Zoom those who can join us on Zoom of course there are

224
00:54:26,579 --> 00:54:34,680
folks who join us on YouTube but being able to be in these small groups are powerful as as you've both uh Stephanie

225
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:40,319
and you Susan have attested too beautiful maybe I'll make space for one last

226
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:45,359
reflection especially if it's related to um to the theme if you tried the theme

227
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:51,059
on and if something else something an aha moment or a challenge

228
00:54:51,059 --> 00:54:54,619
um showed up

229
00:54:56,300 --> 00:55:01,740
Neil please I'll just throw that

230
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:07,800
the interesting thing about this statement is that it doesn't matter if it's right and the universe really is

231
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:12,960
helping or not what matters is your life is better if you can act as if this is

232
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:19,500
right that's what matters you know so it's sort of ironic

233
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:23,599
but marvelous too

234
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:33,480
honestly I couldn't have said it better yeah I think those are the Buddha's

235
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:38,700
words [Laughter] yeah that's

236
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:46,020
that's exactly it that's um we don't have to believe that it's true but act as if it is and it

237
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:51,480
transforms our perspective instead of oh poor me I have to go through this thing

238
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:58,020
this challenge this difficulty this uh pain the sorrow this loss is like okay

239
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:04,020
yeah it's it's this is the way the universe is conspiring to support me to

240
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:11,400
stretch me to stretch me to to tenderize my heart to make me a Kinder more wise

241
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:18,200
person above and beyond what I could possibly imagine yeah exactly thank you Neil beautiful

242
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:24,740
here I see your hand is up make it quick here we go

243
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:34,020
yeah I thank you every everyone in in our group was it was touched by the

244
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:41,940
thought that the Universe wants us to succeed because if we succeed when we succeed the

245
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:48,720
universe succeeds and if when we don't realize our full potential a little bit

246
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:54,619
of the universe gets deflated beautiful beautiful

247
00:56:54,619 --> 00:57:01,680
yes yeah I love that that Insight also there's a sense of oh yes I am a part of

248
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:08,579
this universe I am a part of this I am a part of this and and me fulfilling my

249
00:57:08,579 --> 00:57:15,599
full potential which may not look like what I think it is challenges are a part of it yeah it's conspiring to support me

250
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:21,660
so that I become more fully myself yeah beautiful thank you who Okay Maria we

251
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:26,819
still have time I see your hand just went up was that accidental or intentional all right maybe I'll make

252
00:57:26,819 --> 00:57:29,599
space for one more

253
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:38,099
Maria question I was wondering if you think

254
00:57:38,099 --> 00:57:46,339
that the environment has any impact on the meditation like is there any

255
00:57:46,339 --> 00:57:53,900
specific environments you would recommend Ed before they start a meditation

256
00:57:53,900 --> 00:58:00,780
your voice breaking up so much but um what from what I heard you say was a

257
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:06,000
question about the environment about meditation what should be an environment and the meditation is that what you're

258
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:12,359
asking uh yes sorry my connection is kind of bad it's all right

259
00:58:12,359 --> 00:58:19,559
um so so Inu it's um or when we start to practice it doesn't

260
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:26,220
matter where you're sitting or standing or walking um some people think that if it's more

261
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:31,740
silent and I wonder if you're asking wondering about silence versus non-silent but especially with the

262
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:38,339
practice of of kindness cultivating kindness it's often nice to practice say

263
00:58:38,339 --> 00:58:44,099
on the subway or on a bus or when you're driving and not with your eyes closed

264
00:58:44,099 --> 00:58:51,119
but but wishing everyone well so so there are different ways of practicing that can be done anywhere so you don't

265
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:56,160
necessarily need a very very quiet space that is that can be supportive for a

266
00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:02,579
particular way of cultivating um a calm abiding cultivating peace but

267
00:59:02,579 --> 00:59:10,260
you can actually practice in any kind of environment does that answer your question foreign

268
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:23,960
I don't see you anymore either oh there you are I think you just muted okay there Maria

269
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:30,839
sorry my connection is about the es that answers my question thank you

270
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:37,920
so welcome glad you're joining even with a bad connection all right dear ones thank you for your practice thank you

271
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:44,940
all for your cultivation may may we act as if may we take on this perspective

272
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:50,099
the universe is supporting us through the gifts through the challenges for us

273
00:59:50,099 --> 00:59:56,579
to become fully fully ourselves fully awakened and the universe to be more
