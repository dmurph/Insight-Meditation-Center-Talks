1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,279
good morning good day everyone

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,840
one of the directions that this practice goes in

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:24,000
is to a simplicity of being

4
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:32,000
where anything that is extra

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,600
anything that's really not needed to be happy peaceful

6
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:49,920
has kind of fallen and fallen away kind of taken a vacation

7
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:57,039
so that we give ourselves permission we are given permission

8
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:03,280
where just to be alive is enough breathing sensing feeling

9
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,920
knowing thinking whatever is happening

10
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:16,159
in a kind of simplicity of being that highlights

11
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,080
what we're doing that's extra how we get involved and pick up thoughts

12
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:30,079
pick up concerns react push away want fixate on certain thoughts and ideas

13
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:37,119
that the simplicity of being kind of shows us that you know this is extra

14
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,479
there's something really good happening here something really nice in this simplicity

15
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:49,040
just being alive is enough nothing to prove nothing to defend nothing to

16
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,320
for a few minutes a radical

17
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:01,520
vacation a radical pause in the incessant movement of doing and

18
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:09,520
wanting and thinking and we have permission to do this

19
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,760
just to be alive is enough for these minutes while meditating

20
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:25,599
and trust the process keep coming back to being simple

21
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:32,879
with what is happening simple meaning not getting involved not fixing not

22
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:40,319
pushing away just being just allowing what's there

23
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,160
and as the mind knows what's happening

24
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,519
let that be simple just to know there's a wonderful expression the

25
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,560
cognitive functioning of emptiness

26
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:03,680
the knowing functioning

27
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,280
of radical simplicity

28
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:17,680
where knowing has no weight awareness has no weight

29
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,280
no shape no color

30
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,280
no boundaries no walls

31
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,000
awareness our capacity to know

32
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:44,319
is porous transparent just is

33
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:52,560
and one of the things that falls away with the simplicity of being is all forms of self-preoccupation

34
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,799
self-concern not because we're not important and we want to care for ourselves we don't we

35
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:06,239
do want to care for ourselves but one of the greatest ways to care for ourselves

36
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:15,280
is to trust that just being alive is enough just allowing the simplicity of being

37
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,400
where there is no self-concern because in this simplicity

38
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:29,400
it's not needed so assuming a meditation posture

39
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:40,639
and to begin a process of simplification simplify your eyesight your looking

40
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:47,360
maybe let your eyes gaze look down at the floor

41
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:55,160
relax your focus so you're not really looking at anything in particular

42
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:06,360
and as you exhale closing your eyes

43
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,759
and then feeling your body globally so you're not

44
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,039
landing and standing on any one place in the body

45
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:29,600
but a global open awareness that maybe roams around the body but it

46
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,639
doesn't take a stand anywhere just doesn't get focused on any particular

47
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,840
thing for now just global feeling of being in a

48
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:57,600
body as you exhale relaxing

49
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,240
the belly

50
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,840
softening the lower path of the body

51
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,199
including the legs and the thighs and the feet

52
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:32,000
relaxing in the solar plexus area

53
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,240
the chest

54
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,759
releasing

55
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,879
releasing the shoulders

56
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,840
always going in the direction of being simpler less work less activity less

57
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:13,960
tension just being here

58
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,720
softening the muscles of the face

59
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:38,080
if the lips are pressed or the teeth are pressed together release the pressure

60
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:49,680
if the jaws are clenched release the holding

61
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,759
maybe by dropping the jaws open a little bit

62
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,599
softening around the eyes and the forehead

63
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,720
and on the exhale softening in the mind

64
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,479
quieting your thinking

65
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:41,599
turning whatever thinking you have to gently and quietly

66
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:47,519
think about being here in this body

67
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,959
at this time

68
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,880
let your concerns

69
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:07,160
simplify to just what's happening here in your body

70
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,160
and feel your body breathing

71
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,839
the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out

72
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:05,839
becoming simpler with the breathing as simple as it's easy to do

73
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:13,360
not trying to do anything with your breathing or not trying to get concentrated or

74
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,959
anything simple being

75
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,480
simple just breathing

76
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,839
allowing for a self-forgetting as you enter into the world of the body

77
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,839
breathing

78
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:51,279
and if it helps you be simpler as you exhale

79
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:58,720
gently softly let go of everything

80
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:11,360
or let go of anything that appears anything that's more complicated

81
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,200
than simply the body breathing

82
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,120
and just maybe at the end of the out breath

83
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:41,240
you can even let go of yourself self-concern self-referencing

84
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,839
the end of the up breath before the in-breath

85
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:08,720
the simplicity of no weight no color no shape

86
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:16,639
no body no feelings no thoughts

87
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,639
no mind no self

88
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,959
none of that needs to be a concern

89
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:42,320
you're allowed the simplicity of being

90
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,680
just to be alive is enough

91
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,720
so

92
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,720
let go as you exhale

93
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,440
for these minutes trust letting go

94
00:21:51,760 --> 00:22:00,080
let go of anything and everything the mind is involved in

95
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:07,159
until the last thing to let go of is letting go itself

96
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,520
as we come to the end of the sitting

97
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:54,720
whatever way you can appreciate your simplicity of being

98
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:04,520
just being alive is enough nothing to prove nothing to defend

99
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:12,799
it's enough just sitting here breathing peacefully because all other

100
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:21,840
demands and needs and ways of being have receded for now

101
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:30,399
just enough to be alive in that way

102
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:36,240
it might be possible to have a particular respect even

103
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,760
reverence for others

104
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:49,440
they too they too you can allow to be

105
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,080
just as they are the simplicity of being

106
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:01,679
you can see them as someone

107
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:08,320
with whom you don't need to add desires and needs and demands

108
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,360
just as you see yourself that way for these few moments

109
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,840
so you can also see them that way

110
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:26,398
free of your needs your judgments your desires your fears

111
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:33,120
freeing them from projections and demands

112
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:41,880
and it gives birth to a kind of respect a kind of reverence for others

113
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:49,840
seeing past whatever behavior they have good or bad

114
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,480
past whatever history they have

115
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,960
to just allowing them to be who they are for a few moments

116
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,520
and having a reverence for the life that's there

117
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,158
another human being is as wondrous as

118
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,919
looking out across the ocean at the beach or

119
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:29,440
the vista from a mountaintop or the beauty of a flower

120
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:46,559
not to deny all the things that we should notice but not be limited by it

121
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:56,158
deep respect deep reverence for every life

122
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:04,080
and with that respect to care for their welfare and happiness

123
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:10,640
may all beings happy

124
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,960
may all beings be safe

125
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:23,600
may all beings be peaceful

126
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,320
may all beings be free

127
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,799
and may we contribute that by freeing others

128
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:43,520
from all the projections and needs and demands

129
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,360
that we carry allowing each person each being

130
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,840
to be itself

131
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:08,529
[Music]

132
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,880
thank you

133
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:26,159
so mindfulness of mind mindfulness of awareness

134
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:33,840
awareness has in the simplicity of it has no weight no color no shape

135
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:39,760
awareness in itself has no history and no future

136
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,120
and to free awareness

137
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:56,480
from all the ways in which we burden it

138
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:02,480
with our desires and wishes and fears and projections and

139
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:09,919
so that awareness becomes simple is one of the great possibilities

140
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:16,640
in this practice of mindfulness and

141
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:22,799
awareness is released awareness is set free

142
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:29,760
and even of ourselves and this is one of the more radical things about this practice

143
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:35,840
the way in which it can freer free ourselves from ourselves

144
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:42,720
and um so if you engage in mindfulness practice in meditation practice

145
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:49,760
and you're able to kind of really give yourself over to just being here just being mindful in the

146
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:57,039
in the current of the present moment the current of breathing since sensing feeling whatever's going on

147
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:02,240
and then uh it's

148
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:08,720
we get at some point we get absorbed this becomes all we're doing and in the other all we're doing

149
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,480
absorption and just being present self-concerned self-preoccupation

150
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:20,399
uh falls away we're still here in a fully full way

151
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:26,399
but i like to for some reason i like to liken this to basketball players

152
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:32,240
that it's if you watch someone playing basketball professionally or something

153
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:40,240
and you know there's no time to wonder about how is that fan thinking

154
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:47,120
about me is my shirt tucked in properly the did i

155
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:52,640
you know did i do well did i snap my fingers right at that last

156
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:59,840
shot i mean all kinds of preoccupations and thoughts there's no time for it and there's a kind of complete

157
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:06,320
losing was giving oneself over to what they're doing and not most of us are not basketball

158
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:11,599
players but it could be uh cooking or playing music or reading a

159
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:17,200
book or you know there's activities that we do that we kind of forget ourselves we lose

160
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:24,000
ourselves in a healthy way in the activity some people say that time stops

161
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,440
as they when we lose ourselves in the activity we don't really lose ourselves because

162
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:35,679
there's but we um there's a a wonderful self-forgetting

163
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:42,398
or stepping out of this the closed of self that we wear

164
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:48,560
and and to have this wonderful uh getting out of our own way and being

165
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:54,000
free from self-concern self-preoccupation referencing everything to self

166
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,280
also begins to free awareness it frees our presence

167
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:06,480
our ability to attend to what's here there's a freedom there's a likeness there's an ease in that

168
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:12,400
and so then as that we continue the practice there's more and more of this kind of

169
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:18,800
self-forgetting or more and more this shedding of anything that's extra

170
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:25,680
and and there's a kind of a sensitivity that arises to what's extra

171
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:30,800
so sitting quietly being with the breath being with something

172
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:37,119
and um and then you have the thought you know what that breath wasn't as good as the previous breath

173
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:43,920
but rather than believing it or getting involved in that thought it's so clear that that's extra that

174
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,280
thought the goodness of the moment doesn't need it

175
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:55,440
and so we we don't get involved in that thought we don't pick it up and we just kind of stay with the flow

176
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:01,119
the activity of here and here and

177
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:08,480
and uh and so then awareness gets simpler and simpler we get simpler and simpler or

178
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:15,839
maybe we don't get simpler anymore we've receded from the picture and awareness gets simpler and simpler and simpler

179
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:22,880
and at some point awareness

180
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:28,640
releases itself awareness just like there's a

181
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:34,640
self-forgetting there is an awareness for getting awareness forgets itself

182
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:39,839
and um and what is that like when it gets that simple that free

183
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:45,599
that's safe that settle that

184
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:51,119
just being alive is enough just here and even awareness

185
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:57,359
doesn't have to do anything doesn't have to accomplish anything it's not directed anywhere or

186
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:04,400
and there's a self forgetting in the awareness too just awareness is so smooth and operating so simply

187
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:10,480
it just kind of forgets itself sometimes it's called a dropping away

188
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:17,040
sometimes it's called a a ceasing the ending of something

189
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:23,280
and then it comes back but to have that experience of

190
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:30,160
awareness for getting itself awareness getting out of its own way

191
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:35,440
is uh teaches something very profound about

192
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:41,040
clinging and the possibility of non-clinging

193
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:47,359
so the final step for this week about awareness is the release not only the

194
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:53,520
release in awareness but the release of awareness itself both of those

195
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:59,760
so we respect our minds our awareness we begin by just relaxing that was the

196
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:06,240
first day and then there's recognition a huge part of awareness is its capacity to recognize

197
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:12,640
and we're building on that capacity so the recognition becomes simpler and simpler and simpler less baggage less

198
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,680
associations just the simple knowing just

199
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:24,640
in breath just a thought just hearing just being

200
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:31,119
and um and then there's this uh deep respect for this whole process of

201
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:36,960
being aware of being present respect for ourselves i think this dharma practice is kind of

202
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:42,240
founded on a very deep respect that borders is a kind of reverence

203
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:47,839
for all this and so of course we want to be present and attentive and and

204
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:54,160
and find a way to be with everything that the being with is simple just there

205
00:38:54,160 --> 00:39:02,400
with it we don't interfere with anything and then there's a kind of restoration of

206
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:09,760
a wonderful kind of freedom of mind that can just know whatever's happening freely openly like

207
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:17,280
like there's no barriers no boundaries to anything just it's just known it's free

208
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:23,599
everything is known simply nothing sticks and then as we continue this process of

209
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:30,800
deepening the awareness and just kind of getting the flow of awareness just relaxing in the simplicity of being

210
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:37,280
there is this a greater and greater process of simplification and that might be a nicer word for some

211
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:43,280
of people to hear rather than letting go releasing because letting go can seem

212
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:48,400
like we are dismissing things or we're abandoning things or we're you know

213
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:54,400
we're going to be without anything but this simplification is simplifying into the most

214
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:00,160
the part of ourselves the part of life that is most reverent most respectful deepest

215
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:05,200
most sacred and um

216
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:12,960
and to trust it so deeply and so well that um there's a self-forgetting

217
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,200
and then an awareness forgetting

218
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:23,520
and then you'll know something new something different about this life and

219
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:30,720
you probably never believe that clinging

220
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:38,800
is important again you might you're probably still cling but you will no longer believe in it

221
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,400
and now that that's what's important

222
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:53,440
and so the buddha talked about awareness use the word cheetah so maybe mine but

223
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:59,440
awareness liberated

224
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,960
through non-clinging so

225
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:11,760
and then you get yourself in the simplest most beautiful and

226
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:17,119
profound way that you can be that paradoxically wonderfully

227
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:23,520
wondrously also involves a self-forgetting

228
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,520
so it might seem like you're not going to be there to appreciate this wonder

229
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:35,560
but maybe part of you is not there the part that's extra

230
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:42,960
so thank you for this uh opportunity to teach this stuff

231
