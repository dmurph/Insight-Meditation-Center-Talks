1
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:10,140
foreign people trickle in why don't we just sit for a few minutes let's just let

2
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:20,459
ourselves ground and breathe and come on in please join us yeah and um

3
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:26,220
yeah just taking a moment till that your senses connect with Where You Are

4
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:32,879
you know feeling the feet feeling your bottom

5
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,459
we can move the chairs you can move the chairs anywhere okay we just randomly

6
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:43,760
put wherever you put them not knowing who's neutralized

7
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,239
yeah maybe do what Richard just did is take a couple longer slower deeper

8
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:02,599
breaths you can go ahead and just it's all right

9
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:09,239
we're just taking a few minutes here to ground and breathe and

10
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:17,280
invite ourselves to rest I like the word to finish arriving yeah

11
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:24,060
it's like a car has momentum you know and it needs to slowly stop and sort of we have

12
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:30,720
the same thing going with our energy our momentum getting here and through

13
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:37,200
the day just allowing things to come to

14
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,239
Stillness or closer to that

15
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,340
foreign

16
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,380
foreign

17
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:02,750
[Music]

18
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:10,059
[Music]

19
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,180
foreign

20
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,560
welcome everyone welcome welcome

21
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:40,860
so I have a couple of questions um who's watched The Wizard of Oz

22
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:47,759
has anybody seen the movie one two no three four oh okay so Brian only you

23
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:54,419
have not so far so far but there's probably people out there that haven't watched it too

24
00:07:54,419 --> 00:08:00,740
okay um when was the last time you watched watched it

25
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:08,759
okay a while ago Susan don't even remember so many years so many years ago Jay a

26
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:16,099
long time that's great

27
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:24,060
yeah so were you interested in coming to the class because of the Wizard of Oz or

28
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:30,599
just because the hindrances or both I'm just curious and like just here yeah

29
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:35,880
you don't like the movie okay thanks yeah it's pretty weird when

30
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:43,440
I re-watched it it's pretty weird yeah but um but let me tell you why I was I'm spot

31
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,899
inspired by it I actually went on a long retreat many years ago and

32
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:55,980
for some reason The Wizard of Oz and a lot of what was happening it came

33
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:01,940
up in my meditation and I've spent a lot of years trying to unpack and understand

34
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:09,839
why the symbols and the memories why did they come up in my deep I was in a deep

35
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:17,640
practice it was actually a very profound Meditation Retreat and the more I reflected on it the more

36
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:24,540
I was like wow something in there knows something I don't you know like there's just tremendous wisdom

37
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:31,920
um and in in kind of the insights that I found when I started to think more and more about what was represented

38
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:40,440
in the movie so I'll say more about some of those things um after Diana gives an overview of the

39
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,540
five hindrances because that's really you know that's the the primary teaching

40
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:52,140
is about sort of these five hindrances and um and then we wanted to use the Wizard

41
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:59,240
of Oz as a more of a playful um kind of reference a visual reference

42
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:06,120
less heavy we often get pretty kind of feel a sense of heaviness about the

43
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,339
hindrances so there's an effort to bring some lightness Joy

44
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:20,640
um and and actual when you watch the movie some visual Clarity to how the hindrances can manifest so

45
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:28,080
it's a welcome we look forward to playing with you and exploring and I actually will say

46
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:33,180
just one more thing and then I'll ask Diana to talk about the five hindrances but

47
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:38,399
there's actually quite a few books and essays written on the interpretation of

48
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,440
The Wizard of Oz um and like there are some essays like

49
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,019
that oh one guy did an analysis of five different interpretations

50
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:55,680
and it's like atheists and Christians use the same

51
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,860
examples to demonstrate their points so I think there's a lot of room to

52
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:09,060
interpret the Wizard of Oz from a Buddhist perspective so why not

53
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:15,540
all right thank you Tanya for those of you who don't know me I'm Diana Clark and I'm

54
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:22,200
very happy to be here and Tanya and I are great friends we've been friends for a long time we practice together we

55
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,779
teach together and cook dinner together sometimes and go for hikes and all this

56
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:35,100
kind of stuff so thank you Tanya for inviting me it's such a delight to be teaching together

57
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:42,360
and it was tonya's idea about the Wizard of Oz it's like oh okay but I like this idea of a little bit of some Whimsy you

58
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:49,260
know to bring this in and some fun and maybe what you said about the atheists and the Christians showing that these

59
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:55,260
are the experiences there's some like archetypes there that's not something

60
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:01,079
that's just unique to certain individuals and maybe that's part of what we'll be highlighting during this

61
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:07,339
course but I'm going to begin by bringing in

62
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:12,839
another analogy another kind of like story or a metaphor

63
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:18,779
or something that we might use and many of us come to meditation practice

64
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:27,060
because we want to have more ease more freedom more spaciousness in our life we

65
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:33,180
want to have a more relaxation whatever it is whatever brings us less suffering

66
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:40,680
and part of our way of finding more ease more freedom more peace more relaxation

67
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:46,380
is to pay attention to what gets in the way of that

68
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:53,639
so often we're just trying to we think that we just have to find whatever it is we're looking for but it might even be

69
00:12:53,639 --> 00:13:00,000
more important to look at what's getting in the way to have what we're looking for

70
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,959
and so this analogy this metaphor or something that's in the Buddhist teachings

71
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:13,320
we have no interest in people becoming Buddhists if you're here just for that right to we have a Buddha here this is a

72
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,480
Buddha Center but we're and you know we hold this lightly but you will hear me

73
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:25,440
on occasion maybe Tanya to referring to the Buddhist teachings but there's this um analogy that the

74
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,480
Buddha uses when he's describing the path of practice like how kind of like

75
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,600
practice unfolds either over a lifetime or over one single meditation session

76
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:44,399
collect the same story can work and that is this idea of a river so

77
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:50,940
water starting on a Mountaintop and then going from little streamlits

78
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:56,339
and turning into a river and then going to the ocean

79
00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:04,680
it's natural right Rivers only go One Direction downhill towards the ocean

80
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:11,880
the ocean is can be understood as Freedom this really immense beautiful

81
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:17,160
deep body of water and then our practice can be like this

82
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:24,060
movement towards the ocean but one thing that's in rivers part of

83
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:32,579
what makes them Rivers are boulders big boulders or Banks or Fallen trees or

84
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:38,519
you know something like this right of course they're not streamlined we only see those in amusement parks right it's

85
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:46,380
perfectly smooth and straight down so there's a way in which we might think

86
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:51,779
like oh if only those Boulders weren't there then the water could go more

87
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:58,440
smoothly but there's something there's a that we can learn from this and that the

88
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:04,680
water it meets The Boulders it's touching the boulders and then going around or going

89
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:09,779
over or something like this has this intimate connection with it

90
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:15,240
and it's the water then um maybe slowed down or maybe it's sped

91
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:22,260
up because of some other Boulders but it keeps on going not by avoiding the

92
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:28,320
boulders by contacting them and so this is part of what we're going

93
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,420
to be exploring what are these Boulders and how can we like work with them and

94
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:38,940
such that we are contacting them that's the secret here instead of wishing that they would just

95
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:44,399
go away and that this would be so much easier if they weren't there

96
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:50,100
so in The Wizard of Oz we might say Boulders or the Tin Man you know there's

97
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:59,760
like so many different ways that we might um think about this things that maybe hinder or get into the

98
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:05,579
hinder or maybe impede what we might think of as

99
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:13,079
progress but here is something that is for me is really fascinating and interesting and

100
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:19,139
uplifting is that it turns out

101
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:25,380
that these Boulders are integral to the path of practice they are a necessary

102
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:30,779
part and we don't think that right we think like oh I'm the only one that has this

103
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:36,720
or if only these things weren't here but they are an integral part of practice

104
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,120
and we'll talk about this as these weeks unfold like how is that

105
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:48,360
how is it that they are inherent to this way of finding more freedom part

106
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,639
of the answer to that of course is what I said the beginning is for us to get to

107
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:59,459
know to understand like how these entrances show up in our life

108
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:06,780
because what shows up in the meditation cushion of course shows up in our daily life of

109
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:12,298
course it does we only have one mind one body right so it's not like something on the cushion

110
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:19,199
is completely different than we see elsewhere but it's a way meditation allows the

111
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:26,520
opportunity for us to maybe examine it in a way that we wouldn't normally

112
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:32,520
it provides the opportunity for us to even see the habits that we have of body

113
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:38,580
and mind that might otherwise not be so clear to us we might just think oh this

114
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:45,299
is just the way it is everybody does it this way something like this so it's not until we start to maybe like look at the

115
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:51,419
hindrances become more sensitive to them that we start to gain some more self-understanding

116
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:56,940
and then of course we might even consider that these boulders

117
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:02,700
are in fact I think we can say something I forgot that it's

118
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:10,039
exact expression we put it on the back of Gill's book on the hindrances something like instead of rather being

119
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:17,640
blocking they are Stepping Stones so they are something that that we use

120
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:23,460
to help us get to the next stage to help us get further in our practice

121
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:30,900
so not only because it provides greater self-understanding but also it helps us to it's a little

122
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:37,080
bit of a mind training too and Tony and I in these ensuing weeks

123
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:44,700
we'll be talking about this but into a notice what are our reactions when we

124
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:50,039
come up against something that seems to be getting in our way what's our habitual way of responding do we get

125
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:55,320
angry or do we start blaming or do we collapse and kind of run out of energy

126
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:01,799
and give up or do we just avoid it or you know there's so many different ways

127
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:08,720
that we can respond to things that are some difficulties so working with the hindrances is a meditation

128
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,700
naturally affects the rest of our life and the all the goals and the things that we'd like to do

129
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:22,799
so that's one way in which their Stepping Stones having us gaining some greater self-understanding

130
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:28,740
second way is that part of I keep on talking about this what Tanya and I will

131
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:34,559
be doing is the way that we work with them is by

132
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:40,260
turning towards them and this sometimes is

133
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:46,020
um exactly what we don't want to do we sometimes have this idea of okay well

134
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:52,740
just that thing has to go away and then I'm going to just practice here that thing has to go away but of course that

135
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:59,580
kind of pushing is aversion which is one of the hindrances so that's the second way is just to have

136
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:04,799
this idea that we turn towards difficulties in a way that which is not

137
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:10,440
overwhelming or that doesn't um cause us to collapse or

138
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:17,460
um give up or something like this but that is just gets folded into practice

139
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:22,620
I think Gill says this pretty often like you know this too we just we just bring this into practice

140
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:28,500
so we'll be talking about this also Okay so

141
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:33,660
what are these hindrances for using this word uh hindrances

142
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:40,700
I appreciate um that these are captured in the Buddhist teachings which of course are

143
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:46,320
thousands of years ago for me that's like I love to think about

144
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,600
this like how many generations of people like maybe a hundred Generations before

145
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:58,559
us like we have our parents grandparents great grandparents and then just think they go back a hundred

146
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:05,100
all those people all that time ago they recognized the exact same thing that we

147
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:10,380
experienced today this is not unique to us

148
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:16,380
maybe the particulars are of you know yeah of course right modern times are

149
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:21,840
different but there's something about this universality of it that for me I

150
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:27,000
don't know I feel encouraged by connects me to so many other people this is The

151
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,760
Human Experience we have these hindrances that's just the way it is

152
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:38,100
and part of the way is we learn to work with them and be with them and the exact

153
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:45,600
same experience can stop being a hindrance without it having to go away

154
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:52,380
and that's part of the how we work with them is how do we can make this transition from them being a hindrance

155
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:57,840
to them just being one more thing that we're aware of and then I'll say it again Tanya and I

156
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:04,500
will talk about like some of the tools we can use and how we can work with that in a way that really supports our

157
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:11,460
practice so another analogy or a metaphor that we

158
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:16,799
might use is sometimes they're called like veiling factors

159
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:22,440
so this idea of a hindrance is something that's like impedes progress but we can

160
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:28,620
also think about them as a way that are covering up or obscuring or things so

161
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:34,980
that we can't quite See Clearly we don't see ourselves clearly we don't see other people clearly we don't see

162
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:40,500
the situation clearly when we're filled and we all know this when you're filled

163
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,659
with aversion when you're just woke up on the that side of the bed in which you

164
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:51,240
feel kind of cranky you know things just seem different and you're more up to uh

165
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:56,460
you know say a Curt word to somebody or yell or get in a fight or whatever it

166
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:03,659
might be we all knew this that kind of the Mind states that we're in affect how we

167
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:09,780
interpret or understand other things so these entrances are also we can

168
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:15,120
consider them veiling factors and as we learn to work with them

169
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:21,299
then we can find that our life just starts to unfold with more ease

170
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:26,460
and more clarity you can start to see how things really are

171
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:31,620
or maybe with less obscurations or

172
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:41,600
okay so these hindrances there many of you might know this already they're put into five categories

173
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:48,539
kind of like simplified and classified into these five I don't know maybe today we might come

174
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:54,240
up with a different list of five but these ones from thousands of years ago work as well

175
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:01,140
they're given in a traditional order it's not the order that Tanya and I are going to teach them it is actually it is

176
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:07,320
now okay okay I was just on Retreat for quite some time so I just told Tanya do

177
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:14,059
whatever you want and I'll follow your lead so here we are so they're given in a traditional order

178
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:19,640
the first one is sensual desire this uh

179
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:25,020
this wanting just the next pleasurable thing you know this kind of like leaning

180
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:30,780
forward and okay this is I need to have you know the most comfy chair and the

181
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:38,039
best food and the right temperature and you know everything has to be just right and this because wishing for everything

182
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:45,419
to be comfortable and even Pleasant more than comfortable Pleasant and enjoyable

183
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:52,020
so that's the first one is this thinking that's you know this is the highest priorities to find the most Pleasant

184
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:58,679
thing I want to be clear we are not saying that pleasantness is bad of course not

185
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:04,200
joy happiness Pleasant Sensations are a vital part of this path of practice we

186
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:10,860
get into trouble if we think that our whole life is about chasing them is nothing about is if our whole life is

187
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:16,500
about just having that next pleasurable experience and my guess is you would not be here at

188
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:22,620
a meditation center if you if that worked for you right to just be chasing the pleasant experiences it turns out

189
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:28,559
not to work so well maybe I'll tell a little story that um

190
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:34,559
once I was on a Meditation Retreat and this was coming up a lot I was like having all these ideas like whenever I

191
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:40,500
get out of this dang Retreat I'm gonna go do this and I can't wait to have that and you know I'm gonna buy this eat this

192
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:46,559
you know like I had all these like long ideas and um but I was kind of like working with them working with the hindrances

193
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:52,320
like oh no no okay that's desire Diana and you don't have to follow that and I

194
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:58,500
knew how to work with them so it would kind of fade away but then it would come up again and then I'd work with it and fade away

195
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:05,700
and I thought like okay okay I managed to get through that meditation session you know all right

196
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:12,000
as it happened the um next thing that was happening after that meditation was

197
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,740
um the lunch time so you know we go to the dining hall

198
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:24,360
and I'm in the dining hall I got my plate like oh this looks really good I'm gonna have some of this oh I probably

199
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:29,940
need to get a little bit more like some of this and then oh wow wow they have this okay I need two scoops of that and

200
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:35,580
this I had this huge amount of food on my plate way more than I could eat and

201
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:40,980
realize oh yeah so this desire is still here this thinking that I need to have more and

202
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:47,220
more and more it's just showing up in this way so sometimes it's obvious and sometimes

203
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:53,100
it's not so obvious the way that they show up so that's the first one

204
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:59,340
the second one is the opposite I call it aversion like I don't want

205
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:05,480
this like make it go away it's this um like pushing it away

206
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:11,640
sometimes uh a little bit of perhaps this flavor of ill will like dang it get

207
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:17,640
out of here you know that's kind of a Feeling whether it's a sore knee or this

208
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:24,539
persistent thought of that terrible thing that our boss said that one time that keeps haunting us that keeps on

209
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:32,760
coming up whatever it might be that kind of like wanting to push it away so that's the second one

210
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:39,840
the third one is restlessness and remorse or worry

211
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:46,380
so it's this um having a lot of energy like this I'm sure if

212
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:52,500
anybody has a meditation practice you have this experience like you're sitting down and just this real

213
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:57,659
urge I want to get up and do anything except be here

214
00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:02,940
defrost the refrigerator or organize the sock drawer you know anything

215
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:10,260
so that's the restlessness it's often called restlessness and worry restlessness and remorse it's not quite

216
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:16,740
clear how to translate these into English but it's pointing to the bodily experience of restlessness as well as

217
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:23,840
the mental experience of restlessness of wanting to do something different

218
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:31,260
fourth one is the opposite of that one we call it sloth and torpor it's kind of this language is maybe a little bit

219
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:38,179
dated but it's you know just completely run out of energy

220
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:43,679
it's not uncommon for people to meditate to feel sleepy we would say that's kind of sloth and

221
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:48,779
torpor but there's also a way in which we can feel sleepy just because we're

222
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:54,120
physically tired but it also can be a way in which the mind and the body are

223
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:59,220
reacting to experience we can notice this if at the end of The

224
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:04,260
Meditation period if we feel like oh okay great I'm gonna go do the next thing but while we were meditating you

225
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:10,740
know the energy was completely drained out so we can notice whether it's a physical

226
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:16,799
thing or something with the meditation and then the last one it's often

227
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:24,480
translated as doubt but I I want to maybe flesh that out a little bit

228
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:30,659
I would maybe um the way it gets more experienced is more like hesitation like should I do

229
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:36,779
this practice or maybe I should do this or I don't know that Insight seems nice

230
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:42,600
but this seems too hard okay I'm going to do some loving kindness practice but oh wait I can't remember the phrases

231
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:47,880
well okay maybe I'll just do some walking meditation I don't know maybe those teachers don't even know what

232
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:54,840
they're talking about you know so just this never really getting settled because you have this idea that maybe

233
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:00,480
I'm not doing the practice right maybe the teachers don't really know what

234
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:07,380
they're talking about or can't explain it in the right way or maybe the teachings that we've inherited from all

235
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:12,840
these generations of these practitioners maybe they we might think like oh those are

236
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:18,419
two archaic they don't have any relevance so it's this doubt so maybe

237
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:24,840
it's like the lack of confidence in the practice or lack of confidence in oneself or lack of confidence in the

238
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:31,919
teachers and I'm just going to say quickly one thing about doubt because I think

239
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:37,080
um often we think oh the opposite of doubt well let me just say this

240
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:43,020
the how we often how the antidote we might say to doubt

241
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:48,360
is investigation check it out for yourself ask somebody

242
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:53,760
read a Dharma book listen to podcasts explore things in your own meditation

243
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:59,880
practice so we're not saying that you have to have faith you know that's going

244
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:07,620
to take you all the way instead this is a real encouragement to have some experiential your own experience

245
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:14,520
as a way to support your practice and to work with doubt there and then I'll just end with this last

246
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:19,559
thing that I already mentioned it but I think that

247
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:25,740
um it's worthwhile saying again everybody has contact with these

248
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:33,059
hindrances it's not until you're completely awakened person that you don't have them

249
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:40,740
until you're like a Buddha or an or Hut or something like this very easy when we run into these

250
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:48,120
Boulders these hindrances to start The Narrative of the inner critic like oh everybody else looks like they can do

251
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:53,580
this and I can't do it or I can't meditate or you know some narrative like

252
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:59,700
that to start up everybody has these we might idealize

253
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:05,640
teachers or we might idealize things that we've seen in books or podcasts or

254
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:12,240
something like this but everybody has this so it's there's no need for us to

255
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:19,320
personalize it and feel like it's a failing on our part but instead just to recognize this is

256
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:26,340
part of the human experience having these and maybe with that I'll turn it back

257
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:33,899
over to Tonya I guess I'll just check in and see if

258
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:40,380
you have any questions about those five hindrances central desire aversion

259
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:46,140
restlessness and worry sloth and torpor and doubt just to make sure you have a

260
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:53,059
chance to yeah Stephen do you mind using the mic there's one right here

261
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:06,380
hello hello there you go uh what does torpor mean

262
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:16,140
good question the way that we understand it is like I think that that whole phrase sloth and

263
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:21,720
torper it's like the energy has run out both of the body and the mind so torpor

264
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:27,840
we can think of like when there isn't this energy there's like this dullness and the mind is just feels

265
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:33,899
foggy and maybe cloudy or something like this as well as not having

266
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:40,440
um or not having energy in the body so that's what I would I think that makes sense but like you know in my

267
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:46,019
interpretation like sloth is is is something um

268
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:52,919
that you can contribute to like if you decide to be lazy

269
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:58,620
or eat too much so I'm relating to that but torpers it sounds like it's just

270
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:06,960
more of a an effect I would say that and we'll talk about these in more detail uh soon but uh

271
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:12,000
turns out that uh sloth and this idea of the body it can

272
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,780
be both from the environment what we've eaten or how much we've had to sleep or something as well as it's not an

273
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:24,480
uncommon way for people to kind of like disconnect from their experiences they

274
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:30,599
just kind of run out of energy they don't and so nowadays often what

275
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:38,158
somebody might do is just pick up their phone and kind of just mindlessly scroll or do some Doom scrolling or something

276
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:43,429
like that is how it might show up so something like that

277
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:46,539
[Applause]

278
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:54,240
does Fear fall under one of these categories doing it yeah you know that's an

279
00:34:54,240 --> 00:35:01,440
interesting one because um I just read a different teachers interpretation about fear so

280
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:09,060
I'll say a few things one is they connected fear to aversion and or to

281
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:15,180
doubt and the way they did was they said with aversion you know it's about what

282
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:20,220
we don't want being afraid of what we don't want so it's kind of grounded in

283
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:26,280
aversion and the doubt was connected because when we don't know what's coming we're afraid

284
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:33,920
we're like we're trying to protect ourselves in some way I've also connected it with a sense of

285
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:41,820
anxiety right worry so but it's you know more rooted I think in in the the

286
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:48,300
aversion and or the doubt yeah yeah thank you for the question

287
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:55,140
any other dining anything you want to add to that maybe I'll just say that when I had

288
00:35:55,140 --> 00:36:00,300
mentioned well you know maybe today we would divide them up a little bit differently ahead in my mind that maybe

289
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:07,920
we would highlight fear as its own because it is such a common experience but uh yeah we kind of put it in there

290
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:16,260
with aversion yeah most often great any other thoughts questions

291
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:22,260
sound familiar recognize the states yeah great

292
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:28,800
so um let me talk a little bit about you know this crazy movie Wizard of Oz and

293
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:35,400
um what some of the connections are and and um how some of the these hindrances

294
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:40,619
might be you might be able to see them if you watch the movie remember the

295
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:47,460
movie or just imagine the movie um so first of all just you know these

296
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:54,780
characters are exaggerations extreme exaggerations so just know it's there

297
00:36:54,780 --> 00:37:01,380
you know that's what makes them kind of stand out and easy to recognize so it can be just kind of fun to think

298
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:10,500
about well what hindrance would I match with what character you know just sort of like oh yeah and another thing to

299
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:16,140
think about is that there are there's this idea that and Buddhism they say there's like these

300
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:21,480
different personality types and often that's referencing people who

301
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:26,700
are greed type I want I like people who are aversive I don't like you know stop

302
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:32,400
and then people who are deluded who are just kind of out of it and in their own world

303
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:39,960
but actually I I would like to expand that to include the other hindrances that there are personality types we if

304
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:46,440
we stay stuck in a pattern of the hindrances we can develop a pattern of a lot of soft and torpers you know you

305
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:53,940
might know somebody who you know just doesn't ever get off the couch right or just can't engage mentally and and you

306
00:37:53,940 --> 00:38:00,060
also might know somebody who can't ever sit down that they're restless and they're you know kind of just have too

307
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:05,180
much energy so this is not enough energy sloth and torper and too much energy

308
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:12,740
restlessness and worry in the body and the mind and um

309
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:19,140
I just forgot where I was going but oh yeah this exaggeration right so it's

310
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:24,720
very easy and these personality Styles it's sort of like the Tin Man and the

311
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:31,680
Scarecrow and the lion super kind of embody some of these hindrances

312
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,420
um of course the wicked witch

313
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:43,800
could you just write them down when you have a chance yeah that'd be great um so

314
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:49,920
um then so I'm going to come back to the characters in a minute but I just sort of wanted to say that about the

315
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:55,440
exaggeration another thing I wanted to say is that there's often multiple hindrances

316
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:02,520
present at one time so very often there's a combination of things going on and

317
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:08,339
um so you can you'll see that when we talk about the characters a little bit and then

318
00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:14,820
um another thing is to notice this idea of a veil or a covering the hindrance is

319
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:21,240
something that covers the way something is seen you know so for example the Scarecrow he

320
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:29,420
thinks he needs a brain right if you watch the movie from the perspective of thinking about okay he he

321
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:36,540
is you know very he embodies a lot of restlessness he moves all over he's very

322
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:43,320
sloppy in his movement he falls and his expressions are very erratic his moods

323
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:48,960
kind of Swing all over the place so sort of this too much energy guy

324
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,480
and he doesn't think he's smart but as you watch this show what you see

325
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:01,500
is he ends up being the person who comes with all the strategies for how to get places do things

326
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:09,900
he actually is the person who is the most kind of you know like thoughtful minded in terms of he has this in

327
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:15,119
himself he has a brain but he has this doubt and this restlessness and worry

328
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:21,420
but Cloud his ability to recognize his own inherent wisdom his own brain

329
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:28,260
so the lion well actually let me talk about the um the Tin Man next so he thinks he needs a

330
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:34,200
heart and he is Rusted shut so he embodies

331
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:42,359
sloth and torper right he can't move and that's kind of what happens there's no energy he's rested shut he can barely

332
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:47,579
talk you know they have to grease him up help him move and get going

333
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:54,960
and and but what he has he thinks he you know he needs a heart he thinks he's empty chested you he said knock on my

334
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:01,380
chest and you have this empty tin can sound but actually he's a romantic you know he

335
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:08,220
talks about romantic love and he tears up right which makes him rest again so

336
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:14,339
he goes you know they all end up on on the search with Dorothy to try and get

337
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:21,180
these things they think they don't have which are all within them but the hindrance is sort of what kind

338
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:28,140
of prevents them from connecting with it and it's um and it hides it from view even though

339
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:33,960
it's there it's already there so

340
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:41,880
um another thing that um you might think about when you think about you know the

341
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:47,040
Wizard of Oz himself and the City of Oz it's all green

342
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:52,560
and it's got these painted horses it's just like crazy

343
00:41:52,560 --> 00:42:01,859
fancy wild City and The Wizard himself is is a fake he's a fraud right so he he

344
00:42:01,859 --> 00:42:09,480
himself is from Kansas it turns out which is where Dorothy's from and um he's like hiding behind this curtain

345
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:15,780
and using the speaker and this like scary visualization with little fire

346
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:21,060
Puffs and you know to intimidate people and to make this assumption or this

347
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:28,619
impression of power but the way that I have come more and more to see The Wizard of Oz is like a

348
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:34,020
magic show it's like the magic show that the mind

349
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:41,640
is creating all the time the many movies that were you know have going on in our

350
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:48,359
heads we're creating these stories we're believing the thoughts that are happening and everything gets

351
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:54,660
exaggerated blown up on Technicolor right when we buy into the thinking and

352
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:59,940
the stories that we're patchworking together in our own mind

353
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:07,500
um the mind can really fool us and that's bring up so much fear that's like generates these senses of something

354
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:13,740
terrible is going to happen so there's this combination of like this

355
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:19,500
delusion but it's it's a magic show he's all about magic in fact in the beginning

356
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:25,380
of the movie um so Dorothy is an adopt you know adopted

357
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:31,859
by her aunt and lives on the farm in Kansas and out in the middle of nowhere and you notice in the beginning of the

358
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:39,300
film it's all black and white it's just black and white there's no color and to me this is a representation of

359
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:44,880
where her mind state is at the time which is everything is kind of

360
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:51,420
All or nothing and terrible they're going to take Toto her dog and she doesn't she tries to get her aunt and

361
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:58,500
uncle to respond to her and they're busy taking care of these baby chicks because the the lights for the Hatchery have

362
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:05,339
burnt out or aren't working so they're not really listening to her when she's saying this woman who becomes the wicked

363
00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:12,119
witch is going to take her dog away and so she runs away and she packs her bag because she wants

364
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:18,420
to you know carry off her Toto and protect him she runs away and she runs

365
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:24,300
into this guy who's kind of one of those traveling magicians he's got a crystal ball

366
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:30,480
and he you know she asks him to you know for you know advice and he brings her in

367
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,940
he tells her close your eyes and oh let me hold your purse keep your

368
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:43,680
eyes closed and then he goes through her purse and pulls out this picture of her Auntie M and the farm with the little

369
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:50,359
like Weather Vein on the top and he says to her things like oh I see this Farm

370
00:44:50,359 --> 00:44:57,240
and and there's this Weather Vein you know and then there's this woman out there and she's crying you know and and

371
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:02,339
so he's making all of this up based on you know what he's looked at you know

372
00:45:02,339 --> 00:45:07,980
and she thinks he's you know looking at his crystal ball so this is a magic show

373
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:13,380
he's pretending to know and what he's doing is you know he doesn't want her to

374
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:18,780
travel with him in his little Caravan so he's motivating her to go back home out

375
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:24,240
of worry for her Auntie M and so she's she runs off but at the

376
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:30,540
same time you see right after she goes there's this storm coming right this twister is coming

377
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:35,700
and she's off and and he walks out of his little thing and says oh I hope she

378
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:40,800
makes it Oak home okay you know this is a very bad storm and he knows it and he

379
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:46,440
sent her out into it too right so this this trickster he's really a trickster

380
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:52,380
right and um acting to be this nice guy right

381
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:57,540
so these characters from The Wizard of Oz

382
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:03,540
come from you know her Kansas place but you'll see if you watch the movie or

383
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:10,560
think about it you can reflect in seeing you know kind of the origins of a lot of what happens when the Twister comes she

384
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:16,740
gets knocked in the head the house gets picked up carried up into the sky and dropped into

385
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:22,859
the Land of Oz this other world and the house lands on the Wicked Witch of the

386
00:46:22,859 --> 00:46:30,119
East right is it the east or the West I don't remember one of the wicked witches and kills the wicked witch

387
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:35,460
so um Dorothy then is on this search to get

388
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:42,720
back home because she's worried about her Aunt Em so she has all this drive and desire to

389
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:48,599
get back home and she she's looking and seeking how to get home and she's

390
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:55,020
looking to others and then she's putting her trust in this Wizard of Oz to help him help her get home but he's a

391
00:46:55,020 --> 00:47:00,540
trickster right he puts on the magic show and on her journey to the Wizard of Oz

392
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:05,819
she meets all these characters and they all come with her all seeking from this

393
00:47:05,819 --> 00:47:11,160
wizard the things that they feel that they lack that they all have within themselves

394
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:18,180
so there's the wicked witch as you know greed she wants the shoes she wants the

395
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:23,400
power right and she's also the wicked witch of hatred of aversion I'll get you

396
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:29,819
my pretty she says you know she's gonna threatens and to kill Dorothy the straw

397
00:47:29,819 --> 00:47:35,040
man I mentioned sort of seeing him as the energy of restlessness and worry too

398
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:40,920
much energy unsteady kind of constantly in motion

399
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:46,859
um the Tin Man as the sloth and the torpor the not enough energy

400
00:47:46,859 --> 00:47:52,020
um and also like if you think about the Tin

401
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:59,099
Man is a representation of that that hindrance you notice he speaks slowly

402
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:04,619
that torpor the slowness of the minds right the mind is slowed down and he

403
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:09,900
doesn't process things very quickly and his emotions are sort of

404
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:16,560
dampened sort of depressed in a way and then they come to the lion

405
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:23,099
and the interesting thing about the lion is you know he's very worried

406
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:30,920
he worries a lot but you don't see it when you first meet him he actually his own doubt his own

407
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:36,060
hindrance he covers by trying to instead of you know the opposite of

408
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:41,819
Investigation he actually pretends he's a brave bully

409
00:48:41,819 --> 00:48:48,839
he he comes out with the opposite of what he feels so he's covering up his own doubt his

410
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:54,300
own worry his own sort of restlessness you know his own worry and anxiety by

411
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:59,579
pretending to be the exact opposite right which is quickly uncovered if you

412
00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:06,260
remember and that's he comes out he jumps out at them bullying them trying to get him to fight

413
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:12,119
and then what happens is Toto comes up and Barks and so he decides to chase

414
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:18,599
Toto and then Dorothy comes to his protection Dorothy comes to toda's protection and confronts the line and

415
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:24,119
slaps his nose and then he cries the line just breaks down he's like whoa why

416
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:30,780
did you hit me you know all of his fears come out immediately he goes from fully and trying to get people to fight to

417
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:38,280
just sobbing right and so let's see what else do I need to say

418
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:46,319
just a little bit more um I see Dorothy you know as a character

419
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:52,560
she has this strong pull the strong desire to protect Toto to get back to

420
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:58,800
her aunt to find her way home and I see this as what we call

421
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:04,859
um as Chand a healthy desire it's misplaced but there's this healthy

422
00:50:04,859 --> 00:50:13,140
desire to get home to reconnect you know to sort of get back to sort of

423
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:19,380
what feels right to her home and I'll call home you know mindfulness presence

424
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:25,740
being aware being awake and Toto to me is the complete

425
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:31,200
embodiment of mindfulness when you remember at when they're at the

426
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:37,740
scene where they go back to see the wizard after the wicked witch has been killed on accident

427
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:43,500
um Toto goes over to where the wizard is behind the curtain

428
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:48,780
Toto pulls the curtain back and exposes the wizard behind the curtain

429
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:54,059
it's his simple awareness his ability to just sort of not get caught up in the

430
00:50:54,059 --> 00:51:01,319
magic show did not get caught up in all the worry and all the things that I want and all

431
00:51:01,319 --> 00:51:07,319
the doubts and you know what I need he's just like look there's somebody over

432
00:51:07,319 --> 00:51:14,240
here pulls the curtain back disposes the whole magic show right

433
00:51:14,819 --> 00:51:22,020
so that's that's how I connect with the Wizard of Oz and how I see all of these

434
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:30,140
you know the hindrances and a little bit more as embodiments of the the Dharma

435
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:36,720
so any comments any anything you want to add to that or questions and Richard did

436
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:43,680
you write down some questions you could hand them to me um before we'll break up into small groups

437
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:49,980
and we have a question for you guys to um to discuss with each other

438
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:58,160
but any you want to add anything any other insights questions clarifications

439
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,000
yeah Stephen

440
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:11,000
have kind of a funny uh

441
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:16,859
uh like it um so like

442
00:52:16,859 --> 00:52:21,900
basically all these different uh characterizations are kind of something that you can kind of visualize and

443
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:30,599
they're all they're all happening yeah when we're meditating yes some more than some you know sometimes

444
00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:36,900
you have that multiple hindrance attack and they're all happening sometimes there's a dominant hindrance

445
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:42,920
that's present so um you know

446
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:48,420
it's almost like something that you associate with like different colors emotions yeah there's like these things

447
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:54,180
that come up yeah but um I remember I was on a retreat and we we did a little

448
00:52:54,180 --> 00:53:01,280
sketch where we um personifying these different um

449
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:08,339
but I just wanted to add that the Insight it was

450
00:53:08,339 --> 00:53:14,220
kind of goofy Canadian guy yeah he had um he just happened to have with him on the

451
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:19,740
retreat he wore like a uh with the bicycle or when you're in a

452
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:24,780
cave like those lights that oh yeah yeah so like when we did the little sketch we

453
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:33,059
in addition to the different um hindrances we also had headlamps a guy who was in

454
00:53:33,059 --> 00:53:38,460
sight oh Insight could see Shine the Light yes

455
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:44,400
um I I think that that's also you know that's like Toto right shining the light

456
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:50,339
bringing the awareness on to what's real beautiful yeah and the head the headlamp

457
00:53:50,339 --> 00:53:55,500
is great I love it are you know like bringing insight to like

458
00:53:55,500 --> 00:54:03,720
you know even even an individual like uh an example like like if you feeling

459
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:09,119
um ill will towards someone you could have like the insight that that that's happening when you're

460
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:14,900
meditating yes beautiful thank you

461
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:18,680
anything else

462
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:27,059
can you hear me yeah okay so how about the monkeys yeah how about the monkeys

463
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:33,540
what do you think of the monkey's Gus well I I just think that they come up in meditation more often in a much less

464
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:41,339
structured way than the primary characters yes much less structured monkeys right monkey mind and and

465
00:54:41,339 --> 00:54:47,880
they're they're doing the bidding of the wicked witch they're under the spell of the wicked witch right so

466
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:53,880
um and as soon as the wicked witch dies they're happy they're jumping around they're happy to be free not be under

467
00:54:53,880 --> 00:55:01,680
her spell you know under her control so I guess you know like it's good to

468
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:07,619
think about in what way do we you know get under the spell of these

469
00:55:07,619 --> 00:55:12,839
different hindrances and and put into emotion or actions certain things that

470
00:55:12,839 --> 00:55:18,900
you know are like the little monkeys just getting sent off to do things right beautiful

471
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:24,260
thank you would you add anything to what I just said

472
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:35,280
uh not really I think in my practice what I do is I just

473
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:41,040
I noticed that there and I just wait them out and I rate them essentially it you know yeah

474
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:45,740
great I can't tell them to go yeah

475
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:54,000
and you know so there's a question that came in from YouTube and you know you're

476
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:01,859
kind of pointing to what you do with these hindrances or manifestations of the hindrances and

477
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:07,079
tonight we really and I think it's important to invite you to get familiar

478
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:15,660
we're not going to talk a lot about how to work with each of these hindrances tonight tonight

479
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:21,300
so Diana mentioned something that is so important that you know when doubt

480
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:27,480
arises or when a hindrance arise it's very useful to investigate to get

481
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:35,640
to know it to like she said the water comes in contact with The Rock so instead of giving answers to how to

482
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:40,859
work with these things this week we're going to help name them help you kind of

483
00:56:40,859 --> 00:56:46,980
start to identify them and invite you to not take them so personally

484
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:54,020
and see what you can learn about these qualities these mind States these veils

485
00:56:54,020 --> 00:57:00,900
these hindrances as they come up in your life don't take them so seriously

486
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:06,420
right don't get too wrapped up in trying to block them or prevent them

487
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:12,480
you don't want to be acting from them but if you can turn toward them and

488
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:17,579
learn a little bit about them so

489
00:57:17,579 --> 00:57:20,180
yeah

490
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:26,660
oh nice

491
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,020
do you wanna

492
00:57:38,099 --> 00:57:43,680
the question was I was curious about how emotions surrounding guilt come into

493
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:50,520
this with the hindrances yeah guilt this is a very uh interesting

494
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:56,940
topic and maybe I'll just say um briefly in the kind of like in the

495
00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:02,520
Buddhist um teachings we don't Focus so much on guilt

496
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:07,740
we're more about remorse and then what's the difference guilt as the sense of

497
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:13,619
like Oh I'm a bad person I did this thing that harmed somebody or harmed

498
00:58:13,619 --> 00:58:18,780
myself I shouldn't do that and I should stop doing that and next time I'm not

499
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:26,520
going to do this or something like that so there's a focus on the individual feeling bad and kind of like yeah

500
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:31,680
feeling bad I'll say remorse has a focus on oh there's this

501
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:37,680
harm that caused that got cause this person is suffering and this is nobody

502
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:46,619
wants to suffer and how can we alleviate or diminish the suffering in other people so it's not so much about me as a

503
00:58:46,619 --> 00:58:52,859
bad person it's more about oh there's harm that got caused and let's not cause

504
00:58:52,859 --> 00:58:59,579
harm so it has a different shift a different emphasis and remorse goes in

505
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:05,099
with restlessness I would add that um

506
00:59:05,099 --> 00:59:11,040
I think guilt like some it's good to again investigate so when you feel

507
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:17,700
guilty about something what's kind of underneath the like listen to some of the thoughts listen to

508
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:24,359
the associations that are happening in the mind it could so easily be

509
00:59:24,359 --> 00:59:30,960
you know maybe you had hatred come up maybe you expressed hatred you know and

510
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:37,500
you or you didn't express it but you felt it so you feel guilty about it you feel you're a bad person so it's sort of

511
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:42,540
like having aversion to aversion and then it creates a sense of I feel

512
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:51,480
bad you know this had I'm bad it also for me is like sometimes I will get tripped up in this

513
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:59,040
doubt that's a doubt guilt dance it's like something about like oh I probably said

514
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:04,920
that wrong you know and it's like this awful horrible space of feeling this

515
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:11,760
doubt that comes out in a way like I'm guilty I'm bad I'm not good enough so you've gotta kind of there's so many

516
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:18,660
ways these things get masked masked you know covered and

517
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:27,059
and manifested so investigate try and see for yourself so I hope that was a a

518
01:00:27,059 --> 01:00:34,319
good answer out there thank you for asking so let's let's give you a little bit of

519
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:41,339
a chance to break up into you know we've got one's four seven so two groups

520
01:00:41,339 --> 01:00:48,660
right and um my why don't you go ahead and just make

521
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:55,020
a small circle here in a small circle here and then we'll give you the next set of instructions

522
01:00:55,020 --> 01:01:01,020
it's an opportunity for you guys to talk to each other instead of just listening to us all the time and once you get there just start by sharing your names

523
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:06,599
and maybe you know how much you've been to IMC or where you live or something

524
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:10,520
silly Pleasant like that

525
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:18,319
so you can see

526
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,960
it

527
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:10,920
okay so our thinking is that maybe I'll just

528
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:16,319
first briefly remind us of the hindrances there's kind of like this desire the

529
01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:22,079
Leaning forward and aversion leaning back kind of push pull too we can think about

530
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:29,280
and then there's a too much energy resistance or not enough energy sloth and torpor and then there's this

531
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:34,920
fifth one doubt or hesitation or uncertainty or not knowing

532
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:41,099
so those are the five and as Tanya was saying it's not

533
01:03:41,099 --> 01:03:46,740
uncommon for people to have one that tends to show up a lot for them if you

534
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:52,020
might know that if you're somebody that's always looking for the next exciting new thing or maybe you're

535
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:57,540
somebody who finds it difficult to sit still or whatever it might be so just to

536
01:03:57,540 --> 01:04:03,480
share a little bit is there one of these entrances that for you feels

537
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:09,900
um I don't know particularly interesting or juicy or something you'd like to work with you do not have to share any of

538
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:16,020
your deep dark secrets or anything like this but is there one of these five that

539
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:21,420
right now kind of has caught your attention and you'd like to pay more attention it's either because it shows

540
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:28,200
up a lot in your life or maybe because you doesn't show up at all or you don't see it or you don't

541
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:34,500
understand it or something like this and so just I have an opportunity for each one of you to kind of like share

542
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:41,160
which a hindrance and then after each one of you has had a chance then you can just maybe open it

543
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:46,859
up for a more General discussion but maybe just some general guidelines

544
01:04:46,859 --> 01:04:56,460
is I'm not giving advice to each other there's a no reason to do that and

545
01:04:56,460 --> 01:05:02,400
maybe that's it we don't have to tell long complicated stories we're not going to be here for the whole evening so you

546
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:09,059
know just enough to kind of give the flavor of what you're talking about or what you'd like to share and then Tanya

547
01:05:09,059 --> 01:05:15,839
and I will ring the bell in a little bit but just an opportunity for you guys to talk to each other and have a chance to talk instead of just listening to us all

548
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:20,880
the time and maybe just generally speaking each person can talk for one to

549
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:25,980
two minutes because we'll probably have about 10 minutes in the small group Total so if

550
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:32,579
you just kind of keep a little bit of a loose eye so everyone gets a chance to share and then a little bit of time for

551
01:05:32,579 --> 01:05:38,420
reflection together time to joining

552
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:51,059
thank you Jay if you but if you at any point if you want to grab one or both of

553
01:05:51,059 --> 01:05:56,400
us we're happy to come over and gauge if you're feeling like you're just need a

554
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:04,339
little bit more of our help or support or anything we're right here for you

555
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:11,299
I I kind of wish I could listen in foreign

556
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:37,380
we'll have to see are you guys in a good space to kind of wrap up or do you need

557
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:45,420
more time because if you need more time we'll just take something else off that we were going to do if you feel like

558
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:52,040
a couple more minutes great so how about I'll ring the bell in two minutes okay

559
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:08,100
so if I was a fly on the wall and I got to here in what what my I have learned

560
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:15,480
what would you share with me about how that was is there anything you feel comfortable sharing about your

561
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:22,159
conversations there's the microphones

562
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:27,920
thank you Brian

563
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:41,699
yeah it's uh we all have our own ways of in which the hindrances are represent

564
01:16:41,699 --> 01:16:48,060
themselves like for example I hardly ever am in silence either

565
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:53,159
something some music playing or a video playing um

566
01:16:53,159 --> 01:16:59,100
you like videos and looking for comments right Netflix

567
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:04,140
there's different things that we do you know and we try to classify them in

568
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:09,420
our in our conversations right and for me a lot I think a lot of it is like avoidance like yeah some of the things I

569
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:16,980
do it's avoiding dealing with something um and you know for some of the other

570
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:23,820
people in the room what was the fourth one the sloth interpreter where it was just low energy

571
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:28,820
you just kind of you know disconnecting from things for a while

572
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:36,719
thank you so much cool that you were kind of describing

573
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:42,600
what you do and seeing and kind of mapping and seeing that we it shows up differently for everyone right that's

574
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:48,659
that's so beautiful and that's the thing they're gonna it's not always you know

575
01:17:48,659 --> 01:17:56,060
it's not cut and paste right it's going to manifest differently

576
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:04,679
so I didn't even realize it before we were talking about it but um like we

577
01:18:04,679 --> 01:18:10,920
were just talking so like nine o'clock at night I turned on Netflix and I tune

578
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:16,739
out and I never thought of it as corporate before

579
01:18:16,739 --> 01:18:23,520
but I I like it I mean I don't see it as a negative I see it as a positive it

580
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:31,739
kind of oh refreshes my mind in a way and um

581
01:18:31,739 --> 01:18:36,960
to me I always thought those two sloth and torpor were like

582
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:41,960
really negative and um

583
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:47,460
I'm Gonna Keep Going nice you know I I think Diana wants to say something too

584
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:54,600
but I think our when we get out of whack with our Energies you know one of the things that can

585
01:18:54,600 --> 01:19:01,440
happen is like if we're doing too much concentrating too much making and doing

586
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:06,840
the opposite is you know happens it comes up and that's the sloth and torpor

587
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:13,500
right there's a certain way in which there's a an effort to kind of rebalance but we're going from the repentulation

588
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:20,760
it's too too big the swings are too big right so what were you going to say Diana oh I was going to say right we're

589
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:27,300
calling these hindrances because they're getting in the way of something so trying on Netflix itself and tuning out

590
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:34,380
may not be a bad thing it might be just the right thing to kind of help the body and mind relax and like disconnect from

591
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:41,340
the day or something like that so maybe in that way it's not a hindrance so it works for me yeah so there's

592
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:47,820
you see it as a oh I see it as a positive not I think yeah yeah so we're talking about

593
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:54,920
things you know that are getting in the way of things that we want in our lives or in our meditation practice

594
01:19:55,380 --> 01:20:01,640
great anything else anyone wants to share

595
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:08,699
maybe I'll uh just address this so a question how do the hindrances relate to

596
01:20:08,699 --> 01:20:14,219
the noble Eightfold Path are they manifestations of wrong View I wouldn't say that there are

597
01:20:14,219 --> 01:20:22,199
manifestations a wrong view these are just natural things that happen instead the hindrances are an integral part of

598
01:20:22,199 --> 01:20:29,820
concentration practice and mindfulness practice in fact we're going to talk more about mindfulness in this class but

599
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:36,060
one way if we were to teach concentration one way to think about concentration practice is hindrance

600
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:43,020
practice absolutely because hindrances are what get in the way of kind of like getting settled so some ways we might

601
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:49,140
even say mindfulness practice is hindrance practice too like noticing what gets in the way of

602
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:54,780
of being present for what's happening so that's where they show up in the April

603
01:20:54,780 --> 01:21:01,980
path yeah and I would say I think the wrong view comes in if we have the wrong view of the hindrances oh yeah you know

604
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:07,140
if we're if we're relating to them from a perspective of aversion right like

605
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:12,540
there's a um and not recognizing the suffering that they can cause you know that's

606
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:19,260
where maybe we might want to look at how they get tangled up with the wrong view yeah I would say like maybe if we do

607
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:25,140
take them personally and it's like Oh I'm a bad meditator or I'm a bad person

608
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:30,239
if we kind of like take that on that's definitely would I would say be wrong but you're kind of like personalizing

609
01:21:30,239 --> 01:21:37,040
them and if you don't know what the Eightfold Path is that's perfectly fine too

610
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:48,239
I'm trying to read uh so are there some aversions

611
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:54,120
killing Etc that may be actually good can you comment

612
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:59,280
yes of course I don't want to talk about uh specific

613
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:04,560
ones but of course we need to uh turn

614
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:10,980
away from some things we need to set boundaries we need to say this is not

615
01:22:10,980 --> 01:22:19,739
good I'm not going to do that or something like this or it's so it's not just trying to be a doormat and allow

616
01:22:19,739 --> 01:22:26,699
everything to flow through we're talking more specifically things that get in the way of our life get in the way of our

617
01:22:26,699 --> 01:22:33,600
meditation practice seeing clearly getting in the way of seeing clearly thank you getting in the way of seeing

618
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:41,400
clearly yep yep yep so um let's just see what you guys like

619
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:48,840
there's going to be a one of the things we're going to teach to help work with the hindrance is a practice called raft

620
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:55,500
so we could do a very short very short five-minute guided raft practice if you

621
01:22:55,500 --> 01:23:02,699
want that experience yes I see one head yes two it's a practice of mindfulness

622
01:23:02,699 --> 01:23:08,219
practice the acronym is raft so it's a guided practice Yeah so we've

623
01:23:08,219 --> 01:23:14,480
got a yes I think enough of a yes Diana in five minutes in five minutes

624
01:23:14,540 --> 01:23:21,120
okay maybe six Let's uh let's take a a posture that's

625
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:27,500
um has some alertness but also some relaxation

626
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:34,980
just tune in in general to how the body

627
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:42,000
is right now is it have too much energy not enough

628
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:47,960
energy or is there some wishing that you could go home

629
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:55,080
wishing that uh get away from something or maybe that's showing up in the body and

630
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:58,640
the physical experience

631
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:09,380
just a relaxed easy way tuning in

632
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:21,600
nothing in particular needs to be happening we don't need to do anything

633
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:30,020
in particular just bringing our attention to the bodily experience in general

634
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:43,980
and then can you recognize oh yeah

635
01:24:43,980 --> 01:24:50,100
there is a little bit of restlessness or a little bit of tiredness or a little

636
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:59,600
bit of push or pull can you recognize can you tune into that

637
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:16,980
and can you allow it to be there it is there already

638
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:22,580
can you just allow it to be there

639
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:41,280
without having aversion towards aversion or aversion towards restlessness or any

640
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:46,980
of that right aversion is one of the hindrances

641
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:53,780
can we allow this experience during the meditation to be there

642
01:26:14,820 --> 01:26:22,860
one of the supports for allowing it to be there

643
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:29,639
is to tune into the physical experience that's how you discovered it initially

644
01:26:29,639 --> 01:26:36,480
but often we get go into a story but can you go back to the physical

645
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:42,239
experience for example restlessness might feel like

646
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:47,540
there's a lot of buzziness or energy

647
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:53,179
bouncing through the body or maybe the legs where the arms feel a little

648
01:26:53,179 --> 01:26:59,639
energized or maybe sloth and twerpa maybe there's

649
01:26:59,639 --> 01:27:06,020
some tiredness around the eyes or heaviness in the shoulders

650
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:13,580
there's some desire there might be a slight leaning forward or up with the chin

651
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:20,880
whatever version maybe there's a little slight you know pulling back

652
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:26,360
can you feel in the body

653
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:36,360
that experience letting the thoughts take care of

654
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:42,980
themselves we're focusing on the bodily experience

655
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:12,060
and something else that can help you allow the experience to be there

656
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:20,100
is to tease apart to separate what is the actual experience

657
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:27,360
that restlessness in the body example Separate Peace apart from our reaction

658
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:33,540
to that we don't want it to be there for example these are two different things

659
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:38,840
restlessness and not wanting them to be there for example

660
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:44,580
might be the restlessness is in the body and maybe not wanting to be theirs in

661
01:28:44,580 --> 01:28:50,460
the mind or maybe that's just diversion but can you tease apart

662
01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:56,600
The Experience from our reaction to the experience

663
01:29:14,219 --> 01:29:16,820
foreign

664
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:42,080
recognize our allow a f feel in the body

665
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:49,620
T tease apart and then you add a second T yeah so what did what happened in your

666
01:29:49,620 --> 01:29:55,679
meditation that you feel was useful that you can

667
01:29:55,679 --> 01:30:01,080
trust what did you see what did you feel what did you notice

668
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:08,760
it was something that you you could rely on so the T the second T is trust like oh

669
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:17,219
it was helpful to try and Pull Apart these two pieces when I pulled them apart oh I felt a sense of like ease in

670
01:30:17,219 --> 01:30:23,460
my body it didn't feel so heavy for example so were you able it was a short practice

671
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:29,179
but was there anything that became more clear to you this seemed helpful about

672
01:30:29,179 --> 01:30:35,400
recognizing naming maybe it was just oh just recognizing that this is going on

673
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:44,159
is helpful right there oh can I trust that if I recognize this it's helpful

674
01:30:44,159 --> 01:30:50,159
so this idea of trusting what you can rely on in the practice

675
01:30:50,159 --> 01:30:57,239
is a nice place to end the practice kind of helps you let go a little bit

676
01:30:57,239 --> 01:31:03,900
you feel that that sense of okay it is good it's useful to recognize for

677
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:11,600
example yeah makes sense this is kind of a little resting stopping point

678
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:18,659
for the raft so we'll be spending much more time with us our aft raft recognize

679
01:31:18,659 --> 01:31:23,699
allow feel in the body tease apart trust yeah

680
01:31:23,699 --> 01:31:31,139
so eight o'clock okay if I just do a very brief summary before we end

681
01:31:31,139 --> 01:31:39,480
so the five hindrances arise in meditation and our daily life right they're natural

682
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:44,820
they happen to all of us they're just a normal part of Being

683
01:31:44,820 --> 01:31:52,080
Human we want to encourage you to approach working with them recognizing them with

684
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:57,360
curiosity with a lightness not a heaviness

685
01:31:57,360 --> 01:32:02,400
and um just part of that is that we tend to

686
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:08,820
actually reinforce them when we have a like oh no reaction or we try and get

687
01:32:08,820 --> 01:32:14,040
rid of them or we kind of tend to grow them they get stronger

688
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:20,460
so a light a light approach a normalizing approach and not taking it personal

689
01:32:20,460 --> 01:32:25,739
and then you know one interesting way for me of noticing hindrance is present

690
01:32:25,739 --> 01:32:31,199
is actually to notice what do I share with others or what do they share with

691
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:38,520
me like somebody comes home and all they do is complain complain complain right so that's somebody manifesting the

692
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:46,080
hindrance of aversion or there I can't know why should I do just that simple thing what's their what

693
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:53,540
are they talking about what am I talking about that can help us see the hindrances when they're present

694
01:32:53,699 --> 01:32:59,880
and so this week just the invitation is to

695
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:06,900
just be curious and to see if you can notice when these different states come up and then notice what happens when you

696
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:14,760
recognize them and can you if you're thinking about raft if you recognize it notice can I

697
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:20,699
allow this hindrance to be here or am I having aversion to it or trying

698
01:33:20,699 --> 01:33:26,699
to get rid of it just just that simple so thank you so much

699
01:33:26,699 --> 01:33:32,340
look forward to seeing you hopefully next week thank you thank you I feel like you're welcome to come up and talk

700
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:39,139
to us if you have some comments or otherwise we'd look forward to seeing you next week
