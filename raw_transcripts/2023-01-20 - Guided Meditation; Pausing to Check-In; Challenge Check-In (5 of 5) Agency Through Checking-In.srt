00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,120
hello everyone welcome

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:17,660
and welcome to this meditation

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,140
and meditation is ideally

4
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,480
something which is a bit of a mystery

5
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:38,100
bit of an unknown unknown how any meditation will go

6
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:44,539
unknown what parts of ourselves will come into the Forefront

7
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,539
unknown what we tap into

8
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,219
unknown because there's more going on when we meditate

9
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:03,860
than our own efforts and our own even purposes and intentions

10
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:12,560
I came across a wonderful quote yesterday of James Baldwin

11
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:19,439
I am what time circumstances

12
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,439
history have made me but

13
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:33,560
I am also much more and this much more

14
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,900
we are much more than what we usually think we are

15
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,520
we are much more than our challenges

16
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:49,740
and part of this much more this willingness to take in

17
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:55,460
the fact there's more going on here than we we know

18
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,640
is to also appreciate or open up to

19
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,298
Trust that we can be aware

20
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:14,220
we can step out of our challenges enough

21
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:19,860
that we can be a clearly and calmly

22
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,900
aware of our challenges

23
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:32,940
there's a way in which we can bring a sense of agency essential a

24
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:39,180
sense of personal capacity ability

25
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:47,459
and introduce it into whatever is happening where we where otherwise we would be preoccupied

26
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:53,819
caught up and swept away in we would be identified with it this is

27
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:59,099
me this is important and there's a way in Remembering we're

28
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:07,700
much more and part of that much more which is opens the door to even more and more

29
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:15,900
is to pause and be aware to step back and recognize what's

30
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:22,379
happening to make space for what is happening and in

31
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:30,540
the making of space making room for it we are opening up we're taking using

32
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,819
agency in and to take in a sense maybe even taking

33
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:43,519
a stand here here I am just much more here than my concern my preoccupation

34
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:49,159
what else is here let's make room for more

35
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:58,379
and in this kind of this step this movement towards awareness to

36
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:05,360
know to step back to pause to in there

37
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:13,200
There's Something Beautiful Something wondrous there might even be something you can

38
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,739
start getting little hints of at first of calm

39
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:25,380
of clarity of non-entanglement

40
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:34,500
so to paraphrase James bald when you are what time circumstance and

41
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:41,600
history have made you but you are also much more

42
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:50,580
so taking a meditative posture a posture that has lots of

43
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:56,600
this room for that of which you are more

44
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:11,180
and this movement towards making space pausing opening up

45
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:20,599
Begins by consciously and intentionally assuming a posture of attention

46
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:36,680
gently closing your eyes and as you do so feel into your body

47
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:47,180
feel the vitality

48
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,500
that's there in your body

49
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:19,280
in another place where we take some agency some

50
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:26,400
stepping away from business as usual isn't consciously and intentionally

51
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,100
taking a few long slow deep breaths

52
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:43,880
it's a way of reminding ourselves that we can be consciously present

53
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:53,880
present with a degree of agency here I am and I will be aware I will be

54
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,880
attentive

55
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:12,840
in part of this taking agency pausing engaging consciously

56
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,400
is also to relax

57
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:24,680
as you exhale relaxing the body

58
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:59,580
letting the breathing return to normal and continue on the exhale to relax the

59
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:05,759
body consciously intentionally

60
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:16,080
not letting things be as business as you usual but to feel

61
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,360
a relaxed but clear

62
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:28,680
intentionality the choosing to be intentionally

63
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,680
relaxing

64
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,399
and then letting go of efforts to relax

65
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:13,320
except to take a few moments to soften and relax

66
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:20,820
your mind and if this assumed assumptions of

67
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:28,200
agency is a strain or tense

68
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:34,140
to relax soften

69
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:52,019
and with a relaxed soft agency

70
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:59,899
consciously intentionally gently

71
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,100
become aware of the body breathing

72
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:57,240
taking a moment to pause step back

73
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:03,779
and how are you as a practitioner how are you practicing meditation right

74
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:06,019
now

75
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,240
hardly at all because you're drifting in thoughts

76
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,240
complacently

77
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,899
engage nicely and present

78
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:35,180
how are you as you engaging in this practice

79
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:41,180
and can you ask yourself the question how

80
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:47,220
gently spaciously non-judgmentally

81
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:54,800
it's kind of open question of curious Discovery oh it's like this

82
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:12,000
and then with the same open relaxed

83
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:21,720
Spirit of discovery Begin Again with your breathing

84
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,720
or whatever else you're aware of here in the present moment

85
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:39,540
if you are caught up in your thoughts there might be a kind of unconscious

86
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:45,360
agency unintended agency in your mind

87
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:54,680
to do so can you redirect that reclaim that

88
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:03,320
through calmly gently but clearly

89
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:11,459
begin again with the breathing will you appreciate

90
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:16,640
a relaxed gentle but intentional

91
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,020
being aware

92
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,620
to gently take a pause stepping back

93
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:29,659
for an overview how are you in the effort to meditate

94
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:39,659
are you and to step back and pause where

95
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:47,539
there's an opening in opening to wider possibilities

96
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:56,960
checking in is there some way that you would like to now adjust your meditation

97
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,658
so that you can be more present

98
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,740
Here and Now

99
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,158
where the way that you're present

100
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:21,440
feels good it's a nice way of accompanying yourself

101
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:12,059
then again so we come to the end of this meditation

102
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:16,880
to pause to step back

103
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,020
to check in with yourself

104
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,279
how are you

105
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,120
how are you in

106
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:46,039
taking into account you're always much more than what you think

107
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,779
and can you ask that question can you

108
00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:03,320
consider that way that question as a way of being

109
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:08,059
relaxed and open and curious

110
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:15,559
where how you are with the question is more important than the answers you get

111
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:25,980
asking how you are with an openness a willingness a

112
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:32,419
curiosity a kindness

113
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:40,260
where you're willing to accompany yourself as you are

114
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,820
even with what's difficult

115
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:05,760
and then to turn the Gaze outward to the world with the same question not looking for

116
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:11,100
an answer not rushing to an answer or settling on

117
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:18,080
the first answer how is the world

118
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:27,179
how is your world asking that question with an openness a

119
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:33,080
willingness to be present curiosity

120
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,600
making space for lots of possibilities

121
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:44,600
that would be not possible if you answered quickly

122
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:59,960
your world is always much more than anything you think

123
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:04,460
what is the way to be aware

124
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:10,100
that's available to the much more

125
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:22,500
and can you accompany this world can you accompany others

126
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:26,779
with this generosity of attention

127
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,679
with kindness

128
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:38,898
with making room and space

129
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:47,659
were so much of the joys and suffering can be held

130
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,520
with caring attention

131
00:30:54,659 --> 00:31:00,140
may all beings be happy

132
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:08,039
may all beings be safe may all beings

133
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:15,139
be peaceful and may all beings be free

134
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:31,109
[Music]

135
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:46,740
thank you so good morning good day everyone

136
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:54,000
so this week we I'm talking about challenges and um well for this is the kind of the

137
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,520
general theme now it's going to be for a while and um

138
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:06,620
and so the challenges are um

139
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:14,039
you know can be very challenging that's what it means it's difficulty which is difficult difficulty which we're having

140
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:19,440
trouble figuring out how to be with or it's not clear what to do and we had to sometimes we have to figure something

141
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:27,299
out or it can be overwhelming and it's a wide range of what can be called a challenge

142
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:32,640
and what I offered this week was that what I call a challenge to check in the

143
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:40,159
mindfulness check-in and um it has a number of functions one is to

144
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:45,720
have a step away from business as usual with a challenge if we're really caught

145
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:53,520
in it and and oppressed by it then and uh and really preoccupied we uh and

146
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:59,640
we're and we're focusing on some clear idea this is the problem

147
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:07,440
but to step away and not be caught in anything and take a pause a sacred pause

148
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:13,500
to check in and to have a different framework a different perspective in which to look

149
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:20,580
at our experience then the perspective we might have been using in that provides the idea that I

150
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:28,559
have a challenge so we can check in with how we are physically and we might discover that we're tense

151
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:35,159
or that our posture is kind of you know out of balance

152
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:40,799
and so we can relax the body we can bring balance to our body

153
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:46,799
we could maybe go and exercise in order to get some nice things flowing in our

154
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:53,640
body rather than feeling all congested we check in with the feeling tones the

155
00:33:53,640 --> 00:34:01,019
sense of which things are Pleasant and unpleasant and generally when we feel challenged there's something that feels unpleasant

156
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:08,580
that's sometimes generated from how we're preoccupied how we're afraid or angry or upset or something

157
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:15,118
and um and it's a generous thing to feel our contribution how that's sitting in

158
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:21,658
US because as we feel it it allows something to make space and to dissolve

159
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:29,158
or to open up become clearer but also gives us a chance to to also

160
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:37,020
realize there's much more there's also pleasure here there's also some good feelings and we're realized we've been we've been

161
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:43,679
preoccupied or fixated on the unpleasant or we see the world through the unpleasant

162
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:50,480
but since there's more here what happens if we include what feels right and good

163
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,740
then there's the Mind state uh the emotion the attitude by which

164
00:34:55,740 --> 00:35:01,619
we're operating and to see it as just that

165
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:06,960
oh that's an attitude that's an emotion that's a mind state that I have a mood

166
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:14,579
and um I'm with it I'm not it I don't have to see through it I don't

167
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:19,740
have to have those glasses on those lenses on there's another way

168
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:25,440
and then um and then the mental processes am I involved in processes that are keeping

169
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:33,359
me tight and contracted and grasping or am I touching into a practice for

170
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:40,560
example or mind States or ways of being that it clearly recognizes the challenge but

171
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:47,579
is freeing in the midst of it so asking yourselves this check-in

172
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:52,619
has a number of functions one of them is that because some of the

173
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:58,500
challenges we have are really big in some of the ways we can be with a challenge even a small one sometimes is

174
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:06,060
not productive that we might have to we might be giving ourselves a check in we might see that

175
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:13,800
and see oh I need to do something here I need to somehow break the trance break out of this this funk I need to break

176
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:22,200
out of somehow clear out so I can start fresh and so to do something that refreshes us

177
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:27,720
or to resets us and you know it could be a wide range of

178
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:34,320
things different people have different things that they want to do but this idea of having agency to shift

179
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:40,260
how we are to put ourselves in a more productive useful way is invaluable

180
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:45,540
to be stuck in the challenge and you know is can often what happens

181
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:51,720
when we're stuck in it we tend to uh ruminate and repeat the same thing so

182
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:56,820
just kind of strengthens it and strengthens it and it makes it gets worse

183
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:02,820
so something as simple as going for a walk or having a cup of hot drink

184
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:08,460
if you have if you and you know how to nap to nap for 10 minutes to meditate

185
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:15,960
for 10 minutes take a shower listen to music call up a friend and have a human

186
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:22,680
conversation with someone or go someplace you know in society that

187
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:28,079
you can kind of lose your preoccupation it's just nice to be there and you know

188
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:35,579
maybe you volunteer at an animal shelter and you go spend some time with the kittens and uh and that kind of pulls you out of

189
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:42,720
your kind of cottonness with whatever so by doing the check-in we find out oh I'm

190
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:49,980
really caught for example if you can't do the check-in because you're so caught up that's a

191
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:57,420
clear indication that an intervention is needed not an intervention that you escape

192
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:02,820
forever but maybe sometimes you escape for a little while so you can come back

193
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:08,820
refreshed in a good way the other thing the check-in does it provides a lot of information about how

194
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:15,420
you are that you then can kind of figure out okay with knowing this about me then now

195
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:24,300
I have a better sense of what I can do and uh and both of those just having uh

196
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:30,060
you know doing an intervention for yourself and and you know doing something different

197
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:36,240
or uh uh no understanding what's happening with you so you can be with

198
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:42,000
yourself or adjust yourself in a good way both of them involve agency

199
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,060
and you know and then our Buddhist scene there's a lot of emphasis on don't control don't control should be

200
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:55,280
controlling your meditation which has some truth to it but we also don't want to dismiss agency

201
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:00,839
and sometimes we dismiss agency because we have this strong emphasis on not-self

202
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:06,180
an agency is where the self operates but agency can exist without this kind

203
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:12,720
of self that's we've caught in um but we want to begin feeling and

204
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:19,560
engaging in our capacity to choose engage to that agency with what we do

205
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:27,960
because what happens with extreme challenges we tend to part of the reason we can freeze we can be overwhelmed and

206
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:34,980
we don't use our capacity for agency and so even just kind of going away

207
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:41,940
escaping the challenge for a while is an active agency to check in with yourself is an agent

208
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:48,000
you're using agency to do that and so then we slowly start discovering

209
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:55,140
by using that agency how to use it in a way that is nice is

210
00:39:55,140 --> 00:40:01,020
useful we don't pile on self and self-identity and

211
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:07,020
shoulds and shouldn'ts and and you know I'm supposed to be able to manage here

212
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:12,660
the agency they that's almost the same as the agency to use attention

213
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:19,380
we learned to do that in a soft way in a gentle way in a kind way

214
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:25,740
we learned we learned agency that we enjoy doing

215
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:32,820
and this is what I want to suggest is it's invaluable to discover in challenges

216
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:38,280
to discover some way some pleasure some or some goodness some rightness

217
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:43,560
something you feels right and good and if you can do that in how you

218
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:48,839
accompany the challenge how you show up for it and attentive to it

219
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:55,440
where you have confidence in your

220
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:03,180
agency not necessarily that you know what to do but confidence you could always have agency the agency to do the

221
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:10,320
mindfulness check-in the agency to pause and not do anything and just look at the situation

222
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:17,579
the agency to ask for help the agency to tell yourself recognizing

223
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:22,980
wow I don't know what to do here this is overwhelming

224
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:28,560
to do that in a clear conscious way is almost in a way not to be burdened by it

225
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:36,660
but like wow I'm overwhelmed to start discovering how this sense of

226
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:45,540
doing can be freeing can be relaxing can be give you a

227
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:51,780
different place from where Source within from which to

228
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:57,480
act from because sometimes when we're engaging in

229
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:04,859
Challenge and we're coming from a place of being a victim or being feeling inadequate or feeling confused or

230
00:42:04,859 --> 00:42:11,040
feeling angry or Feeling Just scattered

231
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:17,339
that will often make the challenge harder but if we can recognize we are that way

232
00:42:17,339 --> 00:42:24,180
by doing the check-in we are beginning to find agency we're beginning to find another way

233
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:30,359
that feels good so anyway this mindful check-in has a

234
00:42:30,359 --> 00:42:35,400
lot of functions and there's probably many more than I had that I've said and you're probably discovering it

235
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:42,240
but to take some time to experiment with this simple checklist

236
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:48,480
body feeling tones mind States and then these processes of the Mind how the mind

237
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:54,359
is behaving the operating principles is behaving in a way that is deleterious or

238
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:59,940
beneficial that's getting you caught and or that helps you

239
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:07,280
to have more space and freedom so uh

240
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:13,560
um so then uh thank you for all this now

241
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:19,260
for next week I'm off at the IRC The Retreat Center for teaching a retreat so

242
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:25,260
I won't be here and I believe Matthew Brent silver will be teaching

243
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:31,800
and um and then I'll be back for one week and then I'll be away for a while

244
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:38,160
but my plan is for the next months as I'm here that I'll continue this series

245
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:44,640
on challenges and even though there's a big gap with the idea that we're slowly building kind

246
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:50,359
of laying the foundation here and um and in that regard

247
00:43:50,359 --> 00:43:57,780
I'd encourage you to look for manageable challenges

248
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:06,480
maybe even really minor challenges that you have and um and start kind of uh

249
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:12,119
bringing some of this exploration of the Challenger being with a challenge

250
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:18,119
that um that we've been laying out for these last few weeks

251
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:25,800
and uh and that you're going to be creating their own Foundation yourself for what we do as we go along so one day

252
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:32,099
you can maybe have a new capacity wise

253
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:38,960
capacity to be with one of them some of the major challenges that you have

254
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:45,540
and um so thank you very very much and

255
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:51,780
I will look forward to coming back and in a week or 10 days and um

256
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:59,359
and I'm sure you'll enjoy next week's teachings as well and there's a way in which

257
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:07,680
whatever Buddhist teacher is teaching either directly and directly is about how to be with challenges so

258
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,578
so thank you
