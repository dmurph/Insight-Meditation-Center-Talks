2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,880
so for today's practice the theme

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,080
of the practices of the heart i wanted to invite us to

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,519
to explore this amazing beautiful

5
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:34,320
powerful empowering [Music] emotion

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,000
that is part of the hard qualities we usually don't talk about it so much

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,559
in happy hour i think i've talked about it before maybe a couple of times i think

8
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:54,000
but the topic is all all having a sense of awe

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,559
just can be so supportive for opening our hearts our minds to our

10
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:07,680
life to this precious human birth instead of yeah yeah yeah okay what do i have to do

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,159
or whatever just kind of we go through life often

12
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,560
um with our eyes closed sleep walking we sleep

13
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,159
walk through this this amazing this incredible

14
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,920
being alive being human we're so concerned

15
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,600
with activities with the objects of the mind

16
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:44,240
we're so concerned about the thoughts that arise about the suffering that arises about

17
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:52,000
the peace about what we want about the desires about the pushing away about wanting we're so

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,759
concerned with all of that that we become um

19
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,880
single visioned single visioned as if we have put blinders on

20
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,520
as if we are in a darkened room with a flashlight we're just focusing

21
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,040
the flashlight on what we want what we don't want what we

22
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,319
need to get done the distractions so with awe

23
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:26,640
we get to turn on the light of the whole room instead of just turning around with the

24
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:33,200
flashlight we turn on the light of the whole room and we look around

25
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,480
just it's amazing not just that the objects but the fact that

26
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,160
there is consciousness there is a mind there is presence this this being this

27
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,800
aliveness that we take for granted

28
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:59,440
i mean it's amazing that anything exists at all it's amazing that we exist at all it

29
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,840
it it's it's just america we do and we don't quite if we really really

30
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:14,080
sit to think about it we can't quite understand any of this being existing it's such a

31
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,599
miracle it's a quandary that anything exists at all that that we exist that we

32
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:26,319
can think and cognize and talk and it's just such a

33
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:32,720
sense of miracle even if we have a scientist materialistic perspective

34
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:40,000
which is great with that even with that it's this miracle of consciousness is just not

35
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,360
explained just cannot be this feeling of being in this body and

36
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,720
being alive is so amazing that if we really

37
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,720
take it in we would want to fall to our knees and kiss the ground

38
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:03,840
for just this amazing i mean if if we were say some other

39
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:10,799
animal and then for a little you know for a day we were told okay now you can be human

40
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:17,199
be human and like oh this is amazing this is incredible

41
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,400
whereas we just take it for granted wake up in the morning brush our teeth

42
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:30,800
whatever whatever anyway so oh and all can really support us

43
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,639
on the path to awakening on the path to to

44
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,880
liberation not suffering however way putting that works for you

45
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,950
because when we get too stuck in our ways um

46
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:55,360
[Music] we lose we lose track of the bigger picture it's as if we have this

47
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:03,440
tunnel vision as i said as if we're looking through a small hole and all allah allows us to to expand our

48
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:10,479
vision to expand our vision and um and be

49
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:16,560
more present for our life and we'll have a more expansive vision

50
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,680
not get stuck so much not get stuck in what

51
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,039
troubles us etc etc so you'll discover for

52
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:33,759
yourself i've said enough to to set the frame so

53
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,759
so let's explore for ourselves and see what happens and then one last thing i want to say is

54
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:47,199
is whatever arises or does not arise be kind to yourself

55
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:53,600
no need for self-judgment no need for self-judgment instead of okay now i want

56
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,039
all all needs to come up yeah maybe it doesn't come up right now maybe

57
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,240
you know it's like a shy kitty we we encourage it maybe

58
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,479
it'll come later tonight or tomorrow or sometime this week you're taking a walk in the middle of nature and all of a

59
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,600
sudden you're struck by awe so

60
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:22,880

i'd like to suggest some invitations like to consider

133
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,919
this body of ours

134
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:55,360
is made of cells so many living cells

135
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,720
that communicate interact we're alive

136
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:16,039
our immune system and marvel of ingenuity

137
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:26,919

138
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,640
so many brilliant mechanisms

139
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,760
this body that we don't quite understand

140
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:53,880
both personally and the state of the art of science

141
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,000
our cut

142
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,919
filled with so many

143
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,278
other bacteria that are helpful

144
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:36,480
that we wouldn't be able to live or digest food

145
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:43,679
if it wasn't for this host of helpful healthy bacteria

146
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:50,159
that isn't us not us

147
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,039
different genome

148
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,360

149
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,240

150
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:18,480

such an incredible privilege to be alive to be conscious

170
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:59,440
even for a brief moment in time

171
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:07,279
to have the opportunity to have agency to think to serve to love

172
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:14,640
to give how awesome is that

173
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,720
how awesome is that

174
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:10,640
resting in all opening our hearts to all

175
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:17,840
for this magnificent being who is us it was me

176
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:24,000
with intentions goodness kindness in ways we understand and we don't quite

177
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,559
understand

178
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:36,600
this amazing interconnected world

179
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,640
this

180
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:02,000
and for the last minutes of this practice period

181
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:10,398
feeling the body connecting with the breath

182
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:18,000
the body this amazing body knows what to do breathing

183
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,320

male beings everywhere including us

185
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:40,320
be in touch at least now and then [Music]

186
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:47,800
with the amazing nature of their minds and their bodies

187
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:56,878
to help open up the realization

188
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:06,040
to awakening may all beings everywhere be free

189
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:30,040
thank you all thank you for your practice

190
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:37,359
so i have some time if there are any reflections

191
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:42,400
questions comments and again

192
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:49,520
as i said at the beginning this might be

193
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:56,720
planting seeds if so if i didn't arise it's okay you're planting seeds

194
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:02,079
one reflection your comment about walking through life with

195
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:07,480
our eyes closed reminded me of a saying from the

196
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:14,079
ojibwe sometimes i go about pitying myself and all the while i am being

197
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:19,760
carried across the sky by beautiful clouds oh that's beautiful thank you for

198
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:27,520
sharing that that is lovely i read the quote again from ojibwe

199
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:35,280
sometimes i go about pitying myself and all the while i'm being carried across the sky

200
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:41,480
by beautiful clouds yes great reminder

201
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:50,800
ah appreciation coming from youtube [Music] thank you you're welcome

202
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:57,760
any other reflections what might have come up for you in this

203
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:03,520
practice offering it for the benefit of others

204
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:09,640
if there were any aha moments jamie

205
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:16,560
uh just a a question nikki um awe seems to me in some way

206
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:23,359
related to gratitude but i'm not sure how can you can you comment on the relationship between them

207
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:28,960
yeah yeah um they're related but they're not the same

208
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:34,320
actually before you meet yourself let me ask you let me turn it back to you

209
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:40,800
what what comes up for you as you've explored this how is this question coming up let's let's explore it

210
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:47,920
together um i uh i think that i have a uh more

211
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:54,000
capacity to feel awe if if i'm in regular practice of

212
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:01,520
being in touch with gratitude okay okay and can you te so so if you're

213
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:08,960
more if you're more in touch with gratitude it allows you to have ah and and more uh ah and and how do they

214
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:15,280
qualitatively feel different for you if i ask you to and as much as it's available

215
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:21,119
um well i'll uh steal something from the writer annie lamotte

216
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:27,200
you know she her paradigm is christian but she said that there's there's basically three prayers

217
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:33,040
which are help thanks and wow so oz the third

218
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:40,560
yes yes yeah nice nice it's not helped it's not thanks

219
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,599
which is the second one gratitude and it's wow

220
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:52,000
yeah yeah um yeah yeah so

221
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,560
so gratitude and all so as as i feel into my own experience then to share the

222
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:05,280
gratitude feels like an appreciation opening of the heart a thanking a

223
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:11,440
a um there's a personal relationship with gratitude there's a personal

224
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:17,200
relationship that i am grateful for this i am thankful whereas ah

225
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:24,240
it takes us out of ourselves that's perhaps yeah this is how we compare the two

226
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:30,079
all it takes is out of ourselves it's just wow wow

227
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:35,520
wow not from me and mine but just wow this is amazing

228
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:42,079
whereas gratitude is more personal relationship with with gifts and goodness so that's something to to

229
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:47,280
explore uh perhaps yeah thank you

230
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:53,119
deborah says but there's also a way that after a while you often find thanks

231
00:39:53,119 --> 00:40:00,640
oh yeah that's true too there you go that's yeah wow yeah could be

232
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,240
one more reflection here how does discernment work in this context

233
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:11,680
it seems like you are allowing everything yeah yeah yeah this is a very

234
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:17,680
good question um [Music] yeah

235
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:23,040
it's yes allowing everything which in many ways actually

236
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:31,119
is is the sense of you know when when um awareness when sati is open there's a

237
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:36,640
sense of opening open awareness opening open

238
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:42,720
don't don't put away nothing don't don't push away anything just open open to

239
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:52,319
everything so well aw allows us it tells the soil to uh for us to open to everything

240
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:57,839
uh claire says suggest reading a brief history of time yes that's a great book

241
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:03,040
yeah yeah yeah i see your hand is that your hand is

242
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:07,838
still up is that what you wanted to say claire is there anything else

243
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:14,119
you can either unmute or stay muted

244
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,839
okay i think you're not unmuting either you can't or you don't want to

245
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:37,760
hear your lips moving it's a gita says is it appropriate to say that ah is a sensation not dependent

246
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:44,319
on thinking yes it is appropriate to say that ah is a sensation

247
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:51,119
i mean reflection can bring up but it's not dependent on thinking we can just

248
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:58,560
sit with awe without thinking claire looks like you succeeded i finally got unlocked here i'm having

249
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:05,440
huge technology problems tonight but uh the reason i brought i thought of that book immediately when you started the

250
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:10,720
topic because um stephen hawking was in such awe of the

251
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:17,119
universe as a brilliant physicist but the other thing that was really awesome was that he had lou gehrig's disease and

252
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:22,319
he did all this while he was totally immobile i mean he could barely speak

253
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:28,720
uh and yet he produced one of the most brilliant books of all time and to me that's just an awesome there you go

254
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:34,960
there's all there yeah it's just and there's a movie of it if anybody's interested he did he also made it it's a

255
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:40,640
movie it's beautiful thank you claire yeah but it was just expressing his art

256
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:45,760
for what he had discovered his thanks claire yeah

257
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:53,520
so yes so speaking of all let's have all

258
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:59,920
that we have come together here on zoom and youtube and listening

259
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:07,599
on audiodharma leader here we are these amazing human beings just like us

260
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:13,680
want to practice want to wake up um aligning want to align

261
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:20,000
their um heart their actions

262
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,280
with their best intentions so as we move

263
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:32,800
to the next part of our time together in small groups what i would like to ask you

264
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:39,280
is to first of all speak from your own experience not

265
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:46,079
commenting not managing the group just from your own experience

266
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:52,640
just stay close to your own experience and

267
00:43:53,680 --> 00:44:00,480
you are welcome to say share what came up for you or hold silence say pass

268
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:06,880
each person has the opportunity to share one nugget if you if 10 things came up for you just share one

269
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:12,800
and then pass it on to the next person we'll go reverse alphabetical order

270
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:18,880
and then the next person will say something or we'll say pass and then the next person and then it will go around

271
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:25,280
and round a few times and again just speak from your own experience not managing or

272
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:32,400
or facilitating just it's a way of sharing it's a way of sharing your own awesomeness even you

273
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:38,640
don't think there is much awesomeness you are awesome you're a human being this is pretty incredible and holding
