1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:08,080
so everyone who's here i'm here up in uh the sierras on my

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:16,240
uh kind of a long weekend vacation with my wife and um and uh

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:24,000
it's a little different place than imc i'll be back there tomorrow and i think the delay

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,880
between the my transm my speaking and and you all hearing me is uh

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,920
is about 30 seconds which is different than what it has been at imc

6
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,719
so hopefully this all works fine and you can hear me one of the

7
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,559
interesting things is we have a bird that's chirping at a very regular

8
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:55,198
basis intermittent when it starts doing it but it

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,359
it some people say it sounds like an alarm going off

10
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:09,360
and it's been doing it it doesn't much of the night and uh it's kind of endearing for me

11
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,798
hopefully it'll work for all of you and

12
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,680
so and i'm here in an oak woodland the oak

13
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,840
tree is behind me

14
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:40,880
nice to see your names familiar names and others thank you rocky for loving the birds i

15
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,799
appreciate that and i think michelle has no sounds but

16
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:55,840
maybe it's on your end you have to maybe restart and uh yeah

17
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:05,920
there's a um there's a very long tradition maybe from

18
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,039
the time of the buddha of practitioners practicing in

19
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,720
the wilderness in the forest sometimes actually called forest

20
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:23,680
monastics and there were no retreat centers the

21
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,040
way we have nowadays

22
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,560
and uh so here we are and uh when you're in the wilderness you

23
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,840
have all kinds of

24
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:46,480
natural life that comes along and the first today is

25
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,840
this bird that's chirping

26
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,840
so

27
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,840
so

28
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:56,319
so those of you know california northern california we've been hiking this weekend along the south fork

29
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:03,280
of the yuba river and uh including uh going into the river

30
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:15,840
which was um cold but refreshing

31
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,960
and it seems like the wi-fi connection is quite strong so that's we don't have to worry about

32
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,840
that

33
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,840
and

34
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,360
maybe we should use this uh i should take a photograph of the scene and use it as a backdrop for

35
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:25,840
our usual youtube it's quite beautiful

36
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,840
here

37
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:07,840
so william asks is anybody here with me i know i'm alone sitting outside here

38
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:33,039
i've thought of broadcasting from the woods near redwood city but i looked around to see if i could

39
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:38,080
find good enough cell phone coverage that uh

40
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:45,759
somehow i could do it you know connect my computer to

41
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:55,039
my cell phone but so far i haven't found the connection strong enough anywhere

42
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:17,840
and i don't know whether using my phone for this purpose would work anyway hmm

43
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,160
so the wi-fi spot this cell phone cover is good at natural bridge state park

44
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,840
yes she'll go down there sometime

45
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:12,880
so it's at seven o'clock here in the sierras so we can start

46
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:19,360
so those of you just logging on um we're up here for a little vacation long

47
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:26,080
weekend vacation and so in order to

48
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:32,640
meditate with all of you doing it from the place where you are

49
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:40,160
and now there's a variety of birds around here what you hear is uh it sounds like an alarm it's a bird

50
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:46,720
that goes on good part of the night it's a lovely sound i think but i don't know how it comes through in the computer

51
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:54,320
and there's some other uh doves here and other kind of bird sounds that we have so uh

52
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:00,800
chances are that uh um we're getting a little bit of experience

53
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,880
that meditators have had down through the centuries of forest sounds wood sounds when they

54
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:12,320
practice in the woods yes there's a beeping sound that's the

55
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,320
so it's a bird that's mostly doing a constant

56
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,680
chirping on a regular basis the first night here we thought it was

57
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,279
some kind of alarm going off in the house oh and there i don't know if you could

58
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:36,560
hear the chicken the nearby rooster

59
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:52,269
so let us start and [Music]

60
00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:00,560
one of the benefits of medita meditating in the nature natural

61
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:07,878
world is to appreciate that [Music]

62
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:15,839
that we are supported in meditation by nature

63
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:26,399
now the more and more different bird sounds i don't know how much of it comes through some of it's faint it's getting a

64
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:33,600
symphony of birds including the one that's keeping the beat so the natural world is

65
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,640
found within us and around us and sometimes the word

66
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:44,320
dharma is translated as nature

67
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:52,240
and the different meanings of the word nature and sometimes even people will

68
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,760
see people translated as natural law and one of the things that we are

69
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,800
discovering in dharma practice is the way that the natural processes

70
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,240
that exist within us even around us support can support us

71
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,519
we can learn to be in harmony with them and so practice is not just about

72
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,639
our efforts we certainly have to make some efforts but some of that efforts is to place

73
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:26,639
ourselves in the in the net in nature in the dharma so that the dharma and nature can

74
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,839
operate in a way that's harmonious healthy beneficial for us and

75
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:38,240
even liberating and so to partly dharma practice is

76
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:45,200
partly getting out of the way so that which is unwholesome

77
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:51,680
that which gets in the way of the natural world or interferes with it in ways that are harmful for us and for the world around

78
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:57,040
us uh have come to an end and what is beneficial and harmonious

79
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:03,200
can operate so taking a natural natural

80
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,839
taking a meditation posture

81
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,800
and

82
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,839
allowing your eyes to close

83
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:34,320
knowing for a few moments that this human body that we have

84
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:41,600
is as much nature as the woods and the birds and

85
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,519
the natural world around us

86
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:53,600
we come out of the natural world we are intimately part of it

87
00:13:54,639 --> 00:14:00,079
our body is made up of 100 recycled materials

88
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,480
that come from that the world around us

89
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:16,000
and to take a few long slow deep breaths

90
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,680
the natural world is filled with rhythm and so here we have the rhythm of

91
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:30,880
breathing the life-giving breath that we fill our

92
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,519
lungs with

93
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:44,800
and that our body then expels the co2 to allow for fresh oxygen to

94
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,199
come in

95
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:59,360
letting your breathing return to normal

96
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,480
and taking those moments to relax your

97
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:19,120
body relaxing the belly letting the belly

98
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:25,199
soften relax the relaxing of the body

99
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:33,199
is part of this process that allows the dharma the nature to work within us in a harmonious way

100
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:46,240
relaxing in the chest and the heart

101
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,839
releasing the shoulders

102
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,880
and softening the face

103
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:23,839
letting the eyes rest in the sockets

104
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,360
and then attuning yourself to the natural rhythm

105
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,199
of your body breathing something your body has known to do

106
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:05,839
since the time you were born

107
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,839
through breathing we are participating

108
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:33,840
in the process of nature

109
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:52,960
so and perhaps as you exhale

110
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:01,360
to let go of your thoughts your concerns

111
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:08,880
let go of your worries and let go into a deep

112
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:15,840
trust in the dharma

113
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,640
in that natural process those natural processes within

114
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:43,840
that will support us

115
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,840
you

116
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,919
you

117
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,919
you

118
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,919
you

119
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,919
you

120
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,840
oh

121
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,919
you

122
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,840
oh

123
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,919
you

124
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,839
so

125
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,838
thank oh

126
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,799
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

127
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,519
perhaps the sounds that you hear around that are around me

128
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:56,960
the birds the dogs the rooster the turkey vultures or the turkey of the

129
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,280
turkeys and

130
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:10,240
i don't know if you heard the crunching of the deer they're they're stepping around

131
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:16,240
that we share this world with so many other beings

132
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:25,200
and to sit and really feel that we're connected some deep way with

133
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:31,599
other human beings that support our lives and

134
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:38,078
that we're here with other creatures and

135
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:46,319
and to live with an open heart to do it all

136
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:55,760
to live with a sense of care and mutuality that arises because of our

137
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:03,359
gratitude and to live in gratitude for how much it

138
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:08,480
is that supports our lives

139
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:21,200
the trees around that plants that make the oxygen for what

140
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,078
we depend on

141
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:36,078
the natural world that provides us with our food even if it's grown by farmers

142
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:46,320
and to feel we're part of this really a part of this world

143
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:52,880
an intimate connected part to the process the natural process of this world

144
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:57,920
and to open our hearts and our good will

145
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,839
to well-wishing

146
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:08,800
for the well-being and the welfare of this world

147
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:15,839
of all human beings

148
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,640
and of the planet itself of gaian

149
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:31,200
may all beings be happy

150
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:37,359
may all beings be safe

151
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:47,680
may all beings be peaceful and may all beings everywhere

152
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:57,200
be free

153
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:05,119
and may we find a refuge in the dharma

154
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:10,400
so that we can be a refuge for all beings

155
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:18,880
we could be someone for whom who is safe a refuge of safety

156
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:25,838
for everyone may all beings be saved

157
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:34,000
so thank you all for meditation i don't have a bell

158
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:43,680
so maybe the bird sounds can be our bell today

159
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:52,640
i don't know how much of it you hear maybe everything but

160
00:40:52,640 --> 00:41:07,838
there's been a wide range of bird sounds

161
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,880
so

162
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:35,040
so for this monday monday talk i begin a new five

163
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:42,240
part series and in some ways it continues from the

164
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:48,720
long series we had on mindfulness or breathing that mindfulness of breathing meditation

165
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,480
in general not just mindfulness of breathing

166
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:02,319
to really kind of settle in and discover the value of meditation

167
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:09,280
we discover that it's not all about me myself and mine in fact to be

168
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:18,400
involved in thoughts and ideations of me myself and mine limits our ability to settle deeply in

169
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:26,400
the meditation to in a way get out of the way for our um

170
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:33,359
to get out of the way of our meditative process to get out of the way

171
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:41,838
of what feels more and more like a natural process of the dharma moving through us

172
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:50,640
and uh and at some point we begin to appreciate that how powerful it is

173
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:57,839
to no longer interfere unnecessarily with the natural process of the dharma

174
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:03,920
within and the unnatural ways or the unhealthy ways

175
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:10,839
are to have to be caught up in our thoughts our

176
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:17,440
preoccupations to be lost in thought or to be caught in that what often is

177
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:25,440
the motivating factors for preoccupation it could be greed it could be resentment

178
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:35,920
ill will it could be doubt it could be anxiety and fear it can be conceit

179
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:42,800
a high high number high percentage of our of many people's thinking has me myself

180
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:50,318
and mine at the center of our thinking that they somehow that concerns ourselves

181
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:56,000
and of course we want to make ourselves safe of course we want the best for ourselves

182
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:02,880
and that somewhat paradox is that the less self-preoccupation we have

183
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,319
the more the self who we are more happiness and well-being there is

184
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:14,000
for us and so we begin slowly to learn that

185
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:22,480
there is um another way of living that is not

186
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:29,200
centered on self it might be centered

187
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:36,800
on this body and mind that we have it isn't that we discount this being

188
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:45,040
that we are but the ideations the ideas the identities we take on

189
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:51,280
of me myself and mine we begin to see that even those are those of them which

190
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:57,200
were are true enough those which are useful at times

191
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:02,400
interfere with our deep well-being

192
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:09,359
and i've often when i've been in the natural world like i am now uh

193
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:15,200
become acutely aware of how some of the preoccupations and concerns

194
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:21,119
i have living in an urban environment seem to just fall away and it doesn't

195
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:29,119
matter so many things don't matter so much that i need to get concerned with

196
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:36,319
maybe in the in the urban environment in the cities there's much more ongoing concern about

197
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:41,599
how other people think about us how do people think about me

198
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:49,440
if i spilled my breakfast all over my shirt

199
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:57,520
i probably wouldn't feel very comfortable walking around my neighborhood but if i spill

200
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:03,680
on my shirt from camping it's kind of unfortunate but there's all kinds of levels of

201
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:09,440
preoccupations i don't have of me myself and mine what other people are thinking

202
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:17,599
and rather i stay in touch with or stay connected to an ease a peacefulness an openness

203
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:24,000
a feeling that's more closely related to the natural world than what we might feel as part of an

204
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:30,720
urban environment maybe our social times

205
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:38,319
so then if you're following what i'm saying then we start feeling their safety

206
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:46,079
there is support there's guidance there's a profound wisdom in letting go

207
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:54,839
of self-preoccupation letting go of distractions letting go

208
00:46:54,839 --> 00:47:00,480
of um greed and hatred and delusion

209
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:06,960
and that what results from that letting go is a vitality is a wisdom

210
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:13,680
is a safety is an inspiration that we want to make part of our lives

211
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:20,800
that this is the center of my life this is what makes sense this is how i want to live i don't want

212
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:26,720
to get swept away again in distractions and greed and fear and

213
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:32,240
all the things that i get caught up in i want to live in this natural mind that

214
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:39,040
natural heart that's at ease with itself that allows to be operated without contraction

215
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:44,079
without recoiling and without

216
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:48,720
constantly being foreign against everything

217
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:58,079
and this strong orientation the strong wish heartfelt wish to stay close to this to

218
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:04,079
make this the center of our lives for buddhists is often

219
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:12,240
represented by or expressed through the notion of going for refuge

220
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:20,480
and it's represented by going for refuge sometimes in the buddha dharma and the sangha

221
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:25,838
where the buddha in most simply is the exemplar

222
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:32,160
and the dharma is his is his teachings

223
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:40,880
that arise out of his awakening and the sangha are the witnesses

224
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:48,240
who have discovered who have seen for themselves that what

225
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:54,240
he teaches and what he is the exemplar for is true

226
00:48:54,559 --> 00:49:02,000
so that's one very traditional way of understanding refuge there are other ways that the buddha

227
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:10,000
taught about refuge that have to do with other things besides the buddha dharma and the sangha and

228
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,520
there are six things and one of them that's a big surprise for

229
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:20,800
some people to hear that oneself becomes one's own refuge

230
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:27,599
in this process another is one's actions and choices become a

231
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:32,720
refuge another is the four noble truths are a

232
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:38,079
refuge and the last refuge that the buddha talks about

233
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:45,839
is refuge in the refuge of a deep letting go

234
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:53,040
of greed hate and delusion an ending of them so during this week

235
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:58,560
i would like to talk about refuge and

236
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:07,440
[Music] doing so is for many people is a topic of deep faith certainly is for me

237
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:13,520
the ancient tradition talk comment the ancient uh terror and tradition the commentators

238
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:21,200
talk about refuge exists in the in the seat of our emotions

239
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:26,240
which is said to be the heart that it's a heartfelt phenomenon

240
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:34,000
it's an element of the heart this refuge that it's a maybe it has more to do with a feeling

241
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,359
and inspiration than almost anything else

242
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:48,880
but it's not only a feeling it's not only inspiration it's not only a religious sentiment but it's one that is

243
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:54,078
intimately connected to an understanding

244
00:50:54,319 --> 00:51:01,760
and wisdom that we get as we do this practice and that's why the more people practice the more

245
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:08,400
understanding they have of where true refuge is

246
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:16,079
it's also refuge is also very closely connected to our motivations our sense of purpose

247
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:22,240
that refuge provides a direction for our lives a purpose for our lives it's an

248
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:28,000
orientation and part of the and having all these

249
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,520
things together a deep faith a deep heartfeltness a deep understanding

250
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:40,319
a deep sense of orientation and purpose that we trust means that when buddhists

251
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:46,000
go for a refuge they often will feel just that idea

252
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:52,640
reminded of this there's a trust or a faith and a knowing

253
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:59,520
that they immediately feel like oh there's safety they immediately feel that there is a

254
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:07,599
sense of of um of uh there's a context

255
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:14,800
for our lives of safety there's a net there's an order there's a lawfulness in this life

256
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:22,480
there's a natural process that i can trust and so it's going for refuge is an

257
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:29,599
affirmation not of a blind faith not of a blind adherence

258
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:35,920
to a religion but it's an affirmation of what we're growing into what's growing and

259
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:42,960
developing within us that we begin understanding and have faith in and have a connection to

260
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:48,960
that is so meaningful that for some people it becomes the center of their lives

261
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:54,240
maybe even they would say it's the most important thing in their lives

262
00:52:54,319 --> 00:53:01,599
but not more important because other important things have become less important they can if they really

263
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:08,400
are important keep them as just as important but something about the refuge and the dharma

264
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:15,319
because it's so heart-based maybe and so beyond and bigger than any kind of

265
00:53:15,319 --> 00:53:21,119
self-preoccupation and self-concern it's uh it feels like almost like the

266
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:28,079
world it feels like we're part of something that's bigger than ourselves

267
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:36,800
that connects us to all the other things that are important to us in fact as we become freer

268
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:44,960
and as we become more compassionate through practice then it provides the inner freedom we

269
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:51,440
have and the compassion we have um benefits

270
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:57,040
all the other things that we take as important in our life so to take the dharma is the most

271
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:02,240
important actually i would think improves the quality of our relationships

272
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:07,839
to all the other things that are worthy of keeping important in our lives

273
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:14,160
and to have it at the center of our lives the refuge sometimes the idea is that refuge is a

274
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:21,680
passive thing it's not passive it has to do with

275
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:27,200
how we live our lives and how we engage in the world around us

276
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:35,200
and it's a and this they say in buddhism is a gem

277
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:41,839
as a treasure so that'll be the topic and uh

278
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:49,440
this talk here today was kind of a introduction to it and um won't spend so much time

279
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:55,520
on buddha dharma and the sangha that'll be a topic for tomorrow and some of you have heard lots of talks

280
00:54:55,520 --> 00:55:01,359
on that and though i'd love to do a whole series of talks on that

281
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:08,400
i want to kind of cover that these different areas of refuge that the buddha pointed to as a way

282
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:15,440
of kind of really understanding the full depth and range of something

283
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:20,720
that can be the at the heart it can be our

284
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:26,000
heart to our lives and um in doing so

285
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:32,559
that uh we become a refuge for others not that we are making them to buddhists

286
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:38,079
but rather we are a person for whom people feel safe with

287
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:46,960
and uh inspired with that there is another way to live that's not based in greed or hatred

288
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:53,760
or based on fear so thank you thank you for

289
00:55:53,760 --> 00:56:01,760
allowing me to share this beautiful place that i'm in and and a nice coincidence that

290
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:08,559
we're in the natural world for talking about a refuge in the dharma i think of the

291
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:14,720
natural world and refuge as being somehow closely connected

292
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:19,920
so thank you very much and i look forward to continuing tomorrow

293
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:27,599
tomorrow i should be back at imc
