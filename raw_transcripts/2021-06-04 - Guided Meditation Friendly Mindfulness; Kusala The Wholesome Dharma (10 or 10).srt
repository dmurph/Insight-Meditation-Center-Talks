1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,680
yes good day everyone and welcome

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,760
and

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,560
so one of the orientation that's uh i've been talking about these last two

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,840
weeks is that of wholesome and unwholesome skillful and

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,880
unskillful and to learn to recognize when in

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:39,600
meditation the mind is doing something unskillfully that's unhelpful not useful

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:47,039
and also to recognize the authority we give these unhealthy thoughts and ideas their

8
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:54,000
importance we grant them in doing so being involved with them

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,079
maybe even perpetuating them but also recognizing that there's an

10
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,439
alternative there is wholesome skillful useful helpful ways

11
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:13,040
of engaging the mind and part of the health healthy wholesome ways is not to be

12
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,080
angry or upset about the presence of unwholesome

13
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:25,680
but rather to meet everything with compassion with kindness but not with

14
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,119
a compassion or kindness that accepts it in a way that just

15
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:37,360
perpetuates it accepts our involvement with it or our entanglement with it accepts the way we

16
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:44,079
give it importance and authority but lovingly and openly

17
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:52,840
kindly stepping away from it and and either holding it

18
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,159
kindly or focusing on something which is more wholesome

19
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,280
so in both both circumstances one of the most wholesome things we can

20
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,399
do is to meet everything with friendliness

21
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,920
it's my translation today for metta sometimes translated as good will

22
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:22,319
sometimes as loving kindness and so when we have unwholesome states of mind that

23
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:31,120
we hold that we look we look upon that with kindness with friendliness but not to

24
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:38,560
you know condone it but just to but not to condemn it either but to end the ways in which we

25
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,599
perpetuate these things but to hold it kindly so it can relax perhaps or

26
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:52,319
so that we can relax around it and to uh view everything friend in a

27
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,440
friendly way to view ourselves be our own friend

28
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:04,720
be a friend for our breathing so to have good will friendliness to all things

29
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:12,480
and it doesn't have to be so complicated to do so maybe but uh some very simple

30
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:20,879
basic human capacity for for kind of a simple friendliness to our

31
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:27,599
experience and to begin this meditation

32
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:34,720
you might close your eyes and you might simply think about

33
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:41,920
some um some person or

34
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:49,280
animal or location anything at all which when you

35
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:57,120
are with this person or being or location that it's pretty simple and natural

36
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,680
for you to have a friendly disposition maybe appreciation of the person the

37
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,680
people the beings maybe a sense of friendliness

38
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,440
and um and maybe imagine being in the presence of the

39
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,280
person or imagine a time when you had this friendly feeling for the person

40
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,880
and feel it in your body feel it in your heart

41
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:43,840
maybe even noticing what happens in your mind when you have this friendliness

42
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,919
and then to

43
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:56,320
maybe let go of the memory or the being you're thinking about but

44
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,919
let's stay keep the sense the feeling of friendliness

45
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,560
the sense of it almost maybe as if it's an open door and

46
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,160
then you allow your experience to come into it

47
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:25,840
and then allow your breathing to come into your simple friendliness

48
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,680
maybe in a friendly way that's meant to support your body's breathing

49
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,198
taking a few longer slower deeper breaths

50
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:53,840
breathing in breathing out

51
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:07,840
to be with someone as a friend means to be present for them

52
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:16,159
not too much and not too little but to be present

53
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,840
in a friendly way

54
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,080
then letting your breathing return to normal

55
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,880
and continue to

56
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,840
be with your breathing in a friendly way or allow your breathing to breathe

57
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:49,680
through or with a feeling of friendliness and kindness

58
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:57,840
and if there's any mind states that arise that are difficult or diversive

59
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:06,319
or impatient or some ways are considered unwholesome

60
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:17,039
see what it's like to not condemn it be upset by it but rather

61
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,800
to be friendly towards it

62
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:32,479
as if you're friendly with a angry person and the friendliness

63
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,319
helps the angry person to relax

64
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:48,479
is simple friendliness to yourself including what's difficult

65
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:56,879
maybe allow something to relax and to support that

66
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,440
maybe you can relax parts of your body

67
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:13,840
a friendly relaxation of the shoulders

68
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:27,120
the belly

69
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,400
muscles of the face

70
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:41,039
and a friendly

71
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:55,839
softening relaxing of the mind

72
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,519
and maybe there are many ways to be

73
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:13,360
friendly see during this meditation whether you can find

74
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,240
your way to do it in a simple way

75
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:27,360
without a high standard but just good enough friendly

76
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:37,120
disposition of goodwill care kindness

77
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,839
as an orientation for how to sit in this

78
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,839
meditation

79
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:58,079
maybe during this meditation you don't have to bother being involved

80
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:04,880
in an unwholesome mind states this is a time you can take a vacation

81
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:13,440
or a break from your involvement with them

82
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:20,639
any involvement except a basic friendliness to all things including

83
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:31,839
what's unwholesome

84
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,520
one way to be friendly in meditation

85
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,440
friendly towards all experience

86
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:42,640
whatever you're mindful of while you meditate you might gently quietly

87
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:47,360
meet it with the word yes

88
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:56,000
the word yes might protect you from unwholesome states

89
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,960
and might evoke in you

90
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:07,840
a wholesome state in relationship to what's present

91
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,000
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

92
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,559
to turn our good will outward into the world

93
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:09,600
to in a sense gaze upon the world with kind eyes

94
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:16,799
in a way that might be easier or clearer

95
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,840
when we're calm or settled

96
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:42,480
and one of the great questions is why not be friendly

97
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:51,840
and chances are there's not a lot of good reasons to avoid being friendly

98
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:05,200
friendly doesn't have to be dramatic or doesn't require much of us

99
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:11,039
we have to do something or agree with people or invite them into our homes

100
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:17,279
it just means that we have good will in our hearts that we

101
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:24,480
look upon them in friendly ways even if we keep walking

102
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:32,880
away but to always come back to being friendly

103
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:39,278
to learn the art of walking in the world in a friendly way

104
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,559
and it's with basic friendliness is a way of

105
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,759
enacting

106
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:01,440
the wish or supporting the wish or contributing to the possibility

107
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:09,760
that all beings be happy that all beings be safe

108
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,799
that all beings be peaceful

109
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,679
that all beings be free

110
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,640
may we

111
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:32,080
remember to be friendly so we can contribute to the welfare and

112
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:41,840
happiness of all beings

113
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:52,389
[Music]

114
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:07,120
so as we come to the end of these two weeks that i've been talking about kusala

115
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:13,360
wholesomeness and skillfulness

116
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:26,080
there was a man who came to the buddha to ask a question about the kusala dhamma

117
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:33,120
a question about skillful teachings spiritual teachings or or wholesome

118
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:39,840
spiritual teachings i love this kind of idea that the dhamma

119
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,679
and the teachings excuse me that the buddha teaches or that people

120
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:51,120
are oriented towards is something which is wholesome or skillful

121
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:58,159
beneficial and that's an alternative to someone coming and talking about what

122
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:04,399
is the true teaching as if there's some absolute truth ultimate truth that we have to discover

123
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:10,720
or see teaching which is ultimate you know ultimate teaching that the most

124
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:17,279
profound teaching ever and uh the buddha regularly

125
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:24,159
kind of avoided that kind of language but it was always pragmatic and he

126
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:30,840
emphasizes that which was wholesome and beneficial that which is beneficial for leading to the end of

127
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:36,799
suffering and brought happiness and welfare it's a very different orientation for

128
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:43,440
religious teachings where many times in philosophy and religion people are looking for what's ultimately true

129
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:49,679
in buddhism it's more looking at what leads to happiness and welfare and what leads to

130
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:56,559
the end of suffering so this man comes that's coming a little bit to challenge the buddha

131
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:05,200
and uh he says that um it seems to me that if someone discovers

132
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:12,320
a wholesome teaching a wholesome dharma that they shouldn't teach that to

133
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:17,840
anybody else because it's an impediment to them it's

134
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:26,000
a obstacle to them it's just causes them headaches to uh have to go and teach other people

135
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,760
and after all what can one person do for another person implying that you really can't really

136
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:38,320
can't do something for another much for other people so he asked what do you think about this

137
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:44,240
to the buddha and the buddha said well let me reply with a simile

138
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:50,080
and i think this is a very kind thing to do is rather than directly criticizing the man for his

139
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:55,760
teachings or or offering an alternative directly as almost like there's two different views

140
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:01,679
and i'm going to offer my view now and that's that clearly opposed to your view he says well i'm going to uh

141
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:06,880
offer you a simile and i'll ask you questions

142
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:13,039
so so this brought man who's talking to the buddha it's important to understand that he's a

143
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:19,120
large landholder and in a time in time of the buddha he owns a vast

144
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,399
estate where there are many sharecroppers who work his fields and

145
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:32,720
you know they share in the crop a little bit and that's their payment and um so

146
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:41,279
the buddha says well imagine a visitor comes to you and says

147
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:48,960
you know you should just keep all the produce that's produced on your estate for yourself so you can enjoy it

148
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,320
and have a good life and and don't share anything with your sharecroppers

149
00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:01,679
if that person came to you and told you that would that be a challenge difficulty

150
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,960
for your sharecroppers and the man said yes that would be a difficulty for them and

151
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:14,000
be challenged for them not to receive any payment or any any of the produce for themselves

152
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,839
and uh would that person be uh that visitor who came would that visitor be would be would

153
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:25,520
that person be concerned with their welfare and the man said oh

154
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:32,398
no the person would have no concern for their welfare well then if that uh what do you think

155
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:38,240
with that person more have ill will for your sharecroppers

156
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:44,720
or goodwill or love and kindness kindness for them for your sharecroppers

157
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:51,440
and the person said oh even more ill will for them and the buddha said in the same way if a

158
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:57,280
person discovers a wholesome teaching a wholesome dharma

159
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:04,160
wholesome practice and it doesn't share it with people who could benefit from it

160
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:10,560
that's a challenge for them it's an obstacle for them it uh it's a you know

161
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:18,320
and it's an impediment for them in terms of moving towards greater welfare and um it would not support them and

162
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:25,680
benefit them and maybe it's more likely that kind of keeping the teachings to oneself is a

163
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:30,400
kind of ill will a little bit aversion that's there

164
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:37,760
so that so rather than directly countering the man the buddha said here is a simile how would you behave under a

165
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:43,359
similar circumstance and when the man understood how he'd behave in a similar circumstance

166
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:50,160
then i think the idea is the buddha didn't have to answer the question directly as asked a person could

167
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:59,359
figure out how the simile was applied to his own question and so here the idea being that um

168
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:05,200
there is a wholesome dharma skillful dharmas and that it's a good thing to share it

169
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:11,680
with people it's a good thing to teach if you have if you really discovered it and know it really for yourself

170
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:17,920
and so whether everyone should be teaching explicitly or be a teacher that's another question but the idea

171
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,280
that um that we're here we have something we discovered how to live in a way that

172
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:29,760
is beneficial and we share it with others we live it so that we can benefit other

173
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:37,520
people as well that we don't live uh hermetically sealed off from others but we live in a world uh to cooperate

174
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:45,920
into and to um and to live in mutual kind regard and mutual support for each other

175
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:51,839
and um and so we discover wholesome states of mind we discover wholesome

176
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:58,240
practices wholesome ways of being and you could just keep it to yourself

177
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:06,160
but rather than necessarily teaching your family and friends be sure to live it be sure to express it

178
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,839
in how you live your life share the goodness you discovered the freedom you discovered

179
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:18,400
and that's an art that's a skill to be learned gradually slowly by

180
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:26,960
continuing to do it just because it's difficult um the or it feels a little bit like a

181
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:32,720
you know tiring to kind of be kind to people or friendly

182
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:38,480
if we keep practicing it and doing it it becomes easier and easier it becomes second nature

183
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:45,920
and in some sense it eventually becomes easier than many of the alternatives

184
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,800
so the whole sum dharma and i want to end this series of talks with emphasizing what

185
00:37:52,800 --> 00:38:00,560
i've said now repeatedly about the nature of the buddha's teachings that they're pragmatic

186
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:06,640
there are many people who came to the buddha to ask ultimate questions you know ultimate spiritual

187
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:12,720
religious philosophical existential questions and um some people even demanded the

188
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:19,040
buddha that he should answer these kinds of questions like uh does does the soul exist will the

189
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:24,720
soul exist after we die does a soul die when we die

190
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:30,880
is consciousness something eternal is conscious of something that is temporary only here when we're alive

191
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:37,119
is uh the world eternal is the world fine you know not going to last forever

192
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:43,280
is the world infinite it goes on forever or is it finite all these kinds of kind of ultimate

193
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:50,320
questions and we can add probably all kinds of ones that we've probably hurt ourselves over time um

194
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:56,000
and um and some people really want answers to these things because somehow that reassures them or

195
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,119
tells them they're on a good path or i don't know what the reasons but

196
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:08,480
but the the buddha always said oh those kinds of questions

197
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,920
they are not beneficial so he kind of mostly just stays silent he

198
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:21,200
doesn't answer those questions they don't not beneficial for helping people come to the end of suffering

199
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:28,320
to discover a real happiness and and what is what i teach

200
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:35,200
is the practice the orientation the view that supports people to discover what is

201
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:41,599
really beneficial what brings welfare what brings happiness the end of suffering

202
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:46,720
and and and so with this kind of pragmatic orientation

203
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:53,760
the buddha's concern is um is really with people suffering and

204
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:59,200
overcoming it that's the the topic and sometimes our

205
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:07,920
particular buddhist tradition is considered kind of a lesser lesser buddhist tradition and

206
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:13,920
and maybe that's a nice label we can embrace because yes it's lesser in the sense that it doesn't

207
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:22,079
uh pursue all the grand and wonderful cosmic existential questions that people

208
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:27,680
can think of but rather focus on something very fundamental and root

209
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:34,000
that is the suffering and the end of suffering um happiness and the discovery of a

210
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,240
lasting really profound happiness and well-being

211
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:47,359
and with that end of suffering and with this discovery of happiness then our relationship to these great

212
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:52,480
existential questions the meaning of life and what happens when we die

213
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:58,079
takes a they might still be interesting questions but then they have more they're a little bit more philosophical

214
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:05,920
in nature a little bit more abstract or a little bit more there's not a they're not as a weighty or as important for us

215
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,960
because we've discovered how to be at peace and very happy here there's no fear that's driving those

216
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:16,720
questions so so

217
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:24,480
wholesome and wholesomeness skillfulness uh this is a really

218
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,839
fundamental uh concept uh in the teachings of the buddha that i

219
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:35,119
find quite inspiring it's simple and it's meant to simplify

220
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:41,359
things uh to keep us close to what's most important if what we want to do is to become free

221
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:48,160
of suffering so um thank you very much

222
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:54,319
and uh i hope that you will live a wholesome skillful life for your own

223
00:41:54,319 --> 00:42:01,839
sake and for the sake of others it's a great privilege great honor to be able to do even the

224
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:12,720
smallest thing to benefit the life of someone else so thank you very much
