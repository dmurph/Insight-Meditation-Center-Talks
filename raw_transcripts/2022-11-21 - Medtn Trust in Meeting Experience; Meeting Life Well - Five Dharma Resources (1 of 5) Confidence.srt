1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:07,740
okay well I think we'll go ahead and get started as people continue to arrive

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:16,619
nice to see everyone so this week the theme is called meeting

3
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:24,900
life well five Dharma resources one could say that Dharma practice is a

4
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:33,239
series of encounters we sit on the cushion and we meet the state of our body and mind in detail and then we go

5
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:38,760
out into the world and we meet other people situations in our life and amid

6
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,100
all of that we have our own minds reaction going on also so there's a lot

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,620
going on in the human life and as we encounter our life

8
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:56,039
on what resources do we draw in order to meet it well and to respond well

9
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:02,039
are there supportive qualities or assets that can come forth in particular when

10
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:08,460
things get challenging or surprising or unfamiliar of course I think we all know that

11
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,860
mindfulness is essential so we might call that the foundational resource

12
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:20,580
what the Buddha also named other qualities as forms of inner wealth or

13
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:27,659
fortitude and there's a list of five items that I like to call the five Dharma resources

14
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:33,600
that's my term not the Buddhas um what you'll see as this week unfolds

15
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:40,799
that these five when they're readily available for us can serve as highly

16
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:49,320
helpful resources to meet life well and the first of them is confidence

17
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:57,540
so we'll see the others as as we go on but let's go ahead and start sitting

18
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:05,520
so finding a posture where you can be upright and relaxed

19
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:14,840
or at least have a straight spine just allowing yourself to settle into

20
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,700
a position that's relaxed and alert

21
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:28,680
perhaps sensing the contact points where you're sitting or lying down maybe

22
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:35,640
some of you are standing so feeling your seat against the cushion or chair

23
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:44,160
your legs or feet against the floor or your body against the surface

24
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,120
and just feeling the support and groundedness of that

25
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,540
allowing yourself to be supported

26
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:08,519
you may find that as we connect with and Trust what's supporting

27
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:15,959
us there's kind of an upward surge of energy allowing the body to be drawn

28
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:21,959
upward just allowing that also

29
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,900
as we softened down the body straightens

30
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:39,140
and softening the muscles of the face the eyes and the eye sockets

31
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,500
the jaw

32
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,700
softening down through the shoulders allowing the shoulder blades to slide

33
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:02,760
down the back which tends to put the chest just a bit

34
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,220
forward leaving with the heart

35
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,440
allowing there to be ease in the arms and hands

36
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,860
and down through the Torso

37
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,400
softening the rib cage front back sides

38
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:43,340
sensing Into the Heart area just allowing that to be as it is

39
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,320
down into the valley

40
00:04:55,259 --> 00:05:01,820
just connecting in and inviting any ease

41
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,180
through the belly area

42
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:23,000
and then down through the hips the inner thighs

43
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,900
the knees and all the way down into the feet

44
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:38,120
just connecting in with the whole body however it is right now

45
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:49,560
and inviting ease and if there are still parts that are sore or tense

46
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:57,000
or you couldn't feel them very well that's fine can just have ease in the mind also

47
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,979
about how the body is right now

48
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:20,940
and gently turning the attention toward the sensations of breathing

49
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,080
toward the breath

50
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:35,220
and if we can we want to connect in with the very basic Elemental sensations of

51
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:42,539
breathing so rather than an idea or even an image

52
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:48,780
of our lungs or something I really feel the touch of the air on

53
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:53,060
the nostrils or the upper lip

54
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:03,620
some sense of expansion and coolness as it moves through the air passages

55
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:11,340
maybe there's a shift of clothing against the skin as the chest inflates

56
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:15,680
maybe you feel it even into the belly

57
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:25,259
and then at some point the inhale ends and there's a shifting

58
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:29,599
feeling as the exhale begins

59
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:36,419
the lungs soften and begin to release and there's

60
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:42,020
a different movement of air maybe warmth

61
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:54,479
so it's all part of Wrath but there are these minute simple Sensations that we

62
00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:00,020
can allow attention to just flow along with

63
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:13,819
and all of that is in the service of establishing the quality of mindfulness

64
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,918
being in the present moment

65
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,719
this is the foundational resource for us and a five that we'll talk about this

66
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:40,459
week all rely on some degree of mindfulness

67
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,779
and as we get used to the being with the flow of the sensations of

68
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:24,180
breathing we can of course be aware of other Body

69
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:32,339
Sensations there's also the Sensations in the legs and

70
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:39,959
maybe you have other Sensations coming forward there's the sound of my voice

71
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:45,439
or other things in the room or the house where you are

72
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:53,060
and we can just breathe along with those

73
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:12,360
there may also be some emotion or mood present for you

74
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:19,980
it may not be prominent or it may be you know we may have sense of tiredness or

75
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:27,420
sadness or ease Joy

76
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:32,580
irritation could be anything we can read along with

77
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,480
that also

78
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:03,959
and it's common also to have thoughts going on meditation is not about eliminating all

79
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:09,240
thoughts but we can simply be aware when there's

80
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:15,720
thinking going on so if you have some thoughts present

81
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,760
you can try to breathe through them or along with them

82
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:28,880
let them be kind of in the background like a radio playing in the background

83
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:35,300
not trying to shut it off but also not turning toward it

84
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,600
thank you

85
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:25,860
I know in the mind has wandered away it's fine to just

86
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:31,440
gently reopen to all these objects when

87
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:38,420
awareness returns just start again with the breath or the body

88
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:46,639
being with what's present just being simple

89
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:32,880
anything in our experience can be touched or known by awareness

90
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,200
anything actually

91
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:45,000
service May generate some trust in this quality of knowing

92
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,380
as the initial foundational way to meet life

93
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,839
foreign

94
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,820
so I'd like to drop in just some very brief reflections

95
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:42,800
and then we'll keep sitting in silence after that

96
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,260
so please recall how you first encountered the Dharma

97
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:59,519
or meditation or mindfulness how is it that you somehow came into

98
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,019
contact with that

99
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:20,459
and then move on to recalling what kept you going with it

100
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:28,160
even if you're quite new or if you have started and stopped a number of times

101
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,480
what is it that in the heart that wishes to practice or

102
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:40,699
that keeps you with it keeps you coming back

103
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,699
and then if you can kind of feel underneath the specifics

104
00:16:56,699 --> 00:17:03,720
if there's some kind of quality like trust or confidence

105
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:09,900
I really might even call it faith and what you're doing with this practice

106
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:18,480
it doesn't have to be anything you can name or explain it's more like the underlying feeling there

107
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,819
let's see if you can tap into that

108
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:41,580
and perhaps with a bow to our heart we can just go back to sitting with the

109
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:47,160
flow of experience perhaps infused a little bit with this

110
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:55,580
sense of trust in the process of meeting it however that feels for you right now

111
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:08,400
gently bringing the attention to the body sitting

112
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:18,120
just in these last few minutes just touching in again to the upright

113
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:25,679
posture particularly centering into the chest

114
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,919
area

115
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:39,299
breathing in and out of that space following the shoulders to soften

116
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:46,700
are to be forward a bit the way it is on our Buddha statue

117
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:58,860
with a rupas are meant to express confidence in a certain way

118
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:02,120
through their posture

119
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:13,620
there's a way in which our own sense of trust and confidence in the practice

120
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:19,159
is conveyed even silently

121
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:27,559
definitely doesn't need to be overt or verbal

122
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:34,440
when I first attended a Sangha just a local sitting group

123
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:40,100
I was struck by how it just seemed like the people who were the more experienced

124
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:45,480
leaders of the group they just seemed comfortable with themselves

125
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:52,020
that was what I noticed because I was not at that time

126
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:57,480
so is there a way that whatever your sense of trust in the

127
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:02,580
Dharma or in mindfulness might somehow just be part of your being

128
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:08,220
as you go about today with the hope that

129
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:17,240
somehow that will be picked up by others not even in a really a conscious way

130
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:22,880
but our way of being does subtly influence others

131
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:32,179
the world needs people who are confident in being present for whatever's happening

132
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:37,398
may that be something that we can offer from our practice

133
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,289
[Music]

134
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,640
foreign

135
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,680
[Music]

136
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:35,640
so someone wants to ask the zen teacher possibly Suzuki roshi

137
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:44,820
um what is the essential teaching of Zen and the reply was an appropriate

138
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:50,760
response so we'll be talking this week about five

139
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:56,640
Dharma resources that support our ability to meet life well maybe to

140
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:04,080
produce an appropriate response in the moment their inner strengths that can rise up

141
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:11,220
to meet the moment and they come forth in happy times as well as amid suffering

142
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:16,260
but they're especially useful if we encounter something that is confusing or

143
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:23,279
alarming or painful or just outside of our typical experience

144
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:29,480
so I'll name them all first they are confidence

145
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:35,000
virtue or ethical conduct listening and learning

146
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,919
generosity and letting go and discernment

147
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:46,559
so this list of five is actually from the sutas it appears in a variety of

148
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:54,000
sutas in Bali Canon at least 10 that I counted and to name them in Pali the these

149
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:02,760
qualities are SATA Sila suta chaga and panya

150
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:08,279
which we'll go through this week so in these various discourses they're

151
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:14,520
not always applied in the same way let's say the Buddha called them

152
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:22,279
types of wealth ways of fortifying the mind modes of spiritual growth

153
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:27,440
accomplishments and Inspirations that's kind of a range

154
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:36,059
but I like to sum up all of those diverse terms into the single term Dharma resources so resources from which

155
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:43,440
the heart draws to respond well to situations both on and off the cushion

156
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,600
and we can strengthen these through practice and we can also observe how

157
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:56,220
they might naturally arise to meet situations if we're mindful they all have the basis of mindfulness

158
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:02,520
and the stronger that they become in our heart then the more readily available they are

159
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:08,220
to meet life So today we're talking about confidence

160
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:14,039
SATA I just watched a new film

161
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:20,940
that was made about the founding of the Insight Meditation Society IMS which is

162
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:28,200
kind of the mother institution of insight practice here in the west I think it's fair to call it that

163
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:34,019
we have several long and long-standing institutions now but IMS was the first

164
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:39,779
that was aimed at training laypeople in the practices that the founding teachers

165
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:45,120
had learned in Asia and it was formed in the late 1970s

166
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:50,580
so those founding teachers are Joseph Goldstein Jack cornfield and Sharon

167
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:57,360
Salzburg and also Jacqueline Mandel was involved at the time so

168
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:04,799
um and then Joseph is kind of the you know the one who Joseph and Sharon remained at IMs and are the kind of

169
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:12,240
grandmother and grandfather there so what's striking about the film is how

170
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:17,878
much trust and faith and confidence were needed to create IMS and the Insight

171
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:22,919
Retreat form that we have when there was really nothing like that in the U.S

172
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:28,260
before these were young people in their 20s and

173
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:33,720
you know they've just come back from Asia and they were buying a huge Catholic

174
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:40,740
novitiary for a lot more money than they had really dealt with before and they're you know they came and look

175
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:47,878
they've been looking at a bunch of different places but they saw this one one morning and they were pondering well

176
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:54,118
is this the one because it it seemed to meet all of their needs although it was really a lot bigger than they expected

177
00:34:54,119 --> 00:35:01,980
but they thought about should we buy it and so they they went into the Town Square in Berry Massachusetts which is

178
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:08,339
where IMS is located and they were kind of hanging around and they noticed that there was a statue in

179
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:16,800
the middle of the square that had the town motto on it the town motto for Barry is tranquil and alert

180
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:23,280
so they thought perfect perfect for a meditation center let's go for it

181
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:29,040
so they they tried to you know they went forward they signed the forms but they

182
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:36,420
didn't have all the money for the down payment yet so they did some fundraising but they were still short eventually by

183
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:43,859
fifteen thousand dollars which was a lot of money in the mid 70s and it was a lot of money for a group of essentially

184
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:52,140
hippies in their 20s so you know how to get fifteen thousand dollars no clue but

185
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:58,260
um Joseph at that time was teaching at naropa in Colorado and he was there for

186
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:03,480
an extended period doing some classes and living in an apartment there and a

187
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:10,560
woman came to his apartment who had been to one of his classes and she said I'm wondering what to do with some money

188
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:16,619
that I inherited it's about fifteen thousand dollars what do you think I should do with it

189
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:23,400
and he said well I have an idea for that so you know it kind of

190
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:29,160
appeared for them and then of course so then they bought the building I have a lot of stories

191
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:35,520
today by the way um once they had the building they were learning to operate it and keep it going

192
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:41,839
and they found that it had three massive oil tanks in the basement 60 feet long

193
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:47,520
and it was not even possible to remove them from the room where they were

194
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:55,440
but it turned out as they checked them that only one out of three was actually working and so the facilities person was

195
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:02,339
a little worried about this uh you know how to three three tanks only one functioning

196
00:37:02,339 --> 00:37:08,700
can't even really get the manner out so he was a little bit at wit's end and

197
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:15,240
he said to Joseph what are we going to do about these tanks and you know what if this one doesn't work anymore and

198
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:21,000
Joseph simply asked him well is it working now and he said yes Joseph said

199
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,960
not to worry there will be a way something will work so people repeatedly in this in this

200
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:33,900
film referred to Joseph's faith in slowly growing IMS to him it was just

201
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:39,480
doing the next thing doing the next thing and somehow it all worked out of course there were many problems along

202
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:44,640
the way but you know this kind of just meeting the moment this kind of

203
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:50,099
sincere confidence is often behind institutions that actually endure and

204
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:56,520
evolve over decades or longer and we can see some similar things I think in the

205
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:03,780
evolution of IMC where where this where we're based here just one small example

206
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:10,140
maybe is the financial model at IRC Insight Retreat Center that's associated

207
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:17,820
with IMC and the financial model there is that the you know there's no registration fee and the Retreats are

208
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:25,140
offered on the Donna basis and the donations that people make somehow pay it forward and keep it going

209
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:31,740
and I've heard people talk about Gill's faith in this regard it's it's not really a common business model in the

210
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:37,140
world to you know not charge for what you offer and many people said that it wouldn't

211
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:42,980
work and yet yet it does so

212
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:48,599
this is yeah this is meeting the moment as it says in the comments and this is

213
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:55,260
you know I'm talking on an Institutional scale but it can work on a personal scale too I'm remembering uh talking

214
00:38:55,260 --> 00:39:01,880
with ayatata Loca who's one of now the very senior nuns in the coonies in the

215
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:07,680
western world and she you know way back when she was thinking about ordaining

216
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:14,520
very young in her 20s um she was going back and forth should I ordain as a nun what should I do with my

217
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:20,280
life and she happened to be flying back home to which was in Portland at the

218
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:26,280
time uh Portland Oregon and she got off the plane and that was in the time when Nike

219
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:32,520
had their um their slogan just do it and there were all these ads in the Nike

220
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:39,720
airport in the in the Portland Airport from Nike that said just do it just do it and then she walked off the plane and

221
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:47,339
saw these um signs she said okay I think I'll ordained just do it

222
00:39:47,339 --> 00:39:55,440
so there's a way that honest openness to the Dharma connects us into some larger

223
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:01,859
flow I've heard Gill call this hidden Pathways that we don't know are there

224
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:08,520
and sometimes this approach of Simply having confidence is a way to meet the uncertainties of life

225
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:14,460
and it's not even that we have confidence or trust in some specific thing that we could name

226
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:19,859
we just have trust there's a saying the Dharma supports those who support the

227
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:25,619
Dharma and you know this has to be done with some

228
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:31,520
sincerity and humility we can't rely on it from a purely cognitive perspective

229
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:37,140
or we can't have a demand or an expectation

230
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:42,300
um in in following that that maximum in our life

231
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:49,079
and it's useful also to remember that we might not get the exact solution that we

232
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:56,520
were imagining but there will be some shift that addresses our problem you know if we take this approach of meeting

233
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:01,680
life confidently so here I want to give a somewhat pointed example that I heard

234
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:07,200
from another Dharma teacher in a Dharma talk and I found it striking they were

235
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:13,440
saying suppose a person has the problem of wetting their pants when they get

236
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:20,400
nervous in public and they desperately wish to end the suffering of this terrible condition and

237
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:26,160
so they Place their trust in their Dharma practice but instead of

238
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:31,560
stopping the wedding of their pants what they find is that they become equanimous

239
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:38,960
about doing it so either way the suffering subsides I mean it's kind of a

240
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,339
humorous and somewhat overblown example but it points toward the idea that we

241
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:49,500
can't quite demand how the issue is going to be addressed but we can have

242
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:54,720
confidence that the Dharma will find a way to ease the suffering maybe things

243
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:00,960
change or maybe we just learn not to be so concerned or any other of a myriad

244
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:06,359
possibilities it may not even be about a you know we

245
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:12,599
may not even use this approach just for problems per se I know somebody from a

246
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:18,420
asanga in another location who was sometimes asked to give Dharma talks

247
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:23,520
when the teacher was away and one time she was asked and she said no because

248
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:29,579
she didn't really have any ideas for a talk um but so that's one approach

249
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:36,359
but another approach is to just say yes and trust that because the talk is on

250
00:42:36,359 --> 00:42:41,579
the calendar an idea will come you don't need an idea for a Dharma talk when

251
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:47,280
there isn't one coming up on the calendar but as soon as there is then maybe an

252
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:52,440
idea will come so I don't know do you have my examples

253
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:58,200
of this from your own life if you want to say ask that as a question for your

254
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:03,319
contemplation have there been examples of that that you've seen

255
00:43:03,319 --> 00:43:09,000
there's even a story from the sutas about this Maha kasapa who was one of

256
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,819
the Buddha's Chief disciples he knew from an early age that he wanted to

257
00:43:14,819 --> 00:43:22,800
ordain as a monk but his parents wouldn't allow it and he ended up marrying he ended up

258
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:30,000
married he didn't want to get married but he ended up marrying turned out a woman who really wanted to be a nun but her parents wouldn't allow it so they

259
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,160
did their best to being married and running a farm to make a living but

260
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:40,619
eventually the calling to the spiritual life was too strong for both of them and

261
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:47,640
without even having met the Buddha you know he the possible had never met his teacher but he just knew he wanted to

262
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:54,839
ordain he wanted to live that life so without having met the Buddha kasapa and actually also his wife they just put

263
00:43:54,839 --> 00:43:59,940
on the yellow robe anyway kind of effectively ordaining themselves and set

264
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:06,599
out on the road and the Buddha had sensed at that point that a great disciple was in the area and was coming

265
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:13,040
and he went to meet Kosovo but gossipa couldn't have known that when he set out

266
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:18,060
so this quality of confidence sadha

267
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:25,500
Sometimes the best approach is to just go forward sincerely not knowing how it's all going to work out but trusting

268
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:33,060
that we'll be able to meet it whatever comes may be pleasant maybe unpleasant but we trust that we can meet it

269
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:40,400
so confidence becomes a Dharma resource when we have some clarity in our heart

270
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:45,599
about what we're devoted to or what we're following or what we're aspiring

271
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:52,380
to we have some clarity like we want to build a Dharma Center in America we want to orient our life around

272
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:58,740
practice we want to find a way to meet a terminal illness something and then we

273
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:05,220
step forward and we need the next moment and the next we maybe have a big picture in mind but big pictures come about

274
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:11,220
Moment by Moment by moment and there's a way that we can bring our

275
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:18,300
full heart to that so may you find that confidence is a Dharma

276
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:23,940
resource for you today and and broadly in your life

277
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:26,780
thank you
