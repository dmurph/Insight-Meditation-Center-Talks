1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:08,480
thank you for your practice hello to people on youtube welcome everybody

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,480
one thing i like to say um

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,920
is that uh at imc um

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,160
membership is a matter of wanting to belong so anyone who wants to be part of the

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,840
sangha you are part of the sangha just so you know

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:42,320
so i want to talk about effort today the practice of effort

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,200
and just notice if you can what quality of response do you have in

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:56,960
your being as i bring up the word effort is that uh when i say that word

9
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,640
do you feel a sense of like connecting to having to work hard

10
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,560
or a sense of i don't want to think about effort just i think this word is um

11
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:16,240
what it points to is incredibly important but our relationship to the idea of it may

12
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,799
not be as useful as it could be

13
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,280
i've heard is actually the most common quality that is listed by the

14
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:34,560
buddha for awakening effort is woven into everything we do

15
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:42,159
it's the stuff of energy and it seems to me that it takes on the

16
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:49,600
resonance or the tone of whatever is guiding inspiring or directing it

17
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,560
in particular the qualities of the heart and the presence or absence of wisdom

18
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:03,280
can really be noted in our our efforts and [Music]

19
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,840
to me recognizing the

20
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,080
the visible experiential results of making effort is something

21
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:23,360
that's always possible we can really tune in to the kind of effort

22
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,440
we're making by noticing the results of what we're doing and i'm going to talk a lot more about

23
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:36,840
that but and um

24
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:48,959
i guess i'll say this other thing which is that um you know we always we have a

25
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:55,280
we always have choice and whether that's conscious or unconscious choice habitual choice

26
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,480
there's always some choice happening

27
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:08,280
and with the teachings of the buddha and the science of neuroscience neuroplasticity

28
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:16,640
i think it's particularly useful to to use effort to cultivate mind states

29
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,159
that are beneficial to ourselves others and and both

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,280
and if we aren't kind of consciously tuning in to the kind of effort we're

31
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,480
making or what we're doing

32
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:41,280
the results of what we're doing are going to be determined by our past karmic efforts our past behaviors our

33
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:48,239
habits and patterns this will shape the mind this will shape

34
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,920
what happens in our next moment

35
00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:00,640
so i'm going to kind of go through a long list of things that i want to cover because i actually don't know how much

36
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:08,959
of this i will cover so i'm going to kind of give bullet points of all the different things that that i've been sort of reflecting on around this this

37
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,640
quality of our life our experience

38
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,359
so there's a beautiful

39
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:25,520
suta called it's about sona who's a monk who's practicing

40
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,840
and the buddha comes to talk to him when sona is about ready to give up his practice and return to lay

41
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,440
life and the buddha shows up and and

42
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:45,360
really essentially the teaching is and hopefully i'll come back to the suta is that our mind is like an instrument

43
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,560
and the way that we play it is like we play an instrument he was a

44
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:57,440
musician zona was and so when we play music

45
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:03,600
we can notice the tone right and we can notice how hard we're

46
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,600
strumming or the effort we're putting into playing so the buddha essentially is teaching

47
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:16,080
sona you can work with your mind the same way you play an instrument so we are our own

48
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:23,240
instruments our our mind our body our hearts are our own instruments

49
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,880
it's um you know everything we do requires some

50
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:38,720
amount of effort or energy regardless of our consciousness choice of these things

51
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:45,440
we can learn a lot from the effort we're making sort of a window into

52
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:52,479
you know it becomes what we're doing internally becomes visible in our experience and our actions the

53
00:05:52,479 --> 00:06:00,479
results of our actions and there's uh different types of

54
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:08,719
effort needed at different times in general there's effort that requires

55
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:15,039
activity in a way and there's effort that requires receptivity

56
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:21,919
opening up allowing receiving and it's uh a dynamic thing

57
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:28,639
what is needed um is always gonna change something that we need to tune into like

58
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,960
an instrument when we travel when we do various things set it down

59
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,080
temperature affect the tone and the quality of the music

60
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:52,000
another question for me around effort and noticing is where aren't we applying effort

61
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,960
where aren't we putting effort into our lives into our practice

62
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:08,720
and where aren't we noticing the effort i in high school

63
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:15,039
i volunteered in the [Music] in the classroom where people who were

64
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:23,440
neurodiverse or learning diverse and i was profoundly impacted by

65
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:29,520
one of the preparation exercises i did that was given to me by the teacher who runs that

66
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,960
classroom and what she said is to go home and sit

67
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,560
down and write out instructions for tying your shoe

68
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:50,800
i was shocked as i started to try and articulate step by step with words

69
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:58,599
what it took to tie a shoe try it

70
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,680
another important thing to

71
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,319
you know know in the buddha's teachings on wise effort the function of effort

72
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:22,638
is to increase the wholesome and decrease the unwholesome

73
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,879
the buddha teaches that there are four types of wise efforts so there's lots and lots of types of effort but the four

74
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:36,560
types of wise effort are efforts that

75
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,760
can be kind of summarized in this very simple way if it's not bad don't make it

76
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,120
worse if it's bad stop

77
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,640
so these are kind of moving toward acts of renunciation right letting go or

78
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,480
stopping and if it's if it's not good make it good wholesome

79
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:05,920
supportive and if it's already good sustain or maintain the goodness the wholesomeness

80
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:13,360
so those are the four types of wise effort and to know if we're um

81
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,360
you know what kind of efforts needed we really again need to bring our awareness back to what we're trying to do

82
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,120
and how its impact is and then

83
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,320
one of my final points not that it will be the last thing i talk about but

84
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,200
um effort is uh

85
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,639
i feel like it's very much impact but impacted by the stirring of the heart

86
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:49,200
resonance of the heart energy and there's this uh

87
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,640
when the heart lifts up when the heart is bright you know

88
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,320
inspired maybe you can just think about a moment of that and what happens

89
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:08,720
there's a natural just following of energy and has a certain vitality or quality to it

90
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:17,279
that can really support the um [Music] the capacity to receive

91
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,959
um to open up which is a form of efforting

92
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:28,160
right but to be receptive instead of active a lot of what we think about

93
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,079
i think in my mind anyway with when we connect with effort is

94
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:42,640
the energy we need to exert so a very simple analogy might be

95
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:48,000
a scooter i have a scooter and uh

96
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,720
when we start to ride the scooter we need to take the foot pump pump pump right

97
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,480
but then at some point it's very skillful to stop putting the foot down and just glide

98
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,519
right that's actually gills

99
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:11,040
similarly i have my own later but it's a it's a good one right

100
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,480
so let me talk a little bit about sona

101
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:22,880
the venerable sona was meditating in seclusion he was off you know in the woods and

102
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,959
doing walking after doing walking meditation um which he did until the skin of his

103
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:36,079
souls of his feet were split and bleeding and so after he's like ah this this

104
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:41,279
thought rose in his mind which is of the blessed ones disciples who have

105
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:46,399
aroused their persistence so effort here right i am one

106
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:53,279
but my mind is not released from the effluence through lack of clinging sustenance

107
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:59,040
so then he thinks so now my family has enough wealth it would be possible to enjoy that

108
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:08,399
wealth and make merit so what if i were to disavow training to return to the lower life enjoy wealth and make merit

109
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:15,440
and in the beautiful little story somehow the buddha hears he's nowhere near but somehow the buddha hears

110
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:21,519
and then magically appears right in front of the sauna right after he has this thought and then the buddha says

111
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:27,760
hmm did you just have this thought and he repeats the thought and sona says yes

112
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,959
lord so the buddha says

113
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:38,240
now what do you think sona before when you were a house dweller

114
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,839
were you skilled at playing the vini vinna yes lord

115
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:50,399
it's a string instrument and what do you think when the strings of your vinna were too taut

116
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:56,639
was your vinna in tune and playable no lord

117
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:04,639
and when you think what do you think when the strings of your vinna were too loose was your vinna in tune and playable

118
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,720
no lord and the buddha says and what do you think when the strings of your vinna

119
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:18,720
were neither too taut nor too loose but tuned established to be on the right pitch

120
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,760
was your vinna in tune implable yes lord

121
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,440
and so the buddha says in the same way sona over aroused persistence over over

122
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:37,120
efforting leads to restlessness over slack persistence leads to laziness

123
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,880
thus you should determine the right pitch for your persistence attune

124
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:50,240
you know and use your self as an instrument right

125
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,760
those those words were mine

126
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,040
so maybe just take a moment to think about um how this might

127
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:08,480
be relevant for you in your practice where might you notice that

128
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:15,120
it's almost like becoming brittle when we over effort when we're striving right there's too much

129
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,560
pushing there's a tightness contracting for me in the mind and body

130
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:28,480
and when there's not enough you know we might fall asleep or we drift we dream right we don't hold our

131
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,480
posture so just this is our instrument this is sort of the visible

132
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,399
results of our effort can be seen in just this simple way

133
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:48,160
so i mentioned you know how critical effort is in the buddhist teachings right

134
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,440
so i'll just read a couple of pseudo quotes this one's from the dhammapada actually just

135
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:59,040
to give you a sense of how much value the buddha placed on it

136
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:05,199
better than 100 years 100 years lived lazy and lacking in

137
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:12,600
vigor there's the effort and vigor is one day lived with vigor and exertion

138
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:22,480
and then the other this is from the vicidi maga when initiated properly it meaning

139
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,760
effort should be seen as the root of all

140
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:33,279
attainments the root of all attainments

141
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:44,079
so there's a list of the 37 factors of enlightenment and it's a comprised of a bunch of lists

142
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:50,800
including four foundations of mindfulness oh no that one's not listed four supreme efforts four means to

143
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,000
accomplishment four five strengths no blightful path seven factors of

144
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:05,040
enlightenment and there are five frequently found uh qualities in those lists

145
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:11,199
those five qualities are faith energy mindfulness

146
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:17,759
concentration and wisdom so of these qualities faith energy

147
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:23,279
mindfulness concentration and wisdom what do you think is the most common one

148
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:30,480
if just you know what would you think

149
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:37,279
well the one that's listed the most is energy effort nine times faith is listed twice mindfulness eight

150
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:44,920
times so right up there concentration four times wisdom five times

151
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:58,000
so i mentioned uh the value of learning from the effort that we make

152
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,240
the effort we make will have different results in our lives

153
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,319
let's see

154
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:25,280
one of the um the buddha's emphatic invitations was to come and see for

155
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:31,440
yourself don't just believe what i teach right try it for yourself

156
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:38,559
the dharma is is very incomplete if it's only

157
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:44,720
something we believe or think about the dharma is to be engaged with

158
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:52,320
to be practiced and we need to make an effort to do that

159
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:58,240
and if we aren't attuning to the quality of our effort

160
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:04,000
we might sit down close our eyes sit up straight

161
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,520
try and stop the thoughts get really serious about meditating

162
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:15,440
and have a horrible experience meditating and decide at the end

163
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,720
i suck i can't do this i tried really hard and i'm not going to do it again

164
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:28,880
forget it i can't do it this is a gross exaggeration for a purpose right just to to really

165
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,480
kind of step back and say when we have a practice session or our experience and

166
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,520
interaction in our lives something we're working on

167
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:45,679
when when it doesn't go well there's a lot to tune into not just

168
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:50,799
you know just really there's so much subtlety in this area there's so much

169
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:57,440
subtlety and there's that hurt quality i mentioned right what what where is the

170
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,640
heart in relationship to what we're doing based on what i was describing about you

171
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,320
know sitting down and making all this effort to meditate properly where was the heart in that

172
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,840
for me in the way i was describing it there wasn't really heart in that it was

173
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:20,320
more of a striving to do something perfect to become a meditator to be a good

174
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,000
meditator to have a certain kind of experience

175
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:31,520
a heart quality when we sit down to meditate would be much more like

176
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:37,520
you know well i care about what i see in my mind i care about

177
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,960
how i'm staying in my body and my heart

178
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,640
may i have a sense of kindness to myself and to what arises

179
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:55,760
you know these this is a kind of a setting the tone of a practice

180
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:09,600
so just in summary with that section of what i'm talking about right which is

181
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:15,039
we can learn from the effort we make by noticing the results of what we're doing

182
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:20,640
and not assuming that we can't change the results if we don't

183
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,799
change our approach change the quality of the heart what's guiding us and what kind of effort we're

184
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:32,559
putting in so

185
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:38,640
the next kind of point i wanted to make was different types of effort are needed at

186
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:44,640
different times obviously sometimes um

187
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,400
yeah no i definitely hear this from people they're trying to figure out what the

188
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,360
right amount of effort is to put into a practice

189
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,559
one of the things i love to teach is loving-kindness practice and

190
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:07,120
i remember this person was i was talking about the effort we bring right really paying attention to the effort we bring

191
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:12,320
to that practice and one of the yogis was really trying to

192
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,840
think about okay how do i find that perfect amount of effort

193
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:23,280
and feeling a little frustrated because he couldn't get the same results in his

194
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:30,640
practice every time and it's it's uh because you know like everything our

195
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,880
mind is never the same twice right what's happening in our life in our

196
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:44,159
hearts and our bodies changes all the time the presence our absence of pain

197
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,840
presence or absence of conflict presence or absence of a concentrated

198
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,880
mind or a distracted mind these things our minds are constantly

199
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,960
changing so the effort needed for a distracted

200
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:07,440
mind is going to be very different than the effort needed for a kind of a mind

201
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,080
that's grounded settled whole

202
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,720
so it's our habit because of how we are designed

203
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:27,280
genetically biologically speaking to kind of have these shortcuts for

204
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:35,360
everything we do like tying our shoes and if we aren't tuning in to

205
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:42,880
that we might end up bringing effort that is not wise effort to whatever

206
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:48,799
interaction meditation whatever it is we're doing

207
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:55,039
when i um i've been a swimmer on and off throughout my life you know

208
00:22:55,039 --> 00:23:01,760
various times i'm i have a membership to a pool and i swim a lot and then there's periods of time in my life where that

209
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:10,640
wasn't happening so much in the last in the most recent return to swimming

210
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:17,919
i was just so happy to be back in the pool and i am someone who i just i don't like

211
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:25,440
to swim inside i like to swim outside right and that's because of for me my mind is

212
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,360
very much impacted by the open sky the sense of openness and

213
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,640
of course when it's blessed enough to be sunny that feeling of the warmth

214
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,840
but also the smell in a enclosed pool the smell of the chlorine is quite

215
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:48,080
strong so there's all these things about swimming outside that i particularly love

216
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:56,080
and so when i first got back in the pool i was all about just enjoying being outside and

217
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:01,840
the sky and the sun and i was just very much like you know working on my form

218
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:09,039
just taking my time remembering the form getting the body back into kind of and look up

219
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:17,279
looking at youtube's about current swim techniques and but in this very you know just joyful relaxed way

220
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:24,399
and i started to call my swimming a source of sukkah joy right i would just have so much joy

221
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:31,679
and um you know i don't know for the first couple of years maybe um

222
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:39,120
i'd be swimming a lot in the summer and then when it would get cold in the winter i just would be like

223
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:45,200
my whole body would tense up and it was just like i can't i can't do it i couldn't deal with the

224
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:51,120
the vedana right the unpleasant bait and the coldness

225
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:59,039
and uh you know and then i'm sort of realizing over time oh

226
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:04,240
then i have to kind of start over again every spring or summer and you know sort of

227
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:10,159
and i'm missing out on the you know what i if i continued my practice of swimming

228
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:17,600
which i consider a mindfulness practice how that would be beneficial despite the cold so i started to turn in tune into what

229
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:24,159
effort i needed to make to to bring to my swimming to keep me going

230
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:30,320
and i remember one day i was it was really really raining it was

231
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:37,440
intensely raining and i'm walking out you know i just wear my suit from the locker room out i'm not covered

232
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:44,799
up i'm just going out and so i'm walking and i can feel my body wanting to duck

233
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:52,400
i don't know the best word for that but to try and avoid the drops of rain and it was so absurd to see it i just it

234
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:59,120
just was very freeing actually it was like okay look at this just turn toward the vedana the unpleasant stop reacting

235
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:06,080
stop trying to get away from it and and uh you know so that was an effort bringing some effort right

236
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:11,440
noticing my response right and so my effort maybe would have

237
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:18,640
been to just get out to the pool as fast as i can right that was sort of like putting a lot of energy noticing oh when

238
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:24,799
i'm doing that that just is kind of fueling the sense of reactivity or negativity right

239
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:32,000
is unpleasantness and so then the effort needed to shift to receiving to being okay to staying

240
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,039
with and not trying to get away from the coldness or the raindrops which is

241
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:43,520
impossible anyway and just then over time learning to swim

242
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:49,760
through the winter right swim through the winter another uh really significant thing i

243
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:55,440
noticed about making effort with swimming was

244
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:01,279
when i decided it was time to pick up my pace you know i needed to start to swim a

245
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:07,039
little bit faster i wanted to i was conditioned enough i was swimming you know no problem

246
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:13,919
distances and and amount of time no struggle at all so it was just time to kind of try and pick it up

247
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:19,440
and so um what i started to notice was that when i

248
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:25,760
get out of the pool after making this extra physical effort was i wasn't

249
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:31,279
feeling that sense of joy i wasn't feeling that sense of uplift

250
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:36,880
from my swimming so i started to watch what was happening in the mind as i was swimming and it was

251
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:43,679
like when i was pushing efforting to go faster

252
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:51,039
and you know this might be just fine because it might be the kind of effort i needed at that time right maybe to kind of

253
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:57,120
increase my conditioning but what i noticed was that it was almost like pulling a hood up and over

254
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:03,520
my body my head it was like my senses everything kind of

255
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,799
honed into this smaller point i stopped seeing the light in the water right

256
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:13,919
sort of having these blinders on and it was like just contract there was

257
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,960
this contracting and so then i started to

258
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,159
work on trying to have effort with the swimming while opening up while working

259
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:30,880
with the mind to be open and receptive and trying to find this balance right this right tune meant to the

260
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,880
how tight the streams were right

261
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:42,559
um when we're in on retreat um any of you go on

262
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:47,600
residential retreats yeah well one of the great things about going

263
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,640
on retreat is you know everything becomes sort of under a microscope right because you

264
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,679
start to get more and more kind of simplified and everything's more clear

265
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:03,520
and for me i could so much see the how much effort needed to change all the

266
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:10,240
time sometimes if i had a really concentrated sit

267
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:16,240
i needed to go out and do fast-paced walking right i needed to balance out what was

268
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:22,399
happening sometimes we need to walk slow sometimes we need to walk fast sometimes moderately

269
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:28,480
attuning to the body sometimes during the course of a retreat you'll see

270
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:34,559
it's better to sit longer sits and sometimes

271
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:40,000
we have to consider what's happening in our bodies and maybe we don't go to the hall for the sits because we need to sit

272
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,278
less time right so

273
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:52,960
other things that sort of really helped you know that were examples of taking effort

274
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:59,120
would be to reflect on the buddha the dharma and the sangha the three jewels right could would be a way of

275
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:04,480
sort of brightening the heart and that would affect the energy i brought to my practice

276
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,799
or one of my favorite things is to go out and look up look up at the sky

277
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:16,799
it's like something about it from my mind is just like oh yeah i remember how to be open

278
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:24,240
i remember that taking in the light and that sense of broadness

279
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:35,360
sometimes i think about effort as having [Music] the quality of a temperature or

280
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:40,559
consistency to it right like and i'm i'm offering this

281
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:46,399
because we all all of our minds and hearts are tuned differently we might notice different

282
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:52,480
things i was just going to offer a couple other thoughts about how to be paying attention to your own

283
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:59,679
you know the results of your own effort so there's effort that can feel cold and hard and brittle right thus often

284
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:07,279
thought of as striving and there's effort that can feel like it's hot and saggy right

285
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:14,080
and then there's the not too hot not too cold right middle way

286
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:21,440
sometimes i think about um i can feel in my body and i have this image of an ostrich

287
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:27,840
and it's like is my effort right now like an ostrich with its head in the sand like i'm not really looking i'm not

288
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:33,519
really doing anything i'm just kind of shutting down or is it like an ostrich

289
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:38,880
running right and you know when i think about an ostrich running it's like they're

290
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:45,760
running that way and thinking about what they're running away from or something you know it's just not this taking in

291
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,398
and then there's like being more upright right

292
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:59,200
the here's another dharma quote the diamond is for those who are

293
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:07,519
industrious not those who are lazy that's from the anguttara

294
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:14,880
so i'm i guess i'm inviting by sharing all of this this is kind of industrious creative ways of thinking about and

295
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,159
seeing effort and i think we do need to be really

296
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:27,200
receptive and sensitive and tuned in and creative and how we work with our own

297
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:32,240
effort and bring the heart and the wisdom to it

298
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:47,120
so um where aren't we putting in effort or

299
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:53,279
where aren't we paying attention to our effort and our lives

300
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:58,320
this is a question for me too you know

301
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:04,559
the practice can be everywhere in our lives right not just on the cushion

302
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:12,000
and you know one thing is um

303
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:21,440
there there is effort needed to even orient toward the wholesome because our

304
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,640
the negativity bias in the mind right rick hatson calls it the negative sticks

305
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:32,960
like velcro and the positive stip is like an egg in a teflon pan

306
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,080
and this is sort of the hard wiring or the soft wiring of the brain is to

307
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:45,919
orient us toward that which is more of a threat than that which is a gift

308
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:54,240
and but we can counterbalance that tendency by consciously resting our awareness and

309
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:00,559
being receptive to the good by savoring or appreciating being grateful

310
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:04,440
this is an effort too

311
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:14,320
another area um that i think there might be a

312
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:21,440
certain amounts of places where there's maybe a not noticing a sense of

313
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:27,200
you know delusion maybe even or taking kind of things for granted in our lives

314
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:33,358
there's often in those areas pockets of not bringing appropriate effort to things

315
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:39,839
and i think some of that is around identity like who we think we are

316
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:46,720
right we sort of just kind of can get going in a groove

317
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:51,839
and um just sort of assume we're a certain way

318
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:58,640
right and and if you think about that what i was talking about we're constantly changing our minds are changing our hearts are changing but if

319
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:03,760
we think oh i'm a patient person right because we have this idea about

320
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:09,359
ourselves we're not maybe going to notice when we're being impatient so much

321
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:14,480
right at least not in the beginning there's also things like um

322
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:19,839
that we can bring more awareness and more effort in our lives that can make a big difference

323
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:26,720
and those might be things like where do we have areas of assumptions in general about others

324
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:32,560
where where do we make effort some people are really good at learning people's names and some people aren't

325
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:38,000
and some of that might be just the way our minds are but some of it is how much effort are we bringing to learning

326
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,040
people's names or how they pronounce their names is that important to us

327
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,359
does our heart see the value of that

328
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:03,520
so here's a little quote from wynton higgins

329
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:09,680
we can live ethically without caring about ourselves or we can't i'm sorry we

330
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:15,040
can't live ethically without caring about ourselves as well

331
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:23,599
as others and we can't be mindful without caring about what is happening here and now

332
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:31,200
care underpins the radical attention the dharma practice accentuates

333
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,520
so to tie that piece together with caring

334
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:44,800
can help us bring more awareness and effort to the areas where we maybe aren't tuning in

335
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,480
and could tune in more

336
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:57,119
so i'm going to try and just say a few more things and wrap up and allow time for

337
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:02,720
reflections or questions just a reminder the function of effort

338
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:08,440
is to arouse and maintain wholesome states

339
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:20,160
so let's see and actually in the um

340
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:28,160
you know description of the of effort in the vici maga

341
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:33,280
it says vigor is the state of

342
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:39,200
virya energy its characteristic is exertion

343
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:45,040
its function is to support or consolidate related mental qualities

344
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:50,119
its manifest as non-collapse

345
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:56,000
and stirred one strives wisely so stirring of the

346
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,599
heart right it's that stirring of the heart that helps bring wisdom

347
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,000
to our efforts

348
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:19,440
so it's uh again i just think it's super poignant space for practice

349
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:26,480
i think it's so much immediate feedback right right here and now if we notice

350
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:32,880
sort of and play with the kind of effort and the kind of heart quality you know

351
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:38,480
we bring it's it's very tied to you know wise

352
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:44,560
intention and wise view right all of these path factors are it's

353
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:50,800
and last night of course i was thinking about this talk and i had this dream and i had my dream i had this image of

354
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,400
um granite and how all the different minerals and

355
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,760
colors weave together and you know i think this is the dharma

356
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,800
right any any place you enter you can pretty much find everything else in the

357
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:14,000
dharma so for me i'm just sort of offering effort as one of those ways in ways

358
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:22,240
through in the window of kind of learning and seeing in our practice getting more intimate with this

359
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:30,079
so the for right efforts

360
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:37,440
if it's not yet arisen if it's not making it worse don't make

361
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:44,560
it worse if things whatever's happening is making

362
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,400
it worse stop

363
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,200
if what we're doing isn't making it better start

364
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:00,319
if what we're doing is making it better keep it up

365
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,400
abandoning what is unskillful is letting go developing what is skillful is

366
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,520
cultivation so this important balance even here

367
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:16,000
between the cultivation and the letting go

368
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:22,480
so we need to sort of be ardently tuned in to the results because

369
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,440
life is dynamic it's always changing

370
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:37,599
i've seen with people that um maybe even myself but

371
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:43,520
i'm a therapist so i do a lot of work with others and i've seen where they're trying to

372
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:50,000
abandon something that's unskillful something that's making something worse they're trying to stop it

373
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,599
and what actually happens is the reverse things get worse

374
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:01,599
anybody ever experience that no well

375
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:06,800
sometimes if we're having a thought maybe i'll make it a little more sort of specific

376
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,079
if we're having a thought we don't want to have because it's hurtful or

377
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:17,200
we think it's harmful what happens when you try and stop that

378
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:23,359
thought has anybody ever noticed that it gets a little louder or sticks around a little

379
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:28,800
longer yeah so

380
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:33,920
sometimes instead of trying to make something stop

381
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:39,520
actually what we need to do is not be trying to make anything happen to it

382
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:45,040
to let it be and maybe turn our heart

383
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:50,480
our energy towards something that feels supportive like being kind to ourselves with this thought

384
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:56,640
yeah and sometimes when we're trying to cultivate a sense of

385
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:02,240
wholesomeness in ourselves so this was an example of trying to get rid of something that's you know not not

386
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:08,560
wholesome not helpful and we get the opposite and sometimes when we're trying to cultivate something

387
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:14,400
that feels wholesome like loving kindness we actually start to find our mind

388
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:21,119
becoming more prickly more irritated more critical

389
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:29,680
so even though we're doing loving-kindness practice and that's supposed to make us happy and warm and kind

390
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:35,760
we need to maybe stop doing the loving kindness practice right

391
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:41,280
and just sort of recognize that that in itself at this moment

392
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,000
is resulting in unwholesome states

393
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:52,560
so in a way we feel like i just i just really want one other thing i guess

394
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:58,640
sometimes we're doing all four at the same time essentially they don't they're not always so

395
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,920
independent from each other

396
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,480
okay all right so i think i did it i got

397
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:16,160
through all the points so i'll just kind of go through them very you know to summarize

398
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:21,200
we're our own instrument the sona suta

399
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:26,960
effort is extremely important in the role of awakening and freedom

400
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:32,319
everything we do requires effort or energy to some extent or not whether it's

401
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:39,119
exertion or receptivity we can learn so much by watching

402
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:44,319
the effort we're making and then the results of that effort

403
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:50,480
it's always going to change staying attuned so reflecting before

404
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:57,680
during and after is always important where aren't we applying effort or where

405
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:02,480
aren't we noticing the effort we're putting into things

406
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:11,040
the function of effort and wise effort is to increase the wholesome and decrease the unwholesome

407
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:17,680
the heart the stirring of the heart is extremely supportive

408
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,720
for the the effort we make finding some quality

409
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:29,200
that is has some warmth or tenderness to it to varying degrees

410
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:35,200
right can help us you know str you know play our own selves

411
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,880
with care

412
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:47,880
all right i think that's it thank you for your kind attention
