1
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,080
so good morning everyone and welcome to this

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:21,600
monday as we begin our week on the theme of mindfulness of emotions

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,320
and it's one of the very important areas of mind of

4
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,880
mindfulness to beware to be mindful of our own emotions and to be mindful aware of the emotions

5
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,160
of others as well and to

6
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,160
learn the art the skill of recognizing emotions

7
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,960
knowing how to be mindful of emotions and learning how to discover what liberation

8
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:01,440
is in relationship to emotions so for now i'd like to say that i

9
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:08,240
i think of emotions as as a belonging to a place in human beings

10
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:14,400
that can be quite tender and that uh the

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,880
careful attention careful caring attention taking time to slow down and

12
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,200
be with these things that are to say the moods the emotions the

13
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,280
mental states that kind of kind of have a huge influence on our lives

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,799
that we slow down and really start recognizing more deeply what's going on with them and

15
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:46,320
where they arise from from under the surface and and where they um

16
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,479
it's a tender place and so as we begin this week on emotions

17
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,880
remember that and remember to hold yourself with care with compassion

18
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:07,280
and and generosity lots of generosity to how you feel

19
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,280
and slowly through this practice of mindfulness of emotions we are

20
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,640
increasing our capacity to be with emotions the whole range of

21
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,720
them difficult ones and beautiful ones and and also

22
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:31,120
increasing our capacity to be with them in a way that's free

23
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,040
a kind of freedom that allows the best of the emotions to thrive inside of us

24
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,879
and allows that which is difficult and maybe debilitating around emotions to

25
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:50,760
relax to settle away to no longer be limiting us in our lives

26
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,239
so today's topic is uh relaxation

27
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:02,400
and what we learn about relaxation of the body

28
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:09,440
has a lot to do with our ability to relax with emotions around emotions

29
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,879
and it isn't so much today that i'm going to emphasize relaxing emotions like maybe to make

30
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:22,959
them relax away but rather to relax around them to soften the boundaries of them and

31
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:29,440
any reactivity or holding or preferences we have in relationship to

32
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:39,040
them so so entering into your meditation posture

33
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,959
and maybe spending a little time swaying rocking around

34
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:53,280
and so you can kind of slowly come into a still place that feels balanced

35
00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:01,799
aligned and to lower your gaze

36
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:11,040
and have a loose focus in your gaze you're not really looking at anything in particular

37
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,880
letting the eyes relax and then if it's comfortable for you to

38
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,919
gently close your eyes

39
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:37,040
and is as if you're caring for something tender within

40
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:43,280
taking a few long slow deep breaths three quarters full hour full is

41
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:52,400
comfortable for you and an extended x cell

42
00:04:53,919 --> 00:05:04,039
and in that exhale to allow your body to relax and settle in

43
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:35,919
and then letting your breathing return to normal and continuing on the exhale to relax

44
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:43,680
your body part of the value of relaxing is that

45
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:51,960
there's greater bodily sensitivity to feel when we are relaxed

46
00:05:52,160 --> 00:06:00,120
on the exhale to soften and relax the muscles of the face

47
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,039
around the eyes cheeks

48
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,120
then if you feel any activated energy or

49
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,160
in the face tightening in the face

50
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:43,759
as you exhale maybe you can allow it to get cooler

51
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,080
the coolness across your face

52
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,000
on the exhale relaxing the shoulders

53
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:24,120
relaxing the belly softening the belly

54
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,919
and if there's any way that the thighs are tight or gripping

55
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,520
maybe you can also relax the thighs

56
00:07:53,599 --> 00:08:00,000
and then becoming aware of how you feel

57
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,240
what's the emotional state that's most present or mood

58
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,080
state of mind that's present for you

59
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,520
and it could just be that you're sleepy calm

60
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,960
it might be

61
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:38,599
see if you can feel how it manifests in the body

62
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:47,519
the feeling of your emotional state or your mood

63
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,880
is it kind of mostly felt or ex

64
00:08:52,880 --> 00:09:00,399
in the head the face the chest the arms

65
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:06,680
the belly all of the above

66
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,959
is there a location that seems to be the center of how you

67
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,959
feel

68
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,480
and then as you exhale to relax the physical place where you

69
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:39,560
feel your mood your emotions allow the physical softening

70
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:59,720
or in other ways relax around how you feel

71
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,600
if the mind is preoccupied in some way or caught in

72
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:19,839
on the exhale softening the mind relaxing the thinking muscle

73
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:42,000
and then coming back to your breathing and just settle into the rhythm of your

74
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
breathing

75
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,600
if there's ways in which your mood or emotional state can be gathered in to support you

76
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,040
to stay with the breathing

77
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:05,519
make use of that support or you can just let your mood emotional

78
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:14,839
state receive to the background as you stay with the rhythm of breathing

79
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:28,519
but if what seems most predominant is your mood your emotional state

80
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,440
see if you can find where it's most expressed in your body

81
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:45,040
and relax there relax around it

82
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,959
relax the physicality of it

83
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,160
and then begin again with your breathing

84
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,120
is there any attention associated with how you feel

85
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,959
if so can you relax it

86
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:17,880
if what you feel is pretty nice and relaxed itself

87
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:25,279
can you relax other parts of your body around it

88
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:33,840
to allow the good mood or state to spread through your body

89
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,679
recognizing whatever mood or emotional state you have

90
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,559
and relaxing with it relaxing around it

91
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,880
relaxing through it softening

92
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:40,280
the edges and breathing with it

93
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:28,880
wherever your emotional state mood state of mind is located in your body

94
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:34,640
as you exhale soften relax

95
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:44,399
or if you have some place in your body like you're around your heart

96
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,679
that is your emotional center

97
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,840
soften relax

98
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,159
and as we come to the end of this sitting

99
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:30,960
maybe for the next two or three breaths relax again

100
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,880
on the exhale and on the inhale

101
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:42,320
open your mind's gaze out into the world

102
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:49,640
your world of people you'll encounter and engage in communicate with

103
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:10,720
and how is it that relaxing in your body relaxing around your

104
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:17,039
emotional states how is it that that helps you be more

105
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:22,720
prepared for meeting other people

106
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,480
relating to to other people

107
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:55,360
in whatever ways we benefit from doing this meditation practice

108
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:05,039
to trust that that we do it not only for ourselves but for others as well

109
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:09,360
that these benefits the ways we benefit

110
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:16,559
allow us to be in a better place to care with

111
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,840
to connect with others

112
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:31,360
and may we think about and consider how with the foundation of meditation

113
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:37,600
that we can now engage in the world in a more useful way

114
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:45,440
perhaps in a more generous way or empathic way

115
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:53,559
may whatever ability you have to relax with your emotions

116
00:29:54,080 --> 00:30:00,880
it awaken a care and sympathy for others

117
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:08,399
so we have space and time to consider

118
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:14,960
how to speak how to act and even how to think

119
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:20,240
in ways that is for the welfare and happiness of others

120
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,880
may all beings be happy

121
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:31,200
may all beings be safe

122
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,559
may all beings be peaceful

123
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,559
and may all beings be free

124
00:30:55,180 --> 00:31:03,269
[Music]

125
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:04,960
so i begin these five-part series on mindfulness of emotions

126
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:12,399
and the structure of these five talks will be the first one will be about relaxation

127
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:18,799
the second about recognition the third about respect

128
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:25,600
the fourth about restoration and the fifth about release

129
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:32,320
and um all these ways are ways of aspects of

130
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:38,159
mindfulness that uh ways to practice mindfulness ways of

131
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,760
mind ways that mindfulness practices us just to be this careful attention to

132
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:50,880
what's happening tends to evoke or bring about these kinds of

133
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,799
relationships to our emotional life and

134
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:03,360
as for today it's to relax so one of the remarkable things about

135
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:09,760
mindfulness meditation is that you're allowed to have your emotions

136
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:16,240
in many places in public life at work or other places sometimes if we have very strong

137
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,360
emotions and feelings it maybe isn't so appropriate to show them

138
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,880
if we get angry at someone at work at our boss for example maybe we want to be a little careful how

139
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:33,039
we express it or some i mean i remember when i was a

140
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:38,960
relatively new parent there were some times where i felt angry what was going on with the children

141
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:45,600
but i could see that it was mostly my own inner struggles not really about them

142
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:51,760
and so i found it best not to express the anger and you know sometimes i even left the room

143
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:58,159
and came back a few minutes later when i'd cooled down so there's many places you know in some

144
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:04,880
some families some cultures the idea of expressing emotions is not

145
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,079
really so welcome and it might feel that you know that you have to kind of keep

146
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:16,000
it in check it's something internal that we process but not something we're allowed to

147
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:23,520
talk about even in mindfulness meditation you are allowed to have any emotional state that

148
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:29,839
you have you're allowed to feel whatever feelings that are there

149
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:35,040
and partly especially when we're doing mindfulness in meditation

150
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:43,919
meditation is a wonderful laboratory for investigating getting to know and understanding our inner emotional life

151
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:50,320
and that laboratory works best if we allow ourselves to feel whatever

152
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,599
emotions are present as if meditation is like this special time

153
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:00,880
where you're allowed to feel anything at all you can have murderous rage

154
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:06,720
and as long as you stay in your meditation that you don't move and you know go out to

155
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:12,079
hit anyone just don't move don't speak

156
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:17,359
then to discover what it's like to let the anger course through you and relax

157
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:24,480
with it relax around it i'm very fond of the idea that the word

158
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:30,400
emotion comes kind of from a latin root and the motion means movement and the e

159
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:36,560
means out moving out and all emotions are processes

160
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:44,000
they are not things they are things that are in process they're ways in which we process our lives the ways in which we respond to

161
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:51,040
life the ways in which we understand what's happening in life the ways which we express ourselves

162
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:56,320
they're very important part of our life some of them are

163
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:03,119
afflictive some of them are suffering producing and some of them are not some of them

164
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:08,960
are actually part of the the wonderfulness of the lies the joy the happiness the well-being

165
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,800
uh the beautiful feelings that can arise are the non-afflictive ones sometimes

166
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:22,079
called beautiful emotional states and there's a very interesting phenomena

167
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:28,400
that the afflictive emotional states come with tension

168
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:34,720
come with stress come with some kind of contraction or tightness some kind of

169
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:41,839
directedness that we kind of lose a certain kind of freedom and peacefulness

170
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:48,160
sometimes the directedness and the power of inflictive emotions can be seductive

171
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:54,880
uh the the power that can feel it comes with anger for example or the or the um

172
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:00,079
the allure and the promise of uh lust

173
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:07,839
can be quite you know quite compelling but if you're mindful deeply mindful

174
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:12,880
this is why meditation is such a good place for this you can feel how it's also

175
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:20,800
afflictive how it's also stressful to have it and so the idea of relaxing around the

176
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:27,599
afflictive emotions begins to settle some of that stress some of that tension

177
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:33,200
and uh the other hand the non-afflictive emotions

178
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:39,760
in in their essence or in their kind of in their simplest form

179
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:46,640
before we react to them or or have agendas of what to do with them just in love themselves

180
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,839
tend to be nourishing uh tend to be

181
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:59,680
um comforting tend to be warm tend to be comfortable

182
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,720
tend to have a nice feeling to it and there if we relax

183
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:11,280
this simple aspect of this non-afflictive emotions there tends to be more space for them to grow into

184
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:18,079
they tend to be able to be more open and and more settled in a nice way

185
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:23,839
except if the positive emotions the beautiful emotional states

186
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:28,320
if we're attached to them if we're clinging to them

187
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:35,359
then then they don't necessarily grow when we relax

188
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:43,200
they um because what we might be relaxing is the extra fuel we're giving them by our

189
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:48,400
agendas our attachments our desires are what we're you know trying to feed it

190
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,599
and pump it up and so as we meditate that pumping them

191
00:38:53,599 --> 00:39:00,720
up might relax and so you person might feel like now they're much less emotional

192
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:08,079
and in fact they might be less emotional in an expressive way but hopefully as we settle and allow for

193
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:13,359
the emotions to be there in their simplicity we actually feel them more fully they

194
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:20,000
become more exquisite they become more embodied more

195
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,160
opening to a deeper sensitivity to what's happening that can't be there if we're spending a

196
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:34,320
lot of time celebrating your joy or or indulging in emotional pleasures

197
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:39,599
the idea in meditation is to neither indulge

198
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:44,880
nor push away neither celebrate

199
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:51,520
nor condemn neither before emotions or against them

200
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:58,800
and so when we relax around emotions one of the things we're relaxing is this ways in which we get caught in them

201
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:05,040
indulging getting involved jumping on board justifying them

202
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:12,079
holding on or resisting and pushing away or condemning or being angry or feeling shame or

203
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:18,400
embarrassment for it there's all these kind of secondary reactivities we have

204
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,680
it's those secondary reactions that we learn to relax

205
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,960
and one of the ways to relax is to uh if we can feel

206
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:35,040
the emotional the physical expression of our emotions

207
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:41,839
uh it's sometimes been said that all emotions have a physical expression physical

208
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:47,359
corollary that's part of it and that without having some physical

209
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:54,000
basis for feeling or emotions we might not know what the emotion actually is

210
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:01,200
so whether that's always true or not i can't tell you but certainly i found that that's you know predominantly true

211
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:07,680
regularly very true and i make it a regular practice when i feel some emotions or especially in

212
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:14,640
meditation to find the location where it is in the body so i might feel fear in my belly at

213
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:21,040
tightening or butterflies there i might feel some kind of aversion a little bit and

214
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:26,319
tightening in the face and upwelding kind of tightening in the

215
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:32,319
back of my neck i might feel a love as a kind of warmth

216
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:38,960
and warmth in my heart area or a softness in my in my cheeks that might come along

217
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,000
in easing up of the tension in my eyes so it's all kinds of all kinds of little

218
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:51,920
subtle changes that happen in the body and part of that maybe is because emotions are meant to help us engage and

219
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,960
be actively involved in life so they're kind of in some ways

220
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:02,960
adjusting the body for some new way of being and so but

221
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:08,720
that new way of being might not be healthy for us it might be misplaced

222
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:14,720
it might be the wrong you know it might not be a healthy way of relating to what's happening

223
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:20,800
so finding out where the emotion is in the body and uh and then you know breathe with

224
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:26,880
that area feel it and sense it and see if there's any tension or any tightening

225
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:32,560
in that place that can relax if it's easy to relax it relax the

226
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:39,280
tension soften it if it's not easy to do the tension itself maybe it's possible to

227
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:45,839
relax around it to soften around it sometimes the resistance we have to fear

228
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:50,880
might be uh that where we can relax we can't necessarily relax the fear

229
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,480
or something like whatever it might be and or maybe it's just kind of a

230
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:02,000
softness around it a softness of that comes maybe in allowing ourselves to

231
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:08,000
feel what we're feeling and okay okay i'm just here with this is what's happening now i'm here with it

232
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:14,079
now i'm meditating i'm not going to cause any problems in the world without feeling so

233
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:19,760
this is the time to just allow for it and be mindful of it

234
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:26,560
and sometimes it's not not possible to relax the tension or tightening around emotions

235
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:32,480
but if we simply breathe with it and allow it to be there accompany it with our breathing

236
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:37,520
it kind of removes some it has attention removing some maybe

237
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:43,280
even subconscious way in which we're reacting to the emotions presence

238
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:49,760
and just shifting our focus to breathing rather than feeling but breathing through it so we're not

239
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:55,599
ignoring it can sometimes allow something to settle and relax

240
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:00,720
and if it's afflictive emotions they might dissipate

241
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:06,480
if it's something beautiful a beautiful emotion and there's no extra

242
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,520
attachment we overlay on top of it then you might find something delicious

243
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:16,560
happens with those they might grow and swell and expand through the body in

244
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:24,079
some nice way or they might might transform into something that's a different emotion or mind state mood

245
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:30,160
that has maybe a little different or kind of a wonderful different expression that's not what you

246
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:36,680
were feeling first but now it's something something very different that's beautiful

247
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:43,359
so the theme for here today is relaxing with your emotions relaxing through your emotions

248
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:50,240
around your emotions and the more you can do so physically if you have a physical location for it i

249
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:55,760
think the more effective this this can be but i would encourage you through today

250
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:01,119
next 24 hours to when you have a strong enough emotion

251
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:06,640
that you feel it um practice relaxation and see what happens

252
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:11,920
in the wake of that relaxation and if you have the opportunity to meditate or just

253
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:17,119
stand still close your eyes sit down close your eyes and do this relaxation

254
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:22,960
in a kind of this kind of attentive way meditative way all the better

255
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:30,240
and and developing the skill of this kind of relaxation will help a lot with the

256
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:37,839
further deepening our relationship to emotions that we'll talk about these next days

257
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:46,760
so thank you may you enjoy your emotional life
