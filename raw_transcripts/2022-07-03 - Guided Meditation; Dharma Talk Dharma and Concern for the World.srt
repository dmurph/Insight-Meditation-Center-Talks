21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,040
okay thanks good yeah all right um

22
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,879
so uh yeah we'll sit i'll uh sort of lightly lightly guide us till the top of

23
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:25,879
the hour and uh then offer offer a talk

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
uh

25
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,440
so

26
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,159
so

27
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,639
like a nectar falling to the bottom of a glass of juice

28
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,960
we settle says take that on

29
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,880
and sometimes it's skillful to

30
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:11,759
stop right on a dime to begin implementing a very concrete

31
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,320
technique

32
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:25,840
to specify precisely where the attention is directed

33
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,319
and other times

34
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,840
a certain kind of openness just to see

35
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,400
how the nectar needs to settle

36
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:59,039
to see what needs attention what needs patience what needs love

37
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,400
and to breathe and arrive

38
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,199
so

39
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,360
so

40
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,479
so

41
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,000
just let everything remind you of the dharma

42
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,720
so

43
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,880
just forgive all phenomena

44
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,160
and rest

45
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
so

46
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:57,440
just forgiving thought and sensation and affect and sound

47
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,720
unentangled

48
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,480
so

49
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,920
so

50
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,760
so

51
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,800
so

52
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,720
so

53
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,160
so

54
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,280
so

55
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,360
so

56
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:33,559
marshalling the attention the spotlight of attention

57
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:40,880
takes a little bit of energy nothing wrong with

58
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:48,600
expending energy effort on this path

59
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:59,080
but then sometimes useful

60
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:11,240
to see what is effortless about awareness

61
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,919
dimension of awareness that you [Music]

62
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,600
can't stop don't need to direct

63
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,120
requires no effort to prop up

64
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,559
and we just rest there

65
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,520
so

66
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,480
so

67
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,360
so

68
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,039
so

69
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,360
so

70
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,320
so

71
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,840
so

72
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,120
so

73
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,320
so

74
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,279
so

75
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
this

76
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,679
so

77
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:45,399
so

78
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:59,559
so

79
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,200
so

80
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,120
so

81
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,320
so

82
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,119
so

83
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,960
so

84
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,560
so

85
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,720
so

86
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,320
so

87
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,320
so

88
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,040
so

89
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,079
so

90
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:47,040
so though the way i've uh approached dharma practice is less less

91
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:56,599
of the dharma as a set of answers and more as a kind of open question a method of inquiry

92
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:01,359
and talk is in that spirit

93
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:08,400
so many people these days seem kind of

94
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:14,480
ragged and

95
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:20,240
and people who care about other people seem especially

96
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,680
ragged weary

97
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:32,280
and the pace of the news seems uh

98
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:40,078
unrelenting unsustainable you know for a lot of people emotionally

99
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:47,040
and there's a sense and we're always warned against this sense when we have it in a moment of

100
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:53,359
meditation but there's a sense maybe deluded like it's hard to imagine

101
00:40:53,359 --> 00:41:00,560
it getting better kind of you know there's some sense of like all these different karmic streams

102
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:10,160
converging in ways that make it hard to imagine feeling a lot lighter at least

103
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:16,480
and i was thinking just like there's a kind

104
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:22,079
of consumer confidence index you know of

105
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:28,319
like sort of economic expectations and attitudes among the public and what do

106
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:36,240
you think about interest rates or something what do you you know what are your buying intentions

107
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:42,480
um it's also kind of like a

108
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:48,480
humanity confidence index and um

109
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:56,240
our humanity confidence index right now is like kind of shaky

110
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:04,079
and there's a sense that we

111
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:09,200
maybe can't keep going the way we've been going

112
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:18,480
and uh we've been mining the world

113
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:24,400
the earth and now mining ourselves so this is a

114
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:31,280
kind of a notable quote from uh justin rosenstein tech

115
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:37,440
kind of founder who's concerned about

116
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:44,480
about these things he said we live in a world

117
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,839
in which a tree is worth more financially dead than alive

118
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:55,359
in a world in which a whale is worth more dead than alive

119
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:02,400
for so long as our our economy works in that way and

120
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:07,680
corporations aren't regulated they're going to continue to destroy trees to

121
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:13,200
kill wells to mine the earth and to continue to pull oil out of the ground

122
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:21,440
even though we know it's destroying the planet and we know it's going to leave a worse world for future generations

123
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:27,440
this is short-term thinking based on the religion of profit and all costs as if

124
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:32,640
somehow magically each corporation acting in its selfish

125
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:38,079
interest is going to produce the best result this has been affecting the environment

126
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:43,839
for a long time what's frightening and what hopefully is the last straw

127
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:50,720
that will wake us up as a civilization to how flawed this theory has been in the first place

128
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:57,200
is to see that now we're the tree we're the whale

129
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:03,280
our attention can be mined we are more profitable

130
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:10,640
to a corporation if we're spending time staring at a screen staring at an ad than if we're spending time living our

131
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:16,960
life in a rich way and so we're seeing the results of that we're seeing

132
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:22,319
corporations using powerful artificial intelligence to outsmart us and figure

133
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:27,599
out how to pull our attention towards the things they want us to look at

134
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:35,880
rather than the things that are most consistent with our goals and our values and our lives

135
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:51,680
at some point in in life we realized that the the kind of time

136
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:56,078
left we have the time left is

137
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:02,560
is less than what we've already lived and

138
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:08,640
can feel the same for societies you know like

139
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:14,160
have we hit a kind of apex point and feel like we're

140
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:21,040
in descent is this particular

141
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:27,920
generation the unique extraordinary fortunate and unfortunate inflection

142
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:34,319
point or is that just

143
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:39,680
the vanity and grandiosity of our generation

144
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:48,079
because um just like every person thinks they're special every generation

145
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:54,880
thinks it's special so maybe we're just being seduced into a certain

146
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:01,720
kind of grandiosity of this as a kind of inflection point

147
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:10,079
but it for people who care about people

148
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:17,119
it's intense and uh

149
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:25,920
of course i'm thinking about row and i'm thinking just more generally about the ascendancy of and the the way that greed

150
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:31,520
aversion delusion are dignified culture wide

151
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:43,480
there is a moment this is september 2020 and um

152
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:50,400
george george floyd was was killed may

153
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:56,480
25th and um a very dangerous

154
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:02,960
as is still an unstable political situation

155
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:09,440
and there were fires there was a fire big fire down outside fresno somewhere

156
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:15,440
and then up north and the air on the ground was okay

157
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:20,559
the air on the ground was good actually but whatever the atmospheric conditions

158
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:28,319
maybe you remember this day the atmospheric conditions were such that the the smoke was held

159
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:33,680
you know real high and had this like wild distorting effect on the light and

160
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:39,839
it was like dark in the middle of the day an orange

161
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:46,640
and that day i was at a buddhist teacher meeting on zoom as we all were

162
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:52,480
on zoom then i was at a buddhist teacher meeting

163
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:57,920
and it was grim yeah

164
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:04,880
very painful day and and there's a certain kind of collapse

165
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:10,160
that happens in the mind when

166
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:16,800
like the badness the different kind of points of pain in the body politic and

167
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:21,839
the world do not add up together they they're sort

168
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:27,520
of synergistic they mul it's not badness plus badness but blindness it's like

169
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:35,359
madness multiplied by badness multiplied again

170
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:41,280
and it's a distinctive phenomenology you know like that sense of the collapse of

171
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:48,160
the mind this kind of inward heart collapse and um

172
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:54,400
and there's no no space yeah zen master said hell

173
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,520
is no space

174
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:05,599
and two days after that i gave a meeting and then i gave a

175
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:10,960
a talk on the 19th anniversary of september

176
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:17,359
11th and normally that group is about

177
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:22,480
i don't know 125 people and it was double that that

178
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:29,520
day yeah and um and i talked about love

179
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:35,680
you know just holding on

180
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:42,000
i thought of the the tom waits song hold on

181
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:54,240
lyrics um down by the riverside motel it's 10 below and falling

182
00:49:54,240 --> 00:50:00,079
by a 99 cent store she closed her eyes and started swaying

183
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:06,720
but it's so hard to dance that way when it's cold and there's no music

184
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:12,480
oh your hometown's so far away but inside your head there's a record that's

185
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:17,760
playing a song called hold on

186
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:26,480
hold on babe you gotta hold on take my hand i'm standing right here

187
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,599
you gotta hold on

188
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:44,079
one of the things that happens in moments like like that is a kind of collapse into a certain kind of nihilism

189
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:49,039
or desperation frenzy

190
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,880
and the buddha warned against nihilism felt like it was

191
00:50:54,880 --> 00:51:00,079
though that was a consequence there was a potential risk

192
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:05,359
of opening to the contingency of all things

193
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:13,040
and maybe we intuitively know that it's not satisfying for our heart yeah it's

194
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:18,800
like once we've we've seen the kind of

195
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:25,359
poignancy of the human condition it's very it's hard to just

196
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:31,520
devolve into nihilism so then we want to act we move into the

197
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:37,040
more frenzy desperate mode but are almost immediately confronted with our

198
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:42,160
own nearly complete helplessness

199
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:54,000
maybe maybe suffering dukkha and helplessness are

200
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,760
kind of synonyms almost

201
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:07,680
i read that um you know people cry for many reasons but one of the reasons we

202
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:12,720
cry is is from a sense of helplessness

203
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:19,760
and there are tears being a kind of plea

204
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:28,880
a social plea saying something like i i need you

205
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:39,599
but now we cry for others and often feels like

206
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:45,520
no one's coming and all of this all of this this

207
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:50,880
portrait i'm painting can scramble us and

208
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:58,839
there's a kind of fire hose of negative affect you know that sense of just

209
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:05,200
spraying of negative affect in all directions

210
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:12,359
and then enter twitter

211
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:22,880
and kind of just like just grappling scrambling to try to find

212
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:32,400
a view that's satisfying to try to find an outlet for this fire hose of negative affect

213
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:41,200
and all of this can undercut faith and dhamma in the path

214
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:49,599
it makes us wonder maybe in moments isn't maybe it's not such a meaningful thing

215
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:55,280
or maybe it makes us wonder like is it self-indulgent to even care how i'm

216
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:02,480
doing is it's self-indulgent to even try to potentiate my well-being

217
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:09,040
to fiddle with the nuances of my own suffering as the world

218
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:14,960
burns and so we can get into this mode of

219
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:21,200
practicing where we're kind of trying to save ourselves and kind of trying to save the world and it's a form of

220
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:26,400
multitasking and practice is not

221
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:31,519
does not flourish when we're multitasking in it

222
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,599
and so we're stuck

223
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:46,720
so what to do and this of course is uh where i'm

224
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:51,720
supposed to pivot and give you answers

225
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:05,160
your laughter conveys to me that you know i don't have them you know

226
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:14,799
yeah but um it's worth interrogating the the view

227
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:21,920
that you know fosters the dilemma i i laid

228
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:27,599
out and to make a few suggestions

229
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:36,880
now um i'm always cautious about anything that actually

230
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:45,040
blunts the the force of what i've just shared i'm a little cautious because

231
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:50,160
sometimes the depth of that pain you sort of just want to

232
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:56,160
wiggle out of it in whatever way we can with kind of

233
00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:03,680
vague platitudes or palliative measures and thoughts that just to help us

234
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:10,240
takes the edge off the intensity of the need and suffering

235
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:17,760
and then i'm very conscious of

236
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:24,720
my own [Music] fortune privilege social location as i

237
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:31,838
anytime i talk about progress i'm very conscious of that because

238
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:40,480
it can to talk of progress is can seem like it is uh diminishing

239
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:45,520
the meaning of the existing suffering yeah

240
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:51,440
the enormity of the suffering and so that that's an important

241
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:58,960
caveat but but many many things are getting better

242
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:05,760
and not to see that not to attune to that is its own kind of delusion

243
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,520
and so the global burden of disease

244
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:21,760
or the trends over the recent decades of human rights internationally

245
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:28,799
trends in terms of of of violence and um

246
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:35,359
trends in terms of uh extreme poverty

247
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:42,079
it's it's it costs more now to save a life than it did it's the cost is going

248
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:48,079
up and that's actually good news right because to actually intervene

249
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:55,599
in a way to save a life that otherwise would somebody would have died it costs more

250
00:57:55,599 --> 00:58:03,200
because fewer people are dying needlessly

251
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:08,640
through that could be prevented through very basic interventions this is a good

252
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:13,760
thing that it costs more to save a life now

253
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:22,559
and so this perception that everything is always getting worse is is not

254
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:29,200
is not right and that's an important corrective to

255
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:35,319
us attuning to the kind of enormity of dukkha

256
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:44,400
um some researchers told you wheatley and dan gilbert and colleagues said um

257
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:50,240
did a series of studies where they they described a phenomena where when the

258
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:55,280
instances of badness grow less common

259
00:58:55,280 --> 00:59:02,799
the concept of badness expands becomes more prominent

260
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:08,640
as there's a decreasingly less gross

261
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:15,760
yucky context the examples of badness become more prominent

262
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:21,760
so they write many organizations institutions are dedicated to identifying and reducing

263
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:27,839
the prevalence of social problems but our studies suggest that even well-meaning

264
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:33,920
agents may sometimes fail to recognize the success of their efforts simply

265
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:40,480
because they view each new instance in the decreasingly problematic context

266
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:47,359
that they themselves have brought about although modern societies have made extraordinary progress in solving a wide

267
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:52,480
range of social problems from poverty and illiteracy to violence and infant

268
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:58,799
mortality the majority of people believe that the world is getting worse

269
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:05,520
the fact that concepts grow larger when their instances grow smaller

270
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:10,599
may be one source of that pessimism

271
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:25,799
so we attune we attune to this yeah

272
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:36,079
and not just because um to to blunt the pain of the reality of

273
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:42,319
dukkha but because uh to not know that uh fosters its own kind of delusion as i

274
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:44,559
said

275
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:55,119
and with all that said you know i'm kind of pivoting between depressing uplifting

276
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:59,200
and we're making another pivot here

277
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:08,880
all the positive trends yeah that have enumerated that you can see in the data

278
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:18,000
that are very striking when you look at the data they are threatened by larger risks

279
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:24,079
and as i was starting like you know i was

280
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:31,200
saying like every generation think every generation thinks it's special you know like you always hear like oh

281
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:36,559
back when i you know or whatever things now or what you know

282
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:45,440
all these things right and so there is there is a certain kind of yeah like uh grandiosity generational

283
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:53,520
grandiosity that mirrors the egoic process of an individual

284
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:59,599
and so i'm generally skeptical of like pivotal moments hinge points you know

285
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:07,520
but but these couple generations may actually be that yeah

286
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:14,640
this is um toby award the threats to humanity and how we

287
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:19,680
address them define our time the advent of nuclear weapons posed a

288
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:26,240
real risk to human extinction in the 20th century the continued acceleration of technology

289
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:31,680
and without serious efforts to protect humanity there's strong reason to believe that the risk will be higher

290
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:38,799
this century and increasing with each century that technological progress continues

291
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:44,000
because these human generated risks outstrip all natural risks combined

292
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:50,240
they set the clock on how long humanity has left to pull back from the brink

293
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:57,599
i'm not claiming that extinction's the inevitable conclusion of scientific progress or even the most likely outcome

294
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:04,799
what i am claiming is there's been a robust trend towards increases in the power of humanity

295
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:11,119
which has reached a point where we pose a serious risk to our own existence

296
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:16,319
recognizing goes on to say recognizing that people matter equally wherever they

297
01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:22,799
are in time is a crucial next step in the ongoing story

298
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:30,400
of humanity's moral progress our own generation is but one page

299
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:36,319
in a much larger longer story and that our most important role may be

300
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:44,359
how we shape or fail to shape that story this approach is animated by a moral

301
01:03:44,359 --> 01:03:52,319
reorientation toward the vast future that existential risks threaten

302
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:55,559
to foreclose

303
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:05,119
he suggested that um humanity is is maybe in its kind of like

304
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:11,440
adolescent phase where we have a lot

305
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:17,680
of power and aren't sure what to do with it yeah a lot of

306
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:24,720
of power but are naive in important ways and adolescents like adolescent health

307
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:30,079
adolescents are like peak physical health and yet die

308
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:35,038
at much higher rates than you would expect

309
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:43,160
a sense of like yeah we're playing with fire that that does seem to me not to be

310
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:49,680
catastrophizing that seems real like and to worry

311
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:55,559
to worry is not unreasonable

312
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:03,039
and so amidst the vastness of suffering and the possibilities of the future like

313
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:08,319
what stance will i take what does this mean for my heart

314
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:13,520
how do i want to be informed by this moment

315
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:21,440
and we bump up against the the the kind of blessings and consolation of dharma

316
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:26,880
and the the limitations of dharma

317
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:34,480
and for us often say for for some forms of of dis-ease

318
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:39,920
the dharma seems to me like the only medicine there is for certain kinds

319
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:48,079
forms of suffering i can't imagine any medicine being adequate treatment

320
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:55,599
but that doesn't mean that the dharma is the medicine for all forms of dis-ease

321
01:05:55,599 --> 01:06:02,240
in other words dukkha is an interdisciplinary problem

322
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:08,000
yeah and in a way if we expect dharma to

323
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:14,000
answer all species of suffering it may fail to answer those species it

324
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
can

325
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:28,000
and so we look to all the wisdom of the world

326
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:37,119
all the wisdom of the world to science and art and philosophy and

327
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:42,559
movement building and philanthropy and all of it

328
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:52,160
now as i engage with the world you know i want my suffering to be efficient

329
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:57,280
i'm willing to suffer to engage to avoid

330
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:02,720
the deadness of apathy or nihilism or whatever i'm willing to suffer i'm

331
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:08,160
willing to enter the public sphere and suffer

332
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:17,440
yeah but i want that suffering to be efficient i don't want to waste it

333
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:24,240
and as i look back on my life there are some patches of suffering that

334
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:30,400
seem totally necessary and onward leading and

335
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:36,480
important and generative is like oh yeah i had to suffer in those

336
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:43,280
ways and i know there are ways in the future that i will need to suffer that will be

337
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:50,720
the redemptive form of suffering the onward leading form of suffering and

338
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:58,880
i can also look back on my life maybe anybody can and see

339
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:03,920
patches and strands threads of suffering

340
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:12,480
that appear almost utterly meaningless and cyclical

341
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:18,119
and unnecessary unnecessary

342
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:24,238
it just didn't lead anywhere it didn't accomplish anything it was just me

343
01:08:24,239 --> 01:08:32,480
circling in some kind of little vortex of confusion and pain and not knowing how

344
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:38,359
to break the kind of break it

345
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:44,238
and so we have to part of our dharma practice is becoming connoisseurs of our

346
01:08:44,239 --> 01:08:49,679
suffering yeah and spending it wisely

347
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:55,600
engaging in ways that like we're suffering efficiently

348
01:08:55,600 --> 01:09:00,880
not cyclically not uselessly

349
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:08,238
and so we consent to some measure of suffering we're not giving up on samsara

350
01:09:08,239 --> 01:09:16,159
and we're we're also not we're careful not to suffer meaninglessly

351
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:22,080
and so i think of this to some extent in how we engage with media news

352
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:27,758
like what aspects of that engagement are like redemptive

353
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:35,120
important suffering and what parts are just kind of have that that cyclical

354
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:41,199
like just spinning the wheel of samsara feeling

355
01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:47,520
and this is a place to inquire and to look like what am i doing to my mind

356
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:54,960
is it useful what can i actually open to what do i have to like blunt myself from

357
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:59,560
feeling because i'm so overexposed

358
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:08,560
and it's just this sense you know like when i actually read the paper you know it's like i don't you know my nervous

359
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:14,640
system like isn't really equipped to open to the enormity of suffering

360
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:21,360
of samsara all the time yeah and what does that do when i like

361
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:27,800
kind of open and kind of close to it

362
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:36,960
so we're careful in how we dose this how we dose our

363
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:45,120
the information but um we also find something to do

364
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:51,120
that anxiety needs to be bound you know it needs to

365
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:58,159
be bound to action you know that's that's part of what actually

366
01:10:58,159 --> 01:11:06,400
um that's that's that's part of this picture in to my mind

367
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:12,880
and so some of the kind of compulsivity about news is a function of our sense of our

368
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:19,360
own powerlessness and it's like well okay if i'm completely powerless at least i can just

369
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:24,400
keep consuming that or something or speaking about that

370
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:32,800
and instead it's like no we just do something we find efficient ways to spend our hard

371
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:38,480
to spend our suffering to consent to some measure of suffering and engage

372
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:43,040
hopefully in efficient ways

373
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:48,800
and so we we

374
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:54,640
are called at times to give to give until it hurts time or money or effort

375
01:11:54,640 --> 01:12:00,400
or something we actually like it it's a practice of

376
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:05,760
of like get and this is giving till it hurts this is not like some incredibly

377
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:11,360
mercenary manipulation to try to get donna from you by the way

378
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:16,480
i'm not a psychopath you know but no it's like we give until

379
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:23,760
it hurts you know and and it's like we sometimes we're in this

380
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:31,679
mode of like half compassion half equanimity and my experience it's like no no no a

381
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:36,719
hundred percent compassion and then a hundred percent equanimity

382
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:44,719
it's like we give and then we really rest we really firewall some parts of our life

383
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:53,040
and we really rest otherwise it's like this half open heart half equanimous you know kind of

384
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:59,440
sense of like recognizing are the limitations of our own wishes to control

385
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:08,158
samsara and that half equanimity half compassion is its own kind of fatigue

386
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:14,480
and so we we really [Music]

387
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:20,640
give we try to serve in ways that are meaningful even in the face of the enormity of

388
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:28,679
suffering we try to serve in ways that are meaningful and then we rest and we really rest

389
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:38,159
i think of the dharma primarily as a as a technology of freeing our own heart

390
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:44,239
bring our own heart of greeting delusion i think there are other

391
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:50,880
traditions of wisdom that are relevant for change at a collective level

392
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:57,120
nevertheless our dharma practice is relevant it endows us with skills that

393
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:04,000
are powerful for engaging the dukkha of the world

394
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:14,400
we we learn we learn to truly care about suffering

395
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:19,760
for the earth shattering poignancy of that to rain

396
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:25,760
down on us and just that

397
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:31,120
closes the kind of distance that we might imagine between ourselves

398
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:38,880
and someone on the other side of the world or ourself and someone in the distant future

399
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:48,159
the circle of uh of empathy yeah widens widens we know

400
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:54,719
we know how deeply we share the longing to be free from suffering

401
01:14:54,719 --> 01:15:01,120
that is like in the bones that's in our bones

402
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:09,679
and we learn how to grieve well which is indispensable if we're too open

403
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:16,239
to suffering and to engage it if we don't know how to like open to the

404
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:21,520
rhythms of grieving and the the prospect of loss

405
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:29,280
the reality the inevitability of loss we get spun in many ways

406
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:39,840
we cultivate a deep patience a deep patience that these are multi-generational efforts

407
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:43,600
the parame of patience

408
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:52,480
we're learning to drain a egoic investment from our views

409
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:58,719
the ways in which our views become charged with egoic energy

410
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:08,960
and we think our self-righteousness makes us more persuasive but it makes us much much less

411
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:20,320
it makes us much less it is a form of clinging yeah

412
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:25,440
and so we can actually sense the moral force of

413
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:31,560
a view that is enunciated without clinging

414
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:42,560
and we're coming to terms with death

415
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:50,159
that is so crucial part of our practice

416
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:56,640
i'm part of uh i feel maybe a prerequisite actually for

417
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:02,159
engaging with the broader world of dukkha as a

418
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:07,760
constellation societal level because

419
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:17,040
when we have no freedom around our own death it distorts our engagement in many ways

420
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:22,320
it's like our own death is uh

421
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:29,198
it's mara's ultimate trump card yeah

422
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:36,000
and camus said something like make peace with death after that

423
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,480
anything is possible yeah

424
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:49,760
and so in this realm so much delusion so much

425
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:57,120
kind of fear and manipulation arises out of our own incomplete

426
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:05,600
relationship with mortality with the changingness the the loss of all things

427
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:14,320
and so we

428
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:20,000
find a way to serve we let go of suffering that is inefficient

429
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,400
and we rest

430
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:34,480
it seems like a good enough life to me

431
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:41,840
sit for a minute

432
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:03,880
so

433
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:36,400
now offer offer these thoughts for your consideration yeah

434
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:44,080
and uh it's an idiosyncratic path and um

435
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:49,520
you have to determine what to um what is useful what to pick up and consider

436
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:53,360
investigate and what to leave behind

437
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:04,960
yeah so thank you i appreciate the opportunity to uh

438
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:10,639
ask some of these questions together yeah they uh

439
01:21:10,639 --> 01:21:15,840
may we live well you know thank you
