1
00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:06,859
welcome everyone and thank you for being here

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:15,780
as we train our minds by practicing meditation

3
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:21,199
we are not looking for some special experience

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:28,080
but rather we're putting in place wholesome Tendencies of the Mind

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,020
awesome conditions so that we can open up

6
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,600
and greet our experience in a way that is liberating

7
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:47,180
rather than stuck and reactive

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,940
so as you know this is a gradual path And We Begin by accepting and getting to

9
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,198
know who we are

10
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,520
and our theme for this week opening the Dharma heart

11
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:16,200
to me that means learning to trust what the present moment is offering us

12
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,939
without needing to change how things are in order to be okay

13
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,360
and for those of us who have been conditioned by trauma

14
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:37,280
it can be that trusting anything uh can be quite a tall order

15
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,119
so let's begin our meditation by formulating Our intention

16
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,540
the idea that motivates us to practice

17
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,000
on Monday I shared with you my personal intention which is

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,939
may I be Safe Haven of kindness

19
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:08,360
and emptiness for all beings everywhere

20
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:18,019
so take a moment now to formulate your deepest wish what brings you to practice meditation

21
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:46,140
and assuming your meditation posture whether you're sitting or lying down or

22
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,220
maybe even standing

23
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:57,540
and feeling the support of the Earth resting

24
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,040
the Earth to support you

25
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:12,060
feeling that contact of the buttocks or the back or the feet

26
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:20,420
with the Earth and sending your roots down deep

27
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,900
and then gently aligning the spine

28
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:35,459
so that the energy flows nicely from Heaven to Earth and back right through

29
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:38,900
your spinal column

30
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,720
see if you can land in a posture that

31
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:04,819
gives you a sense of quiet confidence and you feel alert and balanced

32
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:18,260
and now we'll give ourselves the gift of letting go

33
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:27,259
to the extent we can relaxing first of all the body

34
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,600
the head the neck and shoulders

35
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:43,440
relaxing the arms the elbows wrists

36
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,440
hands

37
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:56,220
relaxing the heart area in the belly

38
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,180
on the hips

39
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:11,940
and legs and the feet and letting go of any obvious tensions

40
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:17,580
that we can't let go of and

41
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:24,060
just bringing a sense of softness to those tensions that

42
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,800
are difficult to let go of

43
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:41,160
and now we'll begin with a short practice of

44
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,560
metamedication just to warm up our mindfulness a little

45
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:53,880
bit so if you like you can bring a

46
00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:01,139
benefactor to come and see it in front of you someone who invariably brings you Joy

47
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:04,400
when you're with them

48
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:12,720
or if you're comfortable offering meta to yourself then you can

49
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,680
just do it that way

50
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:25,620
may I may you may all beings

51
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,900
be safe and protected

52
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,600
may we be happy

53
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:49,819
may we be peaceful and may we know moments of freedom

54
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:09,380
so lighting a little candle of well-wishing in our hearts

55
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:17,539
for ourselves and for everyone for this community the whole world

56
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:30,080
and we bring in the wisdom Factor

57
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:37,639
of asking where do we place our trust

58
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:45,560
do we trust the mind that is spinning with preoccupations

59
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:53,699
or is the invitation to choose stepping into the present moment

60
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:59,880
leaving all our preoccupations outside the door for this brief half

61
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,120
hour

62
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:11,520
as you may know the Holly word for mindfulness or awareness is

63
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:18,960
Sati and I often think of Sati as my

64
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:28,160
best friend in this endeavor and I invite her to come and sit with me

65
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:35,219
consciously choosing resting in

66
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:40,880
relaxing into open awareness

67
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:46,459
it's like putting my head inside his lap perhaps

68
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:58,279
okay let's let the Mind settle down now

69
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:06,600
and staying with our ever-changing experience of the breath

70
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:16,080
as our meditation object gently taking in a long slow deep breath

71
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:22,019
appreciating the whole cycle of the breath

72
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:28,800
as the inhale progressively flows into the exhale

73
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:35,060
and the exhale flows into the inhale

74
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:47,959
and letting our full awareness inhabit the process of breathing

75
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:03,480
trusting it is possible to let the Mind settle

76
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,660
down

77
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:17,100
and enjoying the beautiful connection of just settling into the world of the

78
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:24,240
breath breathing in

79
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,260
and settling

80
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,620
breathing out openness

81
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:47,899
trusting the company of being with the breath

82
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:38,600
and letting the eyes close as you settle into the breath

83
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,579
being here with his Heaven flow

84
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:54,980
of the experience of breathing is all we need

85
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:41,279
softening the muscles of the face forehead

86
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:49,040
the eye eyes around the eyes and behind the eyes

87
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:00,320
sinuses and the cheeks the lips and mouth and the jaw

88
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,420
and joining the breath on this

89
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:22,880
quiet Journey through the inhale

90
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:30,240
and the exhale breathing in

91
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:37,680
feeling settled and breathing out

92
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:43,579
the clarity that comes from open awareness

93
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:42,079
as we settle the body and the mind breathing in

94
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:50,660
this makes the space for the clarity of open awareness

95
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:59,839
and we can offer that clarity to the world

96
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:13,279
to each other and to ourselves

97
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:35,760
and with the warm heart kindness breathing in

98
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:41,100
settling breathing out

99
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:45,500
open and clear

100
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,799
foreign

101
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,159
thank you

102
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:32,700
and if the Mind should wander as Minds tend to do

103
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:40,559
coming back with a smile settling into the breath

104
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,799
and the clarity of awareness

105
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,760
thank you

106
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:26,299
and as we come to the end of the city

107
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:33,179
with a mind that has benefited from appreciating

108
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:38,580
some of the goodness in ourselves and in our world

109
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:43,340
and through the goodness of our practice

110
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:51,860
may we from our Center of settledness and clarity

111
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:59,279
now radiate our heartfelt wish that all beings everywhere

112
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:07,760
be safe may all beings be happy

113
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,340
may we all be peaceful

114
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:20,658
and may all beings be free

115
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:42,990
[Music]

116
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,140
foreign

117
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:29,059
friends I'm glad to be here with you

118
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:37,080
um some of you have been asking about when this series of guided meditations and talks will be up on the Audio Dharma

119
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:44,100
and many of you know this but the beautiful entity that is IMC has a

120
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:51,539
remarkable business model which is one of generosity and there's not a single uh paid

121
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:58,500
employee so everything works because a dedicated Army of volunteers

122
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:04,260
uh offer their time freely and in this case the person responsible

123
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:11,240
for putting these talks up on the Audio Dharma is a way so everything will be up at some point

124
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:15,860
but I can't exactly tell you when

125
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:24,779
also uh someone asked where I'm teaching from and uh I live in a very remote and

126
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:32,778
beautiful spot in the south of France near a huge Nature Reserve

127
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:39,120
beautiful stars lots of biodiversity and lots of quiet

128
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:45,679
but if you're into entertaining and shopping you wouldn't like it here at all

129
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:52,559
um so today we come to the last talk in this

130
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:58,500
series of wholesome qualities that we can cultivate

131
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,740
to prepare the mind and the heart for awakening

132
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:09,240
uh on Monday I talked about Paulie as being a language that is highly

133
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:16,380
polysemic and that's not a pun um polysemic is is a Greek origin and it

134
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:22,200
it means that quite often a single word will have a number of quite different

135
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:31,620
meanings so in the early text the word for the quality we'll explore today is Asana

136
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:38,760
and it's not related to vipassana which has two s's in a one n this word

137
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:48,840
has one s and two ends uh Gil translates Asana as uh clear

138
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:56,279
happy and trusting but literally uh it means something like

139
00:32:56,279 --> 00:33:02,760
settling forward so in probably the previous means

140
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:08,220
forward or onward or to the four

141
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:16,940
and it brings the idea of this quality of Mind as one that is on relieving

142
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:23,940
and then um sud is the root of the word Sana

143
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:30,539
and it means sit or settle so

144
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:36,659
um uh literally means settled but as an

145
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:42,779
adjective it's translated as bright clear pure

146
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:49,159
transparent and it can also mean

147
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:55,559
being full of Faith having confidence and trusting

148
00:33:55,559 --> 00:34:02,600
and in addition to that it includes a sense of being pleased and happy

149
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:10,500
so I think that the the root um of the word is has a lot to do with

150
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:18,240
what it means for us as meditators um of being settled

151
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:26,099
as the big part of how this all comes about in my uh professional life I used to

152
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:31,200
work as a limnologist and that's somebody who studies the Ecology of

153
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:39,358
lakes and rivers and coastal areas and I like to think of taking a sample

154
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:46,138
of a column of Lake water from near the bottom to near the surface

155
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:52,320
and then letting it sit long enough so that all the drags and the particles

156
00:34:52,320 --> 00:35:00,540
can settle to the bottom and what's left at the top is water that is transparent

157
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:07,560
and clear so if we sit long enough

158
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:14,280
and let the Mind settle down we can enjoy a mind that is transparent

159
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:20,160
and clear and able to let in the light of the

160
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:27,480
Dharma so drama practice is often thought of

161
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:35,700
as a process of purification and it does take a while and it does

162
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:42,240
require letting the magic happen but in the

163
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:49,760
transformation habit and the opening up that makes that possible

164
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:58,079
So eventually if we sit long enough and let the Mind settle down

165
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:03,540
we do have moments when our preoccupations are no longer running the

166
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:08,760
show so instead of letting the Mind keep

167
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:18,720
stirring up the dregs of thoughts and preoccupations we can perhaps dare to let things settle

168
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:26,099
if only for a short time so don't be discouraged if you can't yet

169
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:32,480
remain settled for a long time you might think of your self as a parent

170
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:40,560
and your mind as a little toddler and if you've had kids you'll remember

171
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:45,839
how wonderful it was when your little toddler first stood up

172
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:53,420
and then finally took a couple of steps and of course plop down right away

173
00:36:53,579 --> 00:37:02,520
but those baby steps were just glorious and a cause of great happiness for you

174
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:10,280
so um celebrate your baby steps of letting the Mind settle down

175
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:21,300
and then trusting the emptiness of a mind with awareness that is wide

176
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:27,680
open receptive soft

177
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:35,599
unobstructed by preoccupations [Music] glad and confident

178
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:44,720
I think the idea of trust is key to being able to walk this path

179
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:50,339
I had the Good Fortune to receive lay ordination from my zinc teacher

180
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:56,099
shouldn't use Suzuki roshi and he gave me the Buddhist name kancho

181
00:37:56,099 --> 00:38:01,980
doshin which means something like feel illuminate

182
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:08,099
path of faith so for the feel illuminate part I I

183
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:13,380
remember my first two years in the monastery where

184
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:20,400
I cried silently in nearly every period of meditation and often throughout the

185
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,560
day and the tears just kept coming and this did

186
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,780
feel like a process of purification

187
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:37,619
and I think perhaps with the first part of my name feel illuminate

188
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:44,280
Suzuki roshu was encouraging me to trust the process of letting my feelings

189
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:49,760
arise and eventually like the way

190
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:55,680
and then as for being a path of Faith well I don't think this was my strong

191
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:01,980
point um of course my faith in my teacher and my

192
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:10,500
faith in the Buddhist teachings was Rock Solid but Faith confidence in myself

193
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:15,619
was really sorely lacking

194
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:24,020
so for me learning to trust has been a big part of learning to walk this path

195
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:29,940
but the Buddha never wanted his disciples to trust blindly on the

196
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:37,760
contrary the Dharma does a splendid job of pointing away

197
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:43,320
but even with that each of us has to learn how to realize it for ourselves

198
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:48,599
because we're all different we all have our own causes and conditions

199
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:53,720
our own knots to untie and unwind

200
00:39:54,900 --> 00:40:03,380
we need to learn where we get stuck where we cling how we become reactive

201
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:09,900
so right now [Music]

202
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:17,160
where am I putting my trust am I trusting my fear

203
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:23,760
am I trusting anger am I filling up the radiant emptiness of

204
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:30,660
the present moment with needing to prove myself With Me Myself and mine

205
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,980
wanting to be someone

206
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:43,260
or might it be possible to trust this radiant emptiness

207
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:48,480
it is available to each of us when we stop filling it up with our

208
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,819
agendas and preoccupations

209
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,200
do I trust noise or clitorous silence

210
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:07,380
what kind of trust is needed so that I can let the dredge dregs of

211
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:13,440
selfing settle out allowing for the clarity

212
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,119
that is needed for insight

213
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:29,520
though the qualities that the Buddha sought to inspire in his followers

214
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:36,000
to prepare them for his deepest teachings who are being receptive

215
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,339
having a mind that's soft without the Fetters of fixed views and

216
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:47,880
conceit free of the preoccupations of the

217
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:55,760
hindrances glad and inspired to practice

218
00:41:56,579 --> 00:42:01,800
and with today's quality a mind that is settled clear

219
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:06,079
bright and confident

220
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:16,579
and then when these qualities are in place and we have opened the Dharma heart

221
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:23,300
then we can finally understand the deepest teachings of the Buddha

222
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:28,039
so do you know what these deepest teachings are

223
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:34,859
um they may sound rather pedestrian at first not so mind-blowing

224
00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:40,819
and in the discourse I'm referring to this week Imagine

225
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:48,240
91 in the middle length discourses when the Brahman uh brahmayu had these

226
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:54,000
wholesome qualities of mind and the Dharma eye arose in him

227
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,720
then the Buddha said all of it is subject to arising

228
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:08,339
is subject to cessation and with this where my you saw the

229
00:43:08,339 --> 00:43:16,140
Dharma and became enlightened so that's all there is to it

230
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:24,420
to really know that oh it is subject to arising is subject to cessation

231
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:31,619
but you know of course it's not enough to just know it with the mind we have to

232
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:38,060
know it with our whole being and be transformed by it

233
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:46,740
so my suggestion to you with the teachings of this week is that for the Dharma eye to open in

234
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:52,140
you you may need to do some preliminary work of opening the Dharma

235
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:57,599
heart we need to

236
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:05,779
get to the bottom of our suffering and see the uselessness of clinging to anything

237
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:15,920
bringing all of you of Who You Are to walking this path

238
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:24,180
and then letting go of trusting the small self of Me Myself and mine

239
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:29,520
and opening up for and making space for trusting

240
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:35,720
the Dharma to take you in the direction of freedom

241
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:46,319
when we can let the Mind settle and get out of their way the Dharma

242
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:53,660
knows where to take us and that's something we can trust

243
00:44:53,760 --> 00:45:00,599
thank you and a small announcement is that next

244
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:06,660

246
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:21,500
ago when we did our master's degree with Gill franzal as our major professor

247
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:29,660
so I'm sure you'll enjoy next week as well thank you for being here
