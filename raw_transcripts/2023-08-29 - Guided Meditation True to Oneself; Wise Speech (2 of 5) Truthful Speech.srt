1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,819
foreign

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:19,560
and welcome and

3
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,240
so

4
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,599
maybe I

5
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,500
maybe I already feel kind of quiet

6
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,320
so this topic of

7
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,280
the beach today's topic is truth

8
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:01,620
and meditation is

9
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:09,380
the mindfulness meditation is the practice of being truthful to oneself

10
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:16,380
that we often say we talk we talk about a simple recognition of what's happening

11
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:22,020
in the present moment and some people use Mental noting

12
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:30,780
noting what's happening in the moment with little mental note breathing in breathing out hearing

13
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,659
itching and um

14
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:44,759
the um but those are all small little statements of Truth saying

15
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:50,640
what is true in the moment in our experience in our sensory experience

16
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,040
but also we can say truth about other things

17
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:06,000
like now I'm quiet I feel quiet internally or I'm agitated or I'm happy or sad

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,819
and it's the accumulation of these simple freely given

19
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:17,160
moments of Truth that build in meditation

20
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:23,459
that help things help us to grow in the Dharma help us to become quiet

21
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:29,040
help us to become clear unconflicted

22
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:36,660
so you might think of meditation as the continuous Act

23
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,360
of being truthful being true

24
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:49,400
to this moment becoming aware of what's Happening truthfully

25
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:56,819
and this of course means much more than just recognizing that we're breathing in and breathing out

26
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:03,420
it's really recognizing how we actually are quality of the heart the quality of the

27
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:09,739
inner being how we're showing up in the world at this moment

28
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,560
recognizing what we're avoiding and hiding from or

29
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:23,640
recognizing the emotions the beliefs the feelings

30
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:32,000
that are driving the distracted mind preoccupied mind the concerned mind

31
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,459
and the continuous Act of being truthful

32
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:44,700
creates a change something different happens with us

33
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:51,659
under the influence of just being true eventually we would discover what a

34
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:58,379
relief it is even there's a freedom to be found

35
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:03,840
in the capacity the ability to be truthful say the truth to

36
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,659
ourselves and it might not be actually using words

37
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:17,880
or it might be a deeper knowing that this is what's happening this is what it is

38
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:24,479
so as we meditate today you might want to keep in mind that what we're practicing is not

39
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,540
concentration not calm not

40
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:37,740
being present for the present moment all those things help and support

41
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:43,380
what is the heart of meditation which is being truthful being true

42
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:53,060
to this moment how it actually is so assuming a meditation posture

43
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:05,300
sometimes it's the emphasis this is the word dignified posture

44
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:13,979
there's a dignity in showing up to be truthful

45
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:19,220
to be the truth to be true

46
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:24,919
there's a dignity a nobility

47
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,740
to be a true person

48
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:41,400
to Stand Tall to sit still and sit tall to lay down tall

49
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,300
here

50
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:51,139
and

51
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:01,880
gently lowering the Gaze if the eyes are open

52
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,400
and then perhaps closing the eyes

53
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:22,139
and gently breathing a little deeper

54
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:28,080
just deep enough that you feel a fuller connection to your torso your

55
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,300
body your belly and chest

56
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:42,840
and a longer exhale than usual long enough to let something

57
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:50,479
relax in your body giving away

58
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,139
easing up

59
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:08,639
breathing out a little longer and

60
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,919
so that the thinking mind could quiet down

61
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,539
thinking mind can relax

62
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,740
letting breathing return to normal

63
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:26,419
and if you're quiet for a few moments to feel and sense and know yourself

64
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,300
what is true for you right now

65
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:45,800
in what way can truth telling recognizing the truth

66
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,200
be quieting be freeing

67
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,620
be opening

68
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:02,480
so something inside something in the mind or the heart

69
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:06,200
response positively

70
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:13,040
to the recognition of what is true for you right now

71
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:32,540
sometimes breathing

72
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,339
to how we breathe is influenced by how we are

73
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,640
and there's a way of being grounded or being settled in what's true

74
00:09:53,640 --> 00:10:00,480
whether it's comfortable or not by recognizing how it is that it's

75
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,040
in the breathing itself

76
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,500
and gently

77
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:26,360
Let The Rhythm of breathing be like a massage or a

78
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:38,899
kind physical contact touching

79
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,580
what is true Within

80
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:59,160
when you notice that you're distracted don't worry about that

81
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:06,660
don't be concerned or rush back to the breath instead

82
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:13,380
just be truthful truthfully recognize that you're

83
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:19,260
distracted Let It Be A Moment of Truth telling or

84
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:24,779
truth recognition that is satisfying in and of itself

85
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:28,279
that's freeing

86
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:35,300
that is healing and growing

87
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:43,380
recognizing how things are without any conflict

88
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,519
just the truth

89
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:09,559
however you are recognizing it honestly truthfully

90
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:19,940
maybe taking the time to feel into yourself what's below the surface

91
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,620
and in the truth-telling

92
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:32,039
might there be some relief some opening

93
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:38,120
some making space for how you are

94
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,200
and then as we come to the end of this meditation

95
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:32,820
to take a few moments to appreciate

96
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:41,720
the value benefits goodness of telling the truth to ourselves

97
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:59,600
growth healing freedom

98
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,919
even love and compassion

99
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:11,340
grow better when we are truthful to ourselves to what's

100
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:17,120
happening with ourselves and our response to the world

101
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:27,000
and may it be that our capacity to be truthful serves for the benefit and Welfare of

102
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,759
all people including ourselves

103
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:38,520
may it be on this day that our meditation practice our

104
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:44,460
truth-telling is dedicated to

105
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:52,400
the benefit of everyone may all beings be happy

106
00:28:52,440 --> 00:29:01,559
may all beings be safe may all beings be peaceful

107
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:05,658
and may all beings be free

108
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,160
[Music]

109
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,360
thank you

110
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:19,158
good morning good day

111
00:30:20,539 --> 00:30:28,860
and um so this is the second talk on the five criteria that Buddha used

112
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:36,059
for why speech and um these five criteria can be taken as

113
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:42,679
questions that we ask ourselves before we speak and yesterday I talked about

114
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:48,419
when the question is is it timely is it the right time to say what we want to

115
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:55,080
say to ask what we want to ask today the topic is or the question is is

116
00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:01,200
it truthful are we speaking the truth and um

117
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:06,720
I kind of like it that this the second that we ask is a timely first that's

118
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:12,960
kind of like the high end like even the truth might not be timely might not be the

119
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:19,140
right time to speak the truth if we start with truth then maybe we are

120
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:26,340
um we speak inappropriately at times when it doesn't help maybe even Harms

121
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:32,220
makes things more difficult so is it timely then today is it

122
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:39,539
truthful and of course the topic of what is true and how do we recognize the truth is can

123
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:46,200
be philosophically or linguistically complex but uh a simple way of understanding it

124
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:53,640
is that um it's uh that the minimum that the

125
00:31:53,640 --> 00:32:00,480
truth is involves an absence of Deceit there's no intention no effort to

126
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,580
deceive anybody um with what we're saying what we're doing

127
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:12,059
and um because if with deception we're clearly not speaking the truth

128
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:18,840
other times we might be attempting to say what's true or we think we say what's true but it might not be true but

129
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:25,200
there's not we're not intentionally trying to be deceitful

130
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,360
we're trying to be truthful and one of the ways to

131
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:38,580
strengthen our capacity or heighten our capacity to be true is when we say something to follow up

132
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:43,620
immediately with the basis upon which we think it's true why do we think

133
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:48,899
something is true so for example I if you you know rather

134
00:32:48,899 --> 00:32:55,440
than saying that um you know you know today is a great day

135
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,779
it's not gonna you can say today um it's my interpretation that it's a

136
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:06,080
great day so we're saying that on what basis we're making the claim it's an interpretation

137
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:11,760
or it's a great day for me rather than just making a blanket

138
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:18,299
statement for everyone so be a little more specific and say what's the basis is for something

139
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:27,240
that would have emphasized this they said if especially with religious statements that you say on the basis of

140
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:33,720
what do you make a claim a religious spiritual claim is it you based on your faith is it

141
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:41,039
based on your reasoning is it based on the tradition you're in or a teacher where the teacher has said

142
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:46,200
um is it based on something you've experienced and because even experience is

143
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,299
interpreted and it's personal so as soon as you make these caveats or

144
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:57,059
these these explanations then people will uh then it's not a declarative

145
00:33:57,059 --> 00:34:03,840
statement and declarative statements are questionable how truthful they are

146
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:10,740
but if you specify or contextualize how you come to this conclusion then

147
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:17,520
then it's easier to participate in a conversation with the others and it's also easier to stay closer to what's

148
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:24,419
true so to be truthful is this truthful what I'm going to say how can I say it so

149
00:34:24,419 --> 00:34:31,679
it's truthful and so this is my interpretation to be truthful today to you all of you I can

150
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:39,658
say that I value this idea of Truth and the Buddha emphasized it and I would

151
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:45,599
like to try to explain my interpretation of why this is important

152
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:51,720
so you know that's you know that now I'm speaking the truth

153
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:57,540
and I'm contextualizing what I'm going to say so you don't have to automatically assume that I'm making

154
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:04,500
declarative statements that's of what's absolutely true in the universe but rather it's my interpretation and

155
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:11,220
you'll have to hear it and see what's true for you as you hear it and what works for you

156
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:17,280
foreign speaking the truth is a way to heal it's

157
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:25,740
the way to grow it's a way to mend relationships it's a way of finding

158
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:30,900
a way to connect more deeply to others we connect more deeply when we're truthful

159
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:36,660
when we're deceitful we're actually creating a barriers between connectivity

160
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:43,980
between people and the kind of alienation a separation and um

161
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:49,859
the uh it's probably true to say that spiritually

162
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:55,380
there's no spiritual growth there's no growth in the Dharma without a

163
00:35:55,380 --> 00:36:00,540
dedication to being truthful to the truth the truth is that important

164
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:05,940
and and ultimately maybe what we're looking for is to become not just

165
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:11,400
truthful but becoming a true person a person is true in how they live their

166
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:18,359
lives how they express their lives how they speak and so asking everyone's else a question

167
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:27,680
before speaking is this true or how can I speak this that I want to say in a way that feels truthful to me

168
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:33,900
the um and then it's also a very powerful practice to to this I think of

169
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:41,220
true speaking the truth as being mindfulness out loud that uh mindfulness meditation or

170
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:48,359
mindfulness practice for oneself is really a continual Act of saying the truth to ourselves saying the truth of

171
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:56,820
what's happening in our experience and not deceiving ourselves and um and then so so doing that out

172
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:02,880
loud isn't my you know being truthful honest is true is mindfulness out loud

173
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:08,700
and uh but in that it's mindful then if we feel that we want to lie

174
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:14,420
feel we want to kind of bend the truth in some way this is a really useful time

175
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:19,859
for deepening our own introspection to really take a good look at what's

176
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:27,000
happening here with me now because what motivates the desire to be to lie

177
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:34,380
what motivates being deceitful and uh is it fear is it greed is it

178
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:40,040
anger is it conceit of some type and you know avoiding embarrassment or

179
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:45,300
you know hiding from people not so they don't know who we are what's what we do

180
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:51,720
is it to try to get our way in the world or to what what's motivating it

181
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:58,200
and and uh the advantage of asking that question what's motivating my desire to

182
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:03,660
to lie is to because that the deeper

183
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:10,079
motivations for that that's an important place of practice that's important place of really looking deeply

184
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:16,740
because the opportunity there is to discover what we're attached to discover what we're clinging to and so ever what

185
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:24,300
kind of conceit there's self-making what you're involved in so that we can begin dissolving it so we can become Freer

186
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:29,400
from these kinds of attachments there's a kind of delight that exists in

187
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,920
Dharma practice of recognizing where we're caught recognize our attachments

188
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:41,220
and that the light is there because we realize oh this is where the practice is now I get to practice

189
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:47,940
this is good rather than assuming that Buddhist practice is all about joy and delight and kind of skipping in

190
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:55,140
the clouds and a Happy Lucky way uh Buddhist practices a lot about this deeper deeper truth-telling

191
00:38:55,140 --> 00:39:02,700
and a deep appreciation for the value of doing so seeing our attachments and clinging so

192
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:07,920
that we can find we can be on the path of freedom from it all

193
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:15,240
so rather than seeing you know our attachments as bad news to identify there's a way in which in a certain way

194
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:24,300
if we're committed to being truthful it's good news so uh I think that the dedication to be

195
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:31,500
truthful begins highlighting all the little ways we exaggerate a little ways we bend the

196
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:37,020
truth maybe sometimes we do it for the city what we think is the sake of the other person

197
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:43,859
and um you know so it's not to hurt them or or upset them or something

198
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:48,960
and um and so that seems good some Compassion

199
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:55,260
or care involved in that but is it necessary to be deceitful to lie

200
00:39:55,260 --> 00:40:05,520
and so part of the art of speaking the truth in our relationships with others is to avoid causing harm and avoid lying

201
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:11,220
and sometimes that takes some cleverness or take some consideration or reframing

202
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:18,240
the conversation or sometimes even responding with a non-sequitur

203
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:23,700
and uh and um the um

204
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:31,740
or finding some way to you know to say something that may be satisfies the

205
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:39,500
person's question but doesn't really address it because to address it honestly it just would be complicated

206
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:46,560
That's a classic example someone gives is someone's dressed for their wedding

207
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:51,960
about to go into the ceremony and they ask you you know what do you think of my

208
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:58,320
my dress or my suit or my clothes and uh and you think it's you know maybe

209
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:05,160
pretty gaudy or the wrong you know the color combination

210
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:12,079
the colors clash or something but you don't want to say that just before someone goes into their their wedding

211
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:19,320
the truthful statement about what you think is uh you know what you really think and so what can you say that's

212
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:26,099
truthful and you might say you know that um something like

213
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:31,680
you you know wow it it was a really is it tailor-made it really fits your body

214
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:36,920
really well or you say something different you say recognize say something it's truthful

215
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:43,619
that is not your first impression but something that you have to think about and tell yeah I can say I can speak

216
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:50,760
about that and that maybe settles the person or allows people to kind of go along

217
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:57,900
so uh um to be truthful and speaking the truth

218
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:04,020
when there's conflict and challenges can be very hard and so this is why it's

219
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:09,119
important to remember the first criteria is it the right time to be have a an

220
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:15,480
honest conversation with someone are they ready for it are you ready for it but then the other three criteria which

221
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:21,119
we'll do over the next days also come into play It's Not only is it truthful

222
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:26,300
and therefore I should say it it's a truthful and

223
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:31,680
can I say it in a useful way can I say it in a supportive way

224
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:37,680
g'day how can I say the truth so that it's beneficial

225
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:43,800
and so we'll talk more about this as we go along here so um

226
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:49,500
is it true and what happens to you when you ask

227
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:55,619
that question and today as you go about your day you might have occasion to

228
00:42:55,619 --> 00:43:02,599
speak and if there's enough self-reflection as you're about to speak

229
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:08,660
maybe you could ask yourself the question is it what I'm going to say about to say

230
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:14,300
is it truthful and uh

231
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:22,520
and is it truthful and a simple and clear way or is it truthful in an exaggerated way or an understated way or

232
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:29,339
leading something out you know why why am I kind of adjusting myself and

233
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:36,300
speaking the truth what's the motivation for that I'm not saying your motivation is wrong

234
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:43,640
because of that but start looking more deeply so is it truthful can you be truthful

235
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:48,680
what motivates any kind of

236
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,540
moving away from the really clear simple truthful statement

237
00:43:54,540 --> 00:44:00,260
so um it's a great practice

238
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:05,339
and you might after do after maybe before you go to sleep or at some point

239
00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:10,980
at the end of the day near the end of the day just review

240
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:16,020
what you've talked about through the day and review it little bit for this

241
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:21,300
question of truth how truthful was I today and where might I have been where

242
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:28,440
could I have been more truthful where could I have been wiser about how I spoke the truth where was I

243
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:35,460
kind of twisting the truth a little bit and why sometimes it's hard to do this exercise

244
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:43,260
in the you know live in the present moment as we're speaking but sometimes reviewing it can really help us to see

245
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:49,619
what's going on and I offer you this not as a not so

246
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:56,520
that the you know highlights something bad about

247
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:02,480
yourself but really to highlight your capacity to grow and develop and learn

248
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:09,839
and heal some deep way Within it's a powerful thing to speak the truth

249
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:17,160
and um I've I've found it amazing what opens up and what opens up in

250
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:23,400
relationships when we learn the art of truth-telling but it is an art and it

251
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:31,200
takes a while to to learn that skill and it's a skill well well worth learning

252
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,300
so thank you very much
