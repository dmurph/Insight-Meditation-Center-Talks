1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:06,779
so uh so welcome welcome folks

2
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:15,500
um yeah it's good to uh good to be with you

3
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,960
um

4
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:31,880
yeah that's um go go right into uh the silence

5
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:14,940
so maybe you um

6
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:21,379
Begin by relaxing or maybe you begin by

7
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,459
um becoming sensitive more sensitive

8
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:32,420
to goodness

9
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:46,140
to the goodness of your intention goodness

10
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,040
of the Sangha

11
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,500
what is good in each of us

12
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,620
part of practice is becoming a

13
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:25,159
moved by goodness so maybe that's a good way to begin

14
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:35,959
help us inhabit this moment more fully

15
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:44,959
just settle in in whatever way you settle in these first few minutes

16
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:09,720
yesterday I was meditating outside

17
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:17,699
and uh in the distance someone was practicing

18
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:24,440
bagpipes and when you're meditating

19
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:33,500
bagpipes are very very funny

20
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:43,760
and you may not have the benefit of bad wipes in your sound space

21
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:53,100
but there's something to hear so maybe

22
00:08:53,100 --> 00:09:00,320
well explore outer sound and then inner sound

23
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:08,480
so first just anchoring attention to this soundscape

24
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,940
the ambient noises of your space

25
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,620
because we tend to subtly image

26
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,899
the the objects uh

27
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:13,920
from which sound emerges

28
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:22,260
then we image those in a kind of uh location

29
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,839
in the theater of our own minds

30
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,839
the sense of um

31
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,860
spaciousness

32
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,839
the openness of our mind

33
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,680
to just listening for sounds will will tend to focus on

34
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:09,260
near sounds the beginning of sounds

35
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:16,160
loud sounds but here we honor

36
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:21,660
sounds from the distance sounds

37
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,360
that are faint sounds when they end in

38
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,680
addition to when they begin

39
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:28,100
it's as if we allow the sounds to run

40
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:36,000
through us like uh a gust of of wind that is not

41
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,839
trapped inside of us it just blows through

42
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,060
nor hope and our fear

43
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,139
trap phenomena

44
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:09,540
or grasping and aversion what we like just like

45
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:16,079
about the sound or that traps the phenomena in the headquarters

46
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:21,860
of self and we chew on it

47
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:36,260
but instead in our practice

48
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,339
we practice

49
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,639
vetting sound

50
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:50,839
run right through

51
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:10,160
in this uh awareness of the soundscape we can also

52
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:16,760
include our own verbal thinking

53
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:21,200
Julie we just call it thinking

54
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:30,000
and usually we don't hear it in the sense of knowing thinking

55
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,520
as thinking we don't hear the phenomena

56
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,080
of verbal thought

57
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:49,940
we are just identified with it and obey

58
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:05,760
and so now they awareness it feels almost as if it's

59
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:13,799
poised perched listening for the arising of auditory

60
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:16,460
thinking

61
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:26,059
and it's generally true that audit the the awareness will

62
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:31,140
disrupt auditory thinking the presence of awareness

63
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:38,900
means that we can't be fully identified with the content of our thought

64
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:52,080
but we listen as we can for the words and sentences for the

65
00:21:52,080 --> 00:22:00,240
chatter for the embryonic auditory thoughts

66
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:06,380
the thoughts that seem to beg us to think them

67
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:25,320
so now we're vetting the the uh attuning to the

68
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:32,240
soundscape as it runs right through our own heads

69
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:05,600
in a way we we practice uh not treating

70
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:12,559
thoughts as some special species of sound

71
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,919
but uh in the same category

72
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:31,919
as the the birds

73
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:39,679
the garbage truck and the neighbors

74
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,799
foreign

75
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,039
foreign

76
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,940
foreign

77
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:43,860
this summer summer before uh September 11 2001 was reading I remember

78
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:50,399
reading a book um that um it was called

79
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:58,320
um I think happiness death and the remainder of life and um

80
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:03,899
what I remember about it was the the basic premise is that life is lived

81
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:10,940
under conditions of too much too much

82
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:16,980
capture something important too much

83
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:23,340
energy in our system and we need to discharge it too much

84
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:28,799
coming at us we're besieged by samsara

85
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:36,539
by this realm of existence too much I want to get done too much

86
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:43,500
I need to worry about too much to let go of too much

87
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:50,039
and it strikes me that maybe maybe too much

88
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:55,580
is a is a kind of synonym for dukkha

89
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:06,240
in the sense of too much necessitates if we're to be happy we we need to find

90
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,500
ways to turn down the dial on our nervous system

91
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:16,860
[Music] and it's over stimulation the sense of

92
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:22,559
too much and the the Dharma is a kind of

93
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:30,659
dialectic between um between peace and what I spoke about

94
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:38,399
yesterday purification between uh tranquility

95
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:44,880
and letting the world rush into our heart and um

96
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:52,320
and without Tranquility the Letting Go the purification the opening to Duke uh

97
00:33:52,320 --> 00:34:00,260
all of it feels like too much and you see how

98
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:07,260
desperate we are to dial things down in some way to

99
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:12,599
um yeah to turn down the nervous system and

100
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:20,179
kind of seek out that that Cocoon of unconsciousness where we're not being

101
00:34:20,419 --> 00:34:27,358
stimulated in a way that creates the sense of too muchness it's kind of yeah

102
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:32,520
cocoon and um

103
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:39,118
and so we we do a lot to kind of like

104
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:44,158
create that Cocoon of unconsciousness

105
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:52,220
to insulate ourselves from the intensity and um

106
00:34:53,159 --> 00:35:01,020
and I'm sympathetic to the the impulse of doing all that we do

107
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:06,720
to dial down the nervous system but the Dharma Dharma celebrates a kind of

108
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:14,280
Tranquility that is alive rather than dissociated it's not the the

109
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:19,500
the peace or seclusion of the the infinite

110
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:26,220
scroll but it's a kind of alive form of Tranquility

111
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:31,619
and so part of the Dharma and part of Dharma pleasure is

112
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:40,579
um learning the the ways that we come to rest yeah way as we come to rest

113
00:35:40,579 --> 00:35:47,940
ways that our Dharma practice allows us to

114
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:54,599
to rest and so we rest

115
00:35:54,599 --> 00:36:01,320
in a number of ways we seek out spiritual friends

116
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:07,500
with whom our heart can relax now we call that Sangha

117
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:14,339
it is soothing it's soothing or so

118
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:20,400
so porous and just to be around

119
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:29,940
people trying to to live a life of wisdom and care

120
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:36,359
um that's not trivial that's not trivial that allows us to begin to relax some of

121
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:41,940
our vigilance were were

122
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:47,900
um were reassured by by the the lineage

123
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:54,540
that that so many of so many have come before us

124
00:36:54,540 --> 00:37:00,359
walk this path profitably and um

125
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:06,119
there's uh there's a certain kind of soothing in knowing this

126
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:11,940
I remember on the first night of a retreat uh Michelle McDonald was

127
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:19,079
teaching and she said something like the first night of retreat I think it was a two-week or ten

128
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:24,720
day Retreat or something she said the first night of retreat is um

129
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:30,900
is all about reassurance yeah and then she repeated the word you know

130
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:36,839
and said something like just that word reassurance

131
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:44,420
something in his lungs for that and you can kind of feel the room just let down a little

132
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:55,680
we learn practices ways of of um directing our attention maybe we say

133
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:02,520
meditating but not just meditating but we'd learn ways of attending that naturally brings

134
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:08,280
a soothing and um

135
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:19,160
some of it is as simple as just attending to phenomena that bring calm stability

136
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:27,480
on a suit uh when when one's mind is possessed by restlessness overpowered by

137
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:34,020
restlessness one not cannot properly see the Escape from restlessness one does not properly

138
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:43,380
understand one's own welfare nor that of another there's unrest of Mind frequently giving unwise attention to it

139
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:48,980
that is the nourishment for the arising of restlessness

140
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:55,339
unwise attention to the sign of restlessness

141
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:04,260
so what aspects of experience what signs are useful to attend to what brings a sense of

142
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:10,500
seclusion protection tranquility

143
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:19,079
and as this process unfolds and we do start to settle and we can start to

144
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:26,400
settle even when we're not quote concentrated you know it's like can start to sense like oh yes something in

145
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:32,339
you is resting even when

146
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:40,920
there's a lot of discursive thinking and then just to rest there is is very

147
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:48,599
healing because um life doesn't feel like too much

148
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:52,099
in that wrath

149
00:39:55,859 --> 00:40:01,079
and we rest in we rest in a certain rest

150
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:05,720
maybe we say in the truth of The Human Condition

151
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:12,720
um in a sense because we've

152
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:19,280
we've deeply contemplated um

153
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:25,200
a Nietzsche impermanence uncertainty we've deeply

154
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:31,800
contemplated dissolution and and death

155
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:37,079
um change doesn't come as such a shock to

156
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:44,180
the system in a sense maybe we say that we

157
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:51,359
we pre-grieve all of the inevitable losses of Being

158
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:58,680
Human yeah and that's different than fretting about

159
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:06,240
it all but we we sort of pre-grieve

160
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:15,180
Leonard Cohen said um I I don't consider myself a pessimist I think of a

161
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:23,420
pessimist as someone waiting for it to rain and I feel soaked to the skin

162
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:34,880
it's said that um that anxiety is the intolerance of uncertainty

163
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:41,480
anxiety is the intolerance of uncertainty

164
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:49,040
but were already soaked to the skin

165
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:56,720
there's no uncertainty

166
00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:03,960
the famous Parable that uh Jack cornfield recounted and in his

167
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:11,880
encountered with Arjun chav uh holding up uh you know holding up a mug or something and saying like uh uh this

168
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:20,760
this cup is already broken yeah because I know it's broken I can enjoy it now yeah

169
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:26,760
cup is already broken I know it's nature nature is the break

170
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:34,160
and because I know it's broken my heart won't break when it does yeah

171
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:43,079
the corollary uh of uh that this cup this cup is is

172
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:48,660
already broken um the corollary there are many

173
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:54,680
corollaries of that but um

174
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:04,680
that includes that uh this cup is already broken

175
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:11,579
um already dead yeah this land is already

176
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:16,640
gone all is already lost

177
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,700
and um

178
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:33,140
that doesn't flatten the heart yeah but um

179
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:38,780
actually um

180
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:47,579
can create some sense of of rest because we're not gaming out some Sarah

181
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:53,280
anymore we know how this story ends and there's

182
00:43:53,280 --> 00:44:00,000
a certain measure of Peace we pre-grieve the inevitable losses

183
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:06,740
of Being Human and uh

184
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:13,099
then we can rest more deeply

185
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:21,318
and also love more deeply

00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:34,619
