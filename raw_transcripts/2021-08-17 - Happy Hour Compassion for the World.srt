00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:02,240
so hello and welcome everyone wonderful to be with you and see you

38
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:10,399
so for today's practice i'd like to invite us to

39
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:17,040
engage with the practice of compassion today compassion for the world compassion for

40
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:24,000
others especially what with what has been happening on the world stage

41
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:32,639
um the past few days ah with the catastrophes internationally

42
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:38,160
just to name a few of course there's afghanistan um

43
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,920
and there is haiti also with not just the

44
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,920
earthquake but also the weather now there the storm so

45
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:57,519
just a heavy heart so much suffering so much suffering around the world

46
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,600
and with the practice of compassion the practice of compassion especially in the

47
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,720
way that i like to invite us to engage with tonight

48
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:14,959
compassion supports us to meet suffering to be with suffering whether it's ours

49
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:20,959
or others to meet it not to

50
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,800
drown in it not to drown in the heartache that

51
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:36,000
is not compassion that's [Music] basically overwhelm that's grief

52
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:43,839
empathic distress is another word for it whereas compassion is where we meet

53
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:49,360
suffering ours or others with care with with

54
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:57,040
kindness with sense of stability with an equanimity that's

55
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:03,440
loving that's caring so we can hold presence we cannot be present

56
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:10,560
can hold presence for what might be painful difficult something that we cannot change and yet

57
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,320
we don't turn our face away that oh yes somebody else's problem

58
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,480
but we stay we hold presence we hold we are present

59
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:30,000
with with the suffering whether it's ours or others without pushing it under

60
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,360
the proverbial carpet and it brings a sense of

61
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,279
strength strength in the heart strength in the heart

62
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:46,560
and compassion is different from empathy

63
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,480
empathy is only read the resonance resonating

64
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,600
with suffering so in some in one way we can think of it if we think of the

65
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:04,000
paradigm the say the neuroscience paradigm it's just the mirror neurons resonating and it

66
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,560
turns out that so that is really the aspect of when you feel empathic oh yes somebody hurts and

67
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:17,040
you feel pain with them and their studies their research studies that actually when you see someone suffering

68
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,959
oh the same areas in your brain that that experience physical pain light up

69
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,519
so empathy alone is not compassion

70
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:36,800
what is compassion is empathy plus meta plus loving kindness plus care plus this

71
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:43,440
feeling of warmth that i care i am present for you with you breathing with you

72
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,880
um holding so it's both it's not just empathy alone and it'll become more

73
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,560
clear in the guided meditation as i will invite you and at any point if you find

74
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:00,399
yourself in empathic distress know that empathy alone just feeling the

75
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:07,038
pain without meta to balance it can fall into empathic distress so my invitation will

76
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:13,600
be at that point to stop and bring compassion bring care to yourself

77
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,720
because in that moment you're the one who's suffering so again

78
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,760
if at any point you find your empathic distress and overwhelm in grief

79
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,440
stop compassion for others turn compassion compassionate gaze to

80
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,720
yourself so that you have enough stability

81
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:40,160
and at that point you can turn back out or maybe just stay with yourself so so

82
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:46,640
know what is best for you what is best for you so the particular practice

83
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:53,760
actually you know i won't say anymore i'll just lead you into whatever you need to know and whether this is your

84
00:17:53,760 --> 00:18:00,960
first time or a hundredth time uh in happy hour whatever you need to know will be shared with you

85
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:08,320
during this guided meditation okay so trust trust yourself trust the practice and

86
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,360
again if at any point it becomes painful and general challenging turn compassion

87
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:21,600
to yourself just remember that okay all right so with that let's begin

88
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:28,440
let's begin our practice formally

89
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,160
landing landing in this body

90
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,240
landing in this moment

91
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:01,200
as always we begin we begin by just arriving

92
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:08,080
letting go of any thoughts stories expectations

93
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:15,600
and just landing landing in this body in this moment in time

94
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,039
inviting awareness to connect

95
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,320
with the sensations of your feet

96
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:39,200
connected to the earth of your sit bones

97
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,919
your bottom connected to the earth

98
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,960
with each breath

99
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:59,320
ah landing landing connecting more deeply

100
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,600
feeling your feet

101
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:26,080
your lower legs you're sitting on the cushion your bottom

102
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:34,720
the contact points all the contact points feeling them

103
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:42,159
more and more to feel solidly connected embodied

104
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,120
well rooted to the earth

105
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,200
feeling your hands

106
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,799
feeling your lower abdomen

107
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,720
expanding and contracting with each breath

108
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,399
on its own

109
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:48,280
each breath breathed each breath breathed on its own

110
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:04,080
the breath has been breathing itself breathing you for all this time so don't make it effortful

111
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:09,840
let it flow just as it has been flowing all this time

112
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,320
just simply notice

113
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,240
the movement

114
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:38,679
of the abdomen the breath received

115
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:51,200
as if the body becomes more and more

116
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,720
alive more present

117
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,799
more settled more relaxed

118
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,120
through each breath

119
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:16,559
i'd like to invite you to imagine the breath as if the breath

120
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:25,919
is being received naturally on its own through the middle of your chest

121
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,158
the peripheral heart center

122
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:39,279
middle of the chest as if the breath was entered and with

123
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:46,640
each breath received this capacity of care

124
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:54,279
of warm-heartedness friendliness kindness

125
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:12,880
is breathed into enlivened

126
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:19,360
again not so much that you are doing it but i know

127
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,080
there is friendliness here already

128
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,000
as if the breath is bellowing bellowing

129
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:44,399
on the embers on the fire making it bigger

130
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,320
it's just happening on its own

131
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:58,799
as much as it's available right now just witnessing

132
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:04,279
letting the breath be received gently

133
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,480
might be a little tiny fire and that's okay

134
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,159
few more minutes allowing the breath

135
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:45,520
to be received from the art center bellowing throughout your whole body

136
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:53,600
calming settling letting go of whatever is not needed

137
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,720
whatever is not necessary

138
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:05,520
if thoughts are not necessary right now letting them go thank you

139
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,679
not needed right now please come back later

140
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,480
me

141
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,039
coming back here just here

142
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,240
and now

143
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:51,039
imagining imagining that your heart center

144
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,240
middle of your chest

145
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:09,440
is this holy fire

146
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:17,080
holy fire of love of care of compassion

147
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:25,919
that is both yours and is not yours it's not personal

148
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:36,028
it's holy fire of universal compassion [Music]

149
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:47,000
burning brightly beautifully

150
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,200
in your heart

151
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:10,480
as if it were a gift a gift from the beyond the gift of grace

152
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:16,960
ah it's not mine it's just here

153
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:26,480
it's part of being human breathing breathing with

154
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:34,120
breathing with holy fire this holy fire of compassion

155
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,080
and imagine that with each out breath

156
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:58,240
each out breath breathed out of your heart center

157
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:07,279
each out breath carries

158
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:12,640
this goodness good will of compassion

159
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:17,120
shining shining the light

160
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:25,640
onto the entire world yourself

161
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,158
and all beings who are suffering

162
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:48,320
and the out breath brings them comfort soothes

163
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:53,840

187
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:23,359
bit of courage not to turn away to hold witness

188

you can turn the compassion care love meta to yourself

205
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:09,760
you can also lean more into the care to the warmth

206
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:16,480
to the good will for others instead of leaning into the suffering

207
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:22,920
lean more into the good will to balance

208
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:40,920

to breathe with to breathe with the times

213
00:47:55,119 --> 00:48:01,920
when there is nothing else within

214
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:08,880
our ability or power to do to forget to hold witness and breathe

215
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,880
with

216
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:44,480
to breathe to breathe with those who are suffering which can include ourselves

217
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:51,040
breathing with the pain

218
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:07,720
letting the sorrow be breathing out care compassion

219
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:08,040
for the last moments of this practice period

220
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:19,760
connecting with the compassion the care for yourself

221
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:25,920
and all beings whatever this period of practice was

222
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:31,119
like whether it was distracted sleepy

223
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:36,800
whether there was falling into empathic distress sadness

224
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:45,359
grief it's all okay it's all okay it's all okay you tried you showed up

225
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:50,079
you did your best to align

226
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:58,400
your actions the training of your mind with your

227
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:04,960
intentions and now letting go letting go of the rest

228
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:12,559
letting go of what you cannot control given all the causes and conditions that

229
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:15,440
have come before

230
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:23,720
may all beings be well

231
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:31,720
may all beings be free from suffering including ourselves

232
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:37,659
[Music]

233
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:51,800
thank you all for your practice

234
00:51:55,599 --> 00:52:02,000
so the practice today was

235
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:10,160
the practice of tongue length compassion as it's practiced in the way of tongue length to

236
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:15,119
the practice in tibetan buddhism

237
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:21,839
breathing in sorrow letting it be transformed breathing it out it's a

238
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:29,359
different way of doing compassion than we tend to usually do and also i try to bring in

239
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:34,720
and and to say that tonglen can often be a very challenging practice

240
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:40,079
so however it was for you whether it was challenging it's okay it's okay it's

241
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:46,559
okay you showed up you tried i also in this practice i brought a

242
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:54,480
little bit of equanimity practice which is being with holding witness when

243
00:52:54,480 --> 00:53:01,760
when causes and conditions are above and beyond our control to acknowledge that and acknowledge the

244
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:08,160
being with holding presence and trying to have a bird's-eye view

245
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:13,480

284
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:52,480

after tuning into into to it somehow beautiful great i

290

then bring in this reflection of this holy fire that the breathing it happens on its own this this holy fire of

293
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:45,040
compassion in some ways it is yours and in some ways not so letting it just as if you're witnessing as if you're

294
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:50,640
witnessing something so i'm delighted to hear that that happened one more reflection i discovered

295
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:55,680
how to have compassion for myself beautiful thank you for that and neil i

296
00:58:55,680 --> 00:59:00,960
see your hand please first of all i really appreciated this

297
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:08,079
it was great timing how do you remember that you know in particular in afghanistan that you know

298
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:14,079
despite all the terrors that are happening there are people deserving of your love on both sides of that

299
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:19,200
yeah absolutely um

300
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:24,880
i'm so glad you brought this up um

301
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:32,799
i'll share something with you from my own practice that came up for me tonight because as as i was practicing for the

302
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:38,720
terror of so many people who are scared so many people who are scared right now

303
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:45,520
and once i i was also seeing the other side i was seeing the other side

304
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:51,440
these fighters as children because at some point they were children

305
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:57,200
and in some ways they are they there's a particular way they see the world

306
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:02,640
and that is causing so much suffering to others and to themselves

307
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:10,559
so and i'm reminded of the in buddhism the root the root of all

308
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:16,880
suffering all all ills in the world are great hatred and

309
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:24,480
confusion or translated as delusion and in fact delusion is the root of greed and hatred

310
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:30,319
delusion really isn't anything but also translated as ignorance but it's

311
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:35,680
not an ignorance of of of not knowing but it's like a not

312
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:43,839
seeing clearly not seeing your true nature not seeing not knowing how particular ways of being

313
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:49,920
causes harm to yourself and causes harm to others it's similar to

314
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:55,520
the um to the prayer of jesus forgive them

315
01:00:55,520 --> 01:01:01,359
father for for the harm they cause i'm paraphrasing as they do not know what

316
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:08,880
they do they do not know what they do so there's a sense of oh they they don't know what they do they

317
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:14,000
saw clearly if they saw without dust in their eyes how the way

318
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:19,119
of being is is causing pain for people for

319
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:25,200
for women children etc it's so in that way my heart can be open to compassion

320
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:30,400
to all sides forgive the father as they do not know what they do

321
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:37,359
so [Music] this is what comes up for me neil and i offer it

322
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:44,240
as a reflection to you thank you thank you

323
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:54,400
