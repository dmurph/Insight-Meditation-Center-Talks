1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,919
so uh I thought of starting uh this talk with a

2
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:11,240
warning and um so that uh because I'm going to say

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:19,000
something that U some people immediately turn off so just pay

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,400
attention and just get through this um so I'm going to introduce to you

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:33,520
a poly word ancient Buddhist word so some people as soon as they hear the poly is going to be spoken or this with

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,600
ancient words they okay this is not for me but this word is maybe in my mind

7
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,520
maybe the most important word to learn if you want to understand the Buddhism

8
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,559
and little bit the ancient language and uh what's important about this word

9
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,800
reason to use the ancient language version of it is that there's no one

10
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,519
English word that translates it and uh because the word can mean a

11
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:09,200
variety of things in English but the two main ones in some contexts it means

12
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:16,320
wholesome in some context it means skillful and it's little not so clear

13
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:23,040
which of these contexts and you know or which translation so some people just

14
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,680
leave leave it leave it untranslated and uh we might also just

15
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:35,159
use a a two words wholesome skillfulness or skillful

16
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:42,040
wholesomeness so the word is cusa k u s a l

17
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:50,040
a and uh the the the concept of it or the experience of it the the Attunement

18
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:56,320
to what is skillful and unskillful wholesome and UNH wholesome lays at the

19
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,759
heart of what Buddhism has to teach all of Buddhism flows from this

20
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:12,680
particular concept this particular Human Experience and um and so as a way of

21
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:22,120
beginning to introduce it more I would like to use a simile and the simile is that of a horse

22
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:29,440
whisperer and uh so a horse whisperer is someone who trains horses usually and uh

23
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:36,879
it's in the in the field of what's called natural horsemanship so where where uh people

24
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:43,440
who sometimes gone into whereas wild horses and living together and uh learn

25
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,800
to uh see how they communicate with each other how they relate to each other and then they come back and they use

26
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,959
positive reinforcement to work with the horse uh where they approach them with

27
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:01,840
great Rapport sensitivity in ways that don't intimidate the horse uh that the

28
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,200
horse feels safe and uh and the horse develops a sense of trust of the person

29
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:14,920
and then there's positive reinforcement where they get trained to communicate with the the human and the human can ask

30
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:21,159
them to do certain things and they're happy to do it and um and there's also

31
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:30,000
similar people they're not called dog whisperers but there are natural forms of um training dogs and um and one of

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,280
the things they have learned with dog training is that and horses as well is

33
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,760
that to use negative reinforcement to use pain for example to train them actually works

34
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,560
faster you can train them quicker but the results in the long term are not as

35
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,599
good and so for example they have military dogs who are they would need to

36
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:58,400
bring into maybe places of great conflict and War perhaps and uh and they

37
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:05,439
found that if they use negative reinforcement to train the dog to do what it has to do the dog becomes uh

38
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,519
chronically anxious and that anxiety doesn't serve

39
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:16,359
the dog well in a conflict situation but if they use positive reinforcement the

40
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:23,120
dog has certain kind of confidence and doesn't have the anxiety and so you know can go into the

41
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:30,479
conflictive uh sit situations and remain confident and more responsive in a good way I suppose I don't know if

42
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:36,160
that was the best example but uh still this idea of so so

43
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:43,400
to uh someone who's a horse whisper or has this kind of really has to have a rapport and feel and sense what's going

44
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:48,800
on Buddhism is similar and Buddhism is

45
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:55,000
asking you to be a self Whisperer and uh and I don't know all

46
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,320
your names but if I could I would go around the room and say each of your

47
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:06,440
names and like sveta is sitting right up in front here so I know her and uh so uh

48
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:12,199
sveta is supposed to become aeta Whisperer an Alex an Alex

49
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:18,759
Whisperer and uh and so for each of you to become your own Whisperer meaning

50
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:25,120
that you develop a report a sensitivity that your inner life trusts

51
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:31,840
you that when you approach and come in you are there to read the person that

52
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,720
you are in some deeper way than you would if you show up with your regular

53
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:44,600
Concepts your anxiety your hostility your CR self-criticism there's all kinds of ways

54
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,960
that we approach ourselves that um whatever way we approach ourselves we

55
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:56,280
are training ourselves that's the kind of one of the principles of Buddhism that whatever way

56
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:02,120
we live our life whatever way we speak whatever way we Act even how we think

57
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:09,479
that has an influence on us it's in classic Buddhist language it's called conditioning we are conditioning

58
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:16,160
ourselves and um and if we're a self- Whisperer we're paying attention to

59
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,800
what's being conditioned we're paying attention to what what the consequences

60
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:28,199
are as we go about our life and we care about that and we notice a difference

61
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:35,400
between an effect an influence it has on our body heart and mind that is UNH

62
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:42,560
wholesome unskillful and uh or one that is skillful and wholesome and being able to

63
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:49,120
read ourselves really well in this way guides Us in how we find the Buddhist

64
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:55,240
path and in fact the goal in Buddhism is for you to become your own

65
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:00,960
teacher and how do you do that by being able to read yourself for listen to

66
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,440
yourself uh really well so become a self- Whisperer then you'll find your

67
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,840
way and you don't have to impose on yourself Buddhist beliefs you don't have

68
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:19,479
to impose on yourself Buddhist ideas of what you should be doing Buddhism would rather have you uh understand this

69
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:26,199
principle this way of being a horse whisperer so that what guides you is

70
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:32,440
wholesomeness what guides you is uh so when it's translated as wholesomeness

71
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:40,919
the word cusa uh I sometimes associate that associated with health so uh so we're

72
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:47,319
doing that which is Health producing and maybe not physical health which is a little bit more complicated but

73
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:53,599
certainly psychological Health uh Inner Health for our inner inner

74
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,039
well-being mental health that we're cultivating so is what I'm doing healthy

75
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:05,199
or not healthy would be the question is um another word I associate

76
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:13,680
with this word cusa is uh nourishing does it nourish us or does it dourish us

77
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,879
and all these things are things we can feel and sense and a lot of it is being sensing

78
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:25,800
it in our own body and uh and so the body provides the

79
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:32,479
evidence for what is nourishing what is wholesome not uh some abstract idea of

80
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:38,680
morality occasionally the word wholesome has uh ethical connotations and people

81
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:44,080
think it means you know some uh following some rules of right and wrong

82
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,240
good and bad and there's something like that in Buddhism perhaps it's Not absent

83
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:56,160
of that but the core thing is the uh evaluation for ethics and Buddhism is

84
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:03,360
not kind of the moral principles but rather are the wholesome reference points inside of ourselves for what is

85
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,399
wholesome and what is not wholesome and um and so that becomes the

86
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,680
source of our ethics as uh when we see the consequences for

87
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,640
ourselves and so to be to be a horse whisperer person Whisperer for ourselves

88
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:25,360
means to pay attention to the body signals just like I think a horse

89
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:32,720
whisperer really pay attention to a body language and how it affects the horse the body language of the human and also

90
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,240
the body language of the animal so our body language what's happening in our

91
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:45,800
body where is their tension where's there tightness where's there uh anxious energy where does the focus of attention

92
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:53,399
come what's activated in our body uh where does the body start feeling more relaxed and softer where does the body

93
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:58,680
behave in feel and to behave in good ways that feel nourishing feel wholesome

94
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:04,480
feel healthy and um and so for some people that's a

95
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:12,200
huge uh challenge to use their own body as a reference point some people uh have

96
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:17,640
don't have never had any practice with doing that they have a lot of practices with paying attention to what's on a

97
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:23,040
screen and so that's you know everything should be there and and uh and that's

98
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,720
how we learn and change by what's on the screen but uh reading things and hearing

99
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:35,959
things and but uh but uh and some people the body is a very difficult place to be there's

100
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:42,560
a lot of pain um physical pain sometimes psychological pain uh in the body that

101
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:52,000
makes it hard to drop in there and then uh so it's sometimes for example it's like um you know these the dog and horse

102
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,839
trainers have to work with traumatized dogs traumatized horses and so there's a

103
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:03,200
whole skill in how to approach someone who has that kind of issue and so for

104
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,440
oneself how do we approach ourselves when it's traumatizing to touch into our

105
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,880
inner life and to our body what kind of care how do we help this inner Life

106
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:21,200
Trust ourselves trust us it's okay for us to approach do we have to approach from a distance I saw a photograph once

107
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:28,360
of a a person who was I guess a horse whisperer I guess uh approaching maybe

108
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:35,320
um horse who was part of a wild pack of horses and um and she was uh crouched

109
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:42,200
down she bent down so to clearly not be a threatening presence and you could see

110
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,639
that the photograph of the horse is coming over to her with its head down because her head was so low comeing

111
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:53,800
close to check her out and um so how how do you approach yourself with what kind

112
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:59,279
of compassion and Care gentleness so that what's in there trusts showing it

113
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,760
self to you so wholesomeness skillfulness is also a

114
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:13,000
nice translation because it emphasizes that it's a skill to develop and um and uh I'm fond of the

115
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,560
idea that when a crafts person is learning a craft and they become skilled

116
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:25,440
at it they're learning how like a like a Potter can can you know on a wheel can

117
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,920
make pots and that's a a skill to learn and a craft to learn as they're learning

118
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:39,000
the craft of making the bow the crafts person is crafting themselves they're

119
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:47,360
reshaping themselves they're learning how to move how to sense how to

120
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,320
focus uh how to hold their body how to be attuned to something outside of

121
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:59,399
themselves and how to involv be involved in a reciprocal relationship of self and

122
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:05,240
other self and pot pot and self and uh so there's a change and you can see

123
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:12,000
someone who's really skilled at a craft for example sometimes there's a beauty in watching how they've been shaped and

124
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,760
their movements and their elegance and their Simplicity and their Attunement and I've I've I've watched people who

125
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:26,720
are craft and one of the things that has um moved me is um uh their

126
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:34,079
focus their attention is being right right there and they they can't be too focused they can't be too little focused

127
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:39,560
they have but they have to be right there and they have to track themselves they have to be able to know when

128
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:46,079
they're getting distracted they have to kind of recognize when the mind is drifting away and not so focused or they

129
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:52,519
have to recognize when their mind is interfering by judgments or something and they have to they have to track it

130
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:57,680
enough to be able to maintain just like on the bowl just the right pressure to

131
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,519
make a thin Bowl you know it's a real skill so to be skillful in in uh in

132
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,839
Buddhist practice is uh to is both to shape ourselves and be shaped by the

133
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:17,560
shaping by be shaped by how we do it so here we back to how for wholesomeness we

134
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:22,880
how we approach ourselves is important how we pay attention to ourself how we

135
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:30,560
attend to ourselves so that this inner life can receive positive reinforcement

136
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,720
and with skill again how how do we change how are we impacted by the very

137
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,279
skill how we doing and building a skill not a few Buddhist practitioners have

138
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:50,079
been introduced to meditation and uh and they're may be very competent and capable in the world

139
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:55,720
to get what they want by hard effort and bearing down and uh studying hard and

140
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,800
getting everything and getting you know Furrow and the forehead in the

141
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:08,240
process and so they're ready to do it in the usual way and it doesn't work uh and

142
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,839
uh I've done that where I've tried to use the old way of getting really engaged that I've sometimes engaged

143
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:19,959
before and uh sometimes I got a headache which is not very healthy or wholesome

144
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:25,920
and sometimes uh I I despaired because it didn't work and so there were times

145
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:32,079
where it didn't work so I tried harder that worked even less so of course I tried

146
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:37,639
harder until I just like came to Rock Bottom I was so you know it was so hard

147
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:44,519
for me I was so critical and upset and felt hopeless and uh it was only by reach

148
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:49,680
rock rock bottom that I was able to give up a certain effort and then only then

149
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,759
could I discover a wholesome way to begin doing my meditation

150
00:15:54,759 --> 00:16:00,759
practice so um so there's a uh so part of Buddhism

151
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:06,000
then Buddhist practice is to be able to read yourself or sense yourself or feel

152
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,920
yourself and what are we feeling we're sensing and feeling uh does this feel

153
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:18,639
good in a healthy way does this feel right in a way that feels harmonious

154
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:26,399
with being a connected attuned human being uh it's not becoming sensitive and

155
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:32,240
aware of what we want and and what we don't want in and of itself because that

156
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:38,519
can come from conceit that can come from just greed and attachment we really want to step back

157
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:43,680
and look more deeply and see what is what does it feel like to want what does

158
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,920
it feel like not to want and sometimes we'll see that it comes out of a place that feels quite

159
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:55,199
wholesome feels good we're caring for ourselves and caring for the world and

160
00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:01,079
that caring feels can feel really nice other times it's clear it involves a

161
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:06,240
some place of clinging of being twisted up inside or being contracted or being

162
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,400
tight or where you can really feel that there's an irritation there's a form of

163
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:17,600
suffering in the very effort to um you know to want something and we can see

164
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:25,079
the consequence is not so good on us and so so to read ourselves and feel

165
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:30,280
ourselves and one of the things that why this is so important is we're trying to

166
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:37,240
also break the addictions of the mind uh and not a few meditators have

167
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:43,720
come to I'm not an addict they'll say until they sit down and watch their mind and their thoughts you know are so

168
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:50,320
driven we're so cut up over and over again in same thoughts pulled into the world of thoughts and preoccupations

169
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:56,240
pulled into certain emotions over and over and over again seemingly without being able to control it like something

170
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:04,200
has us uh in its grip and uh and some people are so in the in the midst of

171
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:11,760
anxiety or the midst of resentments or the mist of of um uh complaining and

172
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:17,159
cynicism or all kinds of things and they've been that way for decades that

173
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:23,039
they think this is life as it should be it just like you know you don't even see it because it's like a fish doesn't see

174
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:28,919
the water it's in but as we sit and get quiet in meditation then we start seeing

175
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:35,840
in some of the habits of the mind and some of them are difficult to see some of some of them invol addiction kind of

176
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:42,320
really grabbed and caught in something so the question is what do we

177
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:49,480
do about that that's wholesome what do we do about that that's skillful what do we do about that

178
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:59,000
that something inside of us maybe the very powerful forces of attachments that we can have uh trust us feel it's okay

179
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,280
to come out and be seen maybe there's a kind of maybe not positive reinforcements for being

180
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,760
attached but maybe there's some equivalent of approaching in a way that

181
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:16,320
our attachments don't feel threatened don't feel that they're that we're

182
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:22,520
critical of them or see them as being automatically wrong maybe we approach them with

183
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:30,080
kindness maybe we approach them with gentleness I think these horse Whisperers and dog whisper spers I think

184
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:36,400
kindness and gentleness is one of the Hallmarks of that kind of work so how do we do that for

185
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:42,720
ourselves and uh and some people will protest you that can't be gentle and

186
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,760
tender and and um because we have to be Stern we have

187
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:54,320
to fight and be aggressive to get our way that's the only way we're going to get our

188
00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:00,039
way so that me so you know certainly Buddhist practice will leave you alone

189
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:05,440
to do that but if you're paying careful attention you'll start seeing sooner or

190
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,960
later that this isn't serving that somehow the influence on the system doesn't feel

191
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:18,559
good and that what has a much better influence is care Compassionate Care Friendly care

192
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:25,679
kind kind care care for this person that we are care for all the different ins

193
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,720
and outs of our complicated in inner life H and how do we approach it and how

194
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:38,039
do we cultivate it and develop it and so as I said Buddhism

195
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:45,039
emphasizes the the becoming a skilled at recognizing what is wholesome

196
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:51,120
and UNH wholesome in ourselves and the emphasis is on cultivating the

197
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:58,600
wholesome uh and for people who want to meditate in the classic instructions or classic Model

198
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:04,280
model of Buddhist practice before starting to meditate you would first

199
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:10,400
learn this topic of of this wholesomeness and un wholesomeness you

200
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:18,760
would understand how to navigate through these uh these two major Concepts and

201
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:25,000
you'd learn to avoid what's unhealthy and learn to promote what is healthy

202
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:33,159
there's actually a choice that's being engaged here in Buddhism choosing one over the other and how that's done uh in

203
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:39,080
this classic uh teaching that before becoming um meditating it would

204
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:45,320
be you would learn something about how when there's four four steps

205
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:51,480
that they say um uh when you're doing something

206
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,960
that is harmful to your self or others something UNH wholesome something

207
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:03,880
unskillful stop just stop easier said than done I know but

208
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:11,919
there are some occasional times where you can just stop what you're doing and um and then

209
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:18,600
uh um if if you haven't if you're not doing anything UNH

210
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:25,760
wholesome prevent yourself prevent the UNH wholesome to

211
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:32,320
arise in the future in other words create the conditions in your life so

212
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:39,880
that some of the UNH wholesome behavior that you have won't get triggered so I know for example that uh

213
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:47,640
if I'm uh stressed out I'm more likely to get grumpy and say you know unhelpful

214
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,840
comments to the people I'm with and so it's important not to be

215
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:58,559
stressed is it how easy is it not to be stressed in this life that we're living

216
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:04,080
because isn't that what aren't we just kind of

217
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:11,760
like you know the boss of society is asking so much of us

218
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:17,520
that how can we even think about not being stressed that's just what life is now for some

219
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:23,440
people to give into it means that maybe then we kind of perpetuate the UN

220
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:30,600
wholesome because we had set up the conditions for that to happen how do we cultivate some a way of being that isn't

221
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:36,559
so stressed some people find that meditation helps some people depend on a

222
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:41,679
daily meditation practice it sets the stage for the day so that they're much

223
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:47,720
less likely to to be triggered into the UNH wholesome and a reactive way so so

224
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:54,400
it isn't just a matter of staying in the present moment that Buddhism emphasizes it emphasizes take a good look at the

225
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:01,360
bigger picture of your day of your week of your year of your life and what are the conditions you need to put in place

226
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:07,360
so that you're less likely to be triggered in UNH wholesome

227
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:14,320
ways the third is if you're not doing anything wholesome at

228
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:21,279
all do something wholesome evoke it bring it forth so if

229
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:29,679
you haven't smiled at anyone all day try smiling find a stranger anybody if you

230
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:36,880
can't find a person at least smile at the dog you know or the horse or something

231
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:42,159
you know do something wholesome uh speak in a wholesome way to

232
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:47,320
someone in a way that's nourishing for you that feels good for you that there's

233
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:53,000
a you develop you know a report with a person you're speaking with that's nice

234
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:00,679
uh I'm fond when I go to the supermarket uh to see what kind of Rapport I can have with the checkout Clerk and

235
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:07,679
sometimes they're hardly looking at me and sometimes they're clearly present and available for some kind of human

236
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:15,360
exchange and there sometimes I missed that and I feel bad afterwards wow that person was there and available but I was

237
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:21,559
so involved with my things getting out of there as quickly as I could and U but

238
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:27,799
I tried to have a practice of really seeing can I have a rapport and can I say hello can I check in can I have a

239
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:34,760
conversation and I've had some great conversations with people checkout clerks that um were doing this wonderful

240
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:40,600
work for us and uh and um you know you

241
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:49,480
know in a very just you know in a minute it all takes sometimes and um so do things that are

242
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,720
wholesome uh meditate that's considered to be

243
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:02,360
wholesome but it's possible to meditate unh wholesomely if you spend the whole time rehearsing your

244
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:09,600
resentments but uh can you find a way then to approach the resentful forces

245
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:17,440
that we have in a kind way or approach it with gentleness with quiet approach

246
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:23,720
it as if you're going to be somebody trust trustworthy trusted

247
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:29,760
by the resentment so you can feel and sense what's going on feel the tension

248
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:37,279
in the body feel the difficult energies in the body hold it carefully and so how you're approaching

249
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:44,640
your own challenges if you take a bigger picture at least the how is feels good but what

250
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:51,480
I'm feeling is really difficult so I think one of the wholesome things is to be patient to

251
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:57,679
listen it's very respectful to our inner life to approach it with care with love

252
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:06,000
with tender Ness with gentleness here let me get to know you better let me know you as you do that you're doing two

253
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,200
things just like the Potter is doing two things the Potter is shaping the bowl

254
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,360
and the Potter is shaping themselves so you're beginning to shape

255
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:24,799
or have some positive influence on that part of you that holds the resentment and you're shaping yourself

256
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:30,120
as the person who can do that and as meditation practice gets

257
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:36,440
deeper it's really wonderful to feel the mutuality between

258
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:41,640
how you're shaping something inside of yourself and how in doing so you're

259
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:47,919
shaping yourself at the same time the how the how we're doing

260
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:53,799
something so uh so the Buddha said so then but the reason I wanted to emphasize this so he said there's three

261
00:27:53,799 --> 00:28:00,000
ways so stop prevent the UNH

262
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,360
wholesome uh initiate the wholesome don't wait around till it happens by

263
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:13,880
accident but what I like is uh the last one and the last one um uh in the first

264
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:19,559
three when the Buddha talks about it he only has one verb to describe what you

265
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:25,720
do stop prevent and initiate but the last one has to do with

266
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:31,519
when you find wholesome States wholesome activity going on within you listen to

267
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:34,360
what he says about

268
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:43,919
that for wholesome states that are

269
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:50,640
occurring um one engages one's mind for the

270
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:58,320
continuation non forgetting increase abundance cultivation and

271
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,640
fulfillment of these wholesome States that's a

272
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:10,360
mouthful imagine that and I love the word abundance the idea of abundance not just

273
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:17,480
wholesome but an abundant sense of wholesomeness isn't that isn't is that

274
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:24,039
bad and uh and sometimes people have association with Buddhism that out it's about the four noble truths and we have

275
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:31,240
to suffer better and we have to understand how our our suffering and we have to let go of our clinging and and

276
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:37,279
that's all kind of good and wise and understandable but it's kind of flat

277
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:42,240
like you know suffering and the end of it I mean that's

278
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:49,279
okay but here the message is an abundance of

279
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:55,919
wholesomeness wow really we're allowed to do that in Buddhism I thought it was just about non-attachment let go let go

280
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:01,039
let go yes let go in a wholesome way

281
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:06,600
there's a way of letting go that's so wholesome that you filled with

282
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:12,399
wholesomeness and and I'll get to that in couple of moments again

283
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:17,559
so and then we'll then I'll stop um so

284
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:23,200
um for the continuation so when there's something Hol doing something wholesome

285
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,960
wholesome notice it it feels good for you it's healthy for you

286
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:35,519
um maybe for others too and keep doing it stay close to it and then it says

287
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:42,840
don't forget it don't lose touch with it uh stay in touch so that takes

288
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:50,080
mindfulness to pay attention and then increase it do a little bit more do it more in a

289
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:58,080
Wholesome Way don't do more in an UNH Wholesome Way uh make it abundant cultivate it and

290
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:03,639
bring it to fulfillment so we see that in how the

291
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:09,919
Buddha teaches meditation teaches the path in other ways over and over and over again the way he teaches the

292
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:19,880
Buddhist Meditation path uh is uh with words like uh developing Happiness joy Delight

293
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:26,200
gladness contentment that to understand the wholesome is to understand how to find

294
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:31,480
our way to how to be happy and joyful and

295
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:39,240
content so to just sit and meditating and wishfully hope one day I'll be happy

296
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:45,039
if I just sit here if I just sit enough something something wonderful will happen and I'll

297
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:52,080
be happy because that's what you know and free and free of my suffering it's a little bit magical thinking if you just

298
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:58,760
think that sitting here is going to do it there's also uh

299
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:06,480
uh being a self- Whisperer and sensing and feeling and

300
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:12,200
understanding what you're doing that's wholesome and UNH wholesome what you're

301
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:19,159
doing that's happiness producing where do you find the happiness how do you evoke it maybe

302
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:24,679
you're more happy than you realize maybe there's more opportunities for Joy than

303
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:31,120
you Avail yourself for go out on a nice day now it's blue

304
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:37,600
sky um do you leave here in a hurry to get to the next thing and not notice the

305
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:44,639
nice weather and you know I think it's kind of nice out there I hope I go out and notice and feel some delight and joy

306
00:32:44,639 --> 00:32:53,440
and such a simple thing not only is it just good to do that in Buddhism it's part of a strategy

307
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,720
a skillfulness in trying to cultivate more and more of this

308
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:04,840
so that it it becomes abundant in our lives not polanish not kind of as a

309
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:11,159
pretend that things are all good but rather so that we can really meet the

310
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:17,000
tremendous suffering in our world and our society and sometimes in ourselves

311
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:24,039
in a way that's wholesome and effective and meaningful that's so much more effective to meet it and be with it if

312
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:30,760
we found some way to develop these wholesome good quality ities inside ourselves including

313
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:35,799
happiness that's the that's the skill that's the art of what Buddhism is

314
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:40,840
working with and that's why this word wholesomeness or cusa wholesome

315
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:47,480
skillfulness skillful wholesomeness is so important so my hope is that by in this

316
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,600
talk you'll never need to come back here again you learned everything you need to
