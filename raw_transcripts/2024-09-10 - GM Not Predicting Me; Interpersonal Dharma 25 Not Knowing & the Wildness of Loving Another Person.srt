1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:08,800
okay so uh [Music] welcome uh yeah warm welcome to to all

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:18,600
of you uh I'm Matthew um and

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:25,599
uh yeah let's uh let's let's practice I don't know what we'll do sort of find

4
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:32,960
our way together for

5
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,879
very natural to just keep reiterating our

6
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,759
s effectively to

7
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:31,560
predict Matthew for the next moment to predict yourself your model of

8
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,320
Self in the next

9
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:49,680
Moment One neuroscientist said I predict myself therefore I am

10
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,160
what would it be to be genuinely

11
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:18,680
open to the next moment not overly structuring it with

12
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:25,400
the expectation that I'd be exactly the same

13
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:32,879
person in the next moment e

14
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,200
what kind of openness might we

15
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,840
know if we didn't expect to find

16
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,480
exactly our self in the next moment

17
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:43,120
if we didn't know how we would feel how life would

18
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:02,560
feel if we didn't know who we would

19
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:09,720
be what Stories We would tell

20
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:42,360
you've been humming the story of self for so long

21
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:06,280
and now we know the melody so

22
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,960
well we know when the chorus is

23
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:32,680
coming can we relax all of this for

24
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:24,440
we can't simply direct our attention to our breathing or our body

25
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:33,639
feeling because we bring the and reverberations of that

26
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:39,280
song into the attentional

27
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,960
field so instead we we make uh opaque

28
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,520
what was transparent

29
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,120
the song we've been

30
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:25,560
humming that's just felt like me actually becomes an object of

31
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,560
awareness

32
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,520
we become slightly

33
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:07,400
alienated from every song We Sing of

34
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:14,039
myself every story of

35
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:20,720
me they don't all become false but we just

36
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:28,440
become little fatigued alienated from

37
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
them

38
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
for

39
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
for

40
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,360
e e

41
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,720
we don't fight self with more

42
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:42,000
self we uh to use a phrase from shinzen Yang we love love it to death love the

43
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,079
self to death

44
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:05,560
and this frees us up to pay a different kind of

45
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,800
attention to our

46
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:29,760
breathing somehow less crowded

47
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:38,880
less crowded by the childlike moralism of what we're supposed to

48
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:47,440
be as crowded by the moralism of the story of me the

49
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,120
pros and cons

50
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:06,720
Matthew a crowded by the expectations of what the next moment will be must be

51
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,399
ought to [Music]

52
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:26,160
be as crowded by the kind of Baseline

53
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,160
Assumption of what my life feels like

54
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:35,279
who I'll be in the next

55
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:55,440
moment and so we surrender into our

56
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
breathing

57
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
e

58
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
e

59
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

60
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
e

61
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

62
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

63
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

64
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

65
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,880
e e

66
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:07,840
we tend to put this moment on

67
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,240
autocomplete like the SS being

68
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:26,840
finished in a text message except it's our life

69
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:43,200
so we're relaxing some of

70
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:49,080
the predictive business

71
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:09,840
becoming more intimate with our

72
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
breathing

73
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
for

74
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

75
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

76
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

77
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

78
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

79
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

80
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

81
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

82
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,360
e e

83
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,039
we can't make our home in a in a

84
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:22,559
story story of self or any other story for that matter

85
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:39,039
no Story withstands the test of

86
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:52,880
time and so we become awake if we make a home for ourselves at

87
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:58,880
all it's in that wakefulness

88
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:13,039
these last few minutes just becoming

89
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:20,600
globally awake to the phenomena that we call our

90
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,440
life internal

91
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,278
external e

92
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:06,320
not trying to take up a vantage point anywhere

93
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:25,919
particular just opening to the

94
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
space

95
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,120
for

96
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,120
e

97
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,080
e e

98
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
e

99
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:41,320
okay thank you uh thank you good to practice with you

100
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:52,880
um so who this uh theme of um interpersonal life Dharma

101
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:59,159
and interpersonal life and the question who Who Am I who

102
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:06,399
am I we uh uh don't often explicitly ask that

103
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:12,639
question but it it's a question that has a venerated spiritual

104
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:21,120
history and every answer we might give

105
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:28,639
feels a least a little wrong somehow

106
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:33,120
inadequate or incomplete or

107
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:40,760
inauthentic and in our alienation we we have

108
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:47,760
uh an answer you know who am

109
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:53,600
I and before the Mind actually reaches for an answer it stops and it creates a

110
00:31:53,600 --> 00:32:01,840
certain kind of Wonder and mystery and we come on this path to love

111
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:09,360
becoming mysterious to ourselves that that kind

112
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:16,760
of moment when the familiar all too familiar autobiography just kind of

113
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:24,000
peels open you know that feeling it's

114
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:32,559
um scares me a little bit but uh Delights me and livens me

115
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:39,760
too and sometimes I say that uh sincerity sincerity spiritual

116
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,880
sincerity is the willingness to be

117
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:51,039
surprised but our tendency of course is to get to

118
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:56,480
knowing to knowing about ourselves about

119
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:02,480
others and interpersonal practice you know this

120
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:08,279
realm is about knowing but it's also about not

121
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:13,799
knowing it's about knowing it's about empathy knowing the

122
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:19,480
inner life of others right sometimes described as

123
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:24,760
theory of mind or in the psychoanalytic literature

124
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:31,279
mentalization being able to richly ACC accurately model the inner life of the

125
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:38,519
other and sometimes if a person has dealt with a lot of misattunement

126
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:43,919
maybe um uh a parent or something that

127
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:50,519
that simply just could not understand the child's inner life capacity for

128
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:56,000
mentalization is is compromised we almost come to an understanding of our

129
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,039
inner life colle collaboratively and when that's that's

130
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:07,840
not there this capacity for mentalization this deep empathic

131
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:15,919
capacity can be compromised and so sometimes we have to ret ourself something we have to learn

132
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:22,480
ourself in a new way and mindfulness is a kind of self-directed

133
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:30,280
empathy we uh we learn we learn a lot about what

134
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:35,800
it's like to be human what it's like to be incarnated in this

135
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:41,720
life and we through that process we become dramatically more attuned to the

136
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:47,358
feelings and needs the beliefs the action

137
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:59,640
Tendencies of uh of others we become more attuned to our our impact on others

138
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:06,400
and so you could say a lot of the way that into Dharma practice functions we

139
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:15,039
become more more knowing empath empathy is a kind of knowing

140
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:24,280
understanding but as the the uh Zen story that I'm fond of quoting says not

141
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:30,079
knowing is most intimate not knowing is most intimate the

142
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:35,160
practice is also about not

143
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:43,359
knowing uh Simon ve said uh I I am also other than

144
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:49,160
what I imagine myself to be to know this is

145
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:55,359
forgiveness often other than what I imagine myself also other than what I

146
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:59,640
imagine myself to be to know this is

147
00:36:01,319 --> 00:36:07,599
forgiveness I was very very curious with that to know this is

148
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:13,319
forgiveness and perhaps it's only in our knowing in the kind of

149
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:18,920
overdetermined model we have of ourselves our certainty it's only in

150
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:26,599
that that we can truly indict ourselves and to know that we are also

151
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:32,359
something other it opens the space of

152
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:37,200
some of not knowing of

153
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:45,880
forgiveness and the child the parent the the spouse the partner the the best

154
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:51,200
friend forever they they are also other than

155
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:57,920
what we imagine them to be to know this is forgiveness

156
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:07,119
yeah so maybe you know the experience it

157
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:15,280
happens kind of most often with those we we know most those we love

158
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:21,960
most but over the years we we become so familiar with them that at some point we

159
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:30,200
actually stop looking at them and the sanctity of our tension becomes

160
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:38,599
degraded they become buried behind a wall of Concepts and the

161
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:49,359
concepts sometimes feel so thick that it's like I cannot reach you I cannot reach

162
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:58,079
you and sometimes maybe after after years or

163
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:06,078
or even decades we might deeply look at

164
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:16,280
them and ask this question who are you

165
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:23,960
really because we're we're animals and

166
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:32,000
vulnerable and dependent on many conditions and dependent on on in a

167
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,520
sense making life predictable this is our our deep habit

168
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:44,440
not inditing this is um Stephen Stephen

169
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:51,480
Mitchell says um we learn to love in the context of the contrived and necessary

170
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:57,640
safety of early childhood and love seeks perpetually a kind of safety that

171
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:03,760
screens out the unknown but in human relationships safety and

172
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:11,040
predictability are difficult to come by we endlessly strive to reestablish

173
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:18,680
that illusory sense of permanence and predictability when patients and uh he's

174
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:25,359
a psycho you know was a psychoanalyst when patients complain of lifeless

175
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:31,560
relationships it's often possible to show them how precious the deadness is

176
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:37,480
to them how it's carefully maintained and insisted

177
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:43,200
upon Love by its very nature is not

178
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:48,838
secure we keep wanting to make it

179
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:57,640
so so with our our escalating dependence on others

180
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:03,000
we try to make them predictable too we we certain like

181
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:09,240
routinize the connection routinize the love

182
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:19,680
even and how we actually try to connect with uh not knowing the openness of the

183
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:28,079
others being is from uh the Phil br novel The

184
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:34,079
Human Stain about it there's a Classics Professor being described by the

185
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:39,880
narrator uh and the the the

186
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:48,880
uh narrator says um previously concealed was the small popey is T Blue Tattoo

187
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:55,440
situated at the top right arm is of the professor's arm just at the shoulder

188
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:02,400
joining the words US Navy and described between the hook-like arms of a shadowy little anchor and running along the

189
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:09,240
hypotenuse of the deltoid muscle a tiny symbol if one were needed of all the

190
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:14,480
million circumstances of the other fellow's life

191
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:21,680
of that blizzard of details that constitute the confusion of a human

192
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:29,800
biography a tiny symbol to remind me why our understanding in of people must

193
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:35,520
always be at best slightly

194
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,480
wrong at best slightly

195
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:49,000
wrong when we get to knowing and relate to others as a kind of concept we

196
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,160
sacrifice certain intimacy and

197
00:41:54,160 --> 00:42:00,400
spontaneity we we sort of orchestrate a a kind of predictability but that

198
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:08,400
orchestration also leads to a certain kind of flatness and I'm very

199
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:15,079
sympathetic to that I mean how much an Nicha can we take how much can we take

200
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:23,520
it's not adaptive to only ever be focused on

201
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:31,480
groundlessness we need a measure of predictability but that same

202
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:39,920
predictability can muffle the wildness of loving another

203
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,240
person and

204
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:52,559
so we uh we come back to not knowing because we don't wish to ignore the kind

205
00:42:52,559 --> 00:43:00,400
of fullness of the other's experience we get into these um highly

206
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:06,960
choreographed routines with each other and we each play our role with great

207
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:13,559
Fidelity maybe as a way of soothing ourself and soothing the

208
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:19,599
other but then there's this wildness

209
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:27,559
and we want to remember that we know them only in our relation to them we

210
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:34,640
kind of freeze them into a parent or a child or a spouse or

211
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:43,800
whatever and we in essence confuse their role in our life with who they

212
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:50,599
are but they are only that in relation to you to everyone else they are

213
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:57,880
something else and sometimes I

214
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:03,960
glance at someone I love maybe they don't don't even see me looking maybe

215
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:09,280
they're alone ued in a

216
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:15,720
way and there's something very powerful in taking in their

217
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:21,559
being in as it's completely apart from

218
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:28,280
me the role that we play in each other's lives

219
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:34,400
and so we cultivate this reverence for not

220
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:41,720
knowing we put down what is known we attune to the wildness of

221
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:48,800
loving another person so offer this for your

222
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:58,359
consideration and uh please pick up what's useful leave the rest behind and we'll uh we will keep going

223
00:44:58,359 --> 00:45:04,280
uh tomorrow wish you all a good day
