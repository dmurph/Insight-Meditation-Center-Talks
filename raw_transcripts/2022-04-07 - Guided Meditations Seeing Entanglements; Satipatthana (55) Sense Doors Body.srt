00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:09,120
hello everyone and delighted to be here with you and to

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:16,840
greet you all and see many of your greetings in the chat and

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,240
thank you there's a

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,519
fascinating teaching that

5
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:35,280
maybe came from the thai meditation teacher ajahn cha i'm not sure the origin of it

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:43,200
but that is the idea that has to do with sound any kind of sound

7
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,440
and the idea is that sounds never bother us

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,760
but we bother sounds and how i understand that is that

9
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,600
sounds are just uh sounds that go through

10
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,360
but uh the problem the botheredness where we get bothered has to do a lot

11
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,520
has to do with our reaction to it our reactivity and ideas around it

12
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,720
there are exceptions to this of course people are highly sensitive or people or

13
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,720
sounds that are just so glaringly painful that

14
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,560
that it seems like they hurt our ears or other things but generally

15
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:37,920
this idea that sounds uh are kind of neutral

16
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,759
and this is particularly true with the words people speak

17
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:50,320
the meaning of the words might not be neutral but the words as sound

18
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,439
are neutral and somewhere in the

19
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:02,159
ears that hear the sound between the sound and the ears

20
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,959
there's a there's something that gets involved something happens there a meaning is assigned

21
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,959
memory is about the words and the meaning come into play the relationship we have my behalf to

22
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:23,840
the person who's speaking them comes into play predictions of the future and what those words might mean and

23
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:30,319
and then becomes this complicated world in the middle of which there is some place we get knotted we get entangled

24
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,680
we're caught in it we're hanging on to that branch on the edge of the river as we

25
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:43,120
uh canoe down so um so to learn the art

26
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,280
of not being not being knotted up not being reactive to our senses

27
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:56,480
is one of the great arts of mindfulness practice it doesn't of course mean that we are

28
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,640
oblivious or indifferent to what happens in the world it means that

29
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,959
we have we can come into kind of a balanced place or a free place

30
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:16,319
where our response is a response not a reaction uh where we can see clearly

31
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,560
what our inner ideas thoughts impulses are and choose wisely

32
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,760
how to act including not giving in to

33
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:34,959
nodding up getting entangled with it all so to hear sounds

34
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,720
and so um

35
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,239
so this is true with all our scent stores it's the eyes the ears the nose the

36
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,680
tongue and the body and today i'd like to focus on the body

37
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:58,159
and in this kind of ability to to discern

38
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:04,640
the sensations in the body the knowing of the sensation and the entanglement

39
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,720
that um that we might get involved with it so to begin

40
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,840
you might uh just very simply close your eyes

41
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,280
and find a and some of you have done this before but

42
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,199
please do it again so find a neutral place in your body

43
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,800
and uh it could be the hands maybe the hands are touching each other or the hands are touching

44
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,919
your thigh or your knees and

45
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,520
find a neutral spot in your body and

46
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:52,479
some place where you're not so likely to get entangled or have a lot of opinions or ideas

47
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,240
but that you can feel the sensations are there

48
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,400
and feel the sensations in that part of your body

49
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:13,199
so if it's in the hand feel the pulsing the tingling the vibration

50
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,479
the warmth the coolness

51
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:28,240
feel how the sensations might be different in the fingers in the palm

52
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,039
in the back of the hand

53
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:45,039
and then as you're aware of the sensations in your body in this neutral place

54
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:52,080
how neutral are you are there judgments ideas

55
00:05:52,080 --> 00:06:00,639
for or against the sensations or the attention with the sensations

56
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,280
is there reactions

57
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,440
now as you exhale

58
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,800
relax your whole body best you can

59
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,880
soften the body

60
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:04,639
soften the mind as you exhale

61
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,120
settling into just being here putting aside ideas of what you have to

62
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:20,160
do or should do in favor of the exhale

63
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:27,400
where you let go relax settle

64
00:07:53,599 --> 00:08:00,478
breathing in and breathing out relaxing and softening

65
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:07,280
and maybe you can't let go of everything but maybe you can soften

66
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:16,000
the tensions in the mind soften the places of anxiety

67
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,789
desire [Music]

68
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,840
of ill will

69
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:38,839
or maybe simply the strong tendency to think on every exhale

70
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:46,000
relax settle soften

71
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:57,360
doing it gently even kindly

72
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,759
relaxing and softening on the exhale

73
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:41,200
and relaxing on the exhale and seeing if you can be

74
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:49,800
gentle and receptive to the inhale with no ambitions

75
00:09:52,800 --> 00:10:01,920
no standards that you're measuring yourself against and allowing yourself to be aware

76
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,839
of the inhale in whatever way it happens

77
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,399
on the exhale

78
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:48,720
letting go into the exhale as if you're letting go into the very

79
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:56,640
end of the exhale to where the things come become quiet and still

80
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,959
before the inhale begins

81
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:34,480
and as you're with your breathing the sensations of the body breathing

82
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,480
notice if there's any ways in which you're knotted or entangled

83
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:48,240
reactive caught up in

84
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:56,120
some idea or preference about the breathing

85
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:03,360
and appreciate that that is your addition

86
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,959
the extra part to breathing

87
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:20,480
it's possible to breathe with no entanglement necessary

88
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,240
but if there is

89
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:33,519
know it as entanglement know it as a knot gently softly

90
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,519
non-judgmentally

91
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:46,920
but perhaps softening it as you exhale

92
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:17,759
with the mindfulness the tension hanging out with your breathing

93
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,680
and if there's any reactivity any ways that you are caught or entangled in

94
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:30,560
breathing bothered by breathing bothered by anything

95
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:41,759
let that be part of the bigger picture of what you accompany

96
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:49,040
as you accompany the present moment as you accompany breathing

97
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:57,519
not being bothered even by being when you're bothered

98
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,560
just knowing it and breathing

99
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:12,440
[Music]

100
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,840
if you are lost in thinking

101
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:26,480
chances are that there's some kind of subtle or big ways in which you are caught in it

102
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,640
entangled knotted can you relax the knot

103
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,440
untie it

104
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:45,639
and if you can't that's okay just know it

105
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:52,720
just know that you're knotted and caught and continue breathing with it through

106
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:59,240
it let breathing

107
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,360
be your support

108
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:14,559
to either freeze you from being caught or gently highlights that you are

109
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,880
and if you are don't be bothered by it

110
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,200
breathe with it gently softly

111
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:41,520
sooner or later in the practice of meditation

112
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,679
we can become mindful enough

113
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:54,480
to notice how we get caught up in things entangled

114
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,278
and reactive

115
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:07,520
to things we see things we hear things we smell things we taste

116
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:14,399
things we feel in the body things we think

117
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,600
things we emote

118
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:29,600
and at some point we begin having a new relationship to those entanglements

119
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:35,840
those attachments the way we're caught up

120
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:41,520
and that is one that we don't necessarily no longer believe in the value

121
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:49,398
of being entangled and caught we know there is something better

122
00:27:51,840 --> 00:28:00,080
and we know it doesn't work to get entangled in our entanglements

123
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,879
to be reactive and bothered

124
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:16,679
by the ways that we are bothered or reactive

125
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:27,039
and this begins to give us a taste of freedom the freedom of leaving things alone and

126
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:33,200
not being further entangled just knowing

127
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,919
what's happening

128
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:50,000
and this ability is invaluable in our social lives

129
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,320
to be able to

130
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:08,320
not give in or stay caught or behave speak from our reactivity

131
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:15,200
but to see it and be able to stay balanced relaxed

132
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:21,600
clear and if we can do that or as we begin

133
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:28,399
doing this better and better it becomes clearer more obvious

134
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:37,440
that the practice we're doing is beneficial for others it frees them from our reactivity

135
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:47,919
and may it be that this practice that you does in fact support and help and

136
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:53,520
others maybe all beings may it be that this community of ours

137
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,960
with so many people coming here in seven a.m sitting

138
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:06,559
and collectively we are making a difference in the world

139
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:13,039
that a known and unknown ways we spread peace

140
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:18,240
safety happiness and freedom

141
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:24,399
may all beings be happy

142
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:29,840
may all beings be safe

143
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:35,120
may all beings be peaceful

144
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:42,480
may all beings be free and may each of us contribute to this

145
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,799
being possible

146
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:00,989
[Music]

147
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,240
so my friends

148
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:23,039
there's a delightful for me little teachings in buddhism that

149
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:30,880
that it's possible to become omniscient but it's not what maybe you think

150
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:37,519
that it's possible to know something about everything

151
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:43,519
and what is it that that omniscience is is that

152
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:50,000
it's not worth clinging to anything

153
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:56,880
so now we know something about everything but there's certain kind of omniscience

154
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:03,279
so but but kind of continuing on this theme of some kind of

155
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:08,720
omniscience and for our human experience

156
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:15,840
all human experiences we have no matter how sophisticated and complex they are

157
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:22,399
have comment have a common denominator and that is we know it

158
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:28,960
through one of the six cent stores the ancient analogy of the time of the

159
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,799
buddha was that if you had a walled city

160
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:41,200
with only one gate coming into the city then a

161
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:47,039
guards a guard would stand be at the gate and could watch everyone coming and

162
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:52,320
going and would decide who can come in and who can go out

163
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:57,679
if there were six gates then there might be six guards you're doing

164
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:04,720
the same thing so we have six doors six gates which all experiences that we process

165
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:11,279
that we take in that we use to understand our life and all that

166
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:18,080
and we have six doors six gates and that's seeing the gates of the eyes the ears

167
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:24,159
the nose the tongue the tactile body and then the mind or

168
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:29,840
that from which we kind of observe or know what's happening in the mind

169
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,440
and so we take in the data from these the sense data the

170
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:41,519
experiences and then somehow we process it we do something with it

171
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:47,200
and sometimes we build whole universes with it

172
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:53,360
there's a story zen chinese story of a painter very realistic painter

173
00:33:53,360 --> 00:34:00,159
who paint very realistic paintings and he was up close painting a tiger

174
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:06,880
and and involved in the details but at some point he stepped back some feet to look

175
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:12,240
at it it was so realistic he became frightened and he ran away

176
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:19,358
so we ourselves our mind is constructing stories ideas memories

177
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:25,839
predictions of the future meaning um elaborations ideas creativity poems

178
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:32,878
and songs and all kinds of things our mind creates and we can live in that inner world

179
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:38,878
but for uh and get lost in it but in buddhist practice what we're

180
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:46,320
trying to do is live at the doors be mindful of things as they appear and

181
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:52,720
occur in the present moment at each of the senstors and the reason for that is if you do

182
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:58,640
that then you know something about everything you know the common denominator everything that's going to happen

183
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:03,760
is going to be built on those things coming in from those sense doors

184
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:09,920
and if you can be there and see at that point what the reactivity is the clinging the

185
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:15,119
resistance how how we relate to it it gives us a tremendously wonderful

186
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:20,640
vantage point in which to live a wise life to not get caught up in the

187
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:26,320
entanglements and reactivity and build universes of tigers that frighten

188
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:34,960
us because we just kind of don't don't not there at the start the beginning point

189
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:41,839
and in some ways our life is always beginning over and so to bring ourselves into the sense

190
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:47,520
doors and really be present for it we're there at the start of the life it's always starting in the present starting

191
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:53,440
over again and over again and and so

192
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,880
to be able to get right there and see it now remember that

193
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:06,079
uh in this teachings that we're doing now in the sixth sense stores and the entanglement to them

194
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:12,720
we're coming near the end of a long series of practices of the sati patana sutra

195
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:19,920
so this is not a beginner's practice this is something that we can begin to do when we've gotten quiet and still

196
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,200
enough or focused mindfulness is strong enough we can really stay there and see it

197
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:30,320
and the advantage of doing so is like this and

198
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:35,359
we have a garden with garden beds and

199
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:41,440
and so i'm kind of responsible for right now because my wife is away she's usually the gardener

200
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:48,240
and one of the flower beds is overgrown with maybe a foot and a

201
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:55,119
half tall mostly oat grass and or some kind of tall grass

202
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:01,040
and all kinds of other weeds and it's packed in the flower bed you know all these must be very fertile the bed because

203
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:06,839
it's just like bursting forth and over whelming you know how thick it's full of

204
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:12,160
weeds we have another bed that

205
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:18,000
where there's some onions and some lettuces and things and

206
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,440
and there there is not so much there's almost no weeds at all

207
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,640
the lettuce and the onions are growing nicely and there's space between them

208
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:34,079
and there if a weed arises i see the little weed coming up out of the soil

209
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:40,079
and i'm not overwhelmed by that i come over and pull it out and um and it doesn't grow to be a big

210
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:46,079
weed to crowd out what we're trying to grow there so um

211
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:51,119
so the same thing with our mind if we haven't uh weeded our mind

212
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:57,760
for decades it can be crowded and overgrown with all kinds of weeds and it takes a

213
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:03,119
while to relax and settle and calm down to the point where we start seeing the

214
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:08,560
beginning of a weed the beginning of the entanglement and if we see at the beginning of it at

215
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:13,920
first arising then we could let go of it we can pull it out by the

216
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:20,320
roots and and put it in the compost pile and

217
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:27,040
and so this is part of as practice deepens and we have the ability to be much more present

218
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:33,520
and we trust being present more than we trust the thinking and predicting and

219
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:39,520
planning and remembering and reviewing and having conversations or having fantasies

220
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:45,599
we trust being in the present moment things become clear enough our flower

221
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:52,000
beds become clear enough we see the beginning of a weed arising a beginning of a react

222
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,000
reaction reactivity arising and that is a powerful place to be

223
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:05,520
because if you see it arise then it's easy to let go of it or not participate or let it be

224
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:11,280
and it's possible to let it be and let it go and not see it no you're not going to pick it up again

225
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:17,599
and this is the instructions for this particular part of the satipatana sutta

226
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:24,240
it is to know the scent store

227
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:30,800
no no you know like today we're talking about the body no the tactile body

228
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:39,200
know the sensations of the touch the object of the tactile experience

229
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:45,920
know the arising of an entanglement

230
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,680
no letting it go and know that you're not going to pick it up again

231
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:56,880
so that's really the exercise of this this point part part of the satipatthana

232
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,480
sutra is to be able to be present for the sense experience

233
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:09,839
and to see the beginning of attachment the beginning of clinging react

234
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:15,359
and to be able to put it down if you can't put it down it's powerful just let it be

235
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:21,520
don't pick it up don't get involved and then know you're not going to get involved again

236
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:26,880
you know at least this time around and this keeps us in this beautiful

237
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:33,440
wonderful place of freedom keeps us in this place where where maybe we're kind of amused or

238
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:40,319
delighted or relieved when we see an attachment arise a clinging and entanglement rise

239
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:45,920
because we know we're not going to get entangled to the entanglement we're not going to react to the reactivity

240
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:52,880
but rather we're going to see the beauty the wonderfulness of being aware of its arising that there

241
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:58,560
it is and it can be for some people kind of amusing kind of delightful

242
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:04,480
kind of um faith it can give birth to a lot of faith and confidence

243
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:11,440
that oh here i got here i got i'm starting to get annoyed

244
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:18,960
i'm starting to be frustrated or and there it is here's me wanting it to be different

245
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:24,480
here's me wanting to get to stay forever there's that little clinging going on

246
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,599
and we say oh wow there's the clinging and there's kind of just joy

247
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:35,200
and knowing we're not going to get involved and knowing that there's freedom and space around it

248
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:43,599
it's a very different relationship to clinging and reactivity than oh no this is terrible i shouldn't be doing this

249
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,520
so the scent stores and uh so today we talked about i talked

250
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:55,440
about the technical sense door of things touching our body

251
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,800
and that can be physical things outside things outside but also from the inside out there's

252
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,000
kind of sensate experience the body can reveal

253
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,000
so today i would encourage you to spend more time with mindfulness of your body

254
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,319
and and discover both the delight of being grounded in your body maybe

255
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:23,599
but more importantly for this exercise today look and see how you're entangled

256
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:29,119
judgments expectations disappointments with the body how you compare your body

257
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:35,040
to other bodies or to how you were before how you might be in the future all the

258
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:43,119
ways you get entangled and see if you can notice the entanglement with such clarity

259
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:50,319
that maybe you're delighted or amused or maybe you believe that you see it

260
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:55,359
see if you can find a different way of relating to the bad news

261
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:01,920
of being reactive and entangled where mindfulness clear mindfulness

262
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:07,359
brings a different way of relating mindfulness to the body

263
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:15,000
it's a way of becoming friends with your body when you stop the reactivity
