1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,879
so good morning everyone welcome happy to be here with you

2
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:14,440
all and um as I prepare to give this talk uh

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:20,000
certainly what's happening in the Middle East is very much on my heart

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,599
and um you know the when I teach the Dharma sometimes it's

5
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:34,920
not explicit why I teach but I all my teaching is as a teacher is directed

6
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,600
towards trying to address the suffering of the world at hopefully at the deepest

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,840
level and um but there's so many different ways to get at that that sometimes it seems like I'm maybe not

8
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,520
talking about that directly so I'd like to uh dedicate

9
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:59,600
today's talk to the people who are suffering in the Middle East and certainly the Palestinians in Gaza were

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,280
so so many innocent Palestinians are dying and injured and homeless and it's

11
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,159
an must be U hellish to be there right now very difficult I think of all the

12
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:17,080
children who are going through how difficult it must be for them and how difficult it probably be for them for a

13
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:23,320
lifetime to go through this and the hostages that uh are also being held

14
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:28,880
isra hostages and it must be also hellish to be there and part of that and

15
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,159
so I dedicated to to the welfare and happiness and the peace for all the

16
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:41,680
people who are suffering Middle East so

17
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:48,960
um the um so conventionally the topic for today

18
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,079
is effort and uh the poly word that's often

19
00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:00,200
translated as effort is viia and viia has a lot of different translations into

20
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:06,039
English and sometimes it's effort sometimes it's it's energy sometimes

21
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:14,000
it's endeavoring some people like the word persistence uh the word in in Sanskrit

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,040
has a kind of has association with courage or uh maybe even uh

23
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:27,280
heroism and we have in um I think in Tibetan Buddhism I believe sometimes this Baria is translated as heroic

24
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,920
effort because of the connotations that IA has and

25
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:38,360
um the um and the word that I'd like to use

26
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:46,360
today is vitality and having a embodied sense of

27
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,560
Vitality is a reference point for wisdom in Buddhist

28
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,840
practice and not just the emphasizing the importance of making effort but uh

29
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:05,200
how we make effort is important and the source of our effort is important within us and uh and by paying

30
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,319
attention to this uh we can develop a lot of wisdom about how we

31
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:17,280
practice this topic of how we make effort is so important that it could be

32
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,440
the only thing we ever need to talk about like everything you need to discover in Buddhism will be discovered

33
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:30,040
by how you make effort generally I like to think that when we do Buddhist practice 50% % of

34
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:36,080
our attention is focused on what we're doing and 50% of attention on how we're

35
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:44,560
doing it how we're doing it including the effort we're making as we do something is as important as what we're

36
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:51,239
doing what we're doing is important of course the Buddha said that um if you're trying

37
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:57,680
to make sesame oil by squeezing

38
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:04,680
gravel that's going to be unpr productive effort you have to know what to do that is to the point of what's

39
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,840
really what of what your intentions are and not be doing something that's not

40
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,360
right but then also how you do it is important and so as I said some people

41
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,959
like to translate the Veria as persistence because

42
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,560
uh uh the continuity of persistant effort is sometimes much more important

43
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,199
than the strength of the effort in fact the the turtle and the hair um

44
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:39,479
Fable is very up propo to Buddhist practice that uh sometimes making you

45
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:47,199
know heroic effort really strong effort um is actually counterproductive Buddhist practice if it stir us up stirs

46
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:54,520
us up and it's so easy to be stirred up like partly because when we make strong effort there tends to be a lot of self

47
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:01,360
and or ego involved in it and like I have to do it I have to be successful and I have to kind of fix what's going

48
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,560
on and and we gear up in a way that just kind of agitates the Mind more than

49
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,639
settles it but if we can practice with a settled effort but do it

50
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:19,680
persistently um and sometimes it doesn't look very hot the effort but the fact that it's being done continuously it

51
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,120
carries the day it carries the the lifetime for for our

52
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:32,800
practice there was um I wasn't there at the time but I've heard now from a few of my friends who were there um of a

53
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,160
large uh teaching that the Dal Lama gave in Arizona many years ago a big

54
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,400
convention center and thousands of people were there and he was giving some

55
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:50,880
teaching I don't know what he was teaching but then there was a period of uh questions that he would respond to

56
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:59,120
and a Gentleman stood up and stood by the mic to ask him a question and asked him um uh something like something like

57
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,520
um what what's the fastest way to Enlightenment and the diama was silent

58
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,960
for a long time and I was as I was told the story as it was told as it was told

59
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:18,000
to me a tear started to go down his cheek and he finally start spoke and

60
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,840
something to the effect of um it was so sad this idea that going for the fastest

61
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:31,759
way to Enlightenment that just represented kind of a kind of a wrong way of practicing a selfish way or

62
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,880
caught up way or misunderstanding of what practice is and it just made him

63
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:43,400
sad um you know for him he he he dedicated his whole lifetime to Buddhist

64
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:49,160
practice and when you did give yourself to the whole lifetime to it I think it tends to be a bit

65
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:55,400
humbling I think we we tend to understand how much there is to work with and how much there is to do and how

66
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:01,360
much there is the the work of of freeing ourselves from all the little and big

67
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:10,400
ways in which we're selfish and the way which we're uh afraid the ways that we're greedy the ways that we are um you

68
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:17,800
know have hostility or have ill will or aversion there's so many layers and layers and layers of ways we get stuck

69
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,639
and it takes a lot of patience sometimes to find our way through this practice

70
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:29,879
and so they're persistent just steadily keeping at it keeping at it and uh it's

71
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:35,720
remarkable how slowly things begin to shift and change the metaphor or the

72
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:42,520
analogy that I love for this is I don't know why I settled on this one maybe because I heard it this way or I used to

73
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:48,960
swim a fair amount and um but people who are like really you know athletic

74
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,680
swimmers uh competitive swimming um uh now I probably don't know

75
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:02,199
what I'm talking about but so you maybe just theal it go go along with with the analogy not

76
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:08,240
literally and uh and that is that uh you know they'll do the same stroke over and

77
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,039
over and over again tens of thousands of times and slowly each of you know each

78
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:19,960
time they do it in a most minuscule little way their body kind of begins to

79
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:25,199
tune into how to make it more efficient how to make it just just like a little

80
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:32,919
bit stronger uh stroke and little bit smoother and slowly slowly the this the

81
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:38,640
stroke becomes more and more efficient and more elegant but it it's not something that they can figure out for

82
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,720
their particular body you know by just reading a book and say this is how you do it you have to keep doing it over and

83
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:51,920
over and over again something begins shifting same thing with this practice we do it over and over and over again

84
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:58,800
and something begins shifting and changing you see it in people's meditation posture and when people are

85
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,519
beginner is in meditation posture um you know it's it's difficult it's stiff it's

86
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:09,680
challenging when I was in the Zen Monastery in Japan like this

87
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:16,200
real you know tough Zen Monastery in Japan uh they would some of the new monks had just come from college they

88
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,760
would go to Buddhist College some of them you know they they'd go to get a bachelor's or something and then from

89
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:28,000
there they'd go to the training Mony but some of the member had been athletes there and and for them they hadn't done

90
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,240
a lot of meditation and I remember they were just in excruciating pain and one of them who we

91
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:40,120
all slept together in the meditation Hall and so before he went to sleep he put a whole bunch of this like I don't

92
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,920
know like I don't know benay or this kind of this this this Menthol cream on

93
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:53,120
his legs to kind of get it to relax and the whole that meditation Hall was filled with his Menthol

94
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,440
thing and um but you know so but slowly slowly the body stretches and changes

95
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:04,959
and and all kinds of subtle ways and you can watch over a few years I've watched over a few years people's meditation

96
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:10,160
posture change until it's kind of like a yogic posture it almost like that now

97
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:16,519
they can sit there in a way that's stable and upright and without fidgeting but it's not a process that happens

98
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:21,600
overnight it's a slow slow process that from the continuity the Persistence of

99
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:28,040
doing it one of the things I'm maybe too fond of of uh

100
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:34,519
saying is I'll say I won't do it for you I'll save you from it so I'll just tell you what I

101
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:41,120
do is I'll say um uh Buddhist practice doesn't work I'll shake my head and do

102
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:48,040
just doesn't work and then I'll pause you know wow Gil says that um uh then

103
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:53,160
I'll add um uh if you don't do

104
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,760
it with the emphasis on you know you have to do it to make it work and so some people will have this idea it

105
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:04,639
doesn't work and they won't even try the Buddha said that this practice

106
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:09,800
that he was teaching or the Dharma that he was teaching is for the energetic not

107
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:15,880
for the lazy that's a quite a powerful statement for the energetic not for the

108
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:23,279
lazy and um and some people I know who are really busy people are actually lazy

109
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:30,320
and the reason why there's not seem as being lazy they're putting a lot of work into being busy but their business is

110
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:37,040
avoiding really facing what's difficult for them they're get they're being busy to get away because they don't want to

111
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:43,639
take the time and the effort to really confront and meet what's really going on for them in their lives and whether it's

112
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:51,320
in themselves or in relationships they're in or something so um so

113
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:57,279
Vitality as a as a as a possible aspect

114
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,399
of this word Viria energy and the reason I find that it's

115
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:11,760
such a wonderful word is that Vitality is a is not necessarily coming from um

116
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:17,480
uh self-conscious applying ourselves pushing

117
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:23,920
ourselves um there's many ways in which through the day that we gear ourselves up and push ourselves to kind of get

118
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:32,079
something and get and have something I suspect a fair number of people who drive cars are putting in a little bit

119
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:38,560
more effort than they need to when they drive their cars they're pushing leaning forward trying to get someplace little

120
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:46,320
bit more on the gas pedal little bit more clutching the steering wheel like they have to get there before the light turns red you know just like you know in

121
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:53,800
that kind of effort there and that's certainly energy but uh uh and it's it may be a

122
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:59,680
kind of um embodied energy of gearing up and getting tight and muscles are working

123
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:07,199
but uh it's not the same thing in my vocabulary of Vitality Vitality is a natural arising

124
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:13,040
of being enlivened without there being any stress

125
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,600
associated with that kind of energy so nonstressful

126
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,760
vitality and um the

127
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:30,360
um the writer the kind of a psychologist religious

128
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:35,560
writer from the 20th century called Joseph Campbell he wrote this very

129
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:41,279
interesting statement he said um

130
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:48,360
um uh something like again I'm not I'm not quite remembering it accurately

131
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:56,199
um um what people need the mo people people think what they need is a sense of meaning but most people are searching

132
00:13:56,199 --> 00:14:01,399
for Vitality for a sense of I think he used the word aliveness a feeling of

133
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:08,199
being alive and there's some there can be this wonderful sense of being alive

134
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:14,160
vital that Vitality of being alive that's satisfying in and of itself that

135
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:21,639
just oh it's so good like it's easy to be content it's easy to be happy to be alive um and we sometimes we get that

136
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:29,320
from doing certain things you're going for a nice hike or doing something really fun like a maybe Sports or

137
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:35,000
playing a musical instrument or something that kind of sets Something Free that then we have when we're

138
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,560
finished we feel a sense of Vitality that is uh very different than

139
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:47,079
um feeling like we've been pushing and trying and working hard to make something

140
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:54,079
happen and so um this sense of aliveness and I think that a lot uh to

141
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:59,199
maybe say the same thing as Joseph Campbell I think a lot of uh the effort

142
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:06,160
people make is to uh try to solve their suffering try to get away from it to

143
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,320
find something to do that can assuage it to bring Comfort to bring safety

144
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:17,440
avoidance that's are often driven by suffer but you know to to somehow deal and cope with our

145
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:23,480
suffering and sometimes in doing that we're making the effort in it kind of in

146
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:29,199
the wrong direction we're kind of squeezing the gravel rather than uh

147
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:35,680
turning inward to where the guess sesame oil in Ancient India was pretty

148
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:43,079
special and uh and so to turn it Inward and to pay attention to how we make

149
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:49,959
effort how we're doing anything at all and what's the consequences of it so one

150
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:56,880
for examp one example I've For Me Maybe it's for some of you as well that um my

151
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:02,240
effort can sometimes go into uh problem solving I'm worried about

152
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,519
something concerned about something trying to figure something out in my head or I'm involved in

153
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:14,880
fantasy all kinds of different things and um and so um I leave it to your

154
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,040
imagination what a Buddhist teacher fantasizes

155
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:28,160
about and uh and uh and I can feel that the energy

156
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:35,240
of that effort has gone up in the top of my head and it's feel to me it feels like it's going in spirals that are

157
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:40,480
getting Tighter and Tighter that energy it's like working sometimes I feel this

158
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,040
mental energy being caught up in the thought streams that I'm in and it feels really agitated and rather than

159
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:52,240
spiraling around in faster and faster way or tighter and way it just feels scattered like ping pong balls are going

160
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:59,920
on in there and uh sometimes I can feel the effort of thinking uh involves pressure

161
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,438
or tension in my forehead and my scalp in my head in my shoulders and all kinds

162
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:12,360
of different ways the Buddha described uh had this analogy of of the how the

163
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:19,678
mind works as being a puppeteer and it has all these strings that go down to all the different muscles in our body

164
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,760
and that the mind is kind of pulling on those strings strings of tension and we

165
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:31,720
get tight in the shoulders and the belly with what's goes on and and the beautiful thing about the freedom that

166
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:37,080
comes from Buddhist practice is um we no longer have a

167
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:43,240
puppeteer that we no longer have this activity in the mind which is has this

168
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:51,200
negative kind of tentacles that go out and affect the rest of our body in all kinds of ways the body starts becoming

169
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:57,400
relaxed so the energies that can be up in the head the effort of trying to make something happen or figure something out

170
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:04,640
you know whatever and um but the Vitality is a whole different species of

171
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:12,640
energy Vitality is not dependent on what we're doing but how at ease we are in

172
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:18,240
ourselves and how awake we are how much Clarity there is in our being and how we

173
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:24,480
are now that for in my for me the word Vitality has a feeling of being clean

174
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:31,960
something very clean about it it just feels good to be alive here I am and once we have this kind of

175
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:37,280
settled relaxed calm sense of Vitality uh some people might call it

176
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:43,320
Chi or Kei in Japanese and now chi in Chinese uh

177
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:52,400
there's something there's an upwelling of a nice sense of aliveness that's here that um that can boy us up that can

178
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,880
support us so when we meditate it's not a matter of applying effort when we

179
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:04,039
meditate but rather it's riding like a maybe like

180
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:10,559
a you know a boat rides the waves or rides on the on the surface of the ocean

181
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:15,840
that's a matter of riding the vi riding the natural Vitality the natur natural

182
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,919
aliveness that's here within us so it's not so much applying effort to pay

183
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:27,280
attention to the breathing but relaxing and allowing ourselves to float to the

184
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:33,880
vitality the energy that's in the body that requires us to be

185
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:40,360
breathing so it's kind of a floating on that sense of movement and energy and

186
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:47,679
activity that goes on as the body breathes and that's a very different feeling the floating on top of it and

187
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,760
allowing it the natural Vitality as opposed to being the one who has to have

188
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:59,919
a laser focus the one who has okay now I got to try hard let's try it now let's make me more

189
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:06,080
effort and um and so to start having a reference point for this clean Vitality

190
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,919
this nice way of being alive and using that as a this is where

191
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:17,720
the wisdom part comes in using that to see how we start applying a different

192
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:24,000
kind of energy effort in our lives to be able to have that contrast between how

193
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,400
to be at ease and relaxed in the body in the in the body's

194
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:36,000
vitality and how we lose that when we start making self-conscious effort oh

195
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,159
I'm late for a meeting I better get there fast and we certainly can have a lot of energy and we get there and we've

196
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:47,919
you know we've got walked really fast maybe we even ran to the meeting and we sit down there's a lot of energy

197
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:53,600
coursing through our body from all that effort and energy but some of that will

198
00:20:53,600 --> 00:21:00,679
not feel like the delightful Vitality some of it might but it came

199
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:08,640
from the stress of trying to not wanting to be late and trying so hard and and it it comes along with um energy that goes

200
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,799
with being tense and so then that tension carries

201
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:22,640
momentum that tension because it's uncomfortable stress that's uncomfortable that generates more

202
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:29,360
stress we're stressful we're stressed so we try harder we don't like the stress that

203
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,480
comes from trying harder because and so it's uncomfortable so the solution what

204
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,640
is to try harder and some of that is unconscious but it plays itself out in

205
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:47,200
what we're thinking about what we're concerned with and how the mind it goes into these habitual Loops of thoughts

206
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:54,120
and ideas of what we need to do and but if you can start feeling the

207
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:59,720
energy the energetics of your thinking habits it's thinking

208
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:06,279
loops and and that's the how you're making the effort all the energy that there the tension that's

209
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:11,440
there and then you say is this the how by which I want to

210
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:18,760
live which is kind of the central Buddhist questions how do you want to be not what

211
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:26,240
do you want to be how do you want to be and uh how do you want to be alive

212
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:32,400
Here and Now and the what you want to be is certainly relevant and important

213
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:40,360
sometimes but I think that we have a culture that is a little bit too tied up in that what I need to be the whole idea

214
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:46,159
of identity and identity politics and asserting yourself and being someone

215
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:51,279
that and being self-promotions you know is really big in our

216
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:58,520
society and uh yesterday I saw a website for someone who was a Buddhist teacher

217
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:03,640
it just seemed like 100% self-promotion in the way that I've seen

218
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:11,080
for other people who are trying to promote their services and themselves as being you know the leading person in

219
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:17,080
their field and what they're doing and I said what is a Buddhist teacher doing with this kind of clear and making

220
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:22,159
claims about himself that no self-respecting

221
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:28,600
you know for a thousand years 2500 years Buddhist no self-respect ing Buddhist

222
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:34,320
would ever say such a thing it just doesn't you know at least that that I know of the way I was trained in

223
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:40,960
Buddhism like where does this come from this comes out of a culture of this kind of self-centered being someone and

224
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,720
proving yourself and you know and this self-promotion and and then those of us

225
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:53,559
who are following in the wake of that it's so easy to when it's in a culture to kind of little bit

226
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:59,080
start it becomes NE it becomes normal I'm supposed to do this and then we get

227
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:05,720
goes go along I'll tell you a story of many years ago when I first moved here to the

228
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:11,320
peninsula I lived up on Skyline and that's irrelevant to the story but I had

229
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:18,039
um I had um I had been given a I think it was

230
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:24,200
a 15-year-old Toyota Celica and um you know and it was red

231
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:30,960
which was cool but it was you know it was just kind of old car and um so I was I I

232
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:37,440
lived in San Francisco first and in there I just drove this old car around kind of and there was no no thought

233
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:43,559
about it I just happy content with it having it and then when I came here to live in

234
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:50,000
a peninsula and I'd come down to paloalto to teach after a while I noticed you know I

235
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,360
had one of the oldest cars on the streets it wasn't that old right but it was one of the oldest cars being

236
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:02,039
paloalto even back then and then at being there long enough at

237
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:08,278
some point I had these thoughts maybe I should get a new

238
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:14,559
car as long as I was living in San Francisco there wasn't that kind of reference point of all lots of everyone

239
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:20,760
has new cars but you know but here in PA Alto there was that reference point and

240
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:26,039
it slowly Creed in innocently so this self-promotional kind

241
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:34,240
of culture that we have kind of comes along and act you know kind of unconsciously seeps in and and then we

242
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:42,640
feel like I'm not good enough I'm not doing the great and wonderful thing that I'm not you know don't have a website

243
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:53,600
yet and um and so so a lot of this unhealthy kind of

244
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,640
Vitality that comes from pushing and trying to be something and proving

245
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:06,799
ourselves or apologizing for ourselves or do these things we can feel the different how that doesn't feel

246
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:13,200
good and so the shift in Buddhism is for many people is to now

247
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:19,720
pay attention to how am I right now not what am I and that's where Joseph goldstein's

248
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,799
little quote I think is quite significant that he um that maybe what

249
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:30,320
we're looking for is sense of aliveness that's been

250
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:35,640
misplaced in Buddhism we would say we're looking for a sense of Freedom that has

251
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:42,080
been misplaced and maybe those two things are not so separate to really feel a healthy

252
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:50,080
sense of aliveness there has to be no longer the pushing the straining the stressing the

253
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:59,600
self assertion that involves a very different kind of energy than the energy of Vitality

254
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:05,200
which uh you know can come from uh really enjoying what you're doing for

255
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:11,240
its own sake and so that's one of the you know

256
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:17,039
one of the signposts of meditation beginning to really uh benefit us and

257
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:24,919
providing a lot of wisdom is when we sit down to meditate and the body has settled into

258
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:30,480
the the posture and we're at home in the posture the mind has learned to calm down we've

259
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:38,080
learned to recognize how we strain and push and how we tend to beat ourselves up and be critical and we learned to

260
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:43,679
recognize these things and we learn to settle them enough that we begin paying

261
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:50,840
attention to the quality of our inner life how am I and that quality of the inner life one

262
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:59,159
of the things that kind of become sensitive to what's that sens what's the quality of being alive right now

263
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:06,559
is there a it's a Vitality that feels good and this can be equally uh valid or

264
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:13,600
or important way of uh checking in with oneself when one is is sick or injured

265
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:19,559
as well and sometimes it's actually more important in those situations where conventionally you don't have much

266
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:28,240
energy you're exhausted because being sick chronically sick or something um and I've been sick and um

267
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,840
it was wonderful to be sick or injured uh when I was in the monastery uh doing

268
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:41,480
a lot of Buddhist practice and it was I was I learned so much about myself in that environment where the practice was

269
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:46,640
so you know right in my face it's like always having to be close to the

270
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:55,200
practice and there were times when I was so sick that um uh that in order to

271
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:01,919
manage I still had to go do the mon work and um or I did it and in order to

272
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:08,120
manage with it I had to be very careful to how I was doing what I was doing not

273
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:15,679
only that I had to pay very careful attention to what I was thinking and and I could see if I

274
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:21,799
thought certain thoughts I would feel sicker my Vitality would

275
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:27,640
diminish if I thought other thoughts it would come back not dramatically but the

276
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:34,080
between those two were enough between managing and not managing I there was times also in the

277
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:42,240
monastery where my back went out and it was horrendous for me I thought I was I was so much pain and and there too I got

278
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:49,960
what was so wonderful about it was um uh the you know ordinarily I have a lot

279
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:56,159
of slack in my body I can get away with a fair amount of things you know without

280
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:03,840
it you know I have arranged where I can do things but when I had my back went out the range was so so almost no range

281
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:11,440
at all so much so I couldn't even think certain thoughts without it affecting my

282
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:18,919
back and and so I learned this reference point of of energy of Vitality of stress

283
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:24,159
that I carry my body became such an important ref not became important it

284
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:31,159
became an essential reference point when I was really sick and really um injured

285
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:37,360
just watching it very carefully and um without thinking I had

286
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:43,039
to be super vital you know like the embodiment of Vitality for anybody it just like I was just trying to cope but

287
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:48,200
it was such a valuable way to understand myself I learned so much about how my

288
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:55,159
mind works when I was sick and the difference had made how to be present so

289
00:30:55,159 --> 00:31:00,279
hopefully you don't have to wait until you're sick for that but uh this is part of what we do in

290
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:08,559
mindfulness practice is we start uh becoming more and more mindful of how we are not just what we're doing and one of

291
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:17,000
the areas of how we are is our sense of Vitality and um and the kind of effort

292
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,120
we make when I was a new Buddhist practitioner the big big kind of

293
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:28,840
exploration was how to make not too much effort and not too little effort and for

294
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:35,679
a long time I learned that it was I was never going to get it right but I could get the swings be

295
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,760
smaller and smaller just like driving down the freeway I you know I don't know

296
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:46,120
for some of you maybe now that you some of you have cars are self-driving and they're

297
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:52,960
straight but I'm constantly almost you know unselfconsciously without any thought making ever so slight

298
00:31:52,960 --> 00:32:00,000
adjustments as I'm going down the straight Lane on the freeway um and um and you know and you

299
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,679
know just just finding my way so same thing with meditation effort there's oh there's too much that's too little so

300
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:13,799
there was a long years where that was part of the reference point like how to do that and oh that's too much let's try

301
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:21,799
to back off and oh that I backed off too much now and it was not making enough and let's come back and finding my

302
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:27,639
way and then over time I learned that there are different kinds of energy in

303
00:32:27,639 --> 00:32:35,120
system and that uh there's the self-conscious energy there's the pushing energy there's the the the me

304
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:41,559
that's making the effort and then there's the Vitality which is the natural Vitality

305
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:46,679
the chi of the system that also varies over different

306
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:52,240
circumstances but to begin having that as a reference point is really helpful

307
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:58,960
and I'll end with this because it's possible as you go through the today to

308
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:04,639
pay attention to what is happening to your native

309
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:11,600
Vitality in the posture with which you sit in a chair with your Vitality by how you sit

310
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:18,320
in your car seat with your driving the Vitality about how you listen to someone else

311
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:24,360
talking what's the Vitality in your body posture and how you are when you're

312
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:30,559
doing something you don't want to do what is the V what's the sense of energy

313
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:36,559
or aliveness inside of you when uh you're in conflict with someone what

314
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:44,519
happens there within you what is taking precedence and what what what can you learn from that because when you're in

315
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:50,519
conflict with someone and the sense of energy now feels stressful and tight

316
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:58,440
or you're the one who's responsible for that not the person you're in conflict with you're the ones source of the

317
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:03,799
energy and so oh is this really how I want to be this how I need to be is

318
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:10,679
there another way is there another way of being alive here how to be where I'm

319
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:18,000
actually more productive more effective more wiser in being in the

320
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,398
conflict and I've certainly learned that when I'm stressed in Conflict I can make

321
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:28,839
a lot of mistakes speak out of terms and speak with things I wish I didn't say

322
00:34:28,839 --> 00:34:33,878
afterwards be more unconscious about what's really driving me but if I'm

323
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:41,960
relaxed and it ease in the conflict I'm actually able to stay involved in a much more useful

324
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:48,040
way so what's your Vitality what's your sense of

325
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:54,398
aliveness is it one that brings you satisfaction feels good it feels like oh

326
00:34:54,399 --> 00:35:00,440
yeah it's good to be alive now even it's even if that aliveness is very teeny in

327
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:06,200
you oh there it is that feels good or is your inner sense of

328
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:12,560
aliveness one that feels difficult and if it is difficult what is

329
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,680
a need from you what is a need for how you are with

330
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:26,119
it not what you do to it but how you are to it and then maybe you could meet it with

331
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:33,680
some of the Vitality the aliveness of your own heart to meet it with your kindness with

332
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:40,040
your love so those are my thoughts for today

333
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:47,960
and uh we have about we have a few minutes here if anyone wants to ask any questions or comments or

334
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,359
testimonials about

335
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,800
vitality

336
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:24,640
push the felt to make it green got

337
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:32,119
it um thank you Gil this is really lovely and

338
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:37,680
um I'm curious to have I feel conflicted

339
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:44,079
because the question in my mind is one of when there's urgent situations where

340
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:52,599
action is needed and that and I often feel that um the practice of Buddhism is

341
00:36:52,599 --> 00:37:00,680
about taking more time stepping back like you said said and that feels I'm

342
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:07,839
I'm In conflict with that when there's urgent matters and how to take action in a way

343
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:14,720
that keeps balance so um I'm sorry that you feel in conflict with that that's a strong word

344
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,839
for me but I'd like to say that that's a very wise

345
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:26,079
concern that you should have because that's the that's that that's often the

346
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:32,359
the asso ation people have with Buddhism you're supposed to do things slowly and calmly and some situations that's not

347
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:38,160
what's called for and what's called for is to do things fast and efficiently and

348
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:43,480
quickly and um um I remember friend of mine many

349
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:50,960
years ago ran a ma was involved with a company that sent out I know male mail

350
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:56,319
their their product out to people who who ordered it and they hired someone

351
00:37:56,319 --> 00:38:02,720
from from the Zen Monastery to work there and the person was you know

352
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:09,720
putting the things into the box slowly stood there a little while and

353
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:16,800
observed how that was maybe moved the product around the Box a little bit and then close the lid and you can't run a

354
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:24,599
business that way so the person lost the job and then when I was um when I left

355
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:29,960
the monastery I was uh the San the San Francisco Zen Center still has back then

356
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:35,440
it had um The Greens restaurant in San Francisco which is a little bit a fast

357
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:42,880
food place to work work and I was a signed when we when when we as monks had to go work there now they pay people but

358
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:48,680
back then it was I got you know I worked five and a half days a week and got paid $60 a

359
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:53,920
month for working there and um so but I loved working there but so I came from

360
00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:00,079
the monastery and I worked there and it was obvious being on the the lunch crew making lunch

361
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:06,400
that you couldn't do things slowly and what I learned was how to do things fast

362
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,920
and mindfully Fast and calmly with inner calm and I loved it there was a dance I

363
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:18,839
was spinning around and I multitasking you know you had I had all these different dishes I had to kind of prepare at the same time and the pizz

364
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:27,599
were in the oven you had to do something else while they're in there you don't stand in front of the pizza of and waiting for the pizza to be done and uh and uh

365
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:33,960
and the idea was how to be fully present and engaged without being

366
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:39,520
stressed and so that's the art so yes definitely let's not uh we can we can

367
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:46,960
learn to be calm but uh and sometimes it takes a while to learn how to have a

368
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:54,040
foundation of being maybe calm and slow in order to learn the basics uh and then once you know it well

369
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:59,880
then we need to respond appropriately to the situation but hopefully without any

370
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:06,000
stress it's urgent it's so urgent it's so important

371
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:12,119
the last thing you want to do is to be stressed let's but let's do it

372
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:28,359
vigorously I grew up

373
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:37,200
I grew up in paloalto and so that message of try harder definitely sep in

374
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:43,400
in many different ways so one of the mantras that I like now is try

375
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:50,920
softer uh and then maybe we could add try softer but

376
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:57,760
persistently just keep keep steady keep steady at least at least in terms of Buddhist practice

377
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:05,839
practice it carries the day and also if you get enlightened

378
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:09,640
slower it might be a better

379
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:16,078
Enlightenment so you pass it back

380
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,599
there um so it was a follow-up question too kind of the question that the lady

381
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:28,720
shared um during the time when you're working um at the restaurant what are

382
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:37,000
some of the things that helped you to what were some of the things that helped you to stay Mindful and calm in a

383
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:44,960
fast-paced environment thank you well um the um the the practice that I had

384
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:50,280
then the kind of in in what I what I learned to do in Zen Monastery which

385
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:56,880
then I applied to working at that restaurant when I came there was the question for me was not um how should I

386
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:03,000
be mindful of this situation uh because sometimes when uh that's a little bit removed from what

387
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:09,240
you're doing to ask how to be mindful at sometimes and rather I asked myself uh

388
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:15,560
the practi was how do I participate more fully with what I'm doing and um and I learned in the

389
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:22,480
monastery how much I only participated half-heartedly quarter heartedly you know sometimes I like

390
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:27,880
especially if I didn't want to do something I like oh I'm not going to really give myself to it and but in the

391
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:36,599
monastery I learned the joy of giving myself fully to what I was doing and this a full Engagement full

392
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:41,640
participation so when I was there at The Greens restaurant that that was my task

393
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:47,280
how do I how do I participate in this fully the consequence of that was that I

394
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:55,319
had to be mindful I had to be very aware of everything I was going on but the awareness followed in the wake of

395
00:42:55,319 --> 00:43:03,160
participating uh as opposed to the awareness leading what I was doing and so I became very

396
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:09,400
present in fact by the time I left work uh end of the end of the work day I was

397
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:16,880
more concentrated than when I came because I was so fully present there for what was going on and I wasn't lost in

398
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:22,839
any particular detail it was like I was participating in the whole thing and

399
00:43:22,839 --> 00:43:29,559
tracking many different things and um and whatever came and one of the things I loved doing was I was

400
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:35,760
doing all this you know I was fully in the present moment doing all this different stuff and then all these

401
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:41,640
dishes and putting them up for the waiters to come and take them to serve to the people eating there and then I

402
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:48,359
also at some point I tried to have this um to have a conversation a relationship with each of the waiters and try to

403
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:54,200
remember what we had talked about between dishes when they came in and tried to have a kind of a kind of a

404
00:43:54,200 --> 00:44:03,800
meaningful connection with them on top top of it all so it was a fun time for me and you know and I was much younger

405
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:09,359
so so I had a lot of energy then so probably what it would look like now if

406
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:15,319
I worked at greens you know that I'd probably have to have a little bit of

407
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:20,480
allowance to do things slower and take breaks than wholeheartedly now full

408
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:26,720
participation now means would mean with the energy and the stamina that have now

409
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:32,079
in my age that does that answer your question

410
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:38,839
is good enough because there's a lot of could have said but was a good

411
00:44:40,359 --> 00:44:48,319
question okay well thank you for being here and appreciate it very much and um one

412
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:55,400
thing I could add as you're leaving is um uh every year we do a yearend letter

413
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:00,720
for kind of kind of a fundraising letter for IMC and um and we never really ask

414
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:06,720
for funds here think I don't know if you never we never ask for things and and in fact if you Le the looks like a

415
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:12,000
fundraising letter it smells like it if you shake it it shakes like one and um

416
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:18,680
they actually don't ask but there is a remate envelope but this year I Tred to write

417
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:25,359
the I write I always one who writes the letter and this year I thought I want to write the less boring letter and uh I

418
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:32,079
want to do something that has some something that's memorable in terms of the Dharma so anyway so if you want to pick

419
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:37,400
it up and read it it's on the counter as you leave and um but I could well

420
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:42,520
imagine people don't want that that that's

421
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:48,400
okay thank you
