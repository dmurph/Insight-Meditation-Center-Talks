[Music] in noticing noticing in your own heart how

24
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:46,360
it feels to read the greetings and observations of others and how it feels

25
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,599
to look back in your own heart at your day and as you're taking maybe as I'm

26
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:59,640
about to do that last sip of tea before settling into the meditation

27
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,159
allowing that to nourish you nourish your

28
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:17,040
heart taking a deep intentional

29
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:22,519
breath or two and beginning to bring the

30
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:26,480
attention inward

31
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,360
bringing a heartful attuned

32
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:45,360
quality to greeting yourself with the same warmth and friendliness you would meet greet an old

33
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,560
s mate or

34
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,720
friend allowing a little extra relaxation on the out breath

35
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,439
letting go into the

36
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,639
moment and letting the breath be natural

37
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:40,160
inviting all of your body all of your heart all of your

38
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,440
mind to be present

39
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:01,638
here resting on the sensations of breathing

40
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,680
perhaps on the [Music] sensations of the

41
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:17,080
attuned art of the

42
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:25,400
body making a gentle loving determination that for these

43
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:32,520
moments we are to be present here this moment

44
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:38,680
now nowhere else the Mind needs to be

45
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:10,440
attending to the details of sensation Ambient sound

46
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,160
temperature weight or lightness of the

47
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:26,720
body [Music] aliveness in this

48
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:33,720
body each in breath its own

49
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:48,120
Journey with each out breath releasing anything extra letting go

50
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:09,840
inviting experience to flow through each breath each

51
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:17,160
moment any flits of thought just to move through like birds

52
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,000
floting across an empty

53
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:36,319
Sky being nourished resting in the waves of the breath the moment

54
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,960
meditate in silence for a while till near the

117
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:00,960
for e

118
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:33,799
so good morning again everyone warm greetings to all of you

119
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:38,559
especially those who slipped in a few minutes

120
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:45,200
late I'm delighted to be back with you for this fifth of five

121
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:52,200
teachings excuse me fifth of five teachings on inner and

122
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:58,120
interpersonal Wellsprings of Dharma wellbeing

123
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:04,320
this week's theme is on cultivating these qualities and they're in the context of

124
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:10,240
the Buddha often gave teachings to all kinds of people but

125
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:18,200
occasionally would give teachings about how to practice when things weren't going so great in the outer world and

126
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:24,279
gave the teaching of coming home to the practice staying home in the practice

127
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:30,360
making the practice our field of influence and our

128
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:36,720
refuge and in this teaching that I'm describing um this week he talked about

129
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,159
five benefits Wells Springs of well-being that get cultivated this way

130
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:48,760
inner um sort of an inner sense of spiritual

131
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:55,360
empowerment true inner beauty happiness inner wealth or heart

132
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:02,159
wealth and this last one that we're covering today Freedom

133
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:09,440
so Freedom Liberation is freedom from any trace of

134
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:16,840
mental Affliction any trace of greed hatred delusion ignorance in the heart

135
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:22,200
and mind no more fuel for that internal

136
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:29,919
optional kind of suffering I'll talk more about that later and it's freedom from causing intentional

137
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:36,039
harm any experience of freedom of the heart Letting

138
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:42,760
Go metabolized carefully can be onward leading in the path towards

139
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:49,200
Awakening onward leading and can make for a much happier

140
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,840
life so in this teaching the Buddha talks about two sort of ways the heart

141
00:33:54,840 --> 00:34:02,000
becomes free and a fully awakened person has experienced both of these the first

142
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:09,118
is Freedom by wisdom Freedom by knowledge deep wisdom and knowledge and

143
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:14,960
the second is Freedom by meditative death and the P depth excuse me

144
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:26,878
meditative deepness the poly for these areti wisdom Awakening and chti heart

145
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:33,200
Awakening now the second can be temporary or

146
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:40,679
permanent in any case it's powerful nourishing it resets an internal set

147
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:47,878
point or reference point for the rest of life this is

148
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:55,839
possible so I've talked about empowerment the first day spiritual power and the Buddha really considered

149
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:01,400
this Freedom this liberation of the heart and mind to be the most

150
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:06,599
consequential form of power all the good qualities we've

151
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:14,640
covered this week help contribute to it and to sort of unpack this topic a little more speak

152
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:20,680
to it I have one more story from the time of the Buddha and this is a story

153
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:28,359
of two good friends atisa and I think his name was kova something like that

154
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:34,920
and in Ancient India they were born within a day or two to families in neighboring Villages and the families

155
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:43,240
had already been friends so it's that beautiful thing many of you have experienced that's if you have kids where your kids friends become friends

156
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:49,760
or your parents were friends when you were born and so you've been friends with this person your whole life and it's a special kind of

157
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:55,520
friendship so they grew up together they went off riding horses together swimming

158
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:03,520
in Creeks going to forests and they were both in their own spheres their own Villages very popular and well

159
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:10,440
liked so um they went to a festival one day as young

160
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:15,560
men maybe adolescents together and it was a three-day festival and the first

161
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:22,480
day was wonderful and they had a lot of fun and it was it's great like folk music and entertainment and plays and

162
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:28,240
tricks and all that kind of stuff so they signed up for the second and the third day

163
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:34,359
but the second day they were both kind of less into it and then that night each

164
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:40,240
of them in their own beds had sort of difficult nights of tossing and

165
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:46,920
turning and it turns out that when they went back that third day there were much more

166
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:52,040
each was much more withdrawn and pensive and atisa was having these

167
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:58,079
thoughts of well death is universal why are we spending our time doing this when

168
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:05,200
we could be finding a way to completely end suffering to know the truth of life

169
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:11,480
before we're gone classic classic kind of young

170
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:16,839
person wisdom young person seeking

171
00:37:16,839 --> 00:37:23,359
so he um notices that his friend is also pensive and asks well we are withdrawn

172
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:28,960
what's up with you and wouldn't you know his friend kovala said this same thing

173
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:34,839
and like oh we're of the same mind we should leave the these Villages and go

174
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:41,000
off and find a good teacher and find a way to really understand the meaning of

175
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,920
life break through our suffering discover freedom and so they

176
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:56,640
did and as The Story Goes Around the time they did this was around the time that the Buddha to be was getting

177
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:02,880
married still in his household life and it was years before he left the Buddha

178
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:11,119
left and became a teacher brought his son into the order and um so they wandered around and

179
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:17,520
were finding teachers and not satisfied with any of them eventually they found one teacher who was brilliant with

180
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:24,040
knowledge and skepticism and Analysis and he really taught them

181
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:29,960
to critically look at what they were learning empirically look at it but he

182
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:36,680
didn't have any of the deeper teachings and so they learned a lot from him but were becoming dissatisfied

183
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:42,040
realizing that they really hadn't come to a full

184
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:48,599
understanding and so they went on and searched out still other teachers and other teachers and then one

185
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:56,079
day atisa is off asking for his food for the day in the neighborhood when he

186
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:01,680
encounters a fully awakened man

187
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:08,119
and he was immediately struck by this person's presence the calm the Stillness

188
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:14,800
that radiated from him the sense of peace and after they had both gotten

189
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:20,480
their meal he bowed down to him and said who is your teacher what have you learned you've clearly learned something

190
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,640
and I want to learn it and this monk was a little bit shy

191
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:31,240
and maybe a little bit skeptical of the newcomers um intentions people often

192
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:37,599
challenged themselves in each other in those days but he told him the teachings of

193
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:43,359
the Buddha in brief just like four stanzas or something and then told him who his teacher was and where his

194
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:51,119
teacher was and upon hearing those four stanas something in aa's heart just

195
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:56,760
opened up and he knew this is it this is the

196
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:04,680
way there was a deeper understanding a miniature significant Awakening in

197
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:12,560
him so he went and found his friend and told him and they went to see the Buddha

198
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:17,640
and joined a kind of a cohort of incoming

199
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:24,720
practitioners and because they had been so dedicated for years even decades and

200
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:32,720
had such Keen powers of some kind of mental analysis and understanding and

201
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:39,280
meditation both of them became fully awakened pretty

202
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:45,920
quickly and the Buddha recognizing their capacity made him made them his two

203
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:51,079
primary assistants of the order so that was an honor but it was also a lot of

204
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:58,240
work you got to kind of run the sa a lot of administrative interpersonal stuff and they also helped him teach

205
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:03,920
each and these two men were saruta and Maha molana those of you who are

206
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:11,319
familiar with the ancient teachings are familiar with them already I'm telling this story in part

207
00:41:11,319 --> 00:41:18,760
because of the importance of spiritual friendship as you're McKing along on the path and in part because these two

208
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:25,680
people exemplify two different expressions of Liberation while they both woke up both

209
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:33,480
ways through wisdom and through meditative depth saruta was much more of a wisdom

210
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:41,079
type he became a great systematizer a lot of details he was kind of like that day's version of a

211
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:48,480
software engineer or an information architect highly logical rational whereas

212
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:54,520
mahamana was extraordinarily skilled in meditative subtlety subtlety of the

213
00:41:54,520 --> 00:42:00,599
inner workings of the mind of meditative depth of different

214
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:10,200
states and saruta tended to bring people into the first beginnings of Awakening first

215
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:17,160
levels of it and Maham molana tended to train the more advanced practitioners in

216
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:23,000
depth so those are a couple of examples of expression of freedom I think you can

217
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:31,440
maybe get a sense of their different personality and there are others the nand Medina in the Buddhist time was

218
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,640
eloquent unsurpassed in her eloquence among the women foremost in teaching

219
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:43,960
especially of lay people and her Dharma sister pachara exemplified and modeled this

220
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:50,480
inner beauty that just Shone from her and this dedication to

221
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:59,440
Virtue excuse me and she became the foremost instructor of new nuns quite a

222
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:05,160
following so it can take many forms of expression this Awakening I've heard

223
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:13,200
stories of Awakened people in the Saigon Hills of Burma from colleagues and friends of mine and one exemplifies

224
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:20,760
utter peace and just radiates it to the point where it's palpable even walking into his space and another was happy and

225
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:28,440
light and joyful all of these are dimensions of the free heart

226
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:33,520
so again this Liberation is freedom from being impacted by Affliction from the

227
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:39,559
LIF denying forces that can come to us through Society our own inner more

228
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:44,960
primitive urges our upbringing it's freedom to respond with

229
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:52,599
Clarity without reactivity to whatever life brings not to make things worse for

230
00:43:52,599 --> 00:44:02,760
self others or anyone it's freedom to be okay to flourish in

231
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:10,960
any circumstances at all so to recap this kind of

232
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:18,000
freedom is what the Buddha considered the most potent form of

233
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,800
power and this week all of these other good qualities we've covered feed into

234
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:30,960
that nourish that capacity for the heartre and each Glimpse

235
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:37,480
