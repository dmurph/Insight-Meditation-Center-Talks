1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:09,259
readings and I'm very glad to be here with you

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:17,599
so in our training and emptiness

3
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:27,060
for this meditation the aspiration for us

4
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:33,079
is cutting through the ignorance of selfishness

5
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,218
and self-referential thinking

6
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,760
so if that's okay with you I propose that we adopt that as a common

7
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:54,300
aspiration for these few minutes and as always We Begin by

8
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,520
going to someplace empty as the Buddha told us to

9
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,619
seclusion we take a break from our worldly

10
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:12,600
concerns and we create physical seclusion

11
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,460
and mental seclusion

12
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:23,400
so we invite all of our worries and concerns

13
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:30,299
to have a seat outside of our meditation space they'll be okay out there

14
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,060
they don't need us for this meditation

15
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:42,860
so assuming your meditation posture

16
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:51,079
and if you're comfortable closing your eyes I really really recommend that

17
00:01:51,079 --> 00:02:00,500
I find it much more restful myself to listen to a guided meditation than to

18
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,920
look at one

19
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,599
and take a moment to

20
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:15,560
investigate your posture

21
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,580
how can you sit in a way that feels

22
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,620
settled relaxed

23
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:36,720
hopefully a bit empty and at the same time

24
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,680
being in touch the flow of life inside of us

25
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,400
and outside of us having some

26
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:57,500
awesome energetic quality in the body

27
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:08,959
I like to think of the energy coming up from the Earth

28
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,739
and it may or may not go through the Lakes but coming certainly coming up from the base

29
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:23,760
of the spine and allowing the head to be well

30
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,599
balanced certainly not I mean you might want to

31
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:37,140
bring it back a little ways and then

32
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:42,780
connecting our posture whether it's sitting

33
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:49,280
standing seating lying down

34
00:03:52,680 --> 00:04:01,159
connecting with their breathing long slow deep breath

35
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:14,780
and if you've found it beneficial if you imagine the flow of the breath

36
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,780
coming up from the base of the spine along the back

37
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:30,540
taking a slight pause between the inhale and the exhale at the crown of the hitch

38
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:38,660
and then gently letting the exhale come peacefully down the front

39
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:47,400
so in a way we're nourishing the settledness and the energy of the

40
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:53,220
body by the way that we breathe

41
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,139
bringing this intentionality

42
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:04,199
to our breathing attending

43
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,900
their breathing with mindfulness with care

44
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:13,160
and full awareness

45
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:32,639
the Brava vihara's the Divine abodes are excellent reparations

46
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:40,139
for the gradual descent into emptiness

47
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:46,160
we spent these first few days

48
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:52,440
relying on meta which is sort of like the mother of all four

49
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,780
of these Divine abodes

50
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:04,520
so again offer your whole body

51
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,418
a sense of exquisite friendliness

52
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:19,740
warmth accepting whatever it is

53
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:25,460
whatever way it is however it is

54
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:32,780
this precious body is what allows us to practice

55
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:49,639
and now I miss also to the mind

56
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:58,680
however our mind is it's I'm confident that we're doing our best

57
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,800
and that's fine that's good enough

58
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:11,120
thank you mind for your effort

59
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,800
and today as a way of maintaining a sense of

60
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,280
spaciousness in the mind

61
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:40,199
will transition to the next of the Divine abodes which is compassion

62
00:07:51,780 --> 00:08:00,979
so first wishing ourselves may I be free from all harm

63
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:08,060
may I be free from cruelty

64
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:18,180
we offer ourselves the well-wishing of being held

65
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:26,300
in compassion and we also do the holding

66
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:46,500
and now we off open up and offer this beautiful

67
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:52,440
feeling of care kindness

68
00:08:52,440 --> 00:09:00,440
and compassion to all beings everywhere we're suffering

69
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:13,080
the Buddha tells us that basically anything

70
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:20,000
that is instructed

71
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:27,839
ends up being suffering because it doesn't last

72
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:35,459
it's fleeting so as long as we're involved

73
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:44,360
in what's going on with us with the world

74
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:52,500
with others there may be even if it's going okay

75
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,320
there's no guarantee that it will always be okay

76
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:04,920
and we can extend our well-wishing to our own suffering

77
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,680
especially if we're experiencing pain

78
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:16,620
or health challenges are

79
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:24,000
emotional deceptions loss

80
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:33,180
and we reach out imagining all the beings in the world the humans

81
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:39,139
who are also experiencing some form of suffering

82
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:46,079
and we send our heartfelt wish that they too

83
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:52,339
be free from Barn from cruelty

84
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,920
for the suffering

85
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,600
and connecting with the nobility

86
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:25,399
of this form of kindness

87
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:35,959
well-wishing or any being who is suffering

88
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:46,760
and keeping that as a backdrop for the period of the meditation

89
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:04,380
to begin with we can experiment with

90
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:09,959
leaving the words behind and incarnating

91
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:16,700
compassion and our own body and mind

92
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:26,040
boundless compassion as we breathe in

93
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,000
and breathe out

94
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:38,360
our compassion is immeasurable

95
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,880
Unlimited

96
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,839
and we can liberate our hearts in mind

97
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,360
through this boundless compassion

98
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:26,660
getting our compassion go out as far as it wants to go

99
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:34,320
and feeling it as Unlimited

100
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,820
endless

101
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,440
and from this spacious compassion

102
00:13:52,800 --> 00:14:01,940
we can invite contemplation of Infinite Space

103
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:20,060
so again coming back the mindfulness of our energy

104
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,839
we take in not only

105
00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:32,540
rounding energy from the Earth

106
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:38,760
but today we'll focus on

107
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,720
receiving

108
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:52,279
the energy from Infinite Space

109
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:59,540
No Boundaries

110
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:21,860
so imagine yourself a little speck on planet Earth

111
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:29,720
sitting here but allowing your mind

112
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,760
to inhabit Infinite Space

113
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:51,620
it's space that's holding everything in the universe

114
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:55,100
and it's empty

115
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:16,760
and we too can be empty of ignorant claim to the self

116
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:27,139
I'm sure In This Moment each of us is free from cruelty

117
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:39,980
we don't need to obsess with our body or the bodies of others

118
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:50,120
we don't really need to obsess with accumulating more and more possessions

119
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:12,558
and with this spaciousness of the Mind dwelling and boundless compassion

120
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:19,938
and mindful attention to whatever arises

121
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:51,740
losing a peaceful heart

122
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:57,860
no need for the burden of selfing

123
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:03,900
thoughts arise we have the wisdom

124
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,039
but let them go

125
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:20,840
a mind that's like space is a wholesome and healing place to be

126
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:32,340
tasting the freedom of emptiness

127
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:38,000
the beauty of compassion

128
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:47,299
as we come to the end of this sitting

129
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:53,940
we appreciate the goodness of our practice

130
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:58,880
even or imperfect practice

131
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:09,299
and we continue to offer well-wishing

132
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:17,240
of compassion to all living beings including us

133
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:25,380
may we and all beings be safe

134
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:32,940
and protect it being safe

135
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:38,960
may we all dwell in kindness

136
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:47,480
contentedness at ease

137
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,039
may we abide in peace

138
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:58,980
and may all beings everywhere be free

139
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:05,899
into out that's all about together

140
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,220
thank you

141
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:24,240
uh I I want to express my uh deep appreciation

142
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,820
um to um both Gill and venerable analio

143
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:36,600
or their teachings on emptiness which I'm borrowing from

144
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,880
quite a bit this week

145
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:49,799
and um so today is the fourth in the series

146
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:56,779
of training and empty nuts and the step after what we did yesterday

147
00:27:56,779 --> 00:28:01,940
and the discourse we've been studying

148
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:07,760
um is Infinite Space

149
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:14,460
so Monday we focused on really becoming aware of

150
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:21,720
the inconstancy of everything that's conditioned

151
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:29,820
and because we and everything are just a flow rather than solid

152
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:36,059
um we're essentially empty

153
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:41,640
and what the Buddha stressed they need to be empty of

154
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,940
is empty of ideas of a self

155
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,120
and then on

156
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:03,419
Tuesday we we went to the part of the Congo where

157
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:10,140
he begins teaching Ananda about how to enter into emptiness and he starts with

158
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:16,200
the example that they're all there meditating together and

159
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:23,640
uh what what is not empty is the Sangha the monastic song The meditating there

160
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:30,419
and so that is the presence and he stresses

161
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:35,640
the importance of knowing not only what's present but

162
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:40,679
also was absent and he gave the example of

163
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:49,580
uh the Sangha there and that all being absent of all kinds of animals

164
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:56,399
and in the same way when we tend to reify anything we should

165
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:01,520
all we should always know that it's empty of itself

166
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:09,260
and then yesterday um

167
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:16,799
we move to the next step in the teaching which is to uh quiet

168
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:24,779
down on the details and meditate on

169
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:29,240
the Oneness of the Earth

170
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:37,340
so this is a way of electing the mind

171
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:45,080
and the step after that is Infinite Space

172
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:52,860
and um I'd like to just make a little aside

173
00:30:52,860 --> 00:31:00,480
that I learned that this week NASA has uh

174
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:09,360
celebrated its first year of the uh James Webb Space Telescope

175
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:16,260
in space and it has performed far beyond expectations

176
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:21,779
and in fact has revealed in um

177
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:27,659
our own Cosmic backyard images uh

178
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:34,440
of galaxies that were that arose

179
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:40,820
very close to the Big Bang to the beginning of the universe

180
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:46,320
and before this telescope in space

181
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,899
foreign ERS only had a handful of images of

182
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:58,320
early galaxies in the first one billion year years of existence

183
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:05,220
and now um they have hundreds and it is totally astonishing because

184
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:10,799
what they're seeing is clouds of

185
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:18,779
uh forming Stars that are swirling around

186
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:24,480
black holes so in the midst of

187
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:30,960
the space of the universe there's all this flow happening

188
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:37,559
and the fact that they could go back so far and see this the earliest

189
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:45,659
time of the universe it was like having um baby pictures of

190
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:53,100
the universe the cosmos and

191
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:59,279
in fact what these reveal is

192
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:04,399
how things were at the beginning of time so in a way

193
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:11,700
uh they they have the time uh in the early part of

194
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:17,279
um the cosmos is now available to humans in the form

195
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:22,100
of images extraordinary

196
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:30,140
so I'd like to spend um this the rest of his talk

197
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:35,880
uh reading to you um continuing from where we left off

198
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:45,260
yesterday in the uh shorter suta on emptiness

199
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:54,898
and I think um it would be nice just for you to listen

200
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,779
uh if you like you can close your eyes but I'm hoping that

201
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:07,260
uh dropping deep into the suto will be useful

202
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:17,520
the buddhisms again and uh not attending to the perception of

203
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:24,780
forest or perception of Earth a practitioner clearly knows

204
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:30,300
this field of perception is empty of the perception of forest

205
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:37,679
there is only this that is not emptiness the Oneness dependent on perception of

206
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:44,099
Earth thus one regards what is not there as

207
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:50,460
empty however as to what remains there

208
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:56,898
one clearly knows this is present

209
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:02,760
thus this is the genuine undistorted

210
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:09,680
completely pure dissent into emptiness

211
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,220
one attends to the Oneness dependent on the perception

212
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:23,059
of the sphere of Infinite Space

213
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:30,359
through the perception of the sphere of Infinite Space

214
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:36,079
the Mind gains confidence becomes settled

215
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:41,520
remains still and is inclined

216
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:47,940
towards release one clearly knows thus

217
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:52,578
whatever stress there might be

218
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:59,400
dependent on the perception of forest that is not present here

219
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:06,480
whatever stress there might be dependent on the perception of Earth

220
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:14,400
that is not present here there is only this measure of stress

221
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:20,880
the Oneness dependent on the perception of the sphere

222
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:28,160
of Infinite Space one clearly knows

223
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,420
this field of perception is empty

224
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:41,820
of the perception of Earth there is only this that is not emptiness

225
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:47,940
the Oneness dependent on the perception of this fear

226
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:55,380
of Infinite Space thus one regards what is not there as

227
00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:01,140
empty however as to what remains

228
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:07,140
one clearly knows this is present thus

229
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:13,200
this is the genuine undistorted completely pure

230
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,200
dissent into emptiness

231
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:28,500
you remember that in the beginning of this discourse the Buddha affirms that

232
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:33,960
he often abides and emptiness

233
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:41,838
and this is what Buddhas do and also Aura hunts fully awakened once

234
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:51,380
the Buddha often refers to this as um Pleasant abiding when he's meditating

235
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:57,740
and it's important to know that uh

236
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:03,240
this can also be done not just in seated meditation but in any

237
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:11,359
of the four postures sitting standing walking or lying down

238
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:18,000
we can imagine spaciousness

239
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:24,780
and emptiness as medicine

240
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:29,060
for the Fetter of conceit

241
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:40,640
so with that um

242
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:49,260
I'd like to um suggest that we

243
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:56,359
in as many of our daily activities as we can see if we can

244
00:38:56,359 --> 00:39:02,700
perceive spaciousness and remember

245
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:09,260
that everything is empty of itself

246
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:19,460
thank you for your attention thank you for your practice
