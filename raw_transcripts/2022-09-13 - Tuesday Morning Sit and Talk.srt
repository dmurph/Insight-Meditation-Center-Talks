1
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:53,520
so warm hello welcome to this meditation

2
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,759
and i think it's fairly well known that

3
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,120
buddhism doesn't think very highly

4
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,840
of the kind of desires that have to do with craving or

5
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,960
clinging and grasping what's less

6
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,000
known is that buddhism has a lot to do

7
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,840
with desires that can be characterized as aspiration

8
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,039
uh inspiration even but i like the word aspiration

9
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:39,039
and the distinction between those is that the ones that buddhism

10
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,159
thinks poorly of the ones that bring suffering are the ones that one way or the other

11
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:51,200
close us down contract us tighten us

12
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,120
limit us or oppress us even

13
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:04,800
and aspiration are the desires that open us up and the word aspiration is derived from

14
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:11,680
the word in latin that's connected to breathing just like respiration is to breathe it's

15
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:19,440
our breathing system uh and um and uh so the idea of um aspiration that

16
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,279
comes from the opening breath the expanding breath the breath that kind of the breathing

17
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:31,120
that helps us become whole or full and so i think of aspiration as a

18
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:39,040
movement towards wholeness aspiration is for me is very much about

19
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:45,279
a desire has more to do i think for me

20
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:50,399
with the focus of desire the object of desire and aspiration has a lot more to

21
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:57,200
do with the source of inspiration inside the source of openness

22
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,959
inspiration creativity possibility the the something deep

23
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:12,000
inside that wants to kind of emerge and blossom come to fruition

24
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,120
and so to uh in buddhism we aspire to becoming free

25
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,480
aspire to becoming whole and the path to that is to be whole

26
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,760
and to allow the aspiration of being present to really help us to fill up

27
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:37,200
into the present moment and added to that is the aspiration for what is beneficial

28
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,519
what is good uh what is um happiness and delight

29
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:50,800
and that comes together this kind of ability to focus on this wholeness of happiness wholeness of goodness

30
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:57,200
that this place of aspiration can if we can connect to the deep inside and let it

31
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:03,760
emerge maybe with each breath that each breath is

32
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:10,240
it carries the aspiration to fullness aspiration to connect to

33
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,079
that which is good in us of course there are challenges we have of course there are all kinds of other

34
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:23,760
things happening within us and not to at any kind of way push them away or

35
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,040
or somehow dismiss them offhand but to

36
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:35,360
have this aspiration there's a growth to presence to

37
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:42,320
mindfulness that becomes full where there's lots of space for all of who we are

38
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:49,120
and we don't get fixated on the parts that are difficult they are held within this wider whole

39
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:56,720
of what is beneficial and what is good so to

40
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,720
take a meditation posture and ideally you take a posture that

41
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,880
there's a room or for becoming cold

42
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:15,440
where in a way all of ourselves is included one of the reasons to sit cross-legged

43
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:22,839
if you can is that a little bit more of a kind of i think it's easier to have a feeling of all the whole body comes

44
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:29,839
together then when we're sitting in a chair or at least when i've sat in the chair i often feel like my lower part of my half

45
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:38,440
my body is not really as connected to the upper part but cross-legged it all comes here

46
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,839
and but even if you're lying down maybe there's some way of laying

47
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:53,600
that um the body is symmetrical or the body is

48
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,600
laying on its back so that the chest a little bit is open and exposed

49
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:08,720
to be and then to gently close your eyes

50
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:17,360
and if what i'm about to say makes sense for you great if not don't worry about it

51
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,720
see if you can bring yourself to the source the beginning

52
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,079
of breathing where does your breathing begin

53
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,839
where in your body is the first indication first little hint

54
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,680
that inhale has begun

55
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,399
is it a little movement in the belly a little movement in the chest

56
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,560
a little tug or tingling the nostrils

57
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:06,320
and from that beginning point of inhale

58
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,240
the inhale grows if you're breathing quickly it might

59
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:19,440
grow very fast if your breathing slows down

60
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,720
you might have a sense of

61
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,839
leisure space time

62
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:37,120
to really feel the growth the expansion of the fullness

63
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,519
of the inhale

64
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,560
and after when you get to the top of the inhale

65
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:03,760
maybe you can feel the letting go the releasing

66
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,000
the settling of the chest the belly

67
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,959
as you exhale all the way to the end of the exhale

68
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:23,040
to the last sensation that represents expresses the exhale

69
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,959
maybe it brings you back to that place where the inhale begins

70
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,519
where the exhale ends and the inhale begins

71
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:53,560
and as you inhale and feel the your lungs fill with oxygen

72
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:02,399
maybe you can feel a little sense of growing fullness of awareness

73
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:11,639
maybe a fullness in your whole body or your torso your rib cage

74
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:33,600
and as you exhale letting go of your thoughts and concerns

75
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:41,199
in a way the more you can let go of your thoughts and make space in your mind

76
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:50,279
that space can receive more fully the your fullness of being

77
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,279
okay

78
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,840
and then as you breathe in see if you can have a

79
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,679
almost almost a silent aspiration

80
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,000
for well-being

81
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:52,400
an aspiration that recognizes your potential for a sense of well-being

82
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,039
maybe because once upon a time you felt that way

83
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,679
and i used the word well-being to encompass many possibilities of

84
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:10,720
happiness and joy and satisfaction peace

85
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,840
whatever you're inspired by

86
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,840
and have an opening aspiration

87
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,039
for your own well-being

88
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,840
and as you inhale

89
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:43,039
let the expansive and the fullness of the inhale

90
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:49,520
carry and spread that wish for well-being

91
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,720
out into the body where maybe you can feel

92
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:03,320
in the wholeness of yourself some hints some traces of well-being

93
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:22,080
letting your mind be quiet as you exhale so breathing

94
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:28,520
fullness aspiration

95
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,440
for wellness

96
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:40,480
connects you more and more to the present moment

97
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,840
to here and now of your experience here in your body

98
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:51,880
this is the place in the present

99
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:59,039
where your wholeness your well-being

100
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:08,400
can arise on the wings of your aspiration

101
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,320
the wings of your breathing

102
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:32,158
breathing in inhaling inhaling in such a way

103
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:38,720
that it opens you up from the inside to the present moment

104
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,480
it opens you up from the inside

105
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:58,360
to your body's experience of the present moment

106
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:35,360
re inhaling with an aspiration for well-being

107
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:43,919
as a potential possibility here now in this body

108
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,840
the opening aspiration

109
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:31,600
aspiration is itself a form of well-being

110
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:40,919
aspiration has a goodness in it and so when we breathe in

111
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:47,760
when we inhale and let the chest expand the belly open up

112
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:55,840
becoming whole with oxygen full

113
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:03,279
let that also carry the goodness of your aspiration for well-being

114
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:11,919
for wellness for happiness and let that goodness of aspiration

115
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:18,000
be carried by your inhale throughout your

116
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:27,000
body the body that expands as you breathe in

117
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:02,280
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

118
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:08,800
maybe as you inhale and feel the chest expand

119
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:16,359
the lungs fill imagine

120
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:25,760
that your aspiration and aspiration for the welfare of the world

121
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:34,520
rises and spreads out from your in your inhale to cover the whole world

122
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:59,440
as you breathe in you your expansion of the body

123
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:06,559
spreads your aspiration for the good will to the whole world

124
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:16,240
and as you breathe out you might say may it be so

125
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:30,400
an aspiration for the welfare of all beings is itself a wholesome and

126
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:36,240
good beneficial state to have for oneself

127
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,520
there's goodness in it and as you breathe and spread your

128
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:47,040
aspiration for the welfare of all beings maybe you can feel

129
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:53,599
maybe physically maybe in the heart the goodness of that

130
00:36:53,599 --> 00:37:00,000
the wellness of that the kind of aspiration that's opening

131
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:08,838
expansive from a place of inspiration

132
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:24,240
and may it be that our collective

133
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:31,920
well-wishing of the world for others spread from our meditation community

134
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:38,960
out into our neighborhoods our towns our lands

135
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:44,400
to the people we somehow rather encounter or learn about

136
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:50,280
or communicate with today

137
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:57,440
may the goodness of our aspiration spread across the lands

138
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:04,320
by how we speak and how we act and how we think of others

139
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:13,280
may all beings be happy may all beings be safe

140
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,799
may all beings be free

141
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:33,619
[Music]

142
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:44,960
so this is the second talk on this week's theme of lovingkindness

143
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:50,720
as one of the divine abodes immeasurables

144
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:56,320
and so the the word for the pali word the buddhist word for

145
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:04,960
loving kindness is metta m-e-tta and it's a cognate to the word mitta

146
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,000
which means friend and so part of the connotations of

147
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:18,160
metta is friendliness and friendliness is a basic attitude of

148
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:23,760
respecting people being kind to people appreciating people

149
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,680
being open to to kind of a friendly exchange a kind

150
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,960
exchange with people and it's possible to be friendly

151
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:42,880
with people who you don't really like or who are challenging in variety of ways

152
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:50,800
and so the word loving kindness which is i think a beautiful concept and word in english

153
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:57,920
for some people might not really represent meta as fully as other english translations

154
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:03,040
some people the idea of love has a very high bar and

155
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:08,480
to have loving kindness kindness which is filled with love

156
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:14,400
it's hard to do like for people who are challenging for us maybe there are people who we find difficult to love

157
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:20,079
because they're just you know maybe doesn't have to explain why but

158
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:26,000
there are challenging people that exist in our lives and we encounter and uh

159
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,280
and so to love them might be you know unreasonable and

160
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:36,839
to hold ourselves up to some kind of standard we're supposed to love everyone might not be

161
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:43,839
realistic but it is possible to have good will for everyone to be friendly for everyone

162
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:50,480
and and friendly towards the strangers friendly a sense of hospitality

163
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:56,480
for anybody that we encounter and so uh it might be that a

164
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:04,160
word that translates meta more appropriately into english is the is the word good will

165
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:10,079
where there's a uh in an aspiration an intention a willingness

166
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:15,280
um to spread our goodness to extend our goodness

167
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,319
uh to others so they feel safe with us they feel

168
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:25,760
happy with us they feel that we have their best interest in mind we have their good interest in mind

169
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:33,200
we're there to support their welfare not there to support their their ill we're not there trying to undermine them or be

170
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:38,400
critical of them or diminish who they are in some way

171
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,680
and the um

172
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:49,359
so good will i like also like the word kindness as a

173
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:54,960
as a translation of meta because kindness has like uh for me

174
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:00,319
implies more than just a feeling or an attitude kindness has connotations for

175
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:07,280
me of you actually something an extension towards other people uh there's expression of you know we

176
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:14,079
have kind words we have a kind gaze we have a kind action that kindness is good will can just be

177
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:19,599
that you kind of radiate a sense of well wishing for someone but kindness implies a little bit more

178
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:27,040
action for me and so i like the word kindness just simply kindness as a translation from metta

179
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:34,160
in the ancient buddhist texts metta is described this way

180
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:42,319
the primary characteristic of metta is to promote the welfare

181
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:47,520
of all beings to promote beneficial conditions for others

182
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:54,319
so this idea of wanting to benefit wanting things to be beneficial wanting and it says beneficial conditions

183
00:42:54,319 --> 00:43:01,200
so it doesn't necessarily mean that you have to be the one who provides them with those conditions but there's a

184
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:07,599
genuine wish that may the conditions of their life be such that they have happiness and well-being

185
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:12,960
may they experience welfare and well it's a you know big difference

186
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,000
between simply wishing that and doing something for it uh we shouldn't underestimate the

187
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,160
tremendous value of having good will for others i know i've been the recipient of people's

188
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:31,200
simple goodwill and it makes a difference something inside of me kind of opens up or is buoyed or inspired by

189
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,759
just just knowing that people are thinking well of me

190
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:44,400
the um it says that the uh that the core

191
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:50,880
of loving kindness is focusing on what is beneficial so it requires some sense of what is

192
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:56,079
beneficial um you know if simply to uh wish someone

193
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:01,920
win uh a very big lottery ticket and you know to get really you know amazingly

194
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:08,319
wealthy uh is that really for their benefit as i i've said enough times that there's

195
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:15,119
been studies made that people who win big chunks of money in a lottery uh a year after winning it

196
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:20,960
they're less happy than they were before they won it so uh you know what to really wish

197
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:27,440
people what's genuinely beneficial what's really supportive for them and nice for them and

198
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:32,640
it might not be wealth it might not be status it might not be

199
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:39,040
material goods it might be that uh you know sometimes it can be so simple

200
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:44,720
some of the simplest things are some of the most fulfilling and happy um

201
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:50,640
i think that uh learning how to breathe within with a breath is just easy and easeful breath

202
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:56,079
is a phenomenal wealth the buddha said that for a monastic who

203
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:03,119
is not monastics are not supposed to acquire money does not have money or wealth he said that

204
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:09,280
wealth for a monastic is meta is loving kindness is good will

205
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:14,400
and and this is a wonderful kind of kind of juxtaposition that

206
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:20,800
having good will for others a wealth for oneself

207
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:27,280
there's so much goodness in that aspiration that the goodness of the aspiration kind of benefits and

208
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:32,880
feeds or nourishes something in us and this idea

209
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:40,560
that uh so that we're focusing on that beneficial both for others and for ourselves it's kind of this mutual way

210
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:46,640
and this is where i really love this english word aspiration as i've said earlier that

211
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:52,240
aspiration is a beneficial desire that buddhism champions aspiration is a good

212
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:58,800
thing and um and that it's a desire which is opening desire

213
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:05,920
which is freeing desire which helps us feel more connected one that it contains within it

214
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:11,200
beneficial seeds beneficial goodness in it so that when we breathe with

215
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:18,240
aspiration inspiration that we get filled with something good

216
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:24,640
it nourishes something there for in ourselves and so they have the aspiration for others welfares we're benefiting

217
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:30,880
ourselves as we're benefiting others the

218
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,920
we know the the description goes on and says the manifestation

219
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:42,720
of metta is the removal of malice the removal of ill will

220
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:48,880
so you we know that loving kindness is present in a stable strong way when there's

221
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:54,960
absolutely no ill will there's only a good will that's there

222
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:01,280
um and its proximate cause

223
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:07,359
is the loveliness of beings what a great expression

224
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:15,599
that the approximate cause the approximate condition that brings about this method is seeing the loveliness and beings

225
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:20,880
so to how do we see the beauty in other people

226
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,480
i think that one of the things that requires is slowing down

227
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:33,440
taking the time to pay attention to that if we're we could be our minds go fast

228
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:41,200
they pay attention to all kinds of things we have a lot of desires we have a lot of wants with a lot of preoccupations concerns fears and so

229
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:47,359
when we encounter someone sometimes all these different things are swirling around and

230
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:53,520
and making the mind fast or caught up in things but to stop

231
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:58,960
and take time it doesn't have to be anybody notices your pausing that long

232
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:04,640
but to learn to appreciate the loveliness of beings

233
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:10,240
the beauty of other people everyone has loveliness

234
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:16,800
everyone has it and to begin to tune into that and that's what again if we go back to

235
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:22,319
meditation practice as we discover our own loveliness

236
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:28,400
as we start sitting and opening up to our beauty beauty within the capacity

237
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:34,800
for integrity and wholeness of lack of conflict lack of ill will

238
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:40,559
lack of hostility lack of greed this beautiful place inside that where

239
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:48,240
this kind of whole other way of being lives is with us and we recognize the beauty in ourselves

240
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:56,160
then it's more easy to see that in other people it's there and if we don't see it in other people

241
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:02,000
one principle you might want to consider as a principle not as a truth

242
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,839
is that maybe just maybe you don't see it in others because you

243
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:13,839
haven't seen it in yourself and if you really see it in yourself you'll see it even even in people who

244
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:19,599
are quite difficult you'll see there's the seed maybe it's hidden even from them

245
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:24,640
but it's a seed it's a potential it's something something lovely to appreciate

246
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:31,520
in others and and it says then the last part of this

247
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:36,720
description is that meta uh fails

248
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:42,559
uh when it leaves leads to uh the translation here is a sticky

249
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:49,119
affection so affection for others which was a neediness and wantingness and a graspingness

250
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:55,280
so that's not meta meta is open-handed

251
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:01,920
the hands don't grasp don't hold on to anything with meta just like a freely offered things are just offered freely

252
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:08,319
and here you can have it you can have my good will and and it's offered freely and i'm not

253
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:13,838
going to hold on and demand anything in return

254
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:19,760
and so

255
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:27,920
and meta is an aspiration you know for all the emphasis we do in mindfulness about being in the present moment

256
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:33,040
that it's not really the full story of a full liberated life

257
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:39,599
that there's also a place for having a sense of potential and possibility for others

258
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:46,160
and wishing that for them certainly wishing it for them to have it now but a sense of the possibility they

259
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:51,359
can grow into that and may it be so may it be

260
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:56,559
and so that aspiration i this is what i would like

261
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:03,839
my wishes my heartfelt wish my wholehearted wish is really that other people feel well

262
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:10,240
and happy you don't have to tell people that you have this wish for them

263
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:16,079
you don't even tell people you have good will for them sometimes that

264
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:21,599
some relationships are such that it's too complicated if you tell them um

265
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:28,640
and because they'll there are people with sticky affection or people who will you know are even mean sometimes and all

266
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:35,440
kinds of difficult ways of being so the wonderful art of metta

267
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:41,839
is knowing when to do it privately and but just to have good will for

268
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:49,200
others and i've had goodwill and i've heard stories of people say that they have very difficult person in their lives and they

269
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:56,319
decided to just have good will for them kind of privately sometimes they do hold them in their in their loving kindness

270
00:51:56,319 --> 00:52:02,480
when they're not together and when they are together they're kind of like just kind of reflecting on their well-wishing

271
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:09,599
for that person and nothing special is said nothing special is done that expresses the good will but just

272
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:15,760
that attitude seems to change this circumstance and the person seems to become kinder or

273
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:22,880
less threatening or less you know difficult to be with

274
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:30,079
finally uh this this brahmaviharas this practice of loving kindness

275
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:35,200
it's both a an expression that can be in

276
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:40,400
present moment just to express to live with loving kindness and goodness and

277
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:47,280
well-being wishing well-being or friendliness to others but it's also in a

278
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:54,960
as i keep saying an aspiration and an aspiration is a choice

279
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:03,280
and uh and it's possible to marshal together a choice a decision a wish

280
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:09,200
yes i would like i want to be kind here i want to be friendly here i want to wish

281
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:14,559
this person well i see what's beneficial i see their loveliness

282
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:21,920
and to live that life where we choose to have that aspiration to be part of

283
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:28,079
what rises out of us and opens us it doesn't mean so what it means is you

284
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:34,880
don't have to feel loving kindness you don't have to feel friendly

285
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:40,960
maybe that those feelings will follow in the wake of the aspiration but the wish is something deeper than a

286
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:47,359
feeling and we do have some choice over that so don't wait to have the feeling

287
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:54,319
to have the wish and if the wish is an aspiration it'll carry with it goodness it'll carry with

288
00:53:54,319 --> 00:54:01,680
it welfare and you'll benefit from having that wish if it's sincere

289
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:07,280
may all of us have the sincere wish to benefit ourselves and others

290
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:13,119
and may we be carried and expanded and come to fullness

291
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:19,280
in our kindness and good will and may you for this day that we

292
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:24,880
next 24 hours until we meet again why don't you take some ex do some

293
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:29,920
experiments take some risks and see if you can make a little bit of

294
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:36,400
this meta-loving kindness good will a kind of a theme you carry with you through the day

295
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:42,720
and uh reflect on it think of it expand extend it to others and see what

296
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:48,400
you learn about loving kindness that in the next 24 hours that you didn't know

297
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:53,680
you don't know right now so thank you very much i look forward to

298
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:57,078
our time tomorrow

299
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,079
you
