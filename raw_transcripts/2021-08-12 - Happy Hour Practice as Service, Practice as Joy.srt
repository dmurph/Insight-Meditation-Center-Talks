246

so yes uh thank you very much uh

247
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:59,040
this is my first time here and it's it's a it's a wonderful experience

248
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:04,079
i really enjoyed the meditation and the group that i was in what i

249
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:09,119
shared was my experience with meta

250
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:14,480
and if i'm out running errands or doing something like that and

251
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:20,800
i'm not able to stop and give assistance to an automobile accident or

252
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:26,079
say hello to a homeless person uh i send them meta

253
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:34,000
and using meta practice uh i feel it on an emotional level

254
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,720
and i feel that that's when it's most effective for me

255
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:44,559
thank you yeah beautiful beautiful thank you so much for sharing this cedric and welcome

256
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:50,400
to happy hour lovely to have you with us yay

257
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:58,240
and and really appreciate what you shared there's a sense that and i want to highlight what you said um

258
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:05,359
because there are times there are times in the world that it's not possible for us uh to to act

259
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:12,880
uh to to physically act out of compassion and yet sometimes you know we don't want to turn on our eyes and just

260
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:19,760
avoid looking at people or avoid them all together because that's painful to that's really painful that avoidance of

261
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:26,079
oh i can't rhyme in a rush but but what you are really highlighting and what you're bringing forth is this sense of

262
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:32,000
good will kindness i care for you may you be well i i see you i see you in my

263
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:38,960
heart i see your suffering and i care for you and i care for me because in this moment i can't

264
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:46,079
help you support you and and i see you i care for you i wish you well so it's it's

265
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:51,760
it's so much better than avoiding or distracting ourselves it's it's it's

266
00:49:51,760 --> 00:50:00,319
sharing good will even if we're not able to if we were able to and again it's this hip it's it's it's almost like um

267
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:06,160
it's along the lines of training our hearts because you actually if you know you are moved

268
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:11,680
you arguing the meta it's like well actually maybe i can stop to help you know who knows you know that turn

269
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:17,520
actually can happen which is very different from turning one's one's gaze all together so thank you for bringing

270
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:25,440
that in beautiful beautiful practice of compassion in in real time in the world so

it isn't always perfect and that's okay yes absolutely and it's lovely that that

275
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:57,839
becomes clear especially when we talk in small groups and we realize no

276
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:03,680
it's we're not defective this is just part of this practice the mind gets just
