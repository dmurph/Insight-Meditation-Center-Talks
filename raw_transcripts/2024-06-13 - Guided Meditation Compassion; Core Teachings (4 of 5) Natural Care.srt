1
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:08,359
so there I think that technological Marvels have all been attended

2
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,920
to so they all need their particular

3
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,520
attention so welcome to

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,800
the this meditation and as an introduction to it I'd like to mention

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,279
that um I have a particular

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,960
very special relationship maybe even reverence to places in the natural

7
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:44,920
world where that are untouched or off bounds for human beings there's a place

8
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:51,360
near here um in their in the San Francisco Peninsula that's a water

9
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,480
district they have a big reservoir for water for San Francisco and other cities

10
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:03,199
but some of the land around it uh no one is supposed to walk on it's off limits

11
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,280
and I'm sure that uh some people in the water district have occasion to go on it

12
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,080
but occasionally but it's basically off limits and it isn't like I feel like

13
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:21,640
it's private property exactly but I feel like it's protected from Human

14
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,040
encroachment and um and I feel I'm so happy that there's a place where in the

15
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,159
natural world that um that it's inaccessible to me it's just there it's

16
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,280
a kind of sacred Place special place where the natural world can just kind of

17
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,360
be it be itself be be its own thing and uh the animals there the deer the

18
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:54,479
mountain lions they can just be um be outside the the influence or outside the

19
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:02,159
desires and preferences of humans so I'm sure there's other ways of understanding this water district land but there are

20
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,280
these places in the world that are considered sacred that some people you know you don't visit you can leave you

21
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:14,560
you stay away from and um and so in the same way in

22
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:21,879
ourselves there are Realms or aspects of our being our inner

23
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:29,360
World which um also belongs to a kind of dimension of Life which I feel doesn't

24
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,959
doesn't it shouldn't be part or is not part of our desires and preferences and

25
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:42,319
what we construct and what even what we interpret and the meaning making we add to it that it's there and it's operating

26
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:48,560
in its own way as a natural functioning as a

27
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,159
natural phenomena that uh can operate with us

28
00:02:54,159 --> 00:03:00,159
for us maybe even guide us but it's not something we can appropriate it's not

29
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:06,319
something that we can claim to be ours or that we can

30
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,440
um uh you know that we that we're really

31
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:18,040
outside the realm of appropriating as mine or me outside

32
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:25,959
the realm of uh uh how I think about myself all the ideas I have about myself

33
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:36,400
the conclusions the judgments about my life there's a whole other operation that's operating here and um and it's

34
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:46,280
found uh or touched into and get be known by a Deep Quiet a Stillness within

35
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:54,640
a quieting of the constructing mind a quieting of the mind that's

36
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:01,360
reacting and thinking and planning and judging and um uh making meaning of

37
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,040
things and predicting the future and hanging on to the

38
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:14,200
Past uh that quieting of the mind that that is concerned with Me Myself and

39
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:20,680
mine who I am what's what my experiences are what's happening to me certainly

40
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:26,560
those those kinds of mental thinking has a place in life but uh I don't want to

41
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,639
rule it out completely but um there's something Beyond it something deeper

42
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:36,919
than that when that gets quiet that there's a natural

43
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:44,120
operation and part of that are belongs to the realm of Love of

44
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:50,720
compassion of some deep sense of tenderness or

45
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,840
care and and maybe there the human qualities of nurture nurturing and

46
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:02,960
nourish nurturing like a parent the nurturing that a parent might feel for a

47
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:10,880
little baby maybe these are instincts instinctual in us they're deeper

48
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,120
than Bel belongs to the human species they belong to maybe all

49
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:22,600
mammals that we have certain maybe hormones and chemicals and

50
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:31,720
orientations that brings forth a a natural capacity to care to

51
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:40,080
love that um should not be appropriated that should be left alone can operate in us

52
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:46,680
through us with us but um it's not about us

53
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,960
exactly and uh it's not about how well we can do something it's not

54
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:59,000
about being successful or not about failing it's about becoming quiet enough

55
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,520
or still enough to be able to

56
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,960
listen on the other side of all our thoughts and thinkings and

57
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:20,720
ruminations to be able to [Music] feel below the level of our anxiety or

58
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:27,360
disappointments or desires aversions

59
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:34,080
resentments there is a place that I think inside that is sacred a place of

60
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:42,240
that I have certain reverence for that it's not exactly me I can't

61
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:50,039
appropriate it but it's there and

62
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:58,560
invaluable and it's connected to very deeply connected to the idea of care and

63
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:08,039
compassion love kindness an instinct towards

64
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:15,840
nurturing and so maybe we can sit here with that as a reference point for

65
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:22,199
today that it's sit to meditate in a [Music]

66
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:31,280
field with an intention with an orientation towards being comp

67
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,080
compassionate or loving or kind

68
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:43,080
nurturing for ourselves and whatever is here within us whatever is challenging

69
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:49,240
within us whatever our thinking mind is

70
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:55,360
churning up and and

71
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,560
U the way the thinking mind is turning up and casting its

72
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:08,440
difficulties through our muscles and our body and our emotions it's difficult to be a human

73
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:17,879
being and deep within us there is a instinct to care to nourish

74
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:26,080
nurture compassion and love so to assume a meditation

75
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:34,039
posture perhaps viewing the

76
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:38,880
posture as a form of love or

77
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,518
care for

78
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,240
ourselves gently closing the

79
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:59,480
eyes and this closing of the eyes to be done with care with love with

80
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,160
with a sense of

81
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,959
purpose to nourish to [Music]

82
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:17,560
heal to free this human being from

83
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:31,279
suffering to become aware of the body breathing not as an

84
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:36,480
exercise in concentration or becoming

85
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,640
present but [Music] rather as an

86
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,360
instinct to bring care

87
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,920
love maybe a parental or

88
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:05,720
grandparent love for what's at the core of

89
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:12,959
yourself maybe the core from which breathing is intimately

90
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,399
connected where we sense that breathing

91
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:30,680
itself is arises from a deep source

92
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,640
of keeping ourselves alive of nourishing

93
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:43,040
ourselves providing us with the energy the

94
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,480
Vitality that allows us to be

95
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,959
here so much of our inner systems

96
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,980
keeping us in homeostasis keeping us in Balance keeping us

97
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,089
[Applause]

98
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,680
alive keeping us

99
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:33,120
alive is for our own benefit allowing this deeper place of ourselves

100
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:41,040
to care and benefit us that's beyond our thinking mind engineering

101
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:47,279
mind judging mind to sit

102
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:52,519
present for our natural capacity for

103
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
love

104
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160

and as we come to the end of this sitting might there

127
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:50,559
be for you enough quiet or calm or maybe inner sensitivity to your

128
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:58,519
body and heart that you could feel

129
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:07,919
that operating system within that is has to do with nurturing or

130
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:15,158
caring has gentle Compassion or

131
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:25,000
love the kind of source of motivation and Instinct that comes with caring for

132
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,320
holding a newborn baby

133
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:39,039
or holding someone's hand as they're dying

134
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:47,039
peacefully there are times in our life where we're touched

135
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,640
deeply by our shared Humanity our connections to

136
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,799
others that bypasses the our biases and our

137
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:06,840
judgments and our histories and our even our created identities

138
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,520
and ideas of Me Myself and

139
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,720
mine and as we sit here and bring this to a

140
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:28,480
conclusion can you be still and gaze upon the world kindly

141
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:38,080
gaze upon the world with compassion and love not wanting anything from

142
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:45,720
anyone being able to gaze upon everyone with no

143
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,200
fear no

144
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:58,880
aversion be still and gaze upon everyone kindly

145
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:08,320
and with that nurturing caring

146
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:18,200
instinct to wish everyone well may all beings be

147
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:28,679
happy may all beings be safe may all beings be peaceful

148
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:36,480
may all beings be free and may all beings

149
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:43,360
know that there is care and love and compassion in this

150
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:51,720
world and that it's directed to them as well

151
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,289
[Music]

152
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:07,390
[Music]

153
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:14,220
thank you [Music]

154
00:27:52,919 --> 00:28:00,080
so hello everyone and welcome to this fourth thought for

155
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:07,360
for fourth talk where I try to articulate the core teachings that uh

156
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:12,760
kind of under underly what motivates me to teach and what guides how I

157
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:20,240
teach and um so it's kind of a hopefully a clear way of letting people know what

158
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:26,320
I'm about because um some of you have been listening to me for a long time and it

159
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:32,279
feels like it's the responsible thing for me to uh kind of be very direct

160
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:39,960
about what I think are my core um my core

161
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:46,640
um you know orientations as a teacher perspectives and uh so yesterday I

162
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,760
talked about uh how there's a strong naturalistic

163
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:58,360
orientation uh in how I want how I teach and how I I practice

164
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:07,080
that um that there's a um an orientation perspective

165
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:15,159
that there is a natural functioning within us that uh that uh benefits us

166
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:20,799
that we're tapping into and allowing to move through us and allowing to awaken Us in

167
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:28,640
us that um as we Orient towards suffering and the end of suffering

168
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,919
as we free ourselves from fixed ideas and fixed

169
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:40,679
views that uh it'll gives room for this this natural functioning of ourselves to

170
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:45,880
to function to operate and uh just like if you keep

171
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:52,399
your cut clean it allows a natural functioning of the body healing

172
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:58,320
to heal the cut just as some of the ways in which

173
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,559
our hearts get broken if similarly kind of metaphorically we keep the heart

174
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:08,760
clean we don't interfere with its own natural working give room for it get

175
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:13,880
room for the pain there is a natural kind of healing or movement towards

176
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:19,240
Health that the heart knows what to do better than our thinking mind our

177
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:26,760
engineering mind our mind that's trying to figure out or trying to understand and so to sit in meditation

178
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:32,480
and get out of our own way and uh not only do the practice but

179
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:38,000
also be practiced be practiced by the practice allow ourselves to be changed

180
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,440
and moved by this deeper Instinct deeper movement that happens within us it's not

181
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:52,399
uh our doing and we learn over time that a lot of the things that we do interfere with

182
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:58,159
the movement towards freedom and Liberation so one of the core aspects of

183
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:03,760
all this this naturalistic kind of orientation is that there is within us a

184
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:12,480
natural movement towards the the whole category whole to use a category word that the whole uh

185
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:20,000
phenomena of love the whole uh movements of the heart that we can

186
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:27,600
have and that uh one of the deepest ones is the instinct to uh nurture the

187
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:34,960
instinct to care for that which we uh value that's which we love that which we

188
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,679
are touched by or moved by and um and so sometimes that's done

189
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:51,919
for who we feel closest to sometimes it's done for um uh you know for small

190
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:58,799
babies uh I think I've to mentioned this that recently that I knew a man who

191
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:05,639
volunteered in the local hospital working with um uh the prematurely born

192
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:11,159
babies who uh needed to be held and have physical contact in order to develop

193
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:17,440
normally and he that was his volunteer job just to hold premature babies and it

194
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:24,440
changed him softened him opened him over the time that he did it uh some people have this relationship

195
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:30,000
to animals or little puppies or kittens that uh something happens or an injured

196
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:37,360
bird that we gently take care of and um or sometimes uh some of us have been at

197
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,799
the bedside of people who are dying and um and when sometimes they're dying

198
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:50,480
slowly and peacefully and uh and there's a can be a deep tenderness a deep uh

199
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:56,679
feeling of love and care that in that bedside

200
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:03,240
occasion and and um so as we settle in meditation as we get quiet in

201
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:09,840
meditation that there are these uh very human capacities we

202
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:15,720
have that are operating that are I like to think of them

203
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:22,039
independent of our thinking mind or our constructive mind our reactive mind our

204
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:28,519
imaginary mind the mind that builds up stories and uh images of ourselves and

205
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:34,960
lives in these kind of cathedrals lives in these kind of cities of Concepts and

206
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:42,200
that are culturally and familiarly and personally kind of created that uh we don't even realize

207
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:47,240
how much we are conditioned by our culture by our

208
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:52,919
society by our language by our family and we just think that

209
00:33:52,919 --> 00:34:00,639
uh you know our very idea of who we are as a self and who we are in relationship to other people and even I who we kind

210
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:07,200
of how we oriented towards others has very deep cultural conditioned

211
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:15,118
phenomena and we take it for granted we think this is the way it is and so with that comes the idea that of course being

212
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:20,480
angry or being aversive of course uh setting up strong boundaries and you and

213
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:26,079
me of course I I have desires and of course protecting myself of course of

214
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:32,800
course all these things of course this that build up this very complicated world that's very fragile and easily

215
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:38,358
disrupted easily hurt but if we in meditation if we get

216
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:43,919
quiet enough and peaceful enough that um that kind of constructing mind the

217
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:50,158
active mind that makes up stories and uh imagines and has beliefs we get through

218
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:56,919
layers and layers of them and it's phenomenal to realize how many layers of conditioning we have and to come down to

219
00:34:56,919 --> 00:35:02,400
a place where the there some deeper operating system can can can

220
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:09,359
function and um and one of those has to do with love and care and

221
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:14,839
compassion and so that when they with a contact with with suffering in the world

222
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:20,040
um the the uh it's not despair that arises it's not anguish it's not a sense

223
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:28,160
of hopelessness or a sense of overwhelm we don't suffer more because we're in contact with suffering but rather

224
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:35,280
uh it awakens the Instinct for compassion instinct to care for what

225
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:42,119
they suffering and um this happened to me when I was uh practicing in in the

226
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:51,680
Buddhist Monastery my first first time in the monastery and I was there for about three years and and that was amazingly U

227
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:59,000
significant for me I felt that the the experience of PR meditating was um I

228
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,800
some I used to call it like you have these I think it's kind of saltlike things I believe you put on meat to

229
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:12,240
tenderize meat to make soften it up that uh so maybe it's an unfortunate metaphor

230
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:18,680
but but I felt like I my heart was being tenderized um softened by the practice

231
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:25,800
of meditation in the monastery and um and I was amazed at um

232
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,920
there was places of respon respon responding to the world that was

233
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:36,200
not me responding it's not the usual Gil not how I knew myself but there was it

234
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:41,960
was it felt like an instinct or it felt like a completely [Music]

235
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:48,760
unintended uh Awakening of compassion of Love of wanting to respond to the

236
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:56,560
suffering of the world and this became so Central to kind of who I became who I

237
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:03,079
am that it wasn't even but it wasn't really me in the usual sense of the term

238
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:09,119
but it was more me than anything else could be me uh but there was no me in it

239
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:16,839
kind of and that was uh and that's where I wanted to base my life from and in

240
00:37:16,839 --> 00:37:21,960
specifically uh uh the only thing that M made sense the only response to the

241
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:29,200
world that I had uh became um um uh responding with

242
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:36,480
compassion to the suffering of the world and that's where and I decided to devote my life to Buddhism to Buddhist practice

243
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,640
and U because I was in a Zen Monastery to become a Zen Monk and a Zen priest in

244
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:47,720
order to because that's the only way I knew to address the suffering human

245
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:55,480
suffering at its deepest Roots many other ways of addressing it that are very important but I felt like

246
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:01,400
I needed to be able to be because of the depth in which I had discovered I I felt

247
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:07,400
like it would be I I had to somehow try to respond from that deep place to the

248
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:13,400
Deep place in others and to bring suffering to an end and um and so that's

249
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:20,079
when I decided to become a be ordained and uh and that ordination was very

250
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:25,640
significant for me because it set my mind my my life certain kind of like a

251
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:32,640
commitment or a or or a or a um or a um

252
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:40,079
maybe commitment sounds like too much self in it but as a recognition uh clear recognition that

253
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:45,160
acknowledged or accepted the fact that this was what my life was about to

254
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:52,280
respond to suffering and um and that set me on a course that uh certainly brings me here

255
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:58,520
today uh so for the last uh over 40 years this has been my my

256
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:04,240
life to uh to almost 40 years uh to

257
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:10,680
dedicate myself yeah more than 40 years almost 50 years now that I just dedicate

258
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:17,240
my life to um uh to address to meet to care for to uh the suffering of the

259
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:24,000
world and in the process of it uh uh this many years of practice my

260
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,560
understanding of this deeper operating system that is love that is compassion

261
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,640
that is care uh began appreciating all the different uh uh aspects of it not

262
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:42,400
all I don't know about all but many different aspects many different flavors in which it takes and in different

263
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:51,040
circumstances different FL flavors different qualities of it get evoked get awakened and operate for for us

264
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:57,560
all and um so in terms of my core teachings then that uh this naturalistic

265
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:05,920
tendency has led me to this deep faith in or trust in or reverence for um this

266
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:12,480
uh um this this place within that

267
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:19,880
is is way too limited if I call it mine or if I say it's within me or Define

268
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:26,560
Myself by it uh it's almost like I get out of the way for this to operate to be

269
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:32,720
there and so I have as a kind of reverence for this a kind of sense of

270
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:40,520
that this is really almost sacred because it's not about me it's

271
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:48,119
about nature nature knowing nature and um nature relating to Nature Nature

272
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:54,480
caring for nature so um this is a core aspect

273
00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:04,560
of behind my teachings core aspect of who I am and um and uh and I I

274
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:11,800
would I suspect that uh I would like it that or I believe that uh this is at the

275
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:18,720
foundation of what um motivates me for pretty much everything I

276
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:25,400
do so um so thank you for my chance to share

277
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:31,720
this and so be one more talk on this topic of my core teachings tomorrow

278
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,920
thank you
