1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:10,000
good morning to everyone it's wonderful to see so many people here so um this morning what I would

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,520
like to talk about is uh inhabiting Our

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,960
Lives how do we inhabit Our Lives how do you inhabit your life does that have any

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,160
meaning for you and and I'm going to begin by reading a

5
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:32,480
poem by Jane herfield this is uh her new book called The

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,360
asking and um this poem may sound a little abstract to begin with so just

7
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:46,879
just sort of get the feeling of the poem don't worry about it too much I would like my living to inhabit

8
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:54,840
me the way the rain sun and their wanting inhabit a fig or an apple I

9
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,600
would like to meet my life also in pieces scattered

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,159
a conversation sat down on a long hallway table a disappointment pocketed

11
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,680
inside a jacket some long ago longing glimpsed half recognized in the corner

12
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,200
of a thrift store painting to discover my happiness

13
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,799
walking first toward me then away from me down a stairwell on two strong legs

14
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:29,920
all its own also the uncountable wheat stocks how many times broken beaten sent

15
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:38,320
between grindstones before entering the marriage of oven and bread let me find my life in that

16
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:45,320
too in my moments of clumsiness Solitude in days of vertigo and hesitation in the

17
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:51,280
many year ends that found me standing on top of a stov top to take down a track

18
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:59,200
light in my nights asked sometimes answered questions I would like to add to my life

19
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,479
while we are still living a little salt and butter one more slice of the edible

20
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:12,800
Apple a teaspoon of jam from the long simmered fig to taste as if something

21
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,879
tasted for the first time what we will have become

22
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:27,200
then to taste as if something tasted for the first time what we will have become

23
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,319
then now the title of this is I would

24
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:40,599
like so what this poem opened up for me was the idea

25
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:47,239
that we sometimes get lost in practice and thinking it's something that we do that's separate from life you know well

26
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:54,239
I'm going to go practice now I'm going to go meditate I'm going to met I'm going to do meta I'm going to do this

27
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,400
practice I'm going to do Equanimity practice now and we make it separate

28
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:05,959
from what what's going on when it is in life that practice

29
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:11,360
really occurs that it's not separate from

30
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,680
life and that the way to be free of suffering is to be free of suffering in

31
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:23,239
life not when we're sitting on the cushion not that that's a bad idea by the way I'm happy to be free of

32
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:31,680
suffering on the cushion thank you very much but it is in inhabiting our Liv

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,799
lives that we really live our lives being present for what's

34
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:46,599
happening and we we talk about well I lost myself in that I lost my way you

35
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:52,599
know I lost track of time as if we in fact lost something and

36
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:57,879
maybe we did that piece of time occurred and will

37
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:01,680
never occur again

38
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,519
that snippet of Our Lives we just

39
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:15,720
missed it's gone that's into that one sometimes we engage in a a deliberate

40
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:20,959
mindless activity in my 20s I wore out decks of cards playing

41
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,960
solitire because I just didn't want to look at what was going on in my

42
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:31,919
life hours hours SP playing Solitaire now you know you can do that

43
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:38,759
electronically you don't have to wear out decks of cards anymore but sometimes we do that we just life is too much I'm

44
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:46,039
just going to I'm going to ignore it I'm going to go do something that allows me not to be not to think about it so I

45
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:52,360
want to make a clear distinction between inhabiting one's life and be

46
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:59,080
being controlled by thinking about one's life which are two entirely different

47
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,440
things and the suffering that arises from them

48
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:11,400
are different sometimes it's just laziness

49
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:18,120
you know just I can't be bothered just can't be bothered can't be bothered with living

50
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:24,120
you know I just well I think I'm just going to sleep this one off just going to go sleep through the day

51
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:30,240
because it's just I just don't I don't have the energy for it thank you

52
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,680
and we forget how delightful is the taste of that fig Jam or I still have

53
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,880
the taste in my mouth just barely of what I had for breakfast and I'm going

54
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:48,120
to tell you about what I had for breakfast later one of my examples it had chocolate in

55
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:56,120
it sometimes we're lost in anxiety frustration anger the emotional storms

56
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,600
of life were lost in them where the emotions take

57
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,638
over and that kind of loss is different it's very

58
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:14,639
intense but we are lost the part of

59
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,800
us that's willing to be present for it is

60
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:28,000
lost something takes over from us and we're not really registering it it's I

61
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:37,240
can't help it it's beyond me many are the ways that we abandon

62
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:44,240
ourselves we leave ourselves alone at the shopping center you know bye kid

63
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,319
I'll be back later we abandon

64
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:54,960
ourselves and yet one of the most common questions I get from people is how do I

65
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,599
bring mindfulness into my everyday life okay so I've been meditating for a

66
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:05,840
while how do I bring it into my life the most common question maybe after what do

67
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:14,840
I do about being angry and the answer is you just pay

68
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:21,039
attention you just inhabit your life so what does that mean what does it

69
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:28,160
mean it's it's it's a puzzling question so it reminded me when I was thinking about this it reminded me of another

70
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:36,120
poem and eventually I remembered that it was a Jane herfield poem once again very short poem called uh why bodh sappa went

71
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:44,720
to Motel 6 so here it is where is your home the interviewer asked him here no

72
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,720
no the interviewer said thinking it a problem of translation when you are where you actually

73
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,919
live now it was his turn to think translation

74
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:02,560
problem okay now I read that few times and then I said

75
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:10,080
oh the monk was saying I live here wherever I am I live

76
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:16,879
here and the translator and the interviewer was saying you know like where do you live as if living was where

77
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:23,199
your home was you know physical domicile but in fact where you live is

78
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,520
here where you live is right here right now in this moment you live right here

79
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:34,719
this is the only place you can live is right here you can't live anywhere

80
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:41,560
else because here is where you are alive and that's that's the secret of

81
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:48,000
bring mindfulness into your everyday life is being aware of the fact that

82
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,279
right here right now is the only place where you are

83
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:01,200
alive it's the only place who exists

84
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,959
everything else is

85
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:16,680
concept the problem is not so much about being mindful as it is just being aware

86
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:23,880
so I want to just remind you that mindfulness mindfulness starts with there's an object okay here's the object

87
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:30,920
we know the object and then there's the knowing that we know part and that's the

88
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:36,160
awareness it's the registering of it

89
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:43,360
so excuse me I hit the microphone so I know I'm sitting here we

90
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:51,160
all know that we're sitting here or walking we're we're here we know this but it isn't until I feel myself on this

91
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:57,560
cushion this nice soft cushion that I am aware of

92
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:04,120
sitting it's the knowing it's the registering it's the keeping oh yeah

93
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:11,360
yeah that happened and to get into the habit of registering what's happening with you me

94
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,000
check this getting into the habit of actually

95
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,360
registering what's going on with you is the becoming aware of being alive in

96
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:28,200
this moment that part it's that part that you want to

97
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,399
cultivate and that's what we're not used to doing we're just sort of kind of floating

98
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:40,000
through life you know I know this is happening I'm driving I'm but it's the noticing

99
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:48,040
something it's understanding that practice is not distinct from our lives it is our

100
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,800
lives it it it's actually kind of hard to talk about this because when I first started

101
00:10:53,800 --> 00:11:01,160
meditating I remember early on maybe I'd been meditating for a few months and I said I went to Gil and I said you know

102
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:06,440
I'm I what I'm noticing is I'm inhabiting more of my life but even then

103
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:12,760
I did not know the extent to which that could be

104
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:19,680
true after many years I don't think so much about being

105
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:27,200
mindful I just am mindful it's not so much a practice of

106
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,800
mindfulness it's it's just being aware I'm I'm oh this is what's happening this

107
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,720
is what's happening this is what's happening this is what's happening and it it doesn't take

108
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:45,079
thinking about it that's the point it doesn't take thinking about it as a

109
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:49,839
practice it becomes a habit of

110
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,760
being like my noticing as I was talking that chocolate was in my mouth still

111
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:04,800
that little faint amount of chocolate was in my mouth another way of talking about it is

112
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:11,160
being present for what is true okay so this is a an act of getting

113
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:17,199
it out of our head so often when we're talking about it we'll say get into your body and notice that the information is

114
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:22,240
coming to you through your senses eyes taste hearing

115
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:29,000
feeling smelling this is how we're getting the information about what's going on in this moment and all of that

116
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,360
is true but if we think about it in a way

117
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:40,240
that doesn't require us to think about it but

118
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:47,000
just feel our way into the moment perhaps using a presence as a word not

119
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:55,560
as a noun but as a dynamic flowing sense of I'm here in

120
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:02,800
this moment then we might notice we might be aware of something in this moment that we aren't otherwise aware of

121
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:09,240
because we're not consciously thinking okay now I'm going to listen so I know what I hear in this moment or I'm going

122
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:16,760
to look and and really see what I'm seeing in this moment but that we're kind of open it's a it's a way of doing

123
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:24,079
open awareness to just consider presence in this moment

124
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:29,360
does it mean to be present in this moment what do I understand by that

125
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:36,880
what do I understand by presence in this moment and don't worry about an

126
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:42,639
answer keep an open it's an open question because the idea is in fact

127
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:49,800
just to be open to what am what am I what am I taking

128
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:55,720
in that I'm not thinking about taking in because you are you know the the

129
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:02,880
conditions of this moment you are not in control of you decided what you're going to wear

130
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:10,519
today you decided to come here today you transported yourself here today

131
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:15,639
you're here you chose your place in the room you didn't choose an infinite

132
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:20,880
number of other things last night I chose what I was

133
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:29,079
going to wear this morning I wore something entirely different because that just last night it was all black said no

134
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:34,639
I don't want to wear all black today because the conditions

135
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:43,320
changed conditions are changing all the time so we can't predict so how can we

136
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:50,560
decide ahead of time here's what I'm going to be aware of it's just wasted energy more things

137
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,079
to think

138
00:14:55,639 --> 00:15:01,639
about so what am I aware of when I'm not not thinking about what I'm aware of

139
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:08,000
what do I just feel in the air I like to to consider what the

140
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:16,399
energy field is that I feel and when I first asked myself that question I said energy field what the hell am I talking

141
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:24,000
about and so I just sat and and decided how much space it felt like my body was

142
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,880
occupying you know what am I aware of so I was sitting here and one of the things that's true when you sit and meditate

143
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:37,440
with people is there is a different feeling when you meditate alone and when you meditate in a group I'm sure most of

144
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,360
you have felt that it just feels different there's something different that happens when you sit in a

145
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,480
group and uh I just went on a it's been a few months now September I went on a

146
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:55,959
3-week retreat and as it happens because of conditions that were

147
00:15:55,959 --> 00:16:03,360
not planned I was sitting in the front row and so I was sitting right in front of the teacher's Das and Gil was sitting

148
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:10,639
there and I could tell when Gil was in the room and when he was not in the room because he had such a great ability to

149
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,720
just sink into concentration it was delightful to sit

150
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:22,120
with him just delightful because I could feel that

151
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:27,519
energy not because I was looking for it

152
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:33,240
oh and so that came to mind this morning as I was sitting here in the room with all

153
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:41,759
of you and I there was there was like a pressure coming toward me I went

154
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:50,040
wow [Laughter] wow almost like I was basking in the

155
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:57,519
energy coming from the room it wasn't that I was looking for

156
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:05,360
that it was just as I left myself open to the

157
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:13,038
energy it was I was concentrating on my breath and then I said so if I don't stop at the skin what do I

158
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:18,600
feel and it was like a blast

159
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:25,959
furnace well that's delightful that was there all along but I was not aware of

160
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:31,640
it so there are many things that you can be aware

161
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:38,880
of if you are open to being aware of them and that's why I say it becomes

162
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,799
just a habit of presence of just being

163
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:51,520
here and not off in your head that becomes more

164
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,559
prevalent as you allow it to be

165
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:04,000
so now tied up with with this is the intention tied up with the presence of

166
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,080
inhabiting your life is the intention so somebody said to me the other day that

167
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:14,559
they felt the that uh they had a uh something

168
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:21,360
that they enjoyed doing and they would become so absorbed in it they would lose themselves in it for hours and they

169
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:28,480
would didn't even know uh what had happened what had transpired and they had a product at the

170
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:34,679
end and that was delightful but but they felt that they had to develop by to

171
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:41,080
develop her spiritual life she had to give that up she had to give that practice up whatever it

172
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,480
was and um that may be

173
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,880
true but what struck me is that it would be very H very

174
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:57,320
sad to develop a spiritual practice independent of what made your heart

175
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:02,960
sing and that the the idea that you lose

176
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:09,039
yourself in something means that it is detrimental to your spiritual practice

177
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:15,559
somehow just is what set me off thinking about this how do we inhabit Our

178
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:22,440
Lives doing what we're doing being who we are and not becoming something else

179
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:29,120
in order to be a spiritual person I have to not be me just doesn't work

180
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,960
doesn't work because the other part of awareness

181
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,320
is the only person you can be in this moment is you you can't be someone

182
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:48,400
else the other part of being alive is the only person who can be alive for you is you you can't be the ideal you you

183
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,640
can only be you so give that

184
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,240
up meet this moment with you

185
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:09,039
the you that is here so the intention you might say well I want to

186
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:15,400
be more mindful in life I want to be more spiritual in life be very careful about that

187
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:21,600
intention being more mindful is not the final

188
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,159
intention being more mindful is on its way to something else that you really

189
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:32,400
want so ask yourself as soon as you come up

190
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,760
with an intention where is this leaning where's this

191
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:43,200
leading what is it that I'm truly yearning

192
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:54,000
toward you know for years my intention in life was to be openhearted because when I began this

193
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,880
practice I was pretty much steel trap closed off

194
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:05,919
and uh and then I got to the point where I

195
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:13,679
realized to be openhearted I had to just be open that was pretty scary be open be

196
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:22,600
open that felt very vulnerable and eventually I got to the point where I heard the B

197
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:29,480
part my intention is to be what

198
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:36,640
wow that was much more freeing in the end much more freeing sometimes just

199
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,600
listening to your own intentions opens up for you what it is you're truly

200
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:47,240
wanting what it is you're truly leaning

201
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:58,559
toward and that seeing clearly what is the intention of my life what is the

202
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:04,159
intention why am I doing this practice I'm doing this practice so I

203
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:10,720
can be at peace H

204
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:18,679
now every time I sit down and I have a a meditation center where session where

205
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:26,080
I'm Restless it's not working but that's not actually true

206
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,919
because somewhere in that I want to be peace is how can I introduce ease into

207
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:40,000
my life and being able to sit with irritation and restlessness and say

208
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,520
ah restlessness is here is how to come to a place of ease

209
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:53,240
whether you are agitated restful

210
00:22:53,240 --> 00:23:01,559
peaceful concerned anxious but ah anxious is here anxious look at that so

211
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:08,240
that you can see things rising and passing and not get hooked by them so now I'm going to tell you about

212
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:15,880
the chocolate so I decided uh I don't know a week ago on a whim I

213
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:24,080
was going through we were planning last night we had our family gift exchange celebration because our close family our

214
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:31,039
daughter and and grandchildren are leaving town for 3 weeks going to New Zealand so we decided to have our

215
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:37,600
celebration last night and as I was going through the cookbook I found a recipe for chocolate

216
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:44,520
babka now this is a um a really wonderful uh bread in the Jewish

217
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:50,640
tradition it come it's a it's a Kala that has uh chocolate in it and the the

218
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:56,360
you you make the dough and then you roll it out and it has a a layer of chocolate

219
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:01,559
that you put in it or you can put cinnamon or there's all kinds of things you can put in it and then you roll it

220
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:08,600
up and you slice it down the middle so that the all the filling then shows on

221
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:15,120
the outside and then you braid it and bake it okay it's very elaborate lots of

222
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:23,440
steps I had some of this last summer that I bought at a Jewish Bakery and I loved it and I've been looking for it

223
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:32,080
and there was a recipe and so somebody who's never made bread decided she was going to make this so I

224
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:37,360
did and so in the process of doing this uh I learned all kinds of things about

225
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:42,640
what you should and should not do and I looked at on the internet watched people make it you know and said oh yeah I

226
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:49,320
could do this I could do this well I'm going to skip all the beginning

227
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:56,840
stuff and get to the part where I was the rolling out the cold dough and it they all of the recipes give you two

228
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:04,200
loaves and the reason they do that is it's a lot of work if you're going to do it make at least two that's the explanation

229
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:10,320
I saw but all the recipes call for two loaves now it turns out this is fortuitous because you know I learned on

230
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:16,720
the first one and then I could do the second one so as I was rolling out this cold

231
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,799
dough uh one characteristic of the dough is it's made it has eggs in it so it's a

232
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:27,320
very rich dough and it's very elastic you know you don't think about

233
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:32,720
roll in up bread dough anyway pie dough that I'm familiar with but bread dough

234
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:40,320
so there I was rolling it on my piece of uh parchment paper second one I did not

235
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:47,440
use parchment paper it was twisting and as so I was

236
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:55,080
aware of oh this is never going to work I don't know what I'm doing why is that happening that

237
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:01,279
way I was thinking about am I going to get this done in time now I was also

238
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:08,559
trying to get this stage done and get it so it was Rising because I had a practice Discussion Group an hour later

239
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:14,600
okay so I had this hard deadline I had to get on Zoom and I I was doing this oh

240
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:20,679
am I going to get done on time so you know just add a little tension so I was watching all of these

241
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:26,200
thoughts coming and going but I didn't grab on to any of them I didn't say I

242
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:32,840
didn't spend the rest of my time thinking about all the things I tried to do that were ill advised is just I

243
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:39,440
watched the thoughts coming and going and I watched when Oh that's oh I can see now that's the way you do that I

244
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:47,480
watch little pieces of satisfaction I got the first one done you know and it was yeah kind of

245
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:52,679
looked like what it was supposed to look like the second one I pull it out

246
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:59,480
whipped through that took about a third of the time to do the same thing looked

247
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:05,840
beautiful because I'd learned so much the first time so it isn't about not learning from the

248
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:12,200
past you can learn from what you do but you don't need to drag any of the

249
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:19,360
extra stuff with you you have to well i' I've did I did this wrong before and I know what to expect and this is going to

250
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:26,520
be a failure because this happened before it's just every moment is

251
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:32,520
fresh and there was a moment when I looked at the piece that ID rolled out and said

252
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:38,919
wow that actually looks like the picture look at that and there's just a

253
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:44,880
moment of huh but only a moment because you also don't spend a lot of time

254
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,960
gloating because you know the moment has changed already and now it's time to

255
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:57,840
find out whether the next step you know what happens in The Next Step there's a lot of freshness to just just being here

256
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,600
for what's happening just just here just just

257
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:16,519
here and uncertainty you know there there's there's uncertainty there's

258
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:23,720
uncertainty okay at one point I remember thinking

259
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:30,159
you know there's I'm doing this because it's supposed to be fun I thought it would be fun am I having fun I asked myself am I

260
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:35,720
having fun and I could I could say yeah I'm

261
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:41,200
having fun even even in the frustrating times when it looked like you know I

262
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:48,399
have to cut the dough over here and Patch it over there which is usually a

263
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:58,880
mistake it was fun to be doing something new that I wasn't particularly

264
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:05,120
good at that I didn't have to be good at that it didn't have anything to do with

265
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:12,240
being me I didn't have to be a master Baker I didn't have to be anything but

266
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:20,159
somebody playing with the dough somebody doing something somebody doing something and being aware of the

267
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:26,320
smell of the chocolate and the feel of the Rolling pen and the just just

268
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:32,399
this and because you know all the ingredients

269
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:39,919
were luscious and things I don't normally Grant myself it was going to be good no matter what it was it was going

270
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:45,240
to be by definition unless I burnt it was going to be good so I didn't worry

271
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:50,679
about the outcomes just this just

272
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:03,840
just and it was was fun not always

273
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:11,840
pleasing I wasn't always happy the fun part was in being there

274
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:20,760
being very alive making just alive just really

275
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,760
there and one moment after a next you know you may often heard a teacher talk

276
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:34,760
about keep your mindfulness continuous it isn't continually find something to

277
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:41,880
to be mindful of not continually look for objects to be mindful of or or to carry this object with you although it

278
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:48,519
can be the continuous part is to never G give up being

279
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:54,039
present don't give up being present and when you find you've lost at the very

280
00:30:54,039 --> 00:31:01,240
moment that you noticed you've been lost is when you are here be really happy about

281
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:08,679
that that's the very moment when you're for sure here you're in this

282
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:20,600
moment you can notice judging I'm judging I'm judging okay

283
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:25,960
judging so you don't have to hold on to the Judgment you don't have to say this is

284
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:31,480
good this is bad you don't have to create more levels of anxiety for

285
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:39,320
yourself by judging yourself about oh how can I be angry I should have been over being angry by

286
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:47,519
now I found myself one uh for for two days last week wanting a sweater that

287
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:53,799
was on a flash sale for two days I wanted that sale I wanted that sweater I

288
00:31:53,799 --> 00:32:00,639
don't have a blue sweater I really want that I just watched the wanting for two

289
00:32:00,639 --> 00:32:06,080
days I put it in the cart I had it all ready to go but no I'm

290
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:14,480
not going to do it I argued with myself I carried that sweater around with me for two days and just watched that

291
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:20,240
wanting and then I let the time expire I couldn't quite tell myself to make the

292
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:26,480
decision I just I'm not going to do it so I didn't quite Reen renounce it but I

293
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,679
had a lot of experience wanting my watching myself

294
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:38,360
want this is what wanting is wanting wanting wanting wanting and

295
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:46,279
seeing how it felt watching some when I'm close to

296
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:53,399
grabbing and when I'm back so you might

297
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:58,960
argue I see wanting I cut out wanting it's all over that's one way to look at

298
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:04,200
it but another way to look at it is to see wanting and to know that I can

299
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:10,279
survive wanting and that I can be at ease with wanting without condemning

300
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:15,399
myself and adding more layers of suffering to

301
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:20,960
wanting I can just want and I can let it

302
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:28,080
go and now as I have more times in the past I know what it's like to want and

303
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:35,080
let it go and I can open the refrigerator and see the ice cream and let it go I can want the ice cream and

304
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:41,559
no I don't have to eat it and I don't have to be the person who cannot resist

305
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:46,840
wanting sometimes I don't resist sometimes I do resist but I understand

306
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:55,158
more about how my mind works around wanting because I was present for

307
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,960
wanting

308
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:14,960
another aspect of being present is to be present not only for what's going on

309
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:22,638
inside us to be present also for what's going on outside of us that is impacting

310
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:27,679
us those other conditions that we don't necessarily that we certainly don't have

311
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:33,679
any control over so one of those might be the people

312
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:41,919
in our lives that we notice that person is particularly irritable

313
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:52,078
today so I'm going to avoid that person or I'm going to make space for that person or I am going to be

314
00:34:53,480 --> 00:35:00,960
particularly forgiving of that person's irritability today or if I don't think I can do that

315
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:07,720
I'm going to not be there today you we might manage our

316
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:14,119
relationships with someone by being aware of how they are not

317
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:22,680
blaming but accommodating my way of being present in this moment is to be aware also that you

318
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:28,000
have an existence in this moment you have a way that you are in

319
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:34,960
this moment not blaming not judging this is how you are in this

320
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:42,800
moment and just as I allow myself to be a certain way in this moment however it

321
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:48,839
is I need to allow you to be as you are in this moment

322
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:53,280
also and how difficult that can

323
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,280
be or even further a field there was a

324
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:06,079
um there was there there's a person who is the Minister of culture for the

325
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:13,920
Palestinian Authority lives in rala and on day two of the recent War he

326
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:20,880
was happened to be in Gaza and he wrote a diary entry that was

327
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:27,119
published in the Washington Post and I read it and he talked about what it was

328
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:34,079
like to be there he was visiting his father and his mother-in-law and uh he was there with

329
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:40,079
his family and his his wife left immediately but his son his 15-year-old

330
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:45,160
son he decided to stay the minister decided to stay with his father and his

331
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:52,318
15-year-old son decided to stay with him and

332
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:59,240
uh it was a very moving account of what was was going on and they were staying

333
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:05,520
in a particular Camp which was in subsequent days heavily

334
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:11,760
bombed and my feeling about that was I kept thinking about this person and his

335
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:19,240
son and saying oh my God that's being bombed what's happened to them they didn't have to be there they were they

336
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:26,119
they they belonged somewhere else and and it was interesting to me that I had somehow made a personal connection with

337
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:33,400
this person because I I knew something about them having read this this

338
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:40,240
account and uh one day last week I think when they were

339
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:47,160
doing the prisoner exchange or hostage exchange there was another account

340
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:53,560
written he wrote about he the his trip with his son as they left they decided

341
00:37:53,560 --> 00:38:00,720
to leave and as I read that account about they're leaving I realized I was

342
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:07,040
crying in relief in relief because I had been so

343
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:14,920
tense hoping that he made his way home this person I didn't even

344
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:21,920
know that condition existed in my life for those two or 3 weeks I can't even

345
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:27,400
tell you how long that has been that condition

346
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:33,240
was impacting me all of that time but I was not particularly aware of

347
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:40,160
it until I read the second account I had thought about it and I was aware when I

348
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:46,880
thought about this person and and wished for his safety and his son's safety so I

349
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,960
knew that it was impacting me at some point but it was only in reading the second

350
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:59,079
account that I realized how deeply affected I I was by

351
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:05,000
that and how how relieved and how grateful I was to know that this person

352
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,040
was alive this

353
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:17,640
person you know not not a nationality not an ethnicity

354
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:23,920
not a political position person but a person a specific person that I don't

355
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:30,920
even know we are impacted by so many things and it

356
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:37,920
is really useful to our understandings of what it

357
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:45,920
means to inhabit Our Lives to sometimes inquire how am I being impacted by what

358
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:51,920
I don't even know who I don't even

359
00:39:53,720 --> 00:40:02,640
know and just occasionally say huh sometimes it's in a Joyful Way that

360
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:10,040
we're being impacted and we don't know particularly because we're not used

361
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:16,760
to looking for that particularly the person on the corner

362
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:24,480
that is always smiling how much we miss them when they're suddenly one day not

363
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:31,119
there so be aware

364
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:38,880
of someone who Smiles don't let it don't let it not be

365
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:45,920
noticed and the one morning last week I was got up I was making my coffee I looked out and there was a blue sky and

366
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:52,440
kind of puffy clouds and the Sea and there was the fresh green grass out and

367
00:40:52,440 --> 00:41:00,040
and it's said to me like the the pictures you draw in first grade you know of a of a

368
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:07,760
sunny scene and then I but I went on to make my coffee and I thought no look at

369
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:15,280
it register it go ahead and register it because that's the awareness

370
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:21,720
part register it so I looked at it yeah it is

371
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:27,560
pretty and then I made my coffee it isn't that it becomes something else

372
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:33,040
it's not like like adopting another practice it's just allow yourself to

373
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:42,720
register what's going on in front of you register the color that attracts your attention register the sound that you

374
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:50,078
hear ah inhabit your

375
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:59,480
life it gives you freedom from being who who you used to be from having to be who

376
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:06,960
you have been it gives you the freedom to be just who you are right

377
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:15,720
now right now to taste as if something tasted for

378
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:21,960
the first time what we will have become

379
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:28,160
then what we will have become then

380
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:33,839
