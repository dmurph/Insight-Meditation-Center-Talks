1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,920
greetings from here all right it's time to

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:17,840
begin so we'll continue today with an exploration of the second precept in our

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,279
week-long exploration of the five precepts these these commitments

4
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:29,480
to uh Aspire these commitments to act skillfully in five different areas of of

5
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:35,280
life today we'll talk about the

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:42,440
precept that guides us to only accept things that are freely

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:51,760
given to avoid taking things not freely given and the guided meditation

8
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:59,878
will will uh support this this idea this this theme

9
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,680
so we can find our meditation

10
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,000
posture looking for a posture that's

11
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:27,240
balanced in the very posture we adopt for the meditation we

12
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,399
can find some of the balance of practice ice between effort and

13
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:39,840
allowing between alertness being present being attentive to what comes

14
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,640
up and adopting an attitude of Letting Go letting

15
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,280
be letting whatever arises come

16
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:57,719
up without adding too much judgment too much

17
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:04,320
opinion too much preference just nicely balanced in the in the

18
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,479
gentle momentum of the practice one breath leading to the

19
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:21,400
next in the spirit of taking what's given freely and giving freely

20
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:30,040
ourselves we can in this meditation ask the question

21
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:36,440
what can I give to the practice we want we expect so much from

22
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:42,480
the practice we ask a lot of

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,519
it and today maybe we can just bring our hearts a little bit

24
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:54,440
to what can we offer the practice what can we give freely to this

25
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:03,120
practice and one thing we can give freely of one

26
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:11,159
thing of which there's an inexhaustible store is our

27
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:18,200
attention maybe the sweetest gift we can give to ourselves and to

28
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:30,480
others and we can do so in a way that's free and we can do this every time we

29
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,959
mind that we're caught up in thought maybe not quite

30
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:43,680
here maybe a little pressed down or a little tight maybe the mind is a little

31
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,040
contracted around something perhaps our field of awareness

32
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,480
becomes narrow limited

33
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,480
constrained and we can open back up to the breathing bring the breathing back into

34
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,439
the the center of attention the center of

35
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,079
awareness and as we do so and as we feel coming back into presence opening back

36
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:20,120
out into the breathing perhaps we can feel this as a

37
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,120
gift a gift freely

38
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:31,840
given just to let our attention spread out again into this middle space where the breathing is happening where the

39
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,320
body is sitting where the weight the body can be perceived in the bench in

40
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,680
the chair on the cushion if we're standing on our feet if

41
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:52,199
we're meditating in a ly down posture we can feel gravity holding us

42
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:06,320
over and over again particularly in the first minutes of a

43
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,199
Sit the mind gets snagged on things thought spirals develop little knots and

44
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:21,560
Tangles of thinking emerge usually around one

45
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:28,960
of well-known axes of our minds the future the past other people

46
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:35,000
ourselves and before we hurry back to the

47
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,680
breath today we can notice maybe some of the tightness that's there whenever we

48
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,240
find the Mind caught up in these

49
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,240
things it's quite a quite a gift of the mind to us that it can do these things

50
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:58,280
project and plan into the future recall remember think about others think about

51
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,639
ourselves in the world for the meditation we just keep opening

52
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:11,039
back up to the here and now when the breath falls into the background we we bring it back to the

53
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,759
foreground we foreground

54
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:24,080
it as we open back up each time building this habit of returning to

55
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:32,160
presence strengthening the tendency to keep coming coming back

56
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:42,120
here we can understand it as a gift of attention paying

57
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:49,120
attention showing up for ourselves showing up for our

58
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:58,560
experience so instead of maybe feeling some frustration that the mind has wandered off or that I've got tangled up

59
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:06,039
again or all the other things we can add to that experience shouldn't be like this should be otherwise no good at this

60
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:12,199
this doesn't work for me all that stuff all that extra added on to experience

61
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:17,759
just the mind getting tangled up in things the mind being mind the mind

62
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,919
being mind when we come

63
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:29,039
back we can instead of hurrying back we can notice that from that tightness from

64
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:35,280
that place of concern from that place of worry or preoccupation you can come back

65
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:43,000
to a place that's at least marginally more still more open more simple more

66
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:50,479
slow and this coming back coming back to Center coming back to home coming back to here back to

67
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:57,479
now today let us conceive of this as a gift a gift

68
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:00,960
freely given

e e

107
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:20,398
so as we bring this meditation to a close we can dedicate

108
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:26,399
Merit as a gift freely given and maybe we can think of it this

109
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:33,240
way today in the spirit of engaging with the second

110
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,600
precept any Stillness that arises in our meditation any benefit that comes from

111
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:48,000
our practice we can offer we can

112
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:56,639
give to others we can make it available to other beings that need

113
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:05,919
it and we can do so freely that is without any expectation of reciprocity getting something

114
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:14,840
back sometimes this giving away of the benefit of practice some of the

115
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,880
Stillness of the meditation sometimes you can feel the heart close a little around that we want

116
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:25,600
to hold on to it we're not sure that it's okay to give it

117
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:32,000
away what happens to that precious portion that benefits

118
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:39,840
us and here's the teaching on that we give away from an inexhaustible

119
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:45,360
store of goodness and a benefit from the

120
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:50,640
practice and even more as we give it

121
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:57,559
away it grows giving away the benefit of practice dedicating it to others

122
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:05,240
offering it freely in the world doesn't diminish it in quite the

123
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:11,720
opposite it strengthens it increases it so in the spirit let's dedicate the

124
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:18,960
mer of our practice to all beings spreading this gift of attention

125
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:27,000
of Stillness of meditative calm of the gifts of practice as broadly as freely as we find

126
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,159
possible in this moment that it may benefit all beings

127
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:38,279
may all beings know some of this Stillness some of this

128
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:45,600
sweetness some of this Joy some of this calm some of this ease may all

129
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,398
beings be free from suffering

130
00:30:53,320 --> 00:31:09,649
[Music]

131
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:25,360
so welcome again greetings to

132
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:33,919
everyone seeing that many people joined us during the sit

133
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:40,799
uh so today we'll take a look at the second precept this is the precept that commits

134
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:46,840
us or that in which we undertake for the purpose of supporting our

135
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:52,720
practice refraining from taking anything that's not freely

136
00:31:53,159 --> 00:32:01,480
given and uh the guided meditation for those of you who were here try to help

137
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:07,320
support this um in our practice by suggesting at least two

138
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:14,039
things that we have the ability to give the gift of

139
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:19,080
attention in our practice we have something we can give to our practice

140
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:25,880
that allows us a way to know in our hearts what it feels like to give freely which helps us

141
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:33,000
understand when something's freely them freely offered freely offered to

142
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:41,320
us um and then we also can take the benefits of practice and

143
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:48,279
share them knowing when we feel maybe a little tightness around that if that comes out

144
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:53,639
does for me sometimes uh that we take from an

145
00:32:53,639 --> 00:33:00,559
inexhaustible store and paradoxically perhaps but our practice is full of

146
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:08,440
paradoxes that as we give it away as we let go we we don't diminish the store in

147
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:15,639
fact it seems to increase so the second precept as we

148
00:33:15,639 --> 00:33:21,480
take a look at each of the five precepts that support can support our practice this

149
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:27,320
week is this commitment to abstaining or

150
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:34,000
refraining from taking things not given I add not freely given because I think it raises the

151
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,960
bar much as we've seen with the first precept this isn't a commandment in

152
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:46,000
other words it's not um it's not a Commandment that thou shalt not steal

153
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:53,399
for example but rather and here's I'm going to be precise in the language it's a

154
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:59,519
commitment to abstain from the unskillful making things our

155
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:06,960
own unskillful expression of an acquisitional urge maybe we could say

156
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:14,040
it's more complicated don't know if I like the way that came out but refraining from unskillfully

157
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:20,240
making things our own so in I think it's an invitation

158
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:25,560
unlike a commandment where I can say okay I didn't steal anything today I don't intend to steal anything today I'm

159
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:31,079
not somebody who typically steals things uh it's just not that simple or that

160
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:38,240
rich or that supportive that that wouldn't be as supportive of practice than this

161
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:45,878
invitation to bring careful attention to our habit of wanting to make things

162
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:53,760
mine trying to think of some ways to illustrate this and uh during the meditation one of

163
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:59,000
the one of the places my mind went off was how would it be to share just a

164
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:05,480
brief clip of um The Beatles song George's song I think I M Me Mine those

165
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:12,240
of you who know this song can maybe bring it to mind I decided not to share it because I wasn't

166
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:19,520
sure that doing so would be making use of something freely given and I know I can probably get away with using less

167
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:25,560
than 15 seconds wouldn't be caught by YouTube's what is it that content ID

168
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:31,760
algorithm no ads would appear or the video would be blocked probably but um

169
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:38,240
just made me reflect maybe it's not freely given somebody owns the copyright I don't lose sleep thinking

170
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:43,920
about whether that person needs um a fraction of a scent that would come from

171
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,640
anyway um the the weariness in that song and again

172
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:56,960
I encourage you to listen to it in your paid service Spotify Apple music whatever uh where you're engaged in an

173
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:03,200
exchange um commercial exchange uh the weariness of that voice

174
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:08,240
that says I me me mine all through the day all through the night I me Me Mine

175
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:15,560
this this urge to make things mine it brings with it a weariness that's the heaviness of the self that we impose on

176
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:22,440
things just coming to sort of influence our interactions in the

177
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:29,680
world and this makes me think that the internet may be a really useful way to practice to explore a little bit this

178
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:37,880
urge to make things mine um and also to notice ask ourselves whether the things

179
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:47,119
we make use of are freely given there's a lot of Realms we could do this in but the internet is one that I expect um

180
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:53,400
many of us will make use of later in the day in point of fact we use it at this

181
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:59,160
moment and just noticing wondering question questioning ourselves is the

182
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:05,480
content I'm enjoying is the content I'm making use of if it's another kind of

183
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:10,640
content is it freely given particularly the content that's

184
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:18,640
embedded in things we enjoy or things we make use of uh is it was it freely given

185
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:26,880
would it be freely given this just provides a way to um

186
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:33,599
keep asking this question keep practicing with this precept in a way that's probably very immediate for most

187
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:39,839
of us logged on here to YouTube

188
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:46,800
um I'm aware of this little thing don't know if this occurs to anybody else but you know I enjoy content I make use of

189
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:53,440
content I'm going to use YouTube as an example where uh I I just as as I um

190
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:59,480
practice with the second precept I'm aware that I'm frequently encouraged to hit like button and

191
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:06,000
subscribe sometimes I'm directed as they do I can I do this to the link to some

192
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,920
free something Bell or whistle in the below just click on this link and I will

193
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:19,880
send you a free this or that if you share your email with me and just that I'm making use of

194
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:27,920
something that actually I'm not I'm not I'm I'm taking I'm taking something that isn't freely given it's actually and um

195
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:33,000
there's an invitation to engage in a exchange that

196
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,920
I'm I'm not choosing to engage in and thus taking something that's

197
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:45,079
actually only partially freely given at any rate it can get very um detailed and

198
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:52,359
precise but that's part of the purpose of these precepts is to really get us to engage in careful thinking

199
00:38:52,359 --> 00:38:58,200
about our actions the the implications the consequences they have in the world

200
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:06,119
world and maybe more than anything how it feels in the heart what is this sense uh when I want

201
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:13,640
to make something my own what is this um self that get created around the

202
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:20,000
enjoyment of this content and I could go on

203
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,079
um so this suggests that the central problem with taking things not freely

204
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:32,160
given making them my own is that it reinforces uh self or selfing reinforces

205
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:37,720
an idea of self an idea that we know has stress and suffering inherent in

206
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:44,319
it and this selfing process can get in the way of an otherwise free flow of

207
00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:48,240
things freely given freely

208
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:55,960
accepted so whereas by making a practice of only taking things freely given by

209
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:03,560
developing a habit of giving freely ourselves we can reduce harmful consequences of this incessant imposing

210
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:09,040
self on the world when we don't engage thoughtfully

211
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:14,160
with this kind of precept we're just going around Our Daily Business Without

212
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:22,480
um really engaging with uh whether harm is caused by our uh accepting things or

213
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,359
taking things making things mine

214
00:40:29,319 --> 00:40:35,720
by um abstaining or refraining from not taking things freely given we're

215
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:44,640
actually letting go sort of uh we're we're letting go of

216
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:49,880
an unskillful habit of letting self get in the way of this kind of cleansing

217
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,920
purifying flow of things that are in fact freely given accepted freely given

218
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:00,560
freely so this may sound sort of abstruse and

219
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:06,800
theoretical but um each of these precepts in a way takes us to the heart

220
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:13,720
of the Buddhist teaching or various aspects of the heart of the Buddhist teachings and in particularly with the

221
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:22,520
second precept I have this sense that it allows us a way to hold self more lightly in a way

222
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:27,760
that's freeing um when we accept things we

223
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:36,240
question is this something that is freely given and I can accept freely we we're letting go of something

224
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:44,480
that um really is quite stressful to hold on to and maybe in taking this into some

225
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:49,839
sort of daily practice today and I'll give a few suggestions you can bring some attention

226
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:57,240
to what that feels like to hold hold the things we hold to hold

227
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:03,880
hold the things we hang on to U with a little bit more lightness perhaps let go

228
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:09,599
a little more so how to take this into the day I

229
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:16,000
could just say don't steal today I'm joking that would be uh that

230
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,319
would be too simple and it would let us off a little too easily but perhaps we

231
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:29,040
can um in sort of our orientation to others orientation what comes at us in a

232
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:35,680
huge torrent fire hose from the internet today we can ask this question of is

233
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:42,800
this freely given particularly is the content embedded in this Tik Tok video this

234
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:49,960
person is this is this this person's experience in the past is this freely

235
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:56,040
given um and the orientation inward might be is there an urge to make this

236
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:00,960
mine in some in some

237
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:10,119
way and again it may not be a thing that there's an urge to make mine but an

238
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:15,640
experience that I desire to make mine in some

239
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:22,000
way and returning to the top of the hour and the guided

240
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,359
sit this idea of giving something to the practice this too might have have an

241
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:33,559
Inward and an outward orientation today for yourself for

242
00:43:33,559 --> 00:43:39,800
ourselves might think about what can I give to the practice today this practice from which I expect

243
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:44,960
so much and want so much there's a lot of eye in there my benefit my

244
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:52,920
freedom what what might I give it it's an interesting question to ask when you sit down to meditate or when you're find

245
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:58,040
yourself bringing practice into daily life what can I give to a practice here

246
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:03,319
what might it need you know maybe that's another 15 minutes on the cushion maybe

247
00:44:03,319 --> 00:44:10,520
that's a certain way of uh being in the world uh the world of

248
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:16,640
experience and then in an orientation outward to others

249
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:22,240
um maybe maybe giving the gift the sweet gift the precious gift of

250
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:27,760
attention giving it freely listening to somebody

251
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:34,359
without any expectation of it being reciprocated just giving the gift of

252
00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:42,440
attention listening carefully to somebody without asserting an opinion or without um judging or without having to

253
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:48,040
say anything ourselves but just giving the gift of uh

254
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:53,079
of our attention the more we pay attention in

255
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:58,960
this way um the more we create a habit of being able to do

256
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:06,760
it and these little exercises over the course of the day can help us create a

257
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:13,000
tendency in the mind to make this the second nature response that comes when

258
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:19,200
we're in a in an actual situation that as we said yesterday we

259
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,880
eventually become uh practitioners who are unable to take something that's not

260
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:32,520
freely given we don't have to spend a lot of time time doing the exercise we just know this feels uh like an exchange

261
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:40,119
in which uh good practice doesn't need to be involved it's not freely given and I can

262
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:45,319
I can move along so anyway thank you for coming today thank you for supporting

263
00:45:45,319 --> 00:45:50,359
each other's practice and I look forward to seeing you tomorrow take care take

264
00:45:50,359 --> 00:45:53,359
care
