00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:16,160

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,480

9
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,839
warm welcome

10
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:13,200
as a little introduction i heard this from gil

11
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,280
some time ago and i liked this uh idea that

12
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,360
when we're practicing with anapanasati when we're practicing with the breath

13
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:32,799
we might think of it as in the same way that we go for a walk we might go on a

14
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:39,360
pilgrimage and we keep walking one step after

15
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,399
another we keep walking whether we are going

16
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:54,799
whether we are there's things to notice there's

17
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:01,040
landscape there's buildings there's other people but because we're on a

18
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,680
pilgrimage we just keep walking

19
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:13,360
doesn't mean that we're not noticing other things but we keep walking maybe sometimes with a little bit more

20
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:20,080
emphasis on noticing the way we're walking and sometimes the attention shifts a little bit to the way

21
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,800
that we are noticing whatever there is to be noticed

22
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,200
so in the same way with anapanasati practice that is

23
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,319
mindfulness of breathing practice we stay with the breath

24
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,239
just like we might keep walking

25
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:50,640
and we might notice things the landscape of our experience if you

26
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,879
will and but we keep with the breath we keep

27
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,000
noticing sometimes it's in the foreground sometimes it's in the background but we

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,280
keep noticing the experience of breathing

29
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:20,400
and then to take this analogy a little bit further we might say that when we're walking we

30
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:27,120
might encounter stray dogs and some of them are so cute and we stop

31
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,319
and we pet the dog maybe for weeks we completely forget that we're walking

32
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:39,200
on a pilgrimage maybe there are barking dogs that

33
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:46,080
we ignore they they don't really seem to be a problem so we

34
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,640
don't give them any attention we just keep walking

35
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,920
maybe there are some barking dogs that we meet and we open our hand we show them our hand

36
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:04,000
to show that we're safe that we're okay we're safe for them

37
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,200
they don't have to be worried about us

38
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,560
maybe there are some dogs that come up to us and we clearly say to them no

39
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,958
go home

40
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:33,600
so through all these different dogs that might visit we just keep walking

41
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,639
so that's what i'd gil offered this initially and i kind of like this idea

42
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:47,040
it might be different experiences that arise but maybe there's some way that we can

43
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,840
just stay with the sensations of breathing

44
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:02,240
okay so before our guided meditation

45
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:09,199
just taking alert posture

46
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:15,199
a posture that expresses our intention to practice

47
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:25,840
as well as some warmth some care kindness

48
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,919
so some uprightness but that doesn't have some coldness or

49
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:39,840
or hardness to it

50
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,840
and to connect with the experience of

51
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,840
breathing

52
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:07,840
feeling the breaths

53
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:21,680
noticing the quality of the breaths

54
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:35,840
are they smooth are they rough

55
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:49,840
maybe the breaths are long maybe they're a little more short

56
00:06:50,720 --> 00:07:03,840
maybe the quality is maybe some deep breaths or maybe they feel a little more shallow

57
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:17,840
we're just noticing

58
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:31,840
feeling the rhythm of the breath

59
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:59,840
an in-breath and then an out breath

60
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:39,440
and then is there a way that we can stretch our awareness

61
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:46,880
expand our awareness to include the whole physical body

62
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,920
this expanding stretching of the awareness helps us to

63
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:06,839
not get lost into our experience or contracted around

64
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:14,640
something it might be helpful to

65
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:21,120
imagine sometimes with the exhales a little bit of blowing up the awareness just like we

66
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:37,839
might blow up a balloon in a relaxed easy manner

67
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:19,839
having the body be the arena of our attention

68
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:54,480
again nothing in particular needs to be happening we're being with

69
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:01,839
sensations of the breathing and with the body

70
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:31,440
can we offer our attention to different parts of the body

71
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:43,440
the face

72
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,560
the shoulders

73
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,839
the chest

74
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:11,839
the belly

75
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,880
it might be that bringing our attention to these

76
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:30,480
different areas allow a certain amount of softening

77
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:39,839
relaxing letting go of the tension

78
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:54,240
maybe not also we don't have to make it a problem if

79
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,639
there's still some tension some holdings

80
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:12,800
but is there a way that we can let go of some of the holding patterns in the

81
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:26,320
body maybe with the exhale there's a little bit of release

82
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:35,839
very subtle

83
00:13:53,680 --> 00:14:01,920
this relaxing calming is more associated with allowing letting go

84
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,800
then with any

85
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,839
doing

86
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:47,120
we might check in and see if we're creating any new tension by

87
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:59,839
expectations we might have

88
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:19,680
we can't notice any pleasant sensations that are associated

89
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:27,120
with breathing

90
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:35,440
this can be very subtle but maybe there's a little feeling of

91
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:45,759
smoothness maybe there's a little feeling of

92
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:50,079
letting go with the exhale

93
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,839
that has some pleasure with it

94
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,480
maybe there's some pleasant sensations associated with the

95
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:23,839
just being intimate with our breathing

96
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,839
maybe there's a feeling of contentment

97
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,839
a vague feeling of okayness

98
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:16,839
this may not be our dominant experience it may be just a corner of our

99
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,839
experience

100
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:30,400
can we tune into this aspect of our experience

101
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,720
any sense of okay-ness contentment pleasantness

102
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:47,840
and allow this to be a support

103
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:43,039
being settled in the body feeling the sensations of breathing

104
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:49,600
you can now turn towards the mental experience

105
00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:00,320
a gentle inquiry are there any thoughts

106
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:08,000
some mental activity that takes us away from the present moment

107
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,840
experience

108
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,840
and just like we did with the body and with the breath we can notice

109
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:29,520
the experience of this mental activity

110
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,600
rather than trying to make it go away

111
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:43,919
perhaps they have a lot of energy associated with them

112
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:53,840
or maybe not so much energy with this mental activity

113
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:10,320
are the thoughts more discursive writing novels so to speak

114
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:17,280
are they very simple descriptive just a single sentence

115
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,840
maybe somewhere in between

116
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:35,840
just noticing the quality not so much the content

117
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:50,880
there might be a sense of constriction or tightness around

118
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:57,120
the breath i'm sorry around the breath but also around the

119
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:03,440
mental activity maybe there's a sense of ease

120
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:11,200
spaciousness openness can feel into that associated with the

121
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:17,840
thoughts the mental activity is there a tightening or a

122
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,840
opening

123
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:42,400
maybe there's a sense of pushing or pulling not liking liking this

124
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:48,320
movement of wanting we can notice that

125
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,840
also

126
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,840
maybe there's a sense of looking for something searching

127
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,000
how does that feel what is that experience

128
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,399
letting the content of the thought take care of itself

129
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,399
more being with the experience

130
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:55,840
of having these thoughts

131
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:20,320
maybe we're identified with the thoughts this is me

132
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,840
this is mine

133
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:38,799
no matter which way we are experiencing the thoughts as we breathe in

134
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:46,640
as we breathe out can we relax soften

135
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,840
these mental activities

136
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,840
letting the activities of the mind come to rest

137
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:18,480
maybe the breaths themselves are can reassure the mind and

138
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:24,320
some kind of way that the mind doesn't need to be so

139
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,840
active

140
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:47,840
not getting involved with the thinking but trusting the breath

141
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:51,039
not all mental activity needs to stop

142
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:58,799
we're just allowing a calming a softening of whatever is

143
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,000
happening in the mind

144
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:25,840
we can do this by being aware of mental activity without getting involved getting tangled up in

145
00:26:48,159 --> 00:27:07,840
all the while in and breathing out

146
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:30,480
staying with the sensations of breathing

147
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:44,240
allows the settling of the mind and the body

148
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,160
the calming

149
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,838
so that we aren't pushed around

150
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:02,799
by this mental activities or

151
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:12,720
sensations in the body so that we don't spend all our

152
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:17,760
energy reacting to

153
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:26,240
responding to trying to take care of trying to make different our experience

154
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:34,480
and instead we can be with our experience

155
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,680
sometimes that includes being with others

156
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:53,599
if we have a certain amount of calmness then we're more apt to really be able to deeply listen

157
00:44:53,599 --> 00:45:01,440
to what others are saying to us really be present for others

158
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:09,440
as well as for ourselves in a way that perhaps

159
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:18,079
we might be a refuge for others if we're not agitated if we're not busy

160
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,119
with ourselves

161
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:31,520
so may our practice be a support for us

162
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,880
and for those around us

163
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:44,240
may all beings find ease and happiness

164
00:45:44,720 --> 00:46:01,838
may all beings know peace

165
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,880
you
