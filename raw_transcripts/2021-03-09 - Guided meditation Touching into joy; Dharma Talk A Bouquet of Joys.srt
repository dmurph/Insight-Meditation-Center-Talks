1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,680
okay so why don't we go ahead and get started this evening

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:12,960
it's nice to see at least uh on the screen a couple of comments there

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,359
know that you're out there and welcome to our monday evening sit

4
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:25,920
uh diana is away so i'm very happy to be here some of you uh know me

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,439
i've taught a number of times at imc for a while and it's a delight to share this time

6
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:38,480
with you so let's go ahead and get started with our meditation

7
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:45,520
so finding a posture that's upright also relaxed

8
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,360
something where you'll be able to sit for a little while

9
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:01,039
just feeling a sense of settling in so knowing that you've arrived

10
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,880
for the sitting and if you're comfortable doing so you

11
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:14,080
can close your eyes just let your eyes gently close if you're more comfortable with

12
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:21,360
them open that's okay but usually in our practice we would keep them closed

13
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,560
maybe taking a couple of long slow deep breaths to really

14
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,799
bring the air into the body and then on the exhale

15
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,920
encouraging the shoulders to drop the body to soften up the

16
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:48,479
spine to still remain upright so we're settling into

17
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:55,840
a posture that is at ease and also alert

18
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:07,520
and then you may begin to bring the attention inward

19
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,599
and just encourage some ease in parts of the body that we often

20
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:19,920
hold tense so softening the muscles of the face

21
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,079
the forehead around the eyes jaw

22
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,840
softening the eyes and the eye sockets especially if we've been looking at the

23
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,640
screen often the eyes get a little tense

24
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:51,920
and down through the shoulder area letting the shoulders drop

25
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,760
maybe thinking of the shoulder blades sliding down the back

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,840
so we don't slump as we soften the shoulders

27
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,000
down the arms into the hands releasing any tension in fingers

28
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,050
from typing [Music]

29
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,879
and down into the torso area softening the chest

30
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,000
maybe deliberately feeling the front back and sides of the

31
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,560
ribcage also when we look at the screen a lot of our energy tends to go forward

32
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:57,439
in the body so it's so helpful to bring the attention to the back

33
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,840
the back of the rib cage

34
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:15,439
down through the belly letting the belly be soft

35
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:22,160
all the way down into the hip joints feeling the seat against the chair or

36
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,960
the cushion or the bench wherever you're sitting

37
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,319
letting that support you

38
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:44,160
and softening down through the legs [Music] releasing any bracing or

39
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,280
tension in the knees or the ankles

40
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:57,840
and if you can feeling all the way into the feet

41
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:25,440
so then having invited ease through the body just returning attention to the full

42
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,960
sense of the body sitting general overall sense

43
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:38,000
and just being at ease mentally with how the body is right now

44
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:53,840
it's fine just as it is

45
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:07,840
gently allowing the attention to settle onto the sensations of breathing

46
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:23,599
these sensations are very simple almost elemental

47
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:33,039
touch of the air on the nostrils or the upper lip

48
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:38,160
sense of coolness in the nasal passages

49
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,840
some sense of expansion maybe the shift of clothing against the

50
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,840
skin

51
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:03,360
maybe even a sense of tension near the top of the in-breath and then that stops and

52
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:09,680
we begin the out breath there's a different kind of movement

53
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:17,360
maybe warmth there's the air exits it's a whole kaleidoscope of

54
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:31,840
simple sensations in sequence and we can just flow along with that

55
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:22,720
just as we invited ease through the body we can begin to encourage ease of the

56
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,960
mind perhaps using the body is a simple way

57
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:35,839
to stabilize the mind body is sitting still

58
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:55,839
relatively so we encourage the mind to become simpler stiller

59
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:05,120
certainly the goal is not to end our thinking or eliminate any emotions

60
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:13,360
present but more to have a simple presence with whatever is here

61
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:25,519
just as we can be simple with the movement of the breath in the body we can be simple with

62
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:31,600
the movement of thoughts emotions

63
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,839
the normal activity of the mind

64
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:46,560
let me just try not to get so caught up in it but instead just to hold it in simple

65
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,839
awareness

66
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:26,880
and if the mind has gotten caught up in thought some concern

67
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:33,519
it's no problem as soon as you notice just returning to the simple

68
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:39,040
presence of the body simple awareness

69
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,839
can anchor in the breath or the body

70
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:53,040
in fact we may even notice that the moment that we come back when

71
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,560
there's presence again there's a little bit of

72
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,800
joy it's actually slightly pleasant to be

73
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,639
present so i encourage you in this sitting to

74
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:16,399
notice the simple joy that accompanies mindfulness

75
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:22,880
even if what we're mindful of is some discomfort in the body

76
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:30,320
or in the mind the mindfulness itself has a certain

77
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,160
quality of joy to it i'm just seeing if you can notice that

78
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:53,839
from time to time as you continue with regular practice

79
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,839
oh

80
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,839
okay

81
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:36,639
in this meditation continuing on

82
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:46,639
if you begin to feel some degree of ease in the body

83
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:55,519
or the mind just from having settled even a little bit

84
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:03,199
you're encouraged to tune into that feeling that pleasant feeling of

85
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:08,480
well-being or a little bit of peace or

86
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:18,160
softness in the body or a mild kind of joy in the mind

87
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:29,680
we don't need to only be neutrally mindful about our experience

88
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:36,320
it's actually fine if we're feeling meditative feelings of well-being

89
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:44,720
to open to those include them explicitly

90
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,160
bring our mindfulness to those also so that they are supported and

91
00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:00,160
nourished in a natural way and if you don't feel

92
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:08,160
so much of that that's okay too but just to be aware when such

93
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:19,839
sense of ease arises and allow it to to be nourished

94
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,919
you

95
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:04,720
the monk tanissero bagu says that sometimes as he practices with

96
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:10,320
the breath he just has the simple idea

97
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:18,720
of not adding any new tension on the in-breath and releasing

98
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,480
a little bit more tension on each out breath

99
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,640
that could be physical or mental tension

100
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:40,159
and practicing in that way it's very easy to tune into the ease that's present

101
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:46,400
so that we're not adding anything on the in-breath and we're deepening into the ease on the

102
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:59,840
out breath whatever use is available

103
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:30,880
and in the last few minutes of this meditation i'm going to invite

104
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:38,480
just a brief reflection if it's of interest

105
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:45,840
as you continue to sit in meditation with the breath with body

106
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:53,679
bringing the mind into the present moment

107
00:26:53,679 --> 00:27:00,880
just reflect on any sense of delight

108
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:08,720
or joy or gratitude for the dharma for

109
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:16,880
your practice for having a path to walk however it is that

110
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,960
you think about this role of dharma in your life

111
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:29,519
consider the appreciation or positive feelings from that

112
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:38,000
just keeping the mind simple maybe even feeling in the body that feeling

113
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:49,840
simple sense of joy and the dharma however that is for you

114
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,760
i'm just resting and breathing with that

115
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,840
that feeling

116
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,650
[Music]

117
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:47,019
[Music]

118
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:12,480
so good evening tonight's topic is joy

119
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:19,279
and you might first consider what you feel when you hear that word

120
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:27,840
for some people joy is almost the aim of the path there's a sense of

121
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:34,720
maybe seeking bliss or something like that for other people

122
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:42,960
they're might even be a slight negative connotation joy really i don't know it feels a

123
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:50,240
little bit fluffy maybe denial there's so much so many problems in the world surely joy

124
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:56,480
is a little bit surface level lightweight something like that

125
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:04,159
so whatever whatever your response is to that idea i encourage you

126
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:09,679
to consider for tonight the possibility that joy has some significant depth to

127
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:15,760
it it's it's not lightweight actually and neither is it solely

128
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:22,480
concerned with bliss and ease it actually it's it has some substance

129
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:30,000
it's not an escape from meeting suffering and i'm gonna talk a bit about

130
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:37,679
how it plays an essential role on the path to liberation we need joy actually it's important on

131
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:43,279
our path so joy is a very beautiful quality of

132
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:49,919
heart it points toward in an essential way it points toward abundance

133
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:55,919
and so we're going to talk about several different kinds of joy tonight

134
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:02,000
i'm going to offer kind of an abundance or a bouquet of different experiences of joy that

135
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:09,279
come on the path so just as an overview there's appreciative joy or

136
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:15,200
empathetic joy that we can feel for the success of others

137
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:21,200
there's meditative joy that comes when the mind becomes stiller and more

138
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,720
free of the hindrances and there can be joy in the path

139
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,840
in the practice in the dharma itself there's even other kinds of joy than

140
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:38,000
that perhaps but that's what we'll try to cover tonight as a as i said kind of a bouquet

141
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:45,519
of different types so let's start with this experience of

142
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:52,640
uh joy at the success or happiness of others this is a kind of joy that's

143
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:58,039
um also called mudita it's one of the four

144
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:03,279
brahmaviharas or heart qualities that we cultivate on the path

145
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:10,240
the others you might be more familiar with meta loving kindness karuna compassion

146
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:16,720
and upekka equanimity those three along with mudita appreciative joy

147
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:24,080
are the four brahmaviharas or divine abodes so these are relational qualities and

148
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:31,360
they acknowledge that we live in a world that does include happiness

149
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:37,360
we see people getting what they like we see them

150
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:42,799
succeeding we see them achieving goals and gaining

151
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:50,960
praise and one quality of having a mature heart is the ability

152
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:58,960
to celebrate the joy of others in a simple happy natural way the dalai lama said

153
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:06,559
if i am happy when good things happen to other people billions more chances to be happy

154
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:13,118
so really this is a wonderful thing all the time in the world there's actually a lot of good things going on

155
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:19,358
there are acts of generosity and kindness being done at every moment somewhere in the world

156
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:27,440
and we can tap into that now if this is sounding a little bit difficult often one way that we can touch into

157
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,480
appreciative joy immediately is through animals

158
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:40,158
like a dog dogs are excited about so many things and you can you can catch the excitement

159
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:45,358
of the dog or watching a a kitten um playing with a leaf

160
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:52,320
in the wind that it's gotten attracted to something you know we don't want to project too many things onto

161
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:58,240
animals but i think it's pretty easy to tell when there's a sense of of joy or

162
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:06,000
excitement in an animal and we can catch that [Music] we can catch that feeling i read a study

163
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,200
by the way that cute cat videos have been shown to reduce stress

164
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:16,480
so there you go one good thing as we're connecting with

165
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:23,359
joy in this simple way is to start to feel what joy feels like in our body you know

166
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:28,800
what is it like to have that sense of uplift into simple uplift at someone

167
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:34,160
else's joy start to feel where that is in the body how the energy moves

168
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:40,320
so that we can be um familiar with it and so we can experience it more often

169
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,359
it has a feeling in the mind too a lightness of openness of warmth in a

170
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:51,040
certain way so we can get familiar with that and then we can cultivate it for people

171
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:58,000
also of course and you know one way that we do this is to say phrases the common

172
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:05,520
phrase for mutita is may your happiness and good fortune continue

173
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:13,440
your happiness and good fortune continue so we wish well for the success and happiness of others

174
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:21,680
when we do that we can also feel the joy in our body and maybe imagine an image of the person being happy or joyful

175
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:28,079
and allow that feeling to mature in us to cook in us if you will

176
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:34,480
another form of joy practice is to evoke somehow that feeling of mudita

177
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,599
through an image or a phrase and then kind of drop the object that we

178
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:45,599
were thinking of and actually just radiate that feeling from our heart concentrate

179
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:51,280
it into the heart center and just feel it like a light shining from inside

180
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:57,520
it's a wonderful way to cultivate meditation so it's natural of course that as we try

181
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:02,960
to cultivate appreciative or empathetic joy we will

182
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,480
run into what gets in the way of that and that's this is normal it doesn't

183
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,800
mean the practice isn't working and you can imagine that the what's called the far enemy or the thing that

184
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:22,560
really opposes our ability to feel mudita is envy so somebody else gets some

185
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:28,480
success or gains something and we think well why did they get that they didn't

186
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:34,160
deserve that or or we think i should have gotten that how come i didn't get that instead or

187
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:42,880
also and so there's a you know a turning toward the cell for somehow some envy and so um

188
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:48,160
it's helpful just to notice that this blocks our appreciative joy

189
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:53,680
one thing that fuels envy and that the reason that we might have such

190
00:37:53,680 --> 00:38:01,040
feelings is there can be an idea that in order to be happy we have to get something

191
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:08,480
and so seeing somebody else get something we would feel like i didn't get something and so but if we

192
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:15,520
can learn to feel this joy for others receiving uh we feel a great amount of relief we

193
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:22,400
can realize oh actually i can be happy without getting something there is a

194
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:28,800
kind of happiness that doesn't come from that and so this is actually quite a wonderful discovery

195
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:35,200
for us like the dalai lama says it greatly increases our chances of happiness in the world

196
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:42,560
now we don't of course have to feel joy at somebody else's joy it may be that they're feeling joy about

197
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:49,359
something that's a little bit unwholesome or that we suspect is not going to be good for them in the long run so it's not like you

198
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:54,800
have to have to experience joy if someone else is feeling joyful

199
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:00,000
you know maybe if we see that it's not leading in a good direction compassion would be a better response

200
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,599
so just so you're aware of that there is also what's called a near enemy

201
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:13,760
of mutita of appreciative joy and that is sometimes called giddiness it's not a

202
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:21,680
word we use very often but the you can get the sense of it it's like a sort of over-the-top uh excitement about

203
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:28,320
something and getting caught up in somebody else's uh pleasure and joy such that we

204
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:37,200
lose our own balance you know we fall into it and we're no longer aware present centered in in ourselves

205
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,960
um so our own heart so you can feel you can feel when that's

206
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:49,680
happening we've probably all experienced that tumbling feeling of of giddiness and so that's

207
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:54,880
just be aware that's not really that's not really medita um

208
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:01,680
so overall detail is of course a great way to reduce our self-focus like all the brahmaviharas are all of the

209
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:06,720
heart qualities are so we undermine you know this belief that we

210
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:13,200
have sometimes subtly that we need to be receiving and getting and you know being praised and bolstered all

211
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:20,160
the time in order to feel happy we don't actually there are many other forms of of happiness available and it's

212
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:25,920
it is an expansive feeling of heart to be able to tap into mudita

213
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:31,200
so much recommended as a cultivation

214
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:38,720
now in addition there's a whole other flavor of joy that comes from meditation and this is

215
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:43,839
something that the mind starts to feel when it has less of the

216
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:51,599
hindrances and less caught up in sense pleasures and sort of our usual pursuits

217
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:58,640
so this comes again through sitting practice it's called uh pt p-i-t-i and i'll

218
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:04,960
get to to it in a moment um often when people start sitting there's

219
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:12,720
not a lot of joy in the sitting and that can be because we're busy dealing with body pain or

220
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:18,960
we've somehow taken on sitting as an obligation or a chore and we're just trying to be with the

221
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:26,319
breath or bring the mind back all the time it's a sort of work where's the joy where's the joy in

222
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:31,440
that but there is an accessible way into

223
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:37,040
meditative joy we practiced it during the meditation which is that

224
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:42,079
even being mindful has a slight amount of pleasure to it

225
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:48,800
you know it's not our usual kind of sense pleasure like eating chocolate or something but being

226
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:55,839
present as opposed to being lost or caught up in something is actually slightly pleasant it's a

227
00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:01,599
very subtle kind of joy being there being present and we can tap into that

228
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:07,440
as i said in the meditation even when what we're mindful of is something unpleasant or a little

229
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:13,920
painful or something the fact that we're present for it we can start to appreciate that

230
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,960
that's better than being lost and so that's an easy accessible way to

231
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:24,079
to start and so every time you get lost which we do all the time in meditation

232
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:30,000
when the mind comes back we wake up oh right meditation mindful we notice at that

233
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,520
moment ah it feels better there's a clarity it isn't there when we were lost

234
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:41,040
and that clarity is slightly pleasant then we tune into that that the mind wants to be present a

235
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:46,240
little bit more often so that's our first little taste of meditative joy actually

236
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:51,920
just being present and then it's also um just fine as we did in the

237
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:58,400
sitting to as we start to feel some degree of ease or peace or

238
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:05,599
softening in the body slowing down of the mind anything that's that's some direction

239
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:12,560
toward well-being it's totally fine to notice that and appreciate it we don't need to grab

240
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:19,119
on to it and try to make it bigger and try to hold on to it that will only cause more difficulty but

241
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:24,800
you can appreciate those um good feelings that start to come in meditation and just let them be

242
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:31,280
nourished by our attention to them let them be naturally present

243
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:38,240
that's also a nice way to slowly cultivate meditative joy

244
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:45,359
and then we will eventually at some point um start to feel some genuine sense of

245
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:51,440
well-being emerging from meditation you know we know that it's coming because we're

246
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:56,800
sitting there with some seclusion of the body some

247
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:03,040
seclusion of the mind we start to feel an internal sense of well-being

248
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:10,880
and it's often felt most strongly in the body we may even feel some kinds of pt meditative joy

249
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:18,000
feel almost like tingling or energy in the body sometimes the hair stands on end it's

250
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,839
kind of delightful these little feelings that we have and then it can also settle a

251
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:29,680
little bit more and be more pervasive but this is um this is a wonderful

252
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:36,480
development when it starts to come in meditation and maybe you'll have it once and then not for a while it's not like it comes

253
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,920
and then stays forever but just start to notice when this these feelings come

254
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:49,280
of one way that we can know that what we're having is meditative joy is that full balanced

255
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:55,920
pt leads to tranquility now this is not our usual mode with joy

256
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:03,680
right it's not your usual kind of excitement which tends to agitate the mind meditative joy is pleasant in and of

257
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:11,040
itself and it leads to tranquility it's almost like there's a little core of tranquility with this joy

258
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:17,119
wrapped around it and we touch the joy first and as we settle into it and deepen into it

259
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:23,760
we then touch the tranquility that's at its heart so that's um you might reflect for a

260
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,880
moment do you know anything of this kind of joy even a little bit

261
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:36,000
a sense of settledness and well-being that can come through the meditation so mostly

262
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:42,560
meditative joy comes as the mind softens and becomes more continuously mindful

263
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:49,200
we don't have to try to cultivate it in fact that's sometimes counterproductive it emerges

264
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:55,280
from a mind that is soft and more or less continually mindful so

265
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:01,839
here's a nice simile from the sutas that i wanted to read about this

266
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:08,720
just like a lake with spring water welling up from within having no inflow

267
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:14,560
from the east west north or south and with the skies not supplying rain

268
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:22,640
so that the cool fountain water welling up from the lake would permeate and pervade suffuse

269
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:31,119
and fill it with cool waters there being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters even so

270
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:38,160
the meditator permeates this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of

271
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:43,760
concentration or of composure so there's a sense like okay lost in all

272
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,960
the words a sense of a lake with a a well within it

273
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:54,319
that is bringing something up it's coming from meditation itself

274
00:46:54,319 --> 00:47:00,560
so what is the value of this joy there are a number of benefits of course but the the main one is

275
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:06,720
this deep sense of well-being that starts to train the mind that something besides sense pleasures

276
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:12,160
and thinking and our usual ways of trying to get pleasure there's something deeper than that

277
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:19,040
that's actually more satisfying this is from the dhammapada tasting the

278
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:26,400
flavor of solitude and peace one becomes free of distress and evil drinking the

279
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:31,839
flavor of dharma joy so it starts out as talking about

280
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:38,559
a concentration the settling of mind that leads to this joy the solitude and peace it gives the clue

281
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:44,000
to that but then this last line drinking the flavor of dharma joy

282
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:51,520
that's going to lead us into the next section i want to talk now turn now to the kind of joy

283
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:56,880
that can come from the practice itself of joy in the practice and the path in the

284
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:02,800
dharma and there isn't just one word for this like mudita or pt it comes from a whole

285
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:09,280
bunch of different places so now we really get to expand our bouquet of different kinds of joy

286
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:17,119
i'll go through some ways that the practice itself generates joy so it's great i love this

287
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:23,920
third kind of joy that we're talking about so one one way that it can come is through ethical

288
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:29,599
conduct um this isn't anything complicated or heavy

289
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:36,240
or rigid it's that when we've generally behaved well you know we've said and done things that

290
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:42,000
were wholesome enough uh we've get to the end of the day and we feel good

291
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:48,079
about how that went as sort of a sense of joy it's actually called the bliss of blamelessness

292
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:53,599
we don't need to absolutize that or make it you know blamelessness sounds a little bit too

293
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:59,920
idealistic to me but essentially we can get to the end of the day and feel like it went okay

294
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:06,800
that's actually very precious feeling it nourishes us to realize that we've

295
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:13,279
generally said and done and even thought things that were good throughout the day

296
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:21,040
it also comes from having confidence or faith if you will in the past so when we

297
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:28,000
have a moment where we realize that we're confident that what we're

298
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:33,040
doing is the right thing you know i have times when i realize

299
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:38,160
i'm just grateful that i have a path you know i'm grateful that i have some way of

300
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:44,240
managing the things that come up during the day in my mind and my body that's right i have a path and when i

301
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:49,920
reflect on that i feel a certain kind of joy just emerges naturally kind of a delight

302
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:58,079
oh yeah good there's there's um support there's a way to deal with life interestingly

303
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:04,000
joy can also come from renunciation now renunciation is not usually our

304
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,359
favorite word but it really just means letting go and in this case

305
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:16,559
it might it could mean uh we don't have so much conventional focus on stuff and

306
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:21,760
wealth and prestige and identity it's like we're not so wrapped up in

307
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:28,240
those usual kinds of pursuits that the advertisements and marketers tell us will make us happy

308
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:35,040
when we realize not really that's not really the path to happiness we can start to feel a subtle kind of

309
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:40,240
joy just in simplicity of living a more balanced

310
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:47,200
way the mind gets clearer so the buddha describes a certain kind of

311
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:54,079
joy that arises from if you will the wisdom of renunciation i'll read a little bit about that so

312
00:50:54,079 --> 00:51:00,240
seeing things as they are so he says when by knowing the

313
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:08,000
impermanence change fading away and cessation of say forms could be any of the five

314
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:14,079
sense objects but material things and one sees as it actually is with

315
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:20,319
proper wisdom that forms are all impermanent and subject to change

316
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:25,599
joy arises such joy as this is called the joy based on

317
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:31,040
renunciation that's interesting so it's a little

318
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:39,280
subtle but it means that you know if i if i'm using this cup and you know it's a nice cup

319
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:46,000
holds water but i know at the same time that i'm looking at it that it's subject

320
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,200
to breakage it will not it's not a permanent source of happiness for me

321
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:56,240
i like it right now but this wouldn't be wise to place all of my

322
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:01,440
happiness in this cup there's certain subtle joy that comes from knowing that

323
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:06,559
you know there's some wisdom there and maybe a cup is somewhat trivial example but

324
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:13,760
we can think about how the path and the practice allow us to realize not take the bait of things in the world

325
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:18,880
quite so easily of course we still do sometimes but there can be a certain joy

326
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:24,559
in having that strength knowing okay i know that all things change they're going to pass

327
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:30,400
i shouldn't rely on this completely so if you do feel that if you have some

328
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:36,000
sense of that in some areas of your life take joy in that not everyone knows that

329
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:42,318
it's a kind of wisdom and kind of joy so

330
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:51,680
we should get also to a question that people sometimes ask at this point which is why

331
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:59,200
or how can we be joyful in a world with pain you know in the face of pain why be

332
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:08,240
joyful so first off let me ask why not seriously why not

333
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:15,920
so i do encounter people who think it's some kind of a betrayal to be happy or joyful or peaceful or

334
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:21,599
light when there is so much suffering in the world

335
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:27,680
or in a difficult situation why why wouldn't you just fall into that and

336
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:34,160
get agitated and worried like everybody else to show that you care but i would again ask a little question

337
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:40,480
betrayal of what trail of what so the buddhist teachings

338
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:45,599
point us toward a happiness that is unconditioned

339
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:52,800
what does that mean that's a word we don't use very often either but it means a kind of happiness that is

340
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:58,079
not subject to the conditions of the world so not

341
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:04,640
dependent on things being a certain way you can be happy if they're this way or that way or this other way

342
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:10,880
and it doesn't mean that at every moment we're skipping down the aisles and laughing that wouldn't be appropriate in

343
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:16,640
every situation but there's a way in which we have a certain happiness of heart

344
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:23,040
that can be present with anything in various ways appropriate to that

345
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:30,079
situation so we can look for that in our heart we can look for ways that we can find joy at the very least we

346
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:37,440
have the joy of presence if we're present for suffering yeah we may feel compassion for the suffering

347
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:43,920
concern wishing to help and in that in that deep presence or

348
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:49,520
that wisdom of being there for something there is actually a little bit of joy there's still that

349
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:56,640
that joy of presence subtle but it's there so jack cornfield says it this way

350
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:02,240
in joy we are not afraid of pleasure we do not mistakenly believe it is

351
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:08,079
disloyal to the suffering of the world to honor the happiness we have been given

352
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:15,839
so if we have some happiness in our life we're not being disloyal to appreciate and enjoy that

353
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:22,240
or this from archbishop desmond tutu wonderful minister

354
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:29,280
from south africa it helps no one if you sacrifice your joy

355
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:36,720
because others are suffering we people who care must be filled with joy

356
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:43,359
so that others recognize that caring helping and being generous are not a

357
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:48,400
burden they are a joy so how about that

358
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:54,880
we people who care we people who care must be filled with joy so that others

359
00:55:54,880 --> 00:56:00,640
recognize caring is a joy it's so valuable

360
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:09,119
to see radiant joyful helpers of the world and

361
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:15,599
so inspiring and necessary you know uplifting offer some hope some vision

362
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:20,799
even in the face of suffering my friend spent some time in south

363
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:27,280
africa and she was fortunate enough to be working at an art museum

364
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:33,680
where archbishop tutu came for some event that was being held there

365
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:41,839
and somehow she managed to be standing just about six feet with from him um and she said he lit up the room

366
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:49,200
he was made of pure joy so there's just um something so valuable

367
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:56,960
in this quality and so many ways that we can touch into it in our practice

368
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:04,400
the medita the appreciative joy for others there's the meditative joy that can come

369
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:11,760
from settling the mind there's the joy in the path practice the dharma itself that

370
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:17,839
can fuel us through times in our practice that are difficult or through meeting the world and its

371
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:23,599
difficulties and in the end

372
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:28,880
joy is one of the factors of awakening there are seven factors of awakening

373
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:35,520
one of them is right in the middle is joy and it

374
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:41,200
is a necessary component for awakening so that we have a mind with some degree

375
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:48,640
of lightness some happiness that is coming from the heart from the path itself and when the mind

376
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:55,119
is in a state like that as well as possessing a number of other wholesome factors

377
00:57:55,119 --> 00:58:03,200
that's when it can awaken so i encourage you to touch into this very beautiful quality

378
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:08,240
that's accessible in a number of ways through seeing other people through

379
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:14,799
the presence of mindfulness through reflection through the settling of the mind and

380
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:20,640
through wisdom through ethics almost everything can be a door to joy

381
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:28,000
if we are looking for it and are open to that so to whatever degree

382
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:34,839
you're able to touch into that whether it's just a little bit or whether you feel the opening of the heart happens to be

383
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:42,400
tonight i encourage you to really appreciate that and let it fill your being

384
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:50,400
so that we can help others with that so may your practice and your path

385
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:55,039
and your heart joyful

386
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,720
