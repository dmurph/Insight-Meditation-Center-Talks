8
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,719
even if we Imagine That We're Alone we're never ever ever alone we are

9
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:01,239
deeply deeply interconnected with with

10
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:09,720
other humans other beings this deep web of interconnection that we impact we we

11
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:20,400
have impact on we um impact how others feel and behave

12
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:28,640
and we can have a positive impact or negative impact and others have NE have impact on us too so so to really value

13
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,799
to really appreciate um that we are supported that we support

14
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:40,640
others um and that we matter we matter our actions

15
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,000
matter and especially um what's with what is

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,640
happening in the world our world um I I

17
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:59,640
saw this quote actually paraphrased quote from ramas that whether today is the first

18
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,159
day way of an apocalypse or or Utopia

19
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:12,480
well our task is still the same we still act as best as we can with Integrity

20
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:19,120
with kindness with Good Will in the world so um trusting that we impact

21
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,000
others and others support us other like like-minded like-hearted people so

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,040
coming together here in happy hour um it's a reminder um of the support so

23
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:39,519
that's the theme that's the theme our practice so with that let's

24
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,720
let's land let's arrive in our posture in our meditation

25
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:54,800
posture if you need to shift and move and maybe if you're sitting shift left and right front and back your shoulders

26
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,200

28
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:13,599
befriending your body getting back in your body very important for

29
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:20,519

reflection we don't go into our head become he and just involved with

58
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:05,839

134
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:24,159
[Music]

135
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:33,320
ourselves thanks everyone thank you for your

136
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:42,720
practice so today's invitation was

137
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:49,840
to practice with the support that we

138
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:56,519
receive the support that we give to others seen and unseen these gifts that

139
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:02,120
we have we have received from so many beings we continue to receive the gifts

140
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:07,760
we've given to so many beings and we continue to do that and I invited you in

141
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:13,679
this practice especially uh because the mind can sometimes go to all the mistakes we've

142
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:21,399
made the ways we have not been supported the ways we haven't supported others yes yes yes and and yet we know that our

143
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:27,600
minds as humans um have a tendency toward negativity much more than

144
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:33,000
positivity so just try to balance that a little bit with tonight's practice not

145
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:40,399
to say that it's not wholesome to perhaps have remorse or there challenges

146
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:47,919
or or forgiveness all those practices are good in their own right this is a different practice tonight I invited you

147
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:53,159
specifically to stay with the goodness really feeling the goodness of the

148
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:58,880
support and giving goodness and and earning our minds intentionally towards

149
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:06,200
that and this is part of the four wise efforts one of the wise four wise

150
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:11,320
efforts is uh bringing up wholesome States if they haven't Arisen

151
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:18,039
intentionally intending to bring them up to cultivate them to to nourish them so

152
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:24,960
that's what we were doing here so also feeling the goodness of

153
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,679
this community the connections we have here here we support one another in this

154
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:37,799
practice and see how your heart felt bringing a

155
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:45,799
sense of being supported by others and supporting others for me as I was practicing there's just goodness this

156
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:51,519
this feeling of oh yeah this person and that person wow there's a sense of

157
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:57,080
goodness that has supported me and of course not everything there's been so much support in my life and continues to

158
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:02,519
be like everyone one of your lives um you know all the inventions for

159
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:10,440

160
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:17,880
it and I'm invisibly connected to that to those groups of people actually not a person huge groups of people over time

benefit um from from their work from their Goodwill from their effort from

164
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,559
their intention from their hard work and the same for us so really appreciating

165
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:52,200
that um helps us feel less alone if we are feeling alone and again loneliness

166
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:57,600
is one of the number one issues in the US and and the world actually especially

167
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:04,519
the since the pandemic but anyway so now I like to invite us to engage in small

168
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:10,240
groups with um with one another as a way to bring our practice the rubber meeting

169
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,720
the road and the invitation is to practice

170
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:24,840
meta mea in small groups and um I will put that in chat

171
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:31,639
the guidelines so the invitation is to um

172
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:38,519
stay with um there we go uh M standing for mind

173
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:45,519
well meta of course and then M also standing for mindfully listening and speaking really considering the practice

174
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:50,919
of small groups as a continuation of the meditation embracing compassion if

175
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:58,960
internal resistance comes up or any reactions or discomfort both for yourself and for others so can you be

176
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:06,320
non-reactive and hold it with kindness whatever is coming up and staying on topic and the topic I

177
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:12,399
like to give you tonight is how what happened when you brought up

178
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:18,240
intentionally brought up um feeling supported by others and supporting

179
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:25,000
others was there particular imagery that worked for you or staying with the body what can support you in this practice

180
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:31,559
and again be brief take turns brief offer just one nugget um let others

181
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:38,840
offer nuggets or you can also hold silence just say a little bit and hold silence uh and maybe just showing up in

182
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:45,240
the group is a part of your Community Practice feeling the support of others maybe you start by saying thank you for

183
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:53,360

184
00:32:53,360 --> 00:33:00,760
each other with support and care or reporting about what happened in your practice in your guided meditation in

185
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:06,240
the meditation that you sat and avoiding cross talk not giving

186
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,840
advice not commenting on other people's um experience so that we keep it really

sweet ah other Reflections Amy or Aloha

224
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:38,280
Amy Aloha that word itself is such a

225
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:46,720
interconnecting word here um I was to drop in with it I was like

226
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:51,800
picturing moments of like laughter or eye contact or

227
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:57,720
hugs um and that was really helpful uh

228
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:03,720
um historically I've uh like written down people's names

229
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:09,119
and then kind of went through and thought of things that I'm like grateful for moments I'm grateful for connections

230
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:15,680
I'm grateful for um or like even thinking through the Love Languages like oh this person I feel like met by like

231
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:21,359
words of service or you know Act of service or like you know those types of things and and I kind of like to I used

232
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:28,040
to do it for like a bunch of like the people I could think of in my life and that was really supportive so that might be something I try

233
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:34,760
TR again um I think laughter is the way we connect and it each

234
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,839
other gosh thank you thanks for sharing the practice that you used to do and and

235
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:45,400
I also appreciate you your inspiration to oh yeah I used to do this I was

236
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:51,160
really sweet and heartful and yeah that was supportive and yes why not let's do

237
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:56,760
it again because especially I'm going to say at this time in this time we we need

238
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:02,280
to uplift our heart and feel the support of one another um so important so that

239
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:07,760
we go we don't go towards the darkness too much of course not ignoring it but

240
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:13,440
so that we are more resourced through each other's um support that we can we

241
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:19,480
can take wholesome actions in the world so thank you Amy that's lovely and this

242
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:25,160
too right the darkness and this through this you know Beautiful Moments with our

243
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:30,359
Dharma Community here and you and everything so thank you thank you thanks

244
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:36,760

245
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:43,119
right love it

246
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:54,040
Claire I just wanted to add sort of spin off what Amy was talking about at least

247
00:39:54,040 --> 00:40:00,200
five years ago I was trying to to Mentor somebody and I noticed that she wasn't

248
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:07,880
very appreciative of the good things going on in her life anyway I got the bright idea of staring a gratitude list

249
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:14,640
via email and she and I and one other gal now have been circulating this list

250
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:20,319
for five years every day okay and what was really funny was that the first time

251
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:25,920
I did it I couldn't think of a thing that I was grateful for it was all I was

252
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:32,920
the one who needed it I thought I was giving it to them oh I love it oh my goodness that's that's that's great CL

253
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:39,480
it's been such a gift to me uh to get my mind to think in terms of what's working

254
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:45,119
and not well and what's not working and I so I want to pass it along as a tip to

255
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:52,560
others because it's been great for me so so sweet Claire I I just love it um

256
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:58,480
especially you know this this recognition that that also this this goodness if you wanted to do something

257
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:05,079
for someone else like oh yeah yeah I want to support this person like wow you're actually receiving more than you're giving in some ways right like I

258
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:10,800
need this like why so and it's often like that isn't it it's you know we give

259
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:16,400
we we receive in the giving it's not more than or less than it's it's we we
