1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,319
so warm greetings

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:13,599
and welcome to our meditation together

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,920
and um

4
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:27,519
those of you who come regularly know that i often begin i usually almost always begin the meditation

5
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:34,320
a guided meditation with spending some time relaxing the body

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,040
and some people might think of this as kind of a beginner's meditation kind of

7
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:48,480
before we get into something more profound and in similar veins some people think

8
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,600
it's just that meditation done for stress

9
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,199
reduction is is also not very profound it's just stress reductions

10
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:08,799
there's great religious things to experience profundities to discover maybe that's true

11
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:16,720
but what's also true is that what we learn in relaxing

12
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,479
with the the activity of relaxing is just what gets more and more thorough

13
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:29,679
more bigger as we go along in the path of buddhism and until we come to

14
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:39,280
awakening or release or nirvana which is the big relaxation

15
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:47,840
um it's a big letting go of the holding the tension the grasping the the stress

16
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,840
and so i think rather than looking at relaxing at the beginning as as a

17
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:01,040
beginning practice or just before we get into something more serious it's really the it's uh beginning to

18
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:08,399
lubricate or practicing or getting familiar letting the body become familiar with

19
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:17,200
something that is going to keep happening deeper and deeper and deeper this releasing relaxing letting go

20
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:24,080
and and what helps with that is that as you relax at the beginning

21
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:31,280
if you're able whatever degree you're able to relax even if it's just a teeny tiny bit that you feel the

22
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,560
the goodness of that or you feel the benefit of that you feel how that's nice

23
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:44,800
let it register allow yourself to feel it in other words feel the influence that

24
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,519
relaxation has on on your body your mind your heart

25
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:58,480
um and uh and as this goes along the relaxation will help you relax

26
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,640
um or uh what's deeper like a surface relaxation sets up the

27
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:11,760
condition for a deeper relaxation and deeper relaxation until we get down to the very core

28
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:18,560
of our being in a sense where something there can release and relax as well and then it's we're

29
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,480
free so um so we'll start now and do some of

30
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:31,440
this relaxation so one of the reasons to assume

31
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:39,840
a balanced aligned posture if you can to sit upright

32
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,080
but if you need if you're laying down to be careful with that posture as well

33
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:54,159
because it's a posture that um that allows for

34
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,519
relaxation if you're new to meditation sometimes you feel the

35
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:06,400
work of sitting upright but after a while the muscles get stronger and body adapts

36
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,519
to it and this sitting upright in a certain

37
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:18,720
kind of meditative way is a posture that allows for some of the deepest physical relaxation

38
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:25,280
that the body is able to do and they say the corpse posture laying

39
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,800
on your back is equal and how deep one can relax

40
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:42,240
and we can relax deeper if we're not hunched over and collapse in the chest

41
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,000
so gently closing the eyes

42
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:56,720
and as if your whole body is participating in a deep inhale

43
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:04,160
breathe in deeply so that your torso expands in all directions

44
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:11,680
ribcage in the front goes out the ribcage in the back expands a little bit the shoulders

45
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,800
maybe are lifted up a bit and if your stomach is relaxed as you

46
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,360
breathe in you might even feel a pushing down

47
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:30,400
i feel take deep breaths and feel the fullness of the whole torso

48
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,880
participating and then as you exhale long slow exhale

49
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:46,080
the whole torso relaxes settles back

50
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,840
taking a deep breath in

51
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:07,840
and then relaxing as you exhale

52
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,280
and then letting your breathing return to normal

53
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:31,039
and then as you as you exhale normal exhale

54
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,360
relax the muscles of your face

55
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:49,840
around the eyes

56
00:06:51,360 --> 00:07:03,840
the jaws the cheeks

57
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:13,759
exhale relaxing the shoulders and whatever relaxation you can

58
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:31,840
feel that the influence of that relaxation through your body

59
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:45,840
as you exhale relaxing or softening in the shoulders

60
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:59,840
maybe a releasing in the shoulders

61
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:35,200
as you relax as you exhale relaxing in the chest

62
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,240
around the heart

63
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:55,839
the solar plexus diaphragm

64
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,839
and relaxing the belly

65
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:23,279
and it's helpful if the whole body participates in this

66
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:29,440
so you might look and see if you can relax your arms and hands

67
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,760
maybe a subtle release of tension

68
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,839
holding

69
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,600
releasing relaxing legs

70
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,839
the muscles of the calves the thighs

71
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:39,440
and then perhaps there's a global relaxation you can do

72
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:47,040
for the whole body and as you release or soften

73
00:10:47,040 --> 00:11:01,839
the body more broadly let that be felt deep inside

74
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:36,880
and also to relax wherever your center of thinking is

75
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:46,399
whatever tension contraction pressure that's associated with thinking

76
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:53,920
as you exhale relaxing the thinking

77
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,839
muscle

78
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:11,839
gently quieting the mind

79
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:35,440
and it's possible to go deeper inside within perhaps

80
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:43,680
if you feel and sense deep in the center of your being maybe there is a

81
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:50,079
holding or resistance attention

82
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,560
maybe a chronic one

83
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:07,839
take a few moments to breathe with it breathe through it

84
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:21,839
and as you exhale to relax and release the center of your being

85
00:13:50,079 --> 00:14:02,160
and there may be a little bit of tension around breathing itself

86
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:09,360
don't worry about that tension make room for it breathe with it

87
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:17,839
as if it's okay

88
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:32,800
and maybe at the end of the exhale you can rela relax a bit of it

89
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:53,519
and if there's a pause at the end of the exhale even if it's infinitesimally short

90
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:00,000
see if you can be very relaxed so you can receive

91
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,560
the inhale allow it to

92
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,839
arise

93
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:46,320
and deeper in your mind than your thinking there can be a very subtle

94
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:54,080
pressure contraction coagulation

95
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:02,399
around self around the doer or the experiencer

96
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:15,760
around the one who's responsible or the one who's scared

97
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:22,720
perhaps you can allow whatever other relaxation you've done so far

98
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:31,200
be there to support and receive the deep relaxation

99
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:43,840
of this tension around self

100
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,919
you

101
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:06,320
chances are any ways in which your take going away from the present moment

102
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,759
in thought feelings

103
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,120
there's some tension related to that

104
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:23,840
if there is see if you can relax that tension

105
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,840
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

106
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,880
we relate to others in the world and to the world itself

107
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:19,279
very differently if we relate to it through our tension through the ways which

108
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:25,840
were contracted

109
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,399
than if we are relaxed and

110
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,360
loose expansive

111
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:53,440
imagine that sitting in front of you is a friend

112
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:59,120
someone you care for uncomplicated friend

113
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,400
and imagine yourself relaxed and peaceful

114
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:09,840
safe and contented where nothing needs to happen you don't

115
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:17,919
have to do anything or say anything particular maybe your friend is reading a book

116
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,799
peacefully you sit and you can sit then

117
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,639
together with your friend in your relaxed state

118
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:37,039
perhaps there's room there for your feelings or friendliness

119
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:48,799
your feelings of appreciation maybe feelings of love for kindness

120
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:54,559
relaxing deeply into and with

121
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:03,840
your feelings are friends friendship for your friend

122
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:10,080
perhaps it's fairly simple then

123
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:15,520
to relate to your friend more from kindness

124
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:25,600
than from hostility complaining resentment

125
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:32,480
more from good will then ill will

126
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:59,840
more from generosity than from greed

127
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,640
and then with the whatever feelings you have for your friend

128
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,760
maybe those can be extended outward in a simple way

129
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,799
out into the world

130
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:27,840
with goodwill for others

131
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:38,640
the deeper and fuller our relaxation is the more space there is

132
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,000
for friendliness and kindness care

133
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:55,039
tension makes us claustrophobic and fills the space of awareness relaxation

134
00:29:55,039 --> 00:30:01,600
opens that space so that our wholesome feelings for

135
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:10,240
others can exist there may all beings be happy

136
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:16,159
may all beings be safe

137
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:23,840
may all beings be peaceful

138
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:31,519
may all beings be free and may we

139
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:39,360
in whatever way that is easy for us appropriate contribute

140
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:51,840
to that possibility

141
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:11,279
continue the topic of also unwholesome a fundamental

142
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:16,840
concept for kind of the entire teachings of the

143
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:23,039
buddha and the focus today will be

144
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:30,399
on more on the unwholesome next week will

145
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:37,120
be more of the wholesome and the unwholesome

146
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:44,799
the is said to have three roots and the roots are greed

147
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:52,320
hatred and delusion and the the idea of roots

148
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:58,480
is very interesting a root is not something root of a plant is underground and you

149
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:06,000
can't see it but some plants if you chop them off at the surface level in the ground then the

150
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,159
roots are still alive and and those the plant will still sprout will grow again from the roots

151
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:20,080
and so and sometimes plants die back and they're not really at all seen visibly above the ground

152
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:26,480
but then spring comes and and maybe and the rainy season comes and

153
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:34,799
they start growing again and there they are sometimes greed hate and delusion as

154
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:42,000
as roots are called latent tendencies they may lay inside

155
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,320
of us latently ready to sprout whenever the conditions are right

156
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:54,240
for it some people might feel that they have no greed hatred and delusion

157
00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:01,679
because they don't see it in themselves but then some point the conditions come together and like boy is it ever there

158
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:08,000
and um the um there's a story in the suttas of

159
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,120
of uh maybe i told you this i don't think i told you last week but

160
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:20,799
i was thinking of it of um of a woman

161
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,720
who was always kind but then someone said maybe this is not only kind of

162
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,760
surface deep and so someone challenged her in a simple way

163
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:38,240
and sure enough she got angry and and violent even

164
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,360
so this idea of the latent roots the roots inside and it could be in greed hatred and

165
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:48,960
delusion and teachers like me and a lot of terrible teachers will repeat this

166
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:55,440
phrase greed hate and delusion a lot and when i was a younger student i heard

167
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,799
it a lot and i think part of my brain just kind of checked out what i heard it i heard it

168
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:06,720
so often it was so repetitive so wrote and and so you know almost like i

169
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:13,520
didn't hear it anymore because it was emphasized so much and and um but the reason it's emphasized is

170
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:20,158
that the truth is that these these are the roots deep inside they give birth to all kinds

171
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:26,240
of unwholesome behavior i find it very compassionate to call it unwholesome

172
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:32,960
behavior as opposed to you know bad behavior or evil behavior

173
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:39,760
or wrong behavior there's a lot of judgments that around some of the ways we judge

174
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:46,078
we understand people's behavior but unwholesome

175
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:52,560
means that you can change it into something wholesome and wholesome is more the quality of the activity

176
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:59,760
and doesn't necessarily uh judge the person some behavior is unwholesome

177
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:06,400
and but they have these three roots and um and inside of ourselves like

178
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:13,599
there's a deeps inside unseen many times can be living inside of us a source

179
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:20,800
from which unhelpful unbeneficial behavior arises and in the simplest kind of way it's

180
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,000
related to tension to holding to places we feel hurt

181
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:34,000
places where we've coagulated or condensed around our pain or our sadness or conceit

182
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:41,200
all kinds of things we're holding on to and and that can be very deep and subliminal and and not even seen

183
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:47,599
feel like it's latent these tensions but they're ready to express themselves in all kinds of ways

184
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:53,920
and so part of this practice of the dharma is to really reach down into the roots of our very being not

185
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:00,079
just the places that we can see and know but uh and uh deep inside that from

186
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:06,400
which unwholesome behavior springs this deep holding patterns and tensions and

187
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:13,440
and uh inside and um and so for that the process of relaxing

188
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:20,000
and feeling safer and safer relaxing deeper and deeper uh releasing releasing until we touch

189
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:28,160
these places that are usually not seen but where the roots the the the deep inside

190
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:35,920
and so when we pull the root of a plant out of the ground then the plant doesn't sprout again

191
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:42,240
so we have these ideas of these three roots of creed hatred and delusion

192
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:48,320
and i think of these as umbrella terms for a whole family of

193
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:55,359
related motivations or feelings or attitudes and um in the ancient texts they have

194
00:36:55,359 --> 00:37:00,800
synonyms or describe some of the words for some of the

195
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:08,800
other elements of that family so with greed that's related to

196
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:14,000
lust to relishing relishing is enjoying but holding on and

197
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,440
really wanting more getting the most squeezing the most out of it

198
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:26,480
longing attachment clinging and craving so these are all

199
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:33,680
in the family of greed and when we say greed we include all of these kind of included within it and

200
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:39,119
and where do those surface from where what's the root of those inside of you

201
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:46,480
when you feel agreed when you feel lust or there's deep longing or attachment or

202
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,920
clinging or craving to really respect these in a in a way that's

203
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:58,320
beneficial um to respect the power of them and the influence they have on us um

204
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:04,240
where what are their roots what are they arising out of what's the deeper disposition from which

205
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:12,079
they come what's a deeper feeling tone what's the deeper tension that we carry with us that seems

206
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:20,160
to be from where they arise hatred is uh

207
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,559
the synonyms for that is wanting to harm

208
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:32,160
anger hostility although you know anger is a little bit confusing that word

209
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:39,760
because not all anger is wanting to harm in uh but in this buddhist list it all

210
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:45,040
has to do with wanting to harm so so hostility or

211
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:52,400
wrath malice obstructing one word is irritation but

212
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:58,720
so the question is irritation how does that mean causing harm some kind of ill will is there as part

213
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,838
of it

214
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:12,160
delusion ignorance bewilderment foolishness interesting

215
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:18,000
not knowing oh not not really understanding suffering

216
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,160
if we don't understand our suffering some deep way and see how it arises how it seizes we don't really

217
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:29,280
understand it suffering not understood

218
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:37,680
is a source for delusion and that then gets expressed often in greed and hatred and ill-will

219
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:44,720
so the these have a wide influence on us and

220
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:51,520
uh what's interesting in the buddhist analysis of human behavior that all unwholesome behavior all

221
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:56,880
behavior which is harmful in some ways to ourselves or to others

222
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,000
has its root in these three forces inside of us these three

223
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,359
categories of things and if these are the roots then the task

224
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:15,200
is to is to somehow get sensitive enough still enough feel comfortable enough in oneself feel

225
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:21,680
a certain enough security in oneself to really be quiet and touch those roots

226
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:28,640
to really feel what is subliminal feel what's often latent and one of the

227
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:35,680
avenues to do that is physical is to feel the physical tension

228
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:42,000
with a very heightened sense of mindfulness to really tune in deeply deeply deeply

229
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,160
to the subtlest forms of tension that sometimes only are felt

230
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:54,560
if the surface tension is finally relaxed enough and it might even after a long period of

231
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:59,920
kind of peace and ease will we get a sense sense oh look at that

232
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:06,800
there's a little tightening a contraction a little kernel of tightness or pressure

233
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:11,920
or something and and then to help that soften and relax

234
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:19,359
let that release and even though it might be feel like a small little kernel subtle deep inside it's often the very

235
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:25,520
seed just like a seed of a redwood tree is quite small but the tree grows really big so uh

236
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:31,040
in the same way these little seeds deep inside of greed hate and delusion

237
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:38,400
they might seem inconsequential because they're so small but in deep quiet meditation

238
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:46,240
that's the place where sometimes we can touch those roots or those seeds and let them relax and release

239
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:53,040
and in that all wholesome behavior unwholesome behavior comes from these it becomes really useful to address them

240
00:41:53,040 --> 00:42:00,400
to meet them to understand them and so one of the practices in buddhism

241
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:06,640
is to recognize greed hatred and delusion when it arises but not recognize

242
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:14,079
sometimes those words are so big words they seem like they represent you know big obvious movements of greed and hatred

243
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:19,839
that everyone can see but the tendency in buddhism is to see them even the very

244
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:27,040
subtle movements like one word for one synonym or a connection to hatred is irritation

245
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:34,880
and and attachment can be very very small very mild but but

246
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:41,359
any movement like that where there involves you can a kind of self-harm

247
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:47,920
or self-um tension any tension we have holding tightening

248
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:56,000
that's that's chronic is a kind of creates very unhelpful conditions for us

249
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:02,480
and as we relax that and soften that we create conditions for something that's very positive

250
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:09,040
um the opposite of greed hatred and delusion and those also can be roots and they

251
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:15,920
have the roots of non-greed non-hatred non-delusion be the source from which we operate is a

252
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:23,839
whole sea change in how some people can live their lives but and that also

253
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:29,680
is discovered by deeply relaxing they're waiting for us those seeds are waiting for us and

254
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:34,799
they also grow into big redwood trees and become strong

255
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:42,160
so greed hatred and delusion and one of the things to become sensitive to

256
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:50,880
so that we are not um pushed around by them caught in bondage

257
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,838
um to their their influence

258
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:02,480
so thank you and i offer these words and thoughts about

259
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:09,119
these deep roots inside of us with the tremendous respect for

260
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:15,359
your depth your roots care for it and really wishing that in that depth of

261
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:23,520
who you are that you can find peace well-being and love and freedom like something deep inside can

262
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:33,280
release and let go so thank you
