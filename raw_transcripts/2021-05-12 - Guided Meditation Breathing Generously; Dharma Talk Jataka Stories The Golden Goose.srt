1
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:18,560
so hello from imc in redwood city california

2
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:25,599
and you know special greetings to all of you

3
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:33,680
who are far away from here in different states different countries across oceans it's

4
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,840
kind of special to have this kind of gathering of people from all over

5
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:46,399
so um there are two

6
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,559
heart qualities that uh go together a little bit like the

7
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:59,839
two sides of a hand and that is um

8
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:07,040
generosity and gratitude that when we experience acts of

9
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,840
generosity towards us then sometimes a natural

10
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:22,960
movement is to feel grateful appreciative and thankful

11
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,799
and when we are generous and sometimes we are then the recipients

12
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,520
of gratitude of thanks appreciation

13
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:42,640
and it's possible to sit in meditation with gratitude and with generosity

14
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:49,200
and have that part of the meditation and one of the simple ways of doing that is to

15
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,840
appreciate that when we inhale that we're receiving life

16
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:03,439
sustaining oxygen without which we wouldn't live and while there's not someone

17
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:11,120
intentionally giving it to us this planet has been set up in such a way that

18
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:18,239
we're a constant recipient of life-sustaining

19
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:26,239
life-sustaining substances that keep us going and alive and conscious and one of those is the air we

20
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:33,200
breathe in and perhaps in some ways we can think of the carbon dioxide we breathe out

21
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:40,560
as you know for us it's waste product but for other beings it's like trees and plants it's what they

22
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,400
need in order to grow and develop

23
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:53,120
and so we heard that we're part of this cycle of giving and receiving and perhaps that can be

24
00:02:53,120 --> 00:03:00,400
also a cycle of gratitude and generosity just in the breath and one of the things

25
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,080
that i like about this is that the breathing is so simple

26
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:13,120
and so easily easy for most most of the day to kind of many of us to be out of mind not really

27
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,959
noticing it or appreciating it really in meditation we have the chance of

28
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:28,000
becoming attuned to the simplicity of each breath each inhale in each exhale

29
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,200
each inhale is a miracle each inhale is uh something we can be grateful for

30
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:42,239
or appreciative and inspired by and each

31
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,239
exhale also as a miracle is a wonderful ways in which we are participating in

32
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,000
this whole natural interconnected interdependent

33
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,439
world of um that we live in and to feel and sense in each breath

34
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:07,120
gratitude for this breath and even if it's hard to breathe even if the breath is a

35
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,720
little bit of a struggle to be grateful for the body that knows well enough

36
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:20,560
even is struggling it's finding a way for us to keep us alive this body knows how to do it

37
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:29,280
knows how to breathe usually and so to to you know be grateful for this body we

38
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,880
have that's keeping us alive that's keeping itself alive

39
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,840
and to have this cycle of gratitude and

40
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:47,840
generosity and i offer that this i offer this to you today um not as a moral injunction for

41
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,840
gratitude and generosity but uh it's also it's a way of um

42
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:00,639
of maybe getting more interested in breathing and focus on the simplicity of this it's

43
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:07,520
so easy to drift off in other thoughts and concerns and preoccupations of all kinds and

44
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:14,720
but to kind of get gathered together and have you really centered here just in the simplicity of breathing then

45
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:21,120
some even a deeper gratitude and appreciation a deeper flow of generosity that comes

46
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:29,039
from a very quiet centered settled heart and body mind and it's kind of then we

47
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,320
really start feeling this miracle of life when things get quiet we're really just just

48
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,360
here no longer thinking about the issues of our life

49
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:53,840
the concerns of our lives the fantasies of our life so to

50
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:04,639
with this body that we have body that we are body that is here for

51
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,199
to assume a meditation posture

52
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,319
and for many of you may be a familiar posture and the familiarity of it

53
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,840
is comforting

54
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:35,840
and gently close your eyes

55
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:49,840
and to take a few long slow maybe gentle breaths

56
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:06,000
long and deep so the whole body gets when your inhale gets

57
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:16,479
stretched and engaged especially the torso rib cages expand

58
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:22,400
slow because it's calming and settling to do it slow and

59
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:29,120
it's it's conscious to do it slow and deep

60
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,479
to awaken our ability to be consciously here and now

61
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:45,120
and gentle so we're not in conflict with anything or struggling or aversive or

62
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:54,400
desirous just gentle here maybe here in a way that's nurturing

63
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,919
nourishing and then let your breathing return to

64
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,319
normal

65
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,840
and as you exhale to relax the muscles of the face

66
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:41,440
as you exhale relax the shoulders

67
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,839
and as you exhale softening the belly

68
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:56,319
taking a minute or so to do soft belly meditation

69
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:09,839
keeping the belly somewhat soft as you breathe in and breathing out

70
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:44,560
and then to gently quiet the mind

71
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:53,600
quiet the thinking maybe you're thinking can even be slower

72
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,160
softer

73
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,839
or there can be a soft and slower way of

74
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,680
holding the thinking mind

75
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:24,560
perhaps as you exhale you can relax the thinking muscle

76
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:47,839
the energies and agitation and tightness pressure associated with thinking

77
00:10:48,640 --> 00:11:01,839
and then settling in

78
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,160
to the experience of breathing

79
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,600
where each breath each inhale is a miracle

80
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:29,839
each exhale is a miracle

81
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:16,240
and as you inhale perhaps very quietly

82
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:24,639
a silent quiet gratitude or appreciation

83
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:31,680
for the gift of this breath this one inhale

84
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,480
and the exhale a simple

85
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:53,839
release letting go that's generous it's a giving

86
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:05,920
giving of your ears outwards to the rest of the

87
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,519
world any giving to your body releasing and

88
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:18,959
relaxing gratitude breathing in

89
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:26,079
generosity as you breathe out all in the service of the mind

90
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:33,519
becoming simpler and quieter here just here

91
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:49,839
breathing in and breathing out

92
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,839
so

93
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,840
so

94
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,840
so

95
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,840
so

96
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,840
hmm

97
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:17,840
and then as we come to the end of this setting

98
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:26,399
what might you learn from this sitting what might you learn from meditation in

99
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:31,760
general about the source of generosity inside of

100
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,000
you

101
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:45,840
not any requirement to be generous but when there's generosity within you

102
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:51,039
can you identify a source place within it

103
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:59,840
or if not a place what's the feeling or the atmosphere inside of you that

104
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:07,278
most supports the arising of generosity

105
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:13,840
and also gratitude

106
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:29,360
in the busyness of life preoccupations of life we ought to easily lose touch with the

107
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,120
source of goodness within us

108
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:43,120
and in our meditation perhaps we can touch into it some

109
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:54,159
in such a way that it reorients us to a dedication or inspiration

110
00:29:54,159 --> 00:30:01,760
to live from this source or this way of being

111
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:13,039
and it helps to give life to this way of being the source

112
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:16,799
this attitude the subtleness

113
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,840
to in a generous way

114
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:34,399
based on that generously wish well for others

115
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:44,158
turn your regard outward into the world and look upon all beings kindly

116
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:53,520
look upon all beings with wishes that they be well and happy and

117
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,000
peaceful

118
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:04,559
and to consider how could you today as you go through the day

119
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:10,960
how could you live to contribute to the welfare and happiness of others

120
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:18,559
even if it's a smallest thing even it's smiling at someone or

121
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,518
opening the door

122
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:37,679
and with all the many people here who meditating this morning what a great

123
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:43,760
impact we can have on the world if all of us

124
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:54,960
contribute to the welfare and well-being of even just one or two people today

125
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:03,200
may it be that this meditation that we do that the goodness of it spread from us

126
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:08,240
out into the world contributing to the world where all

127
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:15,840
beings can be happy

128
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,919
all beings can be safe

129
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:27,519
all beings can be peaceful

130
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:32,000
and all beings can be free

131
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:57,290
they all beings everywhere be happy

132
00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:03,619
[Music]

133
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:07,039
so today i'll continue with telling stories that

134
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:20,158
means birth and so that they are the tales of previous births

135
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:27,040
they say of the buddha former lifetimes many of them when he was an animal

136
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:34,079
and um and he so they're kind of like asap

137
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:42,240
fables fairy tales that uh as many of them have characteristics of kind of fairy tales we tell children

138
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:48,878
and and sometimes i think these fairy tales um as wonderful as they are for children

139
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:56,240
uh you know maybe they're really meant for adults because adults can apply them understand the deeper meaning

140
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:03,838
of them and and um and maybe uh adults have the best chance of

141
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:12,560
living out of the values of some of these wonderful tales so the tale today is

142
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:18,560
called the golden goose and it's a very similar to a european tale of the

143
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:24,720
the i think the goose or the chicken that lays golden eggs and maybe it points to the idea that

144
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:31,040
some of these uh ancient stories fables um uh were pan-cultural they kind of

145
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:36,960
maybe traveled and moved through the world and because of

146
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:44,079
people were inspired by them or they were meaningful so in the buddhist version of this there

147
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:50,240
was uh two farmers a husband and a wife and their two children

148
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:58,240
who eked out in existence they worked really hard on their farm and just barely could grow enough to

149
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:05,520
support themselves themselves and their children and and it was a tough life

150
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:12,079
on the edge of poverty edge of starvation and at some point and i'm going to

151
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:17,599
change the gender of the usual stories and i think that some of the

152
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:24,880
ways ancient stories are gendered are you know it's optional and and i think

153
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:30,480
some of the fables are probably getting a little bit tired of always being kind of the same stereotypes in the

154
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:36,960
gender so maybe it's okay to change and so at some point uh the wife

155
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,640
who um started to feel sick and she got progressively sicker and

156
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:48,480
sicker and at some point it was clear that she wasn't going to survive she was going to die

157
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:54,640
and she was laying there in bed and she made a resolve that she would come back she'd be reborn in

158
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,920
such a way that she could come back and support her family

159
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:05,680
and now so she died and the night after she died the children had a dream

160
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:13,280
and the dream was that their mother came back to see them and said dear ones

161
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:18,720
soon i'll be coming back in a few months i'll come back and i'll support you make sure that you're

162
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:25,200
okay and you don't starve but when i come back you won't recognize me but

163
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:31,280
by what i look like but i'll identify myself for you and you'll know it's me

164
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:37,680
so the children woke up the next morning and told their father about this wonderful dream and the

165
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:45,040
father kind of who was already quite heartbroken from the loss of his wife and said oh dreams just make

166
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:52,000
life more difficult to get disappointed and all that and you shouldn't you so we could forget those kinds of dreams

167
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,599
but the children didn't forget the dreams they um kept the dream alive and but they would

168
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:03,440
talk among themselves too about their dream and how their mother would come back

169
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:10,960
and then um many months later um this goose started waddling up the path towards the

170
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,560
farm and goose was quite large and fat and

171
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:22,480
and was um the head was peculiar and that um its feathers were golden golden

172
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:28,240
colored and um when the the farmer saw that was

173
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:34,960
like oh food for our dinner this is finally where i've been hungry now for days and he went out to

174
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:41,680
capture that goose but the goose kind of knew what was happening and and

175
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:47,839
ran away into the forest and hidden safety but later in the day the

176
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:54,079
goose came back out when the farmer when the the was kind of away or cooking or something

177
00:38:54,079 --> 00:39:03,359
and um and came up to the children who were playing outside and said to the children my dear children

178
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:08,960
i'm your mother and i've come back and i'm here to take care of you and

179
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:14,640
this way that each day pluck one feather

180
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:20,400
from me but only one feather and hold the feather up to the sunlight

181
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,839
and it'll turn to solid real gold and you'll have

182
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:34,000
that gold you can sell and it can support you and take care of you the family so the it's

183
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,480
and then the goose said take you know do it right now and so the the kids plucked one feather and held it

184
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:47,760
up to the sun and sure enough poof it turned into metallic gold and

185
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:56,480
and so they ran back to their father who was cooking in the kitchen and said look what we have we have um

186
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:02,960
this goose came along and and uh told us that you know if we held up its

187
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:10,960
feather plucked it would turn into gold and we could have that gold and uh but there was a caveat the

188
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:19,119
goose made sure that we could we were only supposed to pluck one feather a day and so the

189
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:24,720
the farmer was quite surprised and show me and went out and they saw the goose outside

190
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:30,560
and and the kids said again but you only pluck one feather

191
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:38,319
so the next day they went out and they plucked a feather and for sure enough holding up the sun it turned to gold they did it every day and

192
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:43,440
pretty soon uh they didn't become phenomenally wealthy but they

193
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:49,920
had enough wealth to live safely and comfortably and it was a good time for them they had no food and clothes and

194
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,520
their welfare was kind of basically taken care of and but in this circumstance at some point

195
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,720
the farmer um felt was getting more more and more comfortable

196
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:06,960
but there was a discontent you know well there's maybe a fortune to be made here

197
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:12,480
and get really wealthy from this um this goose what if i pluck

198
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:20,079
all the feathers out then they'll just have this big fortune and who knows what i can do then and um and

199
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:26,480
the kid said no no you can't do that just one feather a day and so the farmer waited and thought

200
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:34,160
about it and thought well you know there's it's dangerous if i just let the goose you know live around here the wolves and

201
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:39,599
the foxes might come along and and gobble it up and then we'll have no feathers at all

202
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:45,520
so it's better to harvest all the feathers now and have wealth than it is possibility

203
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:51,200
of losing it so when the kids were uh were off someplace playing

204
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:58,880
the farmer went to found the goose and grabbed it and and um pulled out grab

205
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:05,280
fistfuls of feathers pulled all the feathers off the goose and put them in a basket and then held

206
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:13,200
the basket up to the sun so they would turn into gold and lo and behold nothing happened

207
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:18,640
and distraught the farmer then scattered the all the the feathers on the ground so

208
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:24,240
all of them would somehow get direct sunlight nothing happened and the farmer yelled

209
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:30,160
out in despair oh no the kids heard and came running over and

210
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:35,920
they saw what had happened they said oh no mother told us that we only take one

211
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:44,319
feather from the goose at a time your mother the farmer said no no and

212
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:50,400
and then the farmer said well you know their feathers will grow back so they waited some days or weeks or a

213
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:57,280
long feathers did grow back but now they came back came back gray and dull gray

214
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:02,960
rather than his golden feathers that had been colored feathers but before and if they took a feather out and held

215
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:12,400
the sun nothing happened and after some time the goose just kind of flew off and never came back and

216
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:18,960
the story was a complete disaster because from the feathers they already had they did have enough that gathered

217
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:24,319
enough and so for their basic well-being for the rest of their time so they

218
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:30,880
continued living that way the kids grew up well enough and continued

219
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:38,319
but greed here we are we're all of us are the recipient of generosity each of us you know the world in a sense

220
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:44,000
is like a golden goose and the world the earth

221
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,119
provides us with feathers that we can harvest and take care of and live well

222
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:55,599
but then we get greedy and afraid of losing it and uh

223
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:02,160
us human beings gathered all together and what more and more and more and sometimes we have definitely on this

224
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:09,040
planet for hundreds of years even back in the time of you know two or three thousand years ago

225
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:14,240
um over-consuming over-farming land and destroying it so that

226
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:19,680
uh the civilizations that grew there of uh died out because they

227
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:26,160
uh they uh the land became infertile so there's a tendency of human beings to

228
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:31,920
overdo it to take too much and more and more and more and then destroy the very thing that is

229
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:37,680
providing us uh this is happening again today in this world and

230
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:44,720
that the the drive to consume to have to want to gr to have greed that um

231
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:51,920
we're not we're not carefully contenting ourselves with the one feather just what's enough to let us live well

232
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:58,400
and happily but to strive for always more and more and more

233
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:05,680
and so what is your golden goose what are the feathers that you collect

234
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,520
and and when is it that you

235
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:16,720
maybe take so much that you take more than is given more than is

236
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:23,520
sustainable and you maybe even destroy the goose i wonder how many people have gone into

237
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:31,119
debt that way and and consumed and somehow then can't repay

238
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:36,800
their debt they're in trouble so

239
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:45,119
meditation is one of the ways of learning how to abide

240
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:51,359
in a deep contentment a deep satisfaction a deep sense of well-being

241
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:57,680
and peace that's not dependent on material goods and wealth and having more and more and

242
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:04,960
more things but rather it's a way in which to grow in a healthy kind of way more and more

243
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:10,880
the buddha used the word abundance when you refer to some of these inner qualities that can develop

244
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:18,640
and perhaps the real gold is the goal that's within and that if we learn how to

245
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:24,640
connect to the inner gold we'll find out that we have all the gold

246
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:33,200
we need to have a happy and contented life may your heart be the golden goose

247
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:43,838
thank you
