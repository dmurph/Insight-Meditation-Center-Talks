1
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,860
okay so welcome welcome folks um

2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:17,900
you're happy to be with you so that's uh that's it

3
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:12,439
what and how we attend

4
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:19,460
shapes our world of experience

5
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,280
in other words shapes our world

6
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,340
and we practice relaxing

7
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:10,099
letting some of the attention drain out of our body into the Earth

8
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,560
so we can attend in a relaxed way

9
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:32,900
so that the way we attend is not a recapitulation of our

10
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,900
agitation vigilance

11
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,680
and to what do we attend

12
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:44,239
the energy energy will follow the attention

13
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,940
and so without making any experience an enemy

14
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:01,700
the Buddha suggested that

15
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,140
becoming deeply involved in

16
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:20,660
objects of of green hatred and aversion

17
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,720
ruminative fantasies or nightmares

18
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:38,660
this is not uh sustainable path of peace

19
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,800
and so without any brittleness in the attention

20
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:53,520
without the the how of attention becoming

21
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:02,479
riddle we welcome our breath

22
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:14,460
the energizing brightening inhale

23
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:25,340
the soothing exhale and then

24
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:32,180
soothes and and Smooths out

25
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,840
the energy of our body

26
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,680
foreign

27
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:10,399
then at the bottom of the exhale

28
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,700
sense of release

29
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:24,899
employers

30
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,180
suspended in space

31
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:14,839
and sometimes the the attention just pulls up in that

32
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:25,339
rhythm inhale exhale release

33
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:38,579
the world gets small secluded protected

34
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:54,680
having put down covetousness and displeasure with respect to the world

35
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:07,980
and sometimes gets very open and it's like the breath

36
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:15,200
is just a reminder of the

37
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:23,420
openness of awareness sea of awareness

38
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:47,360
thank you

39
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:59,940
no world of Hope and fear

40
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:04,340
seems like it's always beckoning us

41
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,360
seems like maybe it's

42
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:31,320
irresponsible or put something 's at risk and not compulsively tending

43
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,240
to Hope and fear

44
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,360
but uh

45
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:17,960
to always be embroiled with the Loose Ends of Human Condition

46
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,460
fatigues the heart

47
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:48,259
and our problems our hopes our fears

48
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:53,059
actually come to look quite a bit different

49
00:21:54,419 --> 00:22:00,419
when we rested in the seclusion protection

50
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:08,360
of the breath no simplicity

51
00:22:11,179 --> 00:22:15,740
relaxation and brightness

52
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,460
foreign

53
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:19,399
okay good to say with you

54
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:24,869
um [Music]

55
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:34,039
so uh the the good uh witnessed

56
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:40,200
aging sickness death and it was this this

57
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:46,760
changingness and maybe we could say

58
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:56,600
anticipatory grief that that launched his spiritual search

59
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:02,940
and anticipatory grief

60
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:11,278
um is a profound engine for Dharma motivation

61
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:18,179
uh this this week the the it's been uh

62
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:23,880
kind of Dharma prominent Dharma themes that that that don't appear in this

63
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:31,440
and so is uh surrender humor playfulness

64
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,259
and today uh grieving

65
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:45,179
the the story of uh story of the Buddha is that his mother

66
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:52,380
died around the time of his birth maybe the most uh Primal

67
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:59,700
form of grief and generally we see that the the Buddha

68
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:05,760
wanted to be free from grief Beyond griefs are a lamentation grief

69
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:11,159
sorrow and lamentation this is a path Beyond grief sorrow and

70
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:18,240
lamentation but then again when when uh

71
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,340
too very dear Disciples of his died the

72
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:30,600
Buddha said that this Hall that is full with hundreds of monastics feels empty

73
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:36,778
with the death of sorry put mogalana

74
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:44,460
and then the sitter goes on to say but the Buddha didn't suffer

75
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:49,860
and I I don't don't know about you this

76
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:58,640
great individual don't know about you but um but I want my Buddha to agree

77
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:07,620
and it took some time but uh kind of clarify in my own heart but um I

78
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:14,340
I don't place um grief in the cluster of afflictive

79
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:23,519
emotions and I I don't live it but I could imagine

80
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:32,279
a life free of of anger and agitation anxiety could

81
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:42,080
imagine it but it's very hard to imagine a life free of grief what that would even mean

82
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:50,399
and it's like how do you even look at the world for one minute and see the

83
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:57,240
the carnival of greed hatred delusion destruction that brings

84
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:02,778
and not feel some bit of grief

85
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:08,760
and so for me I associate grief with some of really our best qualities of

86
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:14,099
sensitivity of Love of morality

87
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:22,040
I really don't don't know what our Sila would look like if we never grieved

88
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:32,398
you know loss is kind of it's part of what makes the sanctity of

89
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:40,520
life intelligible it's finitude

90
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:47,760
and um you know children children have

91
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:54,240
sometimes called growing pains right they say their their legs hurt at night or something

92
00:34:54,240 --> 00:35:00,000
and uh Dharma practice has growing pains too

93
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,460
and The Growing Pains of Dharma often

94
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:12,780
taste like grief how does it actually

95
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:18,420
feel to change in the actual trenches of change

96
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:23,760
not on the other side of letting go the other side of letting go

97
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:30,359
might feel great feel like release feel like we've been freed up from some

98
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:38,400
impingement but the process of letting go the movement from the clenched fist of

99
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:46,460
clinging to the Open Hand of surrender of letting go the movement of that

100
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:54,000
is often painful and that pain often feels something like

101
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:01,079
grieving how does it feel to deepen our

102
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:09,660
compassion to truly awaken to Duke to suffering the

103
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:16,920
Buddha said comprehends suffering to comprehend suffering what is that

104
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,240
what does that entail

105
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:30,420
how does it feel to grow up ethically to have ones the circle of empathy

106
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:37,520
expand the process of coming out of our the depth of our self-absorption into

107
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:43,280
some awareness of the vastness of suffering

108
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:49,859
that feels like grieving and

109
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:56,700
before the the truth of suffering the first Noble Truth of suffering

110
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:02,820
before the truth of suffering ennobles us

111
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:09,920
we we grieve it we grieve it for a long time

112
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:17,400
the the ordinariness of suffering the

113
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:24,200
endlessness of samsara is uh is startling

114
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:34,560
there's um research Shelley Shelley Taylor

115
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:40,440
um and on positive Illusions positive illusions

116
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:45,540
so these are sort of like Illusions we have that seem to be associated with

117
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:52,280
health and so she writes self-aggrandizing self-perceptions an illusion of control

118
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:59,520
and unrealistic optimism or widespread in human thought

119
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:05,420
these Illusions Foster the criteria normally associated with mental health

120
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:12,300
self-aggrandizing self-perceptions the illusion of control unrealistic optimism

121
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:17,760
associated with mental health and uh

122
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:25,640
it said that that these Illusions bolster and stabilize the sense of self

123
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:32,579
indeed philosopher metzinger says creating

124
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:37,619
creating too much awareness of mortality

125
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:44,040
threatens the Integrity of your and other people's conscious self model

126
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:51,720
because it implies a deep existential loss of control almost nobody wants to gaze into an

127
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:57,240
abyss for too long because as Nietzsche famously remarked the admit

128
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:05,240
the abyss might eventually gaze back into you as well

129
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:11,820
I do get the

130
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:17,040
the comfort of of our illusions

131
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:26,660
and we don't live every moment as death contemplation

132
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:33,720
but um there's a subtle agitation of

133
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:41,180
self-deception the Dharma is is the longing longing

134
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:46,680
deep burning desire long in

135
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:54,180
or truth and when some part of us one part of us

136
00:39:54,180 --> 00:40:00,000
knows we're fooling Another Part Of Us

137
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,220
we can't settle there's agitation

138
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:11,960
and so the chickens come home to roost at some point

139
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:18,240
those Illusions will not sustain themselves

140
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:27,900
the chickens come home to roost and if we've not grieved the homelessness of ego

141
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:33,960
the ungovernability of existence we've not grieved

142
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:40,880
the end of all things we will be shattered

143
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:48,440
and so that sense that a kind of anticipatory grieving

144
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:54,839
conditions of our heart not towards hopelessness but towards motivation

145
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:59,900
to practice with what we can practice with

146
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:09,240
to to um to grow into compassion right the two

147
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:17,540
wings of Awakening wisdom compassion to grow to deepen into it

148
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:23,339
to evolve as moral creatures to really evolve like

149
00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:28,280
to grow up as ethical beings

150
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:36,740
this will stretch ourselves and uh

151
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:42,560
and will entail some measure of grief

152
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:51,740
now the grief I speak of is um it's very fluid rather than stagnant

153
00:41:53,300 --> 00:42:00,920
James Baldwin said that people can cry much easier than they can change

154
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:08,300
my lines always kind of haunted me you know it's like um

155
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:15,480
I don't want I don't want those tears to be a kind of

156
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:20,720
a rationalization of stagnation

157
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:30,839
but the Dharma the Dharma grieving is uh process by which

158
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:35,060
something else becomes love

159
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:42,240
and something else becomes love

160
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:48,660
Dharma is this alchemical process transmuting

161
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:51,660
transmuting

162
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:00,140
this beautiful line saying that Greek grief is completely pregnant with

163
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:06,060
bodhichitta the the awakened heart

164
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:12,020
completely pregnant and um

165
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:21,060
and this inside path the path path of purification is transmuting suffering

166
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:27,839
into to wisdom and love and even when the

167
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:35,420
grief hurts the love never feels for

168
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:48,780
out for this for your your consideration today

169
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:51,619
