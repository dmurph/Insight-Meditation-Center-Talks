00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:08,760
greetings everyone I'm happy to be with you this week

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:15,179
and um I should probably tell you that I'm

3
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:21,539
speaking to you from a remote part of the south of France and the the

4
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,939
um internet is not perfect I think the sound should be okay but you

5
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,820
might find the video uh choppy at times

6
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:42,379
and I'd like to thank uh sveta and Julie for taking care of the tech side

7
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:53,280
so in Gill's teachings last week he put a lot of emphasis on quieting discursive

8
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:00,780
thinking and my aspiration for this week is to

9
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:09,060
give you some tools for calming letting go of the

10
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:17,000
self-preoccupation that often is behind discursive thinking

11
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:25,040
so we have to begin by befriending ourselves

12
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:35,960
and take a posture that expresses your aspiration

13
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,039
for your practice

14
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,240
and settling into the body

15
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:56,180
and offering your body your heartfelt friendliness

16
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,420
this is how it is

17
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:16,800
we try to assume a posture that is both settled

18
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,680
and relaxed and also energetic

19
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:37,500
so inviting the energy of the earth we've gone into you

20
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:45,379
through the base of the spine and moving upwards

21
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:51,540
through the back and exiting the body through the crown

22
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,200
of the head

23
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,300
so the invitation is that we take in the Earth's energy from Below

24
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,220
and release it above

25
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,879
and now we invite the clear open energy of the sky

26
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:21,300
we come down through you from the head

27
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:27,920
down through the Torso in the legs

28
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:36,379
and out through the feet bringing the energy from the sky

29
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:42,980
through you and returning it to the Earth

30
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:53,159
so that the body here in meditation is settled

31
00:03:53,159 --> 00:04:00,140
but also a channel for the flow of energy

32
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,060
now the invitation is to light a little flame of

33
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:22,760
friendliness meta benevolence in your heart

34
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:28,820
and let it warm and protect you

35
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:37,860
so Breathe Into Your Heart and see if you can connect with

36
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:43,040
a little flame of loving kindness

37
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:50,060
it protects and comforts you

38
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:10,080
and now opening the edges of your body

39
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:17,639
the edges of your heart see if you can radiate

40
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:25,520
your unconditional friendliness to all beings everywhere

41
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:36,539
radiating meta to the front

42
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:42,660
to the right to the back

43
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:50,360
it's a left above and below

44
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:29,280
in the context of benevolent awareness

45
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:36,300
reheating outward the invitation now is to

46
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:41,960
come inside and connect with the breathing

47
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,620
you may want to imagine an oval

48
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,520
of the breath

49
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:04,940
so on the inhale a wave of breath coming up the back

50
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:13,020
and then when it reaches the crown of the head a little pause

51
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:18,419
and then a wave of breath cascading down on the front

52
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:21,560
of the Torso

53
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:32,180
moving up the back on the in-breath

54
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:37,819
tasting the Stillness for just a moment

55
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:44,819
and exhaling downwards on the out breath

56
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:47,840
in the front

57
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,620
see if you can experience the breathing as waves

58
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:12,180
waves rising up and then falling back down again

59
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,340
with the ball is at the bottom as well

60
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:45,320
the invitation is to connect with the flow of the breath

61
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:05,940
breathing in breathing out

62
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,680
is constantly changing

63
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,820
Anita

64
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,740
one continuous flow

65
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:32,839
then I'll see if you can stay the flow of the breath

66
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,839
reeling out with constantly changing

67
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:39,240
yielding a flow of the breath see if you can sense

68
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:47,000
it's in constancy always changing

69
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:54,240
and then if you can inhabit

70
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,440
the change

71
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,720
going in going out

72
00:11:53,220 --> 00:12:01,220
if you haven't already love the eyes you can do so now

73
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,940
and let the process of breathing convince you

74
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:14,700
in a peaceful way of the ever-changing nature

75
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,959
of our experience

76
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:37,579
staying with the phloem of the breath

77
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,880
then when you

78
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,839
when you see your thoughts arise

79
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:18,019
take a moment to appreciate how unsubstantial they are

80
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,740
they have no substance

81
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:34,200
and rather than choosing to follow your thoughts you can choose instead A Quiet Mind

82
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,399
a peaceful mind

83
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:48,860
your mind free of the preoccupations of Me Myself and mine

84
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:56,360
just present open

85
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:02,160
receptive and available

86
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,800
or the experience of breathing

87
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:16,820
or the experience of being you of being alive

88
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:36,740
your thoughts are not you

89
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:45,000
that his thoughts should arise instead of going back to the breath

90
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,280
right away recognize

91
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,880
I will insubstantial they are

92
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,799
flimsy fleeting

93
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:09,320
no substance Just Thoughts

94
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:20,220
and recognize also a believing in our thoughts

95
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,020
is a path to bondage

96
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:32,520
whereas the path to Freedom is seeing through

97
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:37,280
their unsubstantial nature

98
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:53,220
and then the tendency of the mind can naturally want to come

99
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:59,120
for peace to being settled

100
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:06,900
and one's direct experience unencumbered

101
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,039
by thoughts

102
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:08,700
and in those moments where the mind

103
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:16,919
is empty of thoughts see if you can feel and appreciate

104
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:22,700
the peacefulness the wholesomeness

105
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,360
on a quiet mind

106
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:03,679
I mean

107
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
a mind that is not succeeding

108
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,140
on thinking

109
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:30,740
and abide in the peacefulness

110
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,980
of emptiness

111
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:41,039
and to end this sitting we open our circle of friendliness

112
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:48,860
to all beings or care

113
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:57,140
or benevolence we offer to all beings

114
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:08,120
may all beings everywhere be safe and protect it

115
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:17,100
being safe may all beings including ourselves

116
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:23,120
be contented at ease

117
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:30,380
may we all abide in peace

118
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:39,740
and may all beings everywhere be free

119
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:48,059
and with this bowel I join my hands

120
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:53,840
and bow to you all to end this meditation

121
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:05,360
about your practice and your sincerity thank you

122
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:44,279
greetings everyone I'm delighted to be here with you this

123
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:51,899
week um and I should say that I I'm not able

124
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:59,460
to see the chat uh today in the YouTube but I do very much value your feedback

125
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:05,039
and um I will download it and read it

126
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:11,340
as soon as the teachings are finished so thank you for that

127
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:18,539
and I would also like to announce that um we'll have a q a session at the end of

128
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:23,480
the week on Friday following the talk

129
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:31,500
so in Gil's meditation meditations and talks this last week he's put a lot of

130
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:37,260
emphasis on quieting our discursive thinking

131
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:43,799
as a way of connecting with a deeper Wellspring

132
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:49,679
within us you may have noticed that this is easier

133
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:56,460
said than done and my aspiration for this week

134
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:02,580
is to give you some tools for calming

135
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:09,600
and letting go of this self-preoccupation that is the motor

136
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:17,539
of our discursive thinking Me Myself and mine

137
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:24,860
and the theme for this week is training and emptiness

138
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:32,399
so normally training and Emptiness is for a very Advanced stages of practice

139
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:40,080
and deep concentration but what I'm going to try to do is to find

140
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:45,179
some ways of giving you aspects of emptiness that you

141
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:51,419
can use uh in your everyday life and in your meditation

142
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:58,919
whether you're a beginner a middling practitioner or an advanced

143
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:01,519
practitioner

144
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:16,080
so it's in our DNA um they want to protect ourselves

145
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,779
they want to exist to survive

146
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:27,480
and so our natural habitual tendency is

147
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:36,260
to be very reactive something comes up and and we react

148
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:43,860
and often um with some clinging to

149
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:51,059
um either wanting more of it or wanting less of it or

150
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:57,260
not even knowing what's what's going on and being confused

151
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:03,720
and it's our clinging that is the source

152
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:12,618
of all of our mental constructions the word in Pali is Sankara which

153
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:18,379
literally means constructing together

154
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:25,260
so what we do without any training is to

155
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:34,280
fabricate a sort of amalgam of our inner experience and outer experience

156
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:43,020
we're constructing the way we think things are and

157
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:48,780
this constructing uh as its most

158
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:56,580
um I guess uh dangerous aspect in that uh

159
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:02,280
the the construction of all construction was is

160
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:10,040
clinging hanging around wanting to be

161
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:18,599
uh and when we really understand that

162
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:27,119
everything is constantly changing we see things all things including

163
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,099
ourselves as inconstant

164
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:43,980
we we understand that the mind uh habitually fabricates

165
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:49,440
uh this continuous process of constructing and reconstructing our

166
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,900
experience in the form of these mental constructs

167
00:35:54,900 --> 00:36:02,400
thoughts um but we could go Gil gave a lovely

168
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:09,660
talk on the Chana suta in which uh an elder monk named Chana

169
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:15,540
who was uh had been very very caught for

170
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:21,480
a long long time by conceit

171
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:27,300
uh he had he had been the Buddhist charioteer and I felt that he had a he

172
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:32,880
knew he had a special connection to the Buddha probably grew up together

173
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,640
and somehow in his mind this this was good enough

174
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,680
and so he plateaued for decades

175
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:51,000
until finally um he was able to realize

176
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,000
with um rather Stern the encouragement from the Buddha

177
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:03,000
that he was not on the right track and he was

178
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,540
not able to see the dumb mouth the Dharma

179
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:15,740
and so uh there wasn't him a

180
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:21,839
sincere desire for Liberation and

181
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:28,320
he thought he would go to visit uh Parable Ananda because Anonymous someone

182
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:34,560
that he could really trust and so he did that and Ananda was

183
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:41,339
delighted to see that at last he was asking questions he wasn't the

184
00:37:41,339 --> 00:37:47,760
know-it-all that he had always been and so when Shawna asked Ananda to

185
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:56,000
please give him a talk so that he could see the reality of the demo

186
00:37:56,579 --> 00:38:04,619
uh Ananda was happy to do so and he began by reassuring Channel

187
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:12,420
that he was able to see the dhamma he had he had what it takes

188
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:20,700
and with that China was um joyful and delighted and hopeful and

189
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:27,060
that was that was that the fact that Ananda believed in him was

190
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:32,900
the real turning point in China being able to open his heart

191
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:36,500
to the teachings

192
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,920
so um

193
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:50,579
believing in someone is a great gift that you can give them

194
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:55,619
and it can be transformative so

195
00:38:55,619 --> 00:39:01,980
um I'll reach you a summary of what Ananda fought Shana

196
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:09,480
you're helping understand and really penetrate really see the dumb

197
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:16,980
and he's reciting a discourse that the Buddha had given to another Monk named John

198
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:26,160
mostly this world is attached flinging fixated and in bondage

199
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:32,339
but if one does not attach or cling to mental constructions such as

200
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:39,200
this is myself then one will clearly see dukka

201
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:48,119
suffering when it arises and when Duca ceases

202
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:52,760
that person will clearly see it ceasing

203
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:59,400
and with this one's knowledge is independent of others

204
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,140
this is right for you

205
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:10,020
so the key to understanding

206
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:18,300
everything about the dhamma is seeing through the mental Construction

207
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,680
of this is myself

208
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:31,520
of course you know we we know from the teachings of in constancy Anita

209
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:37,980
that everything is constantly changing and

210
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:43,940
we know also in modern physics that what we think of as

211
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:51,440
solid you know like the table uh here

212
00:40:51,480 --> 00:41:00,240
um okay it's it's solid wood but it is 99.999999 empty

213
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:07,140
um there's a nucleus in the atoms and electrons whirling

214
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:12,799
around the nucleus and mostly it's just space

215
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:19,020
so in the same way uh our minds are

216
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:25,280
um basically empty

217
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,320
in our original nature

218
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:36,720
so perhaps the most important Insight that we can have

219
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:43,500
to benefit our practice is that everything is empty of itself

220
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:49,079
we're empty of a self everyone in our family our friends our

221
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:54,660
community all of us are habitually

222
00:41:54,660 --> 00:42:01,980
putting this self forward all the time selfing and being attached to oneself

223
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:07,500
and yet this idea of itself is just a mental

224
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:12,380
Construction a Sankara

225
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:20,540
so um

226
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:29,760
so Buddhist practice can be seen as emptying ourselves

227
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:36,480
of all the projections and constructs and attachments

228
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:42,839
that we overlay onto our experience we do this all the time

229
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:48,060
this is what the untrained person does

230
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:54,619
and as I said before is it's in our DNA to be reactive

231
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:04,200
so it's um and being a very liberating idea to

232
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:12,440
embrace the idea of the emptiness of yourself

233
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:18,839
so I'll read to you now um AR Norman's translation from the

234
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:22,500
delapada 93

235
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:33,060
those who have extinguished becoming who do not depend on the future

236
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:38,760
whose range is empty silence and secluded

237
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:44,520
their path is hard to track like that of birds

238
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,359
in the sky

239
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:58,140
so when we go camping most of us

240
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:07,079
write a practice leave no track and we can try the same thing when we

241
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:12,240
aspire to emptying ourselves of clinging

242
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:19,160
of attachment or greed hate and delusion

243
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,280
end of selfie

244
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:34,700
when we see thinking arising during meditation

245
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:45,060
we can imagine stepping out of a cage of our belief in Me Myself and mine

246
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:50,960
and then being able to leave more tracks

247
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:57,140
we can do the same thing uh when we're talking with friends

248
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:02,700
stepping out of the cage of Me Myself and mine we've become

249
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:09,420
a much better listener and we're in a great position to

250
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:14,520
be of benefit to serve our friends and their

251
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:20,060
development and aspiration for happiness

252
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:27,839
of the same thing is true at work if we

253
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:34,859
remember that being caught up in our own ideas of how things should be

254
00:45:34,859 --> 00:45:42,780
we can be a much better team player and work in collaboration instead of in

255
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:50,160
competition so

256
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:58,200
knowing um that living beings don't have substance

257
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:04,140
and permanent selves doesn't mean that we don't exist

258
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:11,280
and we can imagine the mind as water they're pure water

259
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:17,579
and all of our references to self as the sediments

260
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:23,579
that make the water that we're swimming in muddy

261
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:31,380
so we can train the mind by emptying it of the constraints of our

262
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:37,440
mental constructs wrapped around the idea of self

263
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:45,599
and our reactivity and gently slide into the wholesome

264
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:51,660
clear water from a mind that's temporarily empty

265
00:46:51,660 --> 00:47:00,619
with suffering and farting and enjoyed the flow of the water

266
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:07,940
thank you very much for your attention

267
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:16,760
I wish you well in the sky of emptiness
