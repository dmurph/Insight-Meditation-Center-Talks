1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:14,080
okay there we go so good morning and um welcome

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,519
to our meditation session okay there we go

3
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,160
and

4
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:34,640
when one of the important qualities or

5
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,760
approaches to meditation that can be very helpful

6
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:47,840
is to steady the mind on something and have a continuity of

7
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:54,079
attention where the mind doesn't jump off that very easily

8
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,000
and so it doesn't get distracted and i don't know if it's a good analogy but

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,439
uh if you're driving on a on a

10
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:12,560
on a road to go far to the east or something

11
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,960
and then you just stay on the big highway that goes east

12
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,119
there's a lot of exits you could take but if you jumped off every exit you

13
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:31,040
would never get to where you want to go so if every time the mind is thinking

14
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:38,880
about something or every time that something different happens in your experience and you jump off

15
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:47,520
the exit you don't really get you don't really go very far you don't settle in for the long haul

16
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:55,520
so this is called a continuity of attention on one thing and um

17
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,759
and one of the interesting things about a continuity of attention on one thing something like just the breathing it can

18
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,759
be seen very simple and simplistic you know not much life of our you know complicated rich life

19
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,879
not much is in the breathing we might think and so all this interesting stuff comes up in

20
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,920
our minds our thoughts our emotions and feelings but there's something about staying on

21
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:24,319
the continuity of something staying on the road without getting off

22
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:31,840
that allows a deepening allows us to connect to something that's uh deeper and deeper within us

23
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:40,000
that if we keep getting off at the all the different exits for all kinds of things that might be important enough in themselves

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,360
they it interrupts the process of of of windowing

25
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,480
out a lot of extra stuff is that keeps us from coming down to the kernel to

26
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,680
this to the source to the the kernel or to that kind of something that's really

27
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:06,000
much more deep and connected so it's not to hold on tight

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,640
to one thing but to have a love or a dedication or a real kind of okay let's let's

29
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,560
really do this and if i can i'll just stay with the breathing

30
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,720
and if i get pulled off into thoughts and other things it's okay

31
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,319
you practically practice with that but to not do it too casually have a

32
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:37,680
little strength or little gentle loving intentionality just just stay here let's

33
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,440
see it through let's stay on this road and see where it takes us

34
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:50,239
and let everything else kind of fall away like all the exits let them just go by go by thoughts are come emotions come

35
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:58,720
let them just kind of wash off to the side let them just pass them by for now unless

36
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:06,640
you come to a place where the you know where you really need to change roads

37
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,000
sometimes you know you have to take detours and sometimes you have to the road isn't straight and you have to

38
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,160
take a different road for a while that's okay but what i'm emphasizing here's a little

39
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,959
emphasis on just stay and stay and stay

40
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,240
so assuming a posture

41
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:36,080
and really spend a little bit of time settling into your posture

42
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:43,600
in such a way that um like you're settling in to really you know

43
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:52,000
be in the driver's seat really stay engaged stay present

44
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:00,478
alert maybe a certain intentness to stay

45
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:11,840
alert enough to not wander off easily

46
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,199
and to then gently close your eyes

47
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,840
and if you're going to use the breathing as your primary focus

48
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:39,840
to make a strong connection to the breathing by taking a few long slow deep breaths

49
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:52,160
you're breathing in deeply in a long exhale

50
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,000
long exhale relaxing as you exhale

51
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,840
relaxing the whole body

52
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:16,639
and then letting your breathing return to normal and continue

53
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:35,840
to relax your body the muscles of the face

54
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,919
the shoulders

55
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,840
relaxing the belly

56
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:23,039
and then settling yourself on the body's experience of breathing

57
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:30,160
wherever that experience

58
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:38,720
his most comforting or most pleasant or most compelling for your mind

59
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:45,919
the movements of the belly the chest sensations in the nostrils

60
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,680
or the whole breath body

61
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,560
and as you exhale

62
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,240
settle into your breathing

63
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:16,000
as if breathing is the main highway breathing is where you'll stay

64
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,840
just as you would stay attentive to the road as you drove on the freeway

65
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:31,439
and not let your mind wonder too much from the road or at all

66
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:37,120
so let your attention be with your

67
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,320
breathing not straying from the breath

68
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:56,560
not easily pulled aside by all the exits that come along

69
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:09,839
just with the breathing

70
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,839
okay continuity with breathing that's supported by relaxing with every

71
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:26,480
exhale relaxing into the breathing

72
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:36,080
and rather than straining to be with a breath relaxing into the breathing as you

73
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:42,000
exhale and receiving

74
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,720
the inhale

75
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,839
and for these minutes that we're meditating

76
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:04,480
trust that all you really need to do

77
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:12,240
you need to stay close to your breathing letting your thinking

78
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:20,240
recede behind you like the exits that you've

79
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,839
passed

80
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,480
keeping inside your breathing

81
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:59,839
staying connected to breathing

82
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:27,839
remain feeling the sensations of breathing one after another just breathing

83
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:11,039
in the last few minutes of the sitting gently persist

84
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:16,720
with a focus on your breathing for these minutes as if it's all you

85
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:23,679
have to do let everything else just recede

86
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:33,840
with breathing in the foreground

87
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,200
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

88
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,600
to direct your steady gaze

89
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:15,600
onto the world of others beyond you

90
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,840
a steady and kind gaze

91
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:29,360
being still and looking upon all things kindly

92
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:38,000
and the steadiness of attention that can come from meditation

93
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,679
can be

94
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:50,080
been directed as a steady gaze steady presence

95
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,600
on which travels our kindness our care

96
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:06,720
compassion and it's invaluable

97
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:16,320
to persist in our kindness

98
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,919
in our non-harming

99
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:33,600
in the peacefulness that we provide for other people so they

100
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:40,960
can feel safe may it be that

101
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,840
what we learn in meditation

102
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:53,440
supports us to find new ways or fuller ways

103
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:59,840
to benefit the lives of others

104
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:09,520
to live with a wonderful happy concern for the welfare and

105
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,840
happiness of others

106
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:21,919
as if their happiness and welfare is our own

107
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,840
may all beings be happy

108
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,960
may all beings be safe

109
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:40,080
may all beings be peaceful

110
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,200
and may all beings be

111
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,840
free

112
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:03,749
[Music]

113
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,840
so

114
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:33,279
so i'll continue today with some stories from the suttas the ancient discourses

115
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:41,200
of the buddha and the buddha himself was a storyteller

116
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,880
in that he tells innumerable stories

117
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:53,120
as part of his teachings and some of them maybe or events that he

118
00:31:53,120 --> 00:32:00,799
experienced some of them i think he just made up for the purposes of teaching

119
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:09,279
he also makes up many analogies and metaphors and he's kind of a wonderful uh

120
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:16,240
storyteller who has a rich kind of vocabulary of storytelling techniques and for helping

121
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:23,200
us understand better and and so here's a story the buddha

122
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,240
told it seems that there was a monk who

123
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:35,120
when he was criticized would easily get upset get angry when someone pointed out that

124
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:42,799
he wasn't behaving properly so he told this story

125
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:47,760
that once there was a lady

126
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:56,559
fedex who was known for being gentle

127
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:04,559
and kind and peaceful she had a reputation around town that that was how she was

128
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:10,080
but this lady also had a servant by the name of kali

129
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,760
and kali was

130
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:22,399
worked hard she was very clever and competent in her work was very neat in her work

131
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:28,880
cooked delicious food did everything for the household that made everything go smoothly and

132
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:36,000
easily and then one day kali the servant

133
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:44,320
thought to herself you know it seems that people have this idea that the lady

134
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:51,440
is kind and gentle and peaceful but i wonder if this is really the case

135
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:58,080
let me find out so the next morning uh when usually kali would wake up

136
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:06,399
before the lady and get everything ready for the day but on this day kali slept in

137
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:13,919
and the lady woke up and found that the servant was still sleeping so she

138
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:20,800
spoke harshly oh she said to us first she said to her what's the matter kali that you're

139
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:29,280
sleeping and kali said nothing's the matter i'm just sleeping in and

140
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,720
then the lady got upset and angry and said and it was harsh spoke harshly to her

141
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:40,000
you know don't do that again you shouldn't you can't you have to do your work

142
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:49,118
so then the next day kali slept in again and

143
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:56,158
the next day the the lady asked what's the matter and kali said

144
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:02,880
nothing's the matter i'm just sleeping in and so then the lady got even more upset

145
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:12,000
and spoke even more harshly the next day the same thing happened

146
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,560
but this time the lady got really upset and she got a rolling pin from the

147
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:24,320
kitchen and started hitting the the servant over the head terrible

148
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:29,440
you're wicked you're bad how could you do such a thing and with

149
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:35,359
blood running down her face the servant ran out in the street and said look everyone

150
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:41,680
you thought that the lady was kind and gentle and peaceful but it doesn't take much to provoke her

151
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:47,040
that she's actually underneath she had carries a lot of anger and that anger

152
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:53,119
given half a chance or even a mild chance will surface and look what she's capable of doing

153
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:59,359
and from then on the lady's reputation of being kind and gentle and peaceful was no longer

154
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:05,920
in that town so i imagine the buddha made the story up and maybe we don't like the story too

155
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:12,560
much but still it's an example of him using a story as an analogy

156
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:20,480
because then he goes on and he says that there are five ways that

157
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:29,040
people might speak to you he's talking to the monastics he says that either

158
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:35,760
someone might say something that's true or not true someone might speak in a timely fashion

159
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:41,839
or a not timely fashion someone might speak gently

160
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:48,079
or harshly someone might speak with loving-kindness uh or not

161
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:53,280
with loving-kindness someone might speak to benefit others

162
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:59,599
or to harm them so these are the five ways it's possible to speak

163
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:05,040
regardless of how they speak to you you should have loving kindness for them you should have

164
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:11,920
kind regard for them you should be concerned for care for their welfare and their happiness

165
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:18,400
in other words don't succumb to anger bitterness resentment if they speak to you in a way that's not

166
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:25,040
kind not beneficial way that's harmful that's untimely or

167
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:30,720
that is false that's not a reason to get angry to get upset to be

168
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:36,480
distressed or to be you should always maintain a heart of

169
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:42,160
kindness that doesn't mean that we're pushover doesn't mean that we

170
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:50,560
go along with what they want but it means that we find our way without getting angry

171
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:57,760
and then he goes on to make some analogies and he says what do you think if a person comes

172
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:03,280
along with a shovel maybe a wheelbarrow and starts digging up the dirt

173
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:10,800
on in on the earth to take it away could that man that person succeed at

174
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:16,880
hauling away all the dirt from the earth and i imagine those listening kind of

175
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:22,800
laughed and said no you can't take the dirt away from the earth where are you going to put it

176
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:30,079
and and so in the same way you should make your mind like the earth

177
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:35,440
that no matter what comes your way that uh you're undisturbed you you

178
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:43,040
you're balanced you're not disturbed you're not you're unchanged uh by the harshness or the trouble that

179
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:48,320
when people speak to you in unkind ways or in untruthful ways

180
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:53,440
rather you should continue to spread loving kindness

181
00:38:53,680 --> 00:39:00,320
suppose he said next that a person comes along with paint all kinds of beautiful colored paints

182
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:05,760
and a paintbrush and dips the brush in the paint and starts painting

183
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,880
with a brush on in the air would that person make an any kind of

184
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:16,160
painting and they say no you can't paint that way you have to paint on something you can't

185
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:25,920
just kind of wave your brush in the air in the same way make your mind like empty space

186
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:32,560
and so that whatever words come your way um they don't paint a picture on your

187
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:38,640
mind they don't your mind doesn't react it doesn't take the colors that are thrown at you and people are

188
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:44,079
unkind or speak words of harmful but rather

189
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:52,000
maintain loving kindness and stay concerned care for the welfare of this person

190
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:59,440
and start with that person and then spread that care and good will through everyone in all directions

191
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:04,000
and then he goes on to say that

192
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:10,880
if you put a little bit of dye i think this is right

193
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:17,040
and i don't have the story 100 accurate so you have to be a little bit generous that i'm being a

194
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:23,200
storyteller myself and in some of the details

195
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:28,960
and um but anyway so he says then and then imagine that there's a ganges river

196
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:34,240
and someone puts a little bit of dye and a few drops of dye in that ganges river

197
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:40,000
would that change the river would it color the river and the person said no a few drops might

198
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,920
change the color in a small glass of water but it has no impact on the ganges river

199
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:51,359
and so in the same way make your mind like the ganges river broad and wide and

200
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:58,240
flowing and the words that other people say towards you let it be like those few drops so that

201
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:03,920
it has no impact on you it has no effect on you so that

202
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:10,480
you can maintain a heart of kindness good will loving kindness

203
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:16,800
for this other person you can maintain care you can stay caring for their welfare and their

204
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,960
happiness even if they want to harm you and with that person

205
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:30,480
cultivating your loving kindness to that person then spread it out to all beings everywhere

206
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:37,760
so the first story of the lady and kali is a story about how there's underlying

207
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:43,359
tendencies we have that we can behave one way but deeper down

208
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:49,920
in the mind there might be triggers for us to get angry upset even

209
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:55,599
hostile violent even and that the point of practice

210
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,720
buddhist practice is really to touch the deeper place and transform it and to change it

211
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:07,440
so that our kindness is not superficial or uh feigned or pretend or

212
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:15,200
you know or doesn't really come from who we are or we're not in danger of of really kind of causing harm

213
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:21,280
ourselves and this is one of the reasons why we want to develop concentration in meditation

214
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:27,280
there's something about concentration that can sometimes

215
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:33,119
bring us deeper under the surface concerns we have the surface mind and preoccupations and

216
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:38,560
concerns and stories we tell ourselves deeper down to really see what's there

217
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:44,000
and sometimes what we find is that there's underlying layers of resentment and anger or

218
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,079
upsetness or fear or greed that's there and that is something really good to

219
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:55,280
touch and to see so we know it's there and then we can practice with it

220
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:01,839
and resolve it dissolve it solve it all these words having to solve in them

221
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:07,040
have to do with releasing untying them and in the latin root

222
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:13,280
to untie it and to cultivate loving-kindness

223
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:21,040
not just to be neutral as we untie the knots of the heart but to cultivate loving-kindness

224
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:26,160
no matter what even if people are speaking words that are difficult for us

225
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:33,280
to hear it's a kind of a tall order it's a challenge with the lives that we live

226
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:40,640
but here the buddha is really pointing to the role of practice

227
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:47,520
we practice because this is a valuable way of living that this is a valuable way not as a

228
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:55,280
moral obligation to be kind or to uproot our anger but rather this is both

229
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:03,280
working for the welfare of ourselves and the welfare of others that to really uproot our underlying

230
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,880
tendencies to anger and to cultivate the ability not to

231
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:14,640
succumb to anger and hostility no matter what people say to us

232
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:21,200
this preserves our own peace and well-being and is for our own welfare and

233
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:29,280
as we do it we are also creating the conditions where that other people might

234
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:36,000
work for their own welfare that other people might relax making it possible for other people

235
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:43,040
to be at peace if they know how to use it if they know how

236
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:50,079
to allow for it

237
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:57,880
so thank you and we'll continue a few more stories this

238
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:00,880
week
