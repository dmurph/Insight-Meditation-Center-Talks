1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,439
so hello everyone and welcome

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,480
and this

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,640
mindfulness that we're exploring and discovering it's always a discovery

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,680
this dharma that we're discovering here and now

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,800
is always a discovery it's always a feeling that

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,840
not a feeling but all that we never go we never bother

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,040
never go to the effort of thinking

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,559
that we've seen it before we never have to

9
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:51,039
have the mental the neurons firing that's saying this is not interesting or

10
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:58,239
this is too much this is you know not what i was hoping for

11
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,600
all those kinds of ideations are not needed in the simplicity

12
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,040
of just here and now as something to be known to be

13
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:15,759
experienced to be felt in its radical simplicity

14
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:23,200
and yesterday i offered this teaching about this the ouch and the ah

15
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,320
without needing to analyze what the ouch is or what the eye

16
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:36,000
is or think about its past and its future and what to do about it keep it that simple

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,439
the other sim very radical simplicity of this practice

18
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:47,360
is to be with the experience the ouches the ahs the knowing of it the ex whatever

19
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,560
the experience is even if it's not out your ah but to

20
00:01:52,560 --> 00:02:00,000
be with it as with in the changing river of time to be with it in the current

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,360
of how things are always flowing past or through

22
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:12,239
it's kind of like a little bit like we're standing in a

23
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,599
river and maybe we're not we're not we're standing

24
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:26,080
but in the moment right with us the the water is always flowing by

25
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,760
and to stay in the flow of the present moment as it comes from the comes from the past in a sense and goes

26
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,360
to the future comes from the future and flows back to the past whatever your metaphor

27
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,959
might be just right here in the changing nature and what's interesting is that this

28
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:52,560
principle this being grounded as best we can here and now in the changing flowing nature of it

29
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,879
is that what we discover is the ways that we

30
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,480
freeze the moment the way we resist the change the way we step out of that flow

31
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,560
by thinking by wanting something different by remembering the past or the future

32
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,800
reacting to something wanting to analyze it figure it out these movements out of the river of time

33
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,239
out of the river of change and movement and flow of what's happening

34
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:31,040
and that flow of change that we tune into is both the change of experiences that they

35
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,400
come and go and use new new experiences come that weren't expected maybe and they're there for a moment and something

36
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:44,239
else comes but they also involve the changing nature of the knowing itself

37
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:50,000
knowing is a little bit fickle knowing knowing jumps around and

38
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,720
and um uh and um

39
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,560
and so to kind of be there so like if you're with your breathing and then

40
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:11,120
you're with some kind of thoughts about the breath or about yesterday's breathing then um

41
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,880
the knowing the awareness has shifted to something else and there's a sound outside the knowing

42
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:23,280
shifts to the sound and is it a knowing that shifts and moves is it the sound that moves that

43
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,759
comes to you is moving what is it that's you know the constant moving of the mind of awareness

44
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:37,520
of experiences not to be straining to look for it that that's just more

45
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,600
kind of freezing in the flow but relaxing into the very simplicity

46
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,759
of the experience here and now to know it for oneself

47
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,160
so to assume a meditation posture

48
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:05,039
a posture of confidence that yes

49
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:11,840
maybe with a yes yes i will sit here

50
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,000
in a sense standing in the ground standing in the middle of the river

51
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,880
of time yes here's where i'll sit be present

52
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:34,560
with confidence taking a few long slow deep breaths

53
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,199
and on the exhales closing the eyes and

54
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,080
settling into this spot here now

55
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,240
and letting your breathing return to normal

56
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:23,199
and continue on the exhale the inhale to feel your body feel where the holding is

57
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,400
maybe holding tension is a little bit of an ouch

58
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,720
feeling that on the inhale and the exhale letting your

59
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,520
letting your body relax soften

60
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:39,199
and then quietly peacefully calming the mind

61
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,560
relaxing the thinking mind

62
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:20,639
and as you're experiencing your breathing the breathing itself the way it's

63
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:27,840
experienced in the body is a changing experience

64
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,360
to some degree it's a change that repeats itself

65
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,959
but it's still a changing experience

66
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:50,640
and spend some time now centering yourself from the changing nature

67
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,480
of sensations connected to breathing

68
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:38,080
and as you do so become aware also of the changing nature

69
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:44,560
of what you know of the knowing itself

70
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:53,440
that you might know the breathing the mind might move if awareness might

71
00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:02,360
move to know something else my voice and then back to the breathing

72
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:12,880
stay centered on the breathing the changing nature of sensations

73
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:21,120
but be aware as well of where the knowing is and how the

74
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,160
knowing might come and go and where it goes

75
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:32,640
it too is changing don't worry about the change if you can

76
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,000
just know and see the change

77
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,720
maybe with your breathing maybe some other way

78
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,000
know how your experiences in the moment now here

79
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,480
are changing and be aware of

80
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,839
how your knowing itself shifts and changes

81
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:17,480
these two exchanging things their experience and our knowing

82
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,160
relax back into that awareness alertness

83
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:35,519
that can allow this to flow along in the present moment the shifting changing nature of

84
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,560
experience and of knowing

85
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,839
both are in the flow of time

86
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:44,800
what we experience is changing shifting

87
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,800
the knowing is changing and shifting

88
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:00,560
both the known and the knowing

89
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,959
come and go and change

90
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,279
calmly being aware of change

91
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,839
change of what we know and the knowing itself

92
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:53,839
and if you're aware of all this with a kind of

93
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:04,079
background awareness or overviewing awareness

94
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,959
they can know what's happening with your knowing

95
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,959
that awareness

96
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,480
is maybe where freedom is found

97
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,760
being aware of change

98
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:02,240
the shifting moving in constant nature of our experience

99
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,880
being aware of it and resting in that awareness

100
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:18,679
kind of like you're not standing in the river but floating in the river of change

101
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,919
carried along in the current

102
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,840
that's where freedom is found

103
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,000
where that is where you can feel that you're resisting or

104
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:51,879
change or stuck and not moving along with change

105
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:21,880
as soon as you know clearly that you're stuck clearly not in the river of change

106
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,799
that moment in a way you're back in the river

107
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:35,360
if you trust it if you allow for it it's just another moment of knowing

108
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,080
that has just arisen

109
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,200
and as we come to the end of this sitting

110
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:22,400
the end is just a continu continuation of change and comings and

111
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,520
goings just another

112
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:32,080
moment in the river of time that's

113
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,519
we only connect to in the present

114
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,720
and to be at ease in this river

115
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,039
to not freeze it or be stuck in some way

116
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:58,640
not hang on to the branches on the sides of

117
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,320
hanging over the sides of the river

118
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:10,159
to be available for the changing nature of this world

119
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:17,640
where the present moment is not static but dynamic

120
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,960
to be available and open receptive

121
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:35,279
and to see that that it can be at that stance that way

122
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:42,480
of being can be a gift for how we are in the world

123
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,520
certainly many of the other ways of being is not a gift

124
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:54,799
but to be present and available aware and

125
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:01,320
attuned to how things shift and change

126
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:09,200
and to be present to feel it to sense it is a way of connecting more deeply to

127
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,120
other people into our life

128
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:23,120
may it be that the freedom of our awareness

129
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,760
our ability to be aware freely with freedom

130
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:38,240
allows for a wonderful channel

131
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:44,440
of our care and good will to flow into the world

132
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:53,278
may all beings be happy

133
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:59,398
may all beings be safe

134
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,960
may all beings be peaceful

135
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:11,480
may all beings be free

136
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:20,960
and may our ability to be mindful aware here in the present

137
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,278
contribute to this possibility

138
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:38,269
[Music]

139
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,398
thank you

140
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:58,320
so we come to the

141
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,440
fifth and last talk on the characteristics qualities of the

142
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:09,200
dharma the dhamma that has been well spoken of by the

143
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:16,399
buddha so to some degree it's talking about his teaching and what is but it's also talking about

144
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:23,440
what his teachings what is dhamma is pointing to what the dhamma is is the truth

145
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:29,279
that we're discovering through this practice and it's also

146
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:37,279
the the the way we discover it the means by which we discover it and this uh

147
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:42,320
combination of the means of what we're discovering and what we're discovering

148
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:47,840
speaks to this intimacy certainly of mindfulness practice

149
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:55,279
but also the intimacy of the means and the goal that the goal to be free to be

150
00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:00,080
aware and open free unrestricted way

151
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:08,880
that not doing it completely but in partial ways beginning to to live that goal in the

152
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:16,720
means to practice being present in a clear direct full way

153
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:22,399
here and these uh five qualities of the dhamma that

154
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:27,519
i've been going through this week is to

155
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:32,799
is the dhamma which is visible here

156
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:40,000
that it's now it's immediate that it is

157
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:54,720
inviting inspection inviting us to see come and see so this coming to see opening to see

158
00:31:54,799 --> 00:32:01,679
here now seeing here now that's kind of at the heart of what

159
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:09,440
we're doing here and if we enter this world of seeing knowing being present here and now

160
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:15,440
then we find that something opens for us the an open door

161
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:22,240
or an open current of what's onward leading we can see a path we see a movement

162
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:28,480
towards what is wholesome and healthy where the eye is we see the ouch

163
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,679
and we can see how our clinging and grasping and hate and

164
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:40,480
delusion and ambition is a freezing of time

165
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:47,840
is a being stuck outs you know without being in the in the free flow of time being free in the time in time

166
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,880
in the flow of here and now and we feel the out show that

167
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:58,799
and as we see it and be with it there's a at some point we see or intuit

168
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:05,200
or feel there's something an alternative to that and that alternative we get a sense of

169
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:11,679
it is the ah is the possibility of non-green non-hatred

170
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:17,519
non-delusion non-conceit non-reactivity just here in a relaxed

171
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:22,720
open way and something begins to flow and to move where we start

172
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:29,279
flowing in the flow of the present moment we start being carried by this wholesome healthy direction

173
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:35,039
of practice of and and that this is to be experienced

174
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:41,279
this dumb must be experienced the last quality is the dhamma is to be experienced

175
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:47,200
directly actually the languages this dhamma is to be

176
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:53,399
personally experienced by the wise

177
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:59,039
so personally experienced by the wise so we're talking about something that in a

178
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:06,799
sense only you yourself can really experience know for yourself

179
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:12,960
so i don't know if it's the best examples but um maybe only you

180
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,720
know that you're hungry only you know you can tell people and maybe you can give the symptoms of

181
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:25,358
it to people but it's a the experience of hunger is internal to oneself

182
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:31,760
the experience of having an itch people might not know you have an itch but you certainly can know it

183
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,878
you have to pee that's something we experience for ourselves

184
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:43,760
so certain so there might be better examples for each of you rather than what i came up with but they did some things only we

185
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:49,760
can experience for ourselves and so there is a way in which this dhamma

186
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:56,960
is to enter into that world which we can only experience we ourselves can experience personally

187
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,400
and the way there's ouches and oz is really something we experience

188
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:09,119
experientially we can know that for ourselves and we can know for ourselves

189
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:15,520
whether things are stuck or whether things are flowing and moving maybe other people can intuit that

190
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:22,320
looking at how we behave but this is something to be experienced for oneself really so this is almost

191
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:28,079
internal or this deep very personal very intimate involvement with the present moment with

192
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:34,400
here and our direct experience and what we can experience most valuably

193
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,520
is not complicated so this is not an engineering job it's not some

194
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:46,800
sophisticated analysis it's not remembering causes and understanding why things happen or

195
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:52,240
planning out the future and what should happen it's rather than

196
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:58,400
there's something extremely powerful and freeing about keeping it radically simple in the

197
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:05,280
present moment the only place where we can really directly personally know for ourselves

198
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,480
how things are shifting and changing moving how they appear and disappear

199
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,760
their inconstancy their impermanence and

200
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:21,920
and not to be straining to see that but more like resting back into it

201
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:27,119
and seeing the changing nature of so this uh

202
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:34,480
personally experienced by the wise the experience wise that the wise person

203
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:40,720
um is mentioned here and and now my favorite definition that the

204
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:48,560
buddha gives for a wise person a wise person is concerned with the welfare of self the welfare of

205
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:54,320
others the welfare of self and others and the welfare of all beings i think

206
00:36:54,320 --> 00:37:00,640
it's such a beautiful definition of wisdom because it doesn't require opening up all the dharma books and learning all

207
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,680
the lists and all the teachings it's more of an attitude it's something

208
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:11,280
that arises within but as a practice deepens a wise person

209
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:16,480
part of the reason a wise person is interested in the welfare of everyone including oneself

210
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,680
is because in the direct experience of the moment we see very clearly

211
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:28,000
this um ah and ouch we can feel the movement to the ah to

212
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,839
what where welfare is where well-being is where peace is and

213
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:39,839
and that comes together with seeing impermanence and change

214
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:45,520
because when we don't see the changing impermanent moving nature of reality

215
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:51,599
we're probably locked on in some way we've frozen we've gotten contracted or caught or

216
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:58,560
in some way on something some preoccupation and maybe trying to think about how things

217
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:05,440
can things really be in constant and changing so much we start thinking about that we've kind of removed ourselves

218
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:11,839
from the experience the directness immediacy of what's changing and we can feel that movement we can

219
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:18,079
feel the ouch of that maybe very very subtle but a little bit of strain or attention

220
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:25,599
and we can feel that there is a way in which the ah comes from coming back into the river of change of flow and movement

221
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:30,720
and and all that and to see this uh it's not an easy

222
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:37,440
thing i'm talking about so you can't just decide to sit down and do it but as a practice deepens and as we

223
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:44,079
settle in more and more and feel more confident and more at ease and more able to stay

224
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:49,680
mindful of the present more continuously at some point this opens up for us we

225
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:55,680
start seeing the changing nature of our experience the changing nature of our knowing of

226
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,800
experience sometimes we're more aware of how experience is changing like the

227
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:07,440
breathing sensations are changing sometimes i'm more aware of how the knowing of it is a changing moving

228
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:13,680
phenomena that the knowing is cooperates a little bit sometimes independent of what we have

229
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:20,000
chosen to know because if we start thinking we you know the mind is kind of no the knowing mind

230
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,240
knows different things there's a sound outside and now we know the sound rather for a moment rather than for

231
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:32,720
the breathing there's a thought about how much time is left in this meditation

232
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:39,040
and we know that and then we're back into the breathing we might be

233
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:45,920
knowing something about the breath and then we notice that now next what we know is we notice that

234
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:52,480
there is some sensation that does in that area of the chest where we're doing breathing but you know

235
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:58,880
it may be not directly connected to breathing how did you shift how did the how did the knowing move that knowing

236
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:05,200
changed and all this no all this knowing of change

237
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:11,119
uh is the at the heart of of uh

238
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:17,280
you know what uh some people are called and translate into what's called vidja

239
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,319
in pali and vijaya some people translate as true knowledge vija is liberating

240
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:28,640
knowledge the liberating understanding or knowing vijaya is the opposite of avijja which

241
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:35,599
is ignorance so if we use ignorance in the opposite in english i guess would be gnosis

242
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:41,839
but knowing understanding seeing and so a wise person is

243
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:48,319
is a vin vinu is the word is connected to this word vidya

244
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:53,760
and so someone who knows what's beneficial what knows what welfare is is concerned

245
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,440
with it and can see that in the direct moment of being attuned to

246
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:07,839
the changing quiet flowing nature of phenomena and in that awareness of that

247
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,200
not looking for freedom but in the awareness of all that

248
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:20,160
freedom is revealed letting go and non-clinging is revealed

249
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:27,040
to be personally experienced by the wise to know for yourself from the inside

250
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:34,560
that the mind is not clinging to anything attached to anything holding on to anything at least for a short period of time

251
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:39,839
trusting that finding that being that is

252
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:46,880
is this art of this dhamma that the buddha is talking about so

253
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:53,520
uh so we have at this uh the dhamma

254
00:41:53,520 --> 00:42:00,400
uh spoken by the buddha

255
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:07,119
well spoken is the dhamma of the buddha it is

256
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:12,560
visible here it's immediate now

257
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:21,359
it is to be see it is inviting us to see deeply

258
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:28,720
it is uh onward leading and to be personally experienced by the

259
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:34,000
wise and in pali this is often chanted in pali and my pali chanting is not so

260
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,280
great but i'll offer you my best effort for it

261
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:11,760
so you have to kind of be generous to the chanting but that's the poly

262
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:17,599
so so thank you and i hope that

263
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:24,000
this kind of teachings about the dhamma can give you some deeper

264
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:32,319
trust and confidence in the mindfulness and don't be so concerned about

265
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:38,839
how far you practice or whether what i'm talking about today this week is exactly where you are in your

266
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:46,079
practice but have confidence that doing this practice it's onward leading

267
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:51,119
and you don't you're not necessarily responsible for the onward leading nature of it

268
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:56,160
we are setting the conditions for it by being present and mindful

269
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:03,440
and then when the time is right the dhamma is onward leading within us

270
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:09,200
and may you become a wise person free liberated

271
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:15,040
and concerned for the welfare of all may all beings be well

272
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,280
thank you
