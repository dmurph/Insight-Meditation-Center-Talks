1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,080
so good morning everyone we've had a

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,360
very exciting time

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,200
trying to welcome you uh this morning so

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,720
i'm sorry we're going to be

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,679
a little short on our meditation um i'll

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:12,559
be

7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,120
having us basically sit for about seven

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:15,679
minutes

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,480
so i just want to ask you all to find a

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,480
comfortable place for your body

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,800
and

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,960
i think most of you are familiar with

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,400
the program that we're doing

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,760
for these three weeks there's an

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,760
intensive with gil

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,160
bronsdale myself and paul heller we've

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,840
called the harmony of zen

18
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,800
and vipassana so during this week we've

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,760
been taking turns

20
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,600
talking about the different elements of

21
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,200
our practice and how they differ how

22
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,399
they're the same

23
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,879
the roots are shared it all starts with

24
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,960
the buddhist enlightened vision

25
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,239
under the tree so as dharma comrades

26
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:52,800
we've been

27
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,120
really enjoying looking at the first

28
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,879
week we looked at samadhi

29
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,840
practices meditation the second week at

30
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,879
prajna

31
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,120
wisdom practices and this week we're

32
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,439
looking at sheila or the practices of

33
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,200
right conduct

34
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,640
so when the buddha was sitting under the

35
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,640
tree he was really giving us this

36
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,000
visible instruction

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,600
of how to meet our life you know

38
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,200
literally face to face and

39
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,520
how to meet the myriad things that are

40
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,479
continuously

41
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,400
coming forth to greet us like we had

42
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,000
this morning with all this

43
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,159
electronic uh efforts to come together

44
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,720
so right posture expresses not only our

45
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,360
integrity

46
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,040
and our dignity but in the best of

47
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,040
moments our kindness

48
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,680
and our innate curiosity about the world

49
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,520
around us

50
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,759
so like the buddha under the tree we sit

51
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,119
on the ground whether it's

52
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,040
on a cushion or on the grass or in a

53
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,439
chair and we find a stable

54
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,560
position for our lower body

55
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,000
as i hope you've already done this

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,079
morning

57
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,920
and then we lengthen the spine from the

58
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,280
base slowly

59
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,719
extending upward to the head balancing

60
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,560
your head on top of your

61
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,079
shoulders relaxing the neck

62
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,119
softening your eyes

63
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,039
and then inviting whatever tension there

64
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,560
is in your body to flow

65
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,840
back downward back down

66
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,280
into the earth from which we came so

67
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,280
very very very long ago

68
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,520
so finding your seed is a very long and

69
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,720
intimate process

70
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,000
as one monk said after years of sitting

71
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,080
the greatest pilgrimage of my life has

72
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,480
been my body

73
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,400
so take the time you need to explore all

74
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,640
the parts of your body lengthening the

75
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,519
torso

76
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,920
opening your chest relax your belly

77
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,120
and then let your skin hang loose i was

78
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,640
thinking about that this morning you

79
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,160
know kind of like a soft

80
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,640
silk dress on a hanger in a dark closet

81
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,080
take two deep breaths fully inhaling

82
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,800
through your mouth

83
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,000
and follow the flow of the air as it

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,959
enters your body that cool air

85
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,920
and how it becomes warm as it goes out

86
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,239
again

87
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,840
so a couple of times deep inhalation see

88
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,360
the mouth

89
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,720
filling the belly the chest and then

90
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,760
slowly exhaling

91
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,239
after that we just breathe naturally

92
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,840
and like

93
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,560
if you like uh helps you to concentrate

94
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,000
you can count your breaths on the

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,840
inhalation on the impulse to inhale

96
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,319
which i

97
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,480
locate myself in my

98
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,040
abdomen pulse to

99
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,400
breathe count one

100
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,720
and on the next impulse to inhale

101
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,120
two and so on to ten

102
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,680
and then from there back to one you know

103
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,720
it's not

104
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,640
always so easy to do this it takes some

105
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,879
time some practice to get to ten

106
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,280
so without discouraging yourself or

107
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,720
thinking you're doing it wrong

108
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,640
just start over at one whenever you

109
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,000
notice you've gone off

110
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
into dreams dreams of the past

111
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,720
plans for the future and just come on on

112
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,079
back to your body

113
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,080
your wonderful body which is always in

114
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,080
the present it's a great thing about our

115
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,960
bodies they are

116
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,280
always right here right now

117
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,080
like a good dog waiting for us to return

118
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,240
so i wanted to read you a little portion

119
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,320
of a poem written by

120
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,479
a chinese zen master who founded our

121
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,639
school uh sotozen his name is dongshan

122
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,000
and in japanese tozan ryokai

123
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,400
and the poem he wrote about meditation

124
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,440
about life

125
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,320
about awakening is called the song of

126
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:00,720
the

127
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,919
dual mirror samadhi

128
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,479
the teaching of vastness has been

129
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,720
intimately communicated by buddhas and

130
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,520
ancestors

131
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,680
so keep it well filling a silver bowl

132
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,639
with snow

133
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,199
hiding a heron in the moonlight taking a

134
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,520
similar they are not the same

135
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,039
when you mix them you know where they

136
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,720
are the meaning is not in the words

137
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,639
yet it responds to the inquiring impulse

138
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,840
move and you are trapped miss and you

139
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,639
fall

140
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,600
into doubt and vacillation turning away

141
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,039
and touching are both wrong

142
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,759
for it is like a massive fire just to

143
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,400
depict it

144
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,440
in literary form is to stain it with

145
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,880
defilement

146
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,600
it is bright just at midnight it doesn't

147
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,000
appear

148
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,520
at dawn it acts as a guide for beings

149
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,800
its use removes all pains

150
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,360
although it is not fabricated it is not

151
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,600
without speech

152
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,800
it is like facing a dual mirror

153
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,240
form and image behold each other

154
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:21,840
you are not it in truth it is you

155
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,840
uh

156
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,360
i'm so sorry we didn't have longer to

157
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,199
sit together this morning but i hope

158
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,800
you'll find time later today

159
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,199
or this evening to sit a little bit

160
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,199
yourselves

161
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,000
so good morning again for those of you

162
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,840
who might just be tuning in

163
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,720
um i'm foo schrader i'm the abbess at

164
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,759

zen center in marin county california

166
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,800
and as i mentioned uh we are in the

167
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,960
middle or toward the end actually

168
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,560
of what's been a wonderful three-week

169
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,280
intensive with gil fransdale

170
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,919
myself and paul haller also from the zen

171
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,080
center

172
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,599
and so we've been offering these

173
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,319
perspectives uh from our two traditions

174
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,840
vipassana and zen

175
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,879
on many things you know what difference

176
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,240
what's the same

177
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,360
about our meditation about our

178
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,000
wisdom teachings and also about right

179
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,560
conduct which is what we're focusing on

180
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,240
this week so i've been discussing

181
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,000
in this morning session the 16

182
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,839
bodhisattva precepts yesterday i talked

183
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,080
about the practice of confession

184
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,720
and repentance which is preliminary to

185
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,080
receiving the precepts

186
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,399
you know acknowledging oh yeah i did

187
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,519
that i did that

188
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,600
and i i really don't want to do that

189
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,680
anymore you know really knowing within

190
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,880
our own hearts

191
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,320
what things we've done that we would

192
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,240
really like to change you know

193
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,320
and how to do that so precepts are one

194
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,080
of the kind of guidance systems for

195
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,080
making changes that we'd like to make

196
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,800
in our lives so the first of the three

197
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,240
bodhisattva precepts

198
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,240
are called the refuges the three refuges

199
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,880
and refuges are taken in what's called

200
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,200
the triple treasure the buddha

201
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,200
the dharma and the sangha community

202
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,000
so i want to begin with the koan from

203
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,440
the book of serenity

204
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,040
which is a collection of teaching

205
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,640
stories that

206
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,800
started to be gathered together right

207
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,959
about the time that zen arrived in china

208
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,720
over 1300 years ago this one is called

209
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,720
the world honored one points to the

210
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,880
ground the world honored one is the

211
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,880
buddha

212
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,839
as soon as a single mode of dust arises

213
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,680
the whole earth is contained

214
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,040
therein with a single horse and a single

215
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,839
lance

216
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,519
the land is extended who is this person

217
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,560
who can be master in any place

218
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,440
and meet the source in everything so

219
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,160
here's the story

220
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,720
as the world honored one the buddha was

221
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,720
walking with a congregation

222
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,640
he pointed to the ground with his finger

223
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,640
and said this spot

224
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,240
is good to build a sanctuary

225
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,000
indra the emperor of the gods took a

226
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,360
blade of grass

227
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,839
stuck it in the ground and said the

228
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,480
sanctuary is built

229
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,320
the world honored one smiled

230
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,320
so for me it's the buddhist smile that

231
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,760
has carried this ancient

232
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,760
tradition from its home in far away

233
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,800
india

234
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,320
over those thousands of miles and

235
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,480
hundreds of centuries

236
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,079
in order to shine brightly on us here

237
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,680
today taking refuge building sanctuaries

238
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,320
in the warmth of that smile is the

239
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,399
beginning of a well-marked path

240
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,040
to our own well-being and happiness and

241
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,240
for the benefit

242
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,240
of this terribly suffering world i take

243
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,800
refuge in buddha as the perfect teacher

244
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,880
i take refuge in dharma as the perfect

245
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,240
teaching

246
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,480
i take refuge in sangha as the perfect

247
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,600
life

248
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,000
so these are very powerful words that we

249
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,519
chant just about every morning

250
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,640
excuse me at the zen center

251
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,399
and although each of us may have this

252
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,240
unique feeling about what these words

253
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,120
mean

254
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,959
i think it's useful for us to look at

255
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,160
words carefully

256
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,560
and wonder about what they how they hit

257
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,000
us deeply inside

258
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,160
and what role they play and our own

259
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,240
understanding of buddhist practice

260
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,680
in our near perfect lives

261
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,600
so long long ago when the buddha the

262
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,720
perfect teacher

263
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,279
had set in motion the wheel of the law

264
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,079
there was a moment

265
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,120
in time where or so i can imagine

266
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,760
there was kind of near perfect stillness

267
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,680
you know like when someone shouts into a

268
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,880
canyon and then

269
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,000
waits for that familiar voice to echo

270
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,839
in reply hello

271
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,200
so in the case of the buddha the

272
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,920
response came from kondana

273
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,639
meaning the one who knows declaring his

274
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,519
understanding

275
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,760
and requesting the full admission as the

276
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,680
buddha's first disciple

277
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,240
hello kundana says i'm here

278
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,800
i hear you lord buddha

279
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,639
and then he says to the buddha i wish to

280
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,720
go forth under the blessed one and to

281
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,639
receive the full admission

282
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,920
the buddha replies come your

283
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,600
understanding of the dharma is well

284
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,800
proclaimed

285
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,200
live the holy life for the complete end

286
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,279
of suffering

287
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,600
and with that request the triple

288
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,480
treasure

289
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,959
was manifest in this world we have the

290
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:47,680
buddha

291
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,680
and the dharma the teaching and now

292
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,120
there's a sangha

293
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,440
giver the receiver and the gift

294
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,839
so at that moment as it says in the pali

295
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,360
canon at that instant

296
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,440
the news traveled right up to the brahma

297
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,920
world and this ten thousand-fold

298
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,839
world element shook and quaked and

299
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,720
trembled while a great measureless light

300
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,800
surpassing the splendor of the gods

301
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,760
appeared

302
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,320
in the world

303
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,120
so this request by kundana to take

304
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,079
refuge

305
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,399
in the buddha and the dharma was in the

306
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,160
form of a call and response

307
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,200
you know like the echo in the valley

308
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,600
this is a very familiar form of dialogue

309
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,560
that we practice

310
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,240
both in the zen and the vipassana

311
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,480
traditions right to this very day

312
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,200
and it's called by a number of names we

313
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,079
call it sometimes question and answer

314
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,560
uh or practice discussion or doksan

315
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,760
doksan means

316
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,360
a private consultation with a teacher

317
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,240
so with the buddha and his teachings

318
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,079
without them without these teachings and

319
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,920
without these people who came to study

320
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,639
with him

321
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,279
there wouldn't be any buddhism for us

322
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,279
right now there'd be no refuge

323
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,600
no blade of grass with which to build

324
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,519
the sanctuary

325
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,480
so taking refuge in the triple treasure

326
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,480
as suzuki roshi said

327
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,199
i mentioned this the other day by taking

328
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:09,920
refuge

329
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,720
you adore the buddha and the dharma and

330
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,600
the sangha

331
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,560
and that for you taking refuge is an act

332
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,040
of adoration

333
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,920
so before declaring your adoration for

334
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,440
the triple treasure if you

335
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,839
haven't already it might be good to

336
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,920
consider what each of these three

337
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,360
treasures means to you now first there's

338
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,000
the buddha

339
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,120
a word that means awake when the buddha

340
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,279
was approached by a wanderer on the road

341
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,959
shortly after his enlightenment the

342
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,560
wanderers said

343
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,519
are you a god would have said no are you

344
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,720
a water spirit

345
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,639
buddha said no are you a demon no

346
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,760
are you a human being buddha said no

347
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,680
he said and then the wanderer said well

348
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,680
dear sir what might you be

349
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,600
and buddha said i am awake.

350
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,680
so lots of things that can be said about

351
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,600
the buddha in fact we use this word all

352
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,399
the time

353
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,720
we bow to images of the buddha we offer

354
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,160
fragrance and sweet tea

355
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,760
and flowers and food we dress like him

356
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,920
we endeavor to act like him and we spend

357
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,199
a lot of time listening

358
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,880
to the words of the buddha and of his

359
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,120
descendants

360
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,760
all of which sound like adoration you

361
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,160
know at least the form of it

362
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,079
so one understanding that we in the zen

363
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,000
school have about what it means to take

364
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,480
refuge in buddha is to take refuge in

365
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,360
who we really are you know and that who

366
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,320
we really are

367
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,600
is already buddha is already this

368
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,839
quality

369
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,680
awake so the word refuge

370
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,440
literally means to fly back to fly back

371
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,759
in other words we fly back to our true

372
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,440
self our whole self

373
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,680
our limitless ungraspable and

374
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,040
inconceivable

375
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,240
existence so therefore

376
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,240
it's not something that we can change we

377
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,160
can't produce it we can't destroy it and

378
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,600
we can't bring it about

379
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,240
by any kind of effort there's nothing to

380
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:04,880
add

381
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,519
and there's nothing to be taken away and

382
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,639
as frustrating

383
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,040
as that might be it's something that no

384
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,160
doubt we've all noticed

385
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,240
about reality it always wins

386
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,720
so the shortest term for that reality of

387
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,199
who we really are in zen we say the word

388
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,639
thus thus the buddha is called the thus

389
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,440
come one just like the body always in

390
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,959
the present

391
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,040
or as zen master dongshan said as he

392
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,079
crossed a river

393
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,480
and saw the reflection of his own face

394
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,440
in the water

395
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,000
this is the moment of his awakening and

396
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,800
he said

397
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,560
just this person he was quite surprised

398
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,240
just this person and as the buddha said

399
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,959
showed by uh to the assembly by holding

400
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,519
up a flower you know just this flower

401
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,639
you know look just this person just this

402
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,440
moment

403
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,360
of awakening so being a buddha being

404
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,519
awake means being unattached to your

405
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,400
ideas about who you are whether you

406
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,199
think you are

407
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,199
rotten or you think you are absolutely

408
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,319
great

409
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,400
that not grasping those thoughts is

410
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,240
buddha and ironically

411
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,720
being a person who has such thoughts is

412
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,079
a prerequisite

413
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,360
for being buddha for awakening so step

414
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,480
number one

415
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,959
this very mind is buddha step number two

416
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,799
no mind no buddha so in either case

417
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,799
imagining that you can run away from who

418
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,400
you really are is

419
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,360
simply a delusion and what kind of

420
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,000
delusion

421
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,880
it's the delusion of running away seeing

422
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,840
that

423
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,799
is an insight it's called returning to

424
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,840
buddha you know taking refuge

425
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,400
return to who we really are including

426
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,840
all of our delusions

427
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,480
is to take refuge in buddha in the truth

428
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,000
of reality

429
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,120
the truth of our human life not one and

430
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,480
not two

431
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,200
and that's true sentient beings and

432
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:01,840
buddhas

433
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,360
are not separate in his book being

434
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:05,840
upright

435
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,240
tension anderson says this about taking

436
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,960
refuge in buddha

437
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,880
trusting that your buddha does not mean

438
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,120
that you identify with being buddha

439
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,120
it's not something special about you

440
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,480
that makes you buddha

441
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,360
it's simply you being you that is buddha

442
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,200
and it's not that you're so virtuous

443
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,320
that your buddha

444
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,600
but that you being you is virtue

445
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,520
to take refuge in buddha means to give

446
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,640
up running away

447
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,360
from home it means to recognize our

448
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,559
responsibility

449
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,600
to live in accord with our buddhahood in

450
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,200
other words to assume

451
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,559
you are buddha and now to act like it

452
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,880
the second of the triple treasures is

453
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,799
taking refuge in the dharma

454
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,360
what the buddha taught and here's what

455
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,360
he said to ananda at the very time of

456
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,559
his death

457
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,600
it's from the polycanada ananda you may

458
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,360
think the word of the teacher is a thing

459
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,160
of the past

460
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,799
now you have no more teacher but you

461
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,480
should not regard it so

462
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,640
the dharma and the discipline taught by

463
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,440
me are your teacher after i'm gone

464
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,520
the law i have taught has no secret

465
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,880
version there is no

466
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,440
teacher's closed fist about the good

467
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,360
things here

468
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,240
now i am old ananda my years have turned

469
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,440
80.

470
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,000
just as an old cart is made to carry on

471
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
with the help of makeshifts

472
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,640
so too it seems to me the blessed one's

473
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,320
body is made to carry on

474
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,679
with the help of makeshift so ananda

475
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,760
each of you should make of yourself an

476
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,559
island with no other refuge

477
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,640
each of you should make the law their

478
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,840
island and no

479
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,360
other refuge either now or when i'm gone

480
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,640
it is those whoever they may be who make

481
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,919
themselves and the law

482
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,799
their islands and no other refuge who

483
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,360
will be the foremost among my disciples

484
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,960
of those that is who want to train

485
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,000
how could it be ananda that what is born

486
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,679
come into being formed and bound to fall

487
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,200
should not fall that is not possible

488
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,559
then the blessed one addressed the

489
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,640
beaches thus

490
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,679
indeed beaches i declare this to you it

491
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,080
is in the nature of all formations

492
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,280
to dissolve attain perfection through

493
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,960
diligence

494
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,280
this was the perfect one's last

495
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,919
utterance

496
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,480
so part of our understanding of these

497
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,720
teachings is that the buddha was not

498
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,200
the person but the teaching itself which

499
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,080
has continued right up into this day

500
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,840
and in this way i think we're quite

501
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,840
fortunate not to bear the problems of

502
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,520
deification

503
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,440
although we do get carried away

504
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,720
sometimes

505
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,000
especially here at green country with

506
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,400
all the bells and whistles

507
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,960
so i think if we continue to appreciate

508
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,720
that these statues and offerings

509
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,640
that we're making in our homes and in

510
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,919
our temples are truly

511
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,320
gestures of gratitude being made by

512
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,039
those of us

513
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,039
alive today you know the living

514
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,039
buddhists

515
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,640
and without that there can't be any

516
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,559
ancestors if we don't remember and honor

517
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,400
them and there can't be the teaching

518
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,320
of the buddha unless you know we like

519
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,320
the honey ants carry it within our own

520
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,760
bodies

521
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,960
i don't know if you know about honey

522
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,880
ants but they're really amazing which is

523
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,080
why i think of them

524
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,840
as a good metaphor for the work that

525
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,200
we're also doing

526
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,240
together in our temples honey ants have

527
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:28,640
these

528
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,200
abdomens that fill up with honey and

529
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,320
then they hang

530
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,080
the ants hang from the ceilings of their

531
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,400
nests serving as storage units for the

532
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,360
benefit

533
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,240
of their communities and for the same

534
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,600
reason the students of the buddhist

535
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,440
teaching have been called the vessels of

536
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,120
the dharma

537
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,600
the honey ants of the dharma and so

538
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,640
what's the dharma

539
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,960
well that's a good question with either

540
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,000
a very long

541
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,200
or a very short answer in the prajnapar

542
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,440
mita literature which is the basis for

543
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,000
our

544
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,960
zen tradition prajnaparamita means

545
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,120
wisdom beyond wisdom

546
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,720
there are two versions that have been

547
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,280
written extreme examples

548
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,000
one version is a hundred thousand lines

549
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,760
it's a very large text and on the other

550
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,640
end

551
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,320
is the letter a so basically the dharma

552
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,520
is the truth

553
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,760
and it's really up to each of us to find

554
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,720
the truth

555
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,640
and to live within the circle of what

556
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,240
our eye of practice can see

557
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,880
and as for the sangha it is this very

558
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,320
wide and wonderful

559
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,400
community of friends who have been

560
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,480
gathering in a world around

561
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,159
to listen to the teachings of the gentle

562
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,640
buddhas and those teachings

563
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,400

588
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,440
be looking into

589
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,200
seeing if we can get a transcript

590
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,480
available so patricia also said that uh

591
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,720
this was an amazing talk oh thank you

592
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,760
patricia

593
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,279
i'm glad you loved it uh michelle has a

594
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:11,840
question

595
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,480
she says uh when we take the buddha vows

596
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,080
do we need to be in the presence of

597
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,840
someone appointed to be a witness

598
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,400
yeah it's called warm hand to warm hand

599
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,480
in our tradition the way we

600
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,600
practice those celebrations really and

601
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,600
so usually you have a preceptor

602
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,240
someone who has received transmission or

603
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,640
dharma transmission we call it meaning

604
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,880
they have permission from their teacher

605
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,080
to offer precepts

606
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,720
so that's really the only thing you're

607
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,520
granted

608
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,840
by receiving dharma transmission is this

609
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,559
authority

610
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,919
to give others the precepts so that's

611
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,480
um a wonderful relationship that you

612
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,559
have very intimate with someone you talk

613
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,120
to

614
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,600
as a mentor as a teacher and then at

615
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,039
some point when you finish

616
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,240
sowing your robes we sew we sew our own

617
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,760
robes i'm wearing one of them right now

618
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,000
it's

619
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,880
called a rock suit it's a miniature of

620
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,080
the larger robes that

621
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,679
i think you've all seen that the monks

622
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,000
wear i have one of those too

623
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,039
um we wear during meditation so we sew

624
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:13,760
our robes

625
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,600
it's one of the traditions that we

626
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,919
continue to practice at the zen center

627
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,000
uh it takes a while which is good and

628
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,919
with each stitch

629
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:27,840
you say i take refuge in buddha

630
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,960
thousands of stitches it's it's

631
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,799
fantastic practice it's very

632
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,559
if you like to meditate it's a great way

633
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:35,919
to meditate with this

634
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,360
cloth and thread and usually sitting

635
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,400
with other friends

636
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,120
in silence so once you've finished your

637
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,440
robes then we schedule a ceremony and

638
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,279
often there's more than one person

639
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,840
usually there's quite a few

640
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,120
and um it's a very beautiful ceremony

641
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,159
families come

642
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,240
friends come the community comes and

643
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,279
then we have a

644
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,480
a party after cookies and tea that's our

645
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,760
that's our favorite party so yes it's

646
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,640
it's quite a

647
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,679
uh it's quite an intimate part of

648
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,640
our community life is receiving the

649
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,120
precepts

650
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,760
so thank you for that question do you

651
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,640
want to take one more

652
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,080
foo or sure okay uh chris asks can you

653
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,520
give your interpretation of

654
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,440
be an island unto yourself

655
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,279
yeah well you know what comes to mind i

656
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,039
mean thank you for that question

657
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,559
right away what comes to mind is a

658
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,240
familiar teaching for me

659
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,279
is like when the buddha said

660
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,279
i and all beings together enlightened at

661
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,400
the same time

662
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,120
so the island unto yourself would be

663
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,840
yourself

664
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,880
as the entirety of existence that you're

665
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,600
this is a representative of all of it

666
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,279
right all of us are representatives of

667
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,320
the whole thing

668
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,360
we are the universe in this form

669
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,840
so an island unto itself is kind of like

670
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,960
the universe

671
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,360
it's a pretty big island and then all of

672
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,320
us are

673
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,159
you know kind of uh

674
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,640
we're all i i came up with this image

675
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,720
the other day of

676
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,120
after meditation you walk outside and it

677
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,640
feels like this womb of light

678
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,159
you've just walked into the womb of

679
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,400
light and i think as as

680
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,320
little babies we're born you know from

681
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,240
our mother's belly the dark

682
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,279
into this womb of light you know this uh

683
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,480
being alive in this world of light and

684
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,760
color and amazement sound so you know

685
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,360
we're kind of roommates that's what we

686
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,120
all are we're roommates

687
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,559
and that's for me is the island it's the

688
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:37,440
great island

689
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,480
jambudvipa it's called in sanskrit

690
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,799
the center of the universe where we live

691
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,960
so that's that's the island

692
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,720
okay well thank you everyone for coming
