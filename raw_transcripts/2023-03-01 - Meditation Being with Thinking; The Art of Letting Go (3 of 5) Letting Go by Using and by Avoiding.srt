1
00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:07,700
okay so we'll begin with our sitting

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,080
allowing yourself to find a comfortable posture

3
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:21,320
settle in for our time of practice together

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,840
and if you're comfortable please close your eyes and allow the attention to come inward

5
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:43,680
and just taking a moment to kind of survey the body the mind the heart

6
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,360
how are you right now

7
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,340
with the awareness that we are looking at how things are

8
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:12,140
perhaps with a sense of appreciation for the opportunity to practice

9
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,560
to good use of time

10
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:29,640
and just softening the body softening the muscles of the face and the eyes and the

11
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,360
eye sockets

12
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,600
allowing the shoulders to release and sink down

13
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,100
softening the any holding in the belly

14
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,719
knee bracing in the legs or arms

15
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:10,819
and then sensing into the straightness of the spine

16
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,200
sometimes it's even useful to pass the attention through the spine from the

17
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:27,319
bottom to the top just relaxing and aligning each vertebra

18
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,819
and then bringing mindfulness into the mind

19
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:50,660
just the simple awareness of the present moment

20
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:06,980
and allowing the attention to settle onto the sensations of the breath

21
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:15,920
to us the simple in and out Movement Like a rhythm

22
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:24,680
and putting the attention there as a a resting place for the mind

23
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:30,200
allowing it to gather its Energies

24
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:44,940
there's nothing magic about the breath but we can use it use this natural

25
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:50,640
phenomenon as a support for

26
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:57,299
mindfulness so maybe just noticing whether the

27
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:01,700
breath is generally long or short

28
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:14,760
and it might be that the in-breath is long and the out breath short or vice

29
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:20,660
versa they don't have to be the same

30
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:46,020
and if we just watch the natural breath there will be a tendency for it to get

31
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,160
softer and shorter

32
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,860
there's no control of the breath in our practice

33
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:25,320
foreign the attention still maintaining some awareness of the

34
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,139
breath but broadening the attention to the whole body

35
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:37,280
perhaps sensing the breath in the body or as an aspect of the body

36
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:10,500
using the natural recurrence of having a body

37
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,900
as a way to support the mind

38
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:22,940
and it's okay if the body is somewhat uncomfortable or

39
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:32,280
otherwise not up to our ideal

40
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:38,220
it is as it is and we accept that and just

41
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:44,100
intend to release any tension that might be in the body

42
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:51,000
especially tension that's due to the mind due to the way we are

43
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:58,620
relating to the body just softening that letting the body be as useful as it can

44
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,780
while breathing in and out

45
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:02,960
and if we find that thoughts are coming in that's quite normal

46
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:11,900
but we can just gently reopen to the body and the breath

47
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:21,360
as if we're releasing the thought like releasing a balloon whose string we have

48
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,900
accidentally been holding just let it float away

49
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:52,820
just gently tranquilizing the sense of the body

50
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,040
and now opening to the possibility

51
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:21,480
of some kind of joy in the mind perhaps arising simply because the body

52
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:27,019
is more at ease than it was before

53
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:34,560
this wouldn't be Joy like leaping in the air and

54
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:40,740
celebrating what a simple inner Joy

55
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:46,339
that comes from ease and bodily tranquility

56
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:53,820
it may be very mild or it may be stronger but we can open

57
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,260
to that possibility

58
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:36,200
if we allow that to infuse the body perhaps spreading it with the breath

59
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:43,200
we also feel a kind of softer feeling behind it more like

60
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,000
happiness or contentment

61
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,220
again it could be subtle

62
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:11,519
and even if the mind is fairly active and still

63
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:18,600
not wanting to stay in the present moment there can be a contentment that we're practicing with that

64
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,880
we're here doing this meditation in a sense

65
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:29,579
contentment is always available to be content with

66
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:37,640
being here for this letting yourself feel that

67
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:08,880
if you would like to just continue with the breath and the ease and the body

68
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,519
and a sense of inner happiness and mind

69
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:19,459
that's fine to just rest with that

70
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:27,899
and it's also possible to use the the breath and the

71
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:36,139
sense of Happiness as a support to open to the process of thinking

72
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:43,820
to actually use and allow the presence of thinking as part of meditation

73
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:51,180
okay but we would stay in the present moment not do the thinking

74
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:58,220
but watch the thinking watch it like an activity

75
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:07,620
like a parent watch as a child playing just the playing of the line with its

76
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,040
thoughts

77
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:24,019
or maybe there aren't any thoughts that's fine also

78
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,040
foreign completely

79
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:37,980
sometimes that doesn't happen until we allow the activity of the thought and

80
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:44,240
then just let it settle out the way we settled out the body earlier

81
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,720
so trying that and remembering that you have the support of the breath in the

82
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:01,699
present moment and the support of the inner happiness from meditation

83
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:12,199
allowing mental activity without becoming active

84
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:58,940
foreign

85
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,820
foreign

86
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,500
foreign

87
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,658
thank you

88
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:33,559
gently allowing mental activity to just settle out

89
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:42,799
breath the body the inner happiness of meditation

90
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:52,520
there can start to be a feeling of wholeness fullness in the mind and body system

91
00:24:53,460 --> 00:25:01,039
we need to become gathered around just the present moment experience

92
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:18,919
nothing is disavowed but there is no distraction either

93
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,659
foreign

94
00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:03,900
as we approach the end of this meditation okay perhaps just reflecting a on

95
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:12,779
the experience of opening slowly to the path and the body

96
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:18,419
the support of our inner life and then allowing

97
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:25,260
the mind to be as it is there a way that this is also valuable

98
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:32,159
in our daily life the balance of having an inner

99
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:39,500
anchor or orientation or reference point that we stay with

100
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:45,419
and you know allowing things to come and go as they do

101
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:49,759
allowing the line to be as it is

102
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:57,600
can there be both a clear sense of inner orientation and a

103
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:03,500
complete openness to how things unfold

104
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:12,000
and wouldn't this be a support or not only for ourselves living peacefully

105
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,820
among the ways of the world but also a support for others in that we

106
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:25,500
would be available to them open responsive flexible without losing their

107
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:33,019
own balance and hence providing the support for them they're not balanced

108
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:44,700
we don't always have the capacity for all of that but we can understand the

109
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:52,639
potential of cultivating the mind so if it's

110
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:58,760
grounded and also open and flexible

111
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,940
it's a real gift

112
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,950

113

[Music]

114
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:56,000
this week we've been looking at seven ways of letting go

115
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,260
often maybe in our practice we would pose a question like

116
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:06,960
how do I let go of impatience something like that and

117
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,360
in such a case then these different methods are useful actions to start

118
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:19,200
practicing with and we let go by doing a certain practice without expectation maybe

119
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:25,679
without impatience and then the Letting Go can come about we don't really do the

120
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:30,840
letting go but there's there are things we have to do in order for it to come about

121
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:37,740
and sometimes it's enough just to see you know just to notice if our mind is

122
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:46,380
headed into duka or not and sometimes what we see is that we

123
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:51,720
need to actively restrain something we're going too far or we're getting

124
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:56,820
compulsive in some way and then over time we'll feel less and less compulsion

125
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:02,100
around that if we make the effort to restrain a little bit it it just becomes

126
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:10,020
weaker and then someday it lets go so that's what we talked about so far

127
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:15,140
and then today we have a pair we have

128
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:20,940
Letting Go by using and letting go by avoiding

129
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:26,760
so those might sound like they contrast quite significantly they're even

130
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:33,360
opposites and that's part of the art you know this week this series is called

131
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:40,080
The Art of Letting Go and part of the artists knowing which

132
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:45,779
thing is going to be the best so let's talk through each of these

133
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:54,419
so what does it mean to let go by using so in the texts this refers mostly to

134
00:32:54,419 --> 00:33:00,899
the requisites so those are the things that we need like food clothing shelter

135
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:07,799
and Medicine this late people we may also need some kind of Transportation some kind of

136
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:13,140
communication these basics of life and these are the aspects of life that are

137
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:20,039
not going away you know and so here we see clearly that Letting Go does not

138
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:27,480
mean getting rid of Letting Go does not mean getting rid of we're not going to stop eating but we do

139
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,940
need to develop for example a relationship with food that doesn't

140
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:40,919
include craving and clinging that doesn't include Duca so the Buddha recommends that we

141
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:47,519
explicitly practice with the aspects of life that we can avoid using

142
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:53,580
so as you might imagine a lot of the energy in this one goes around food the

143
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:59,880
the requisite that we often have the most attachment to and there are a lot of practices we can

144
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:06,779
do to work with our relationship to meeting and it's it's not always just

145
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:13,500
that you know we're doing too much or we need to you know restrain like the

146
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:19,740
previous one there can be all kinds of subtle things tied in with our relationship to who we may have some

147
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:25,919
aversion to having certain kinds of food or that we should be having more of who

148
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:32,280
knows so don't go in with expectations but here are some sort of popular ones

149
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:38,339
um there is a practice uh of doing what's called the eight precepts for Lay

150
00:34:38,339 --> 00:34:45,839
people and one of them is to not eat after the midday meal so we

151
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:51,898
would just have two meals that day and in Asia at least often the people will

152
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:57,180
do this on the full moon day and half moon day and sometimes even the quarter

153
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:03,119
moon so kind of once a week but at least once a month they would have a day or

154
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:09,420
they just have the morning meal and then something in midday and then wait until the next Dawn

155
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:16,200
and there's a a way of letting go of of our you know busyness with food when we

156
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:22,260
do that just to see what that's like we may feel hunger of course and we can

157
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:28,680
learn that that's okay you know we can be with that for a few hours and when we

158
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:33,720
can do that with relative mental ease which might take a little practice

159
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:39,780
then we find over time that we're less controlled by our appetite and we're

160
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:46,020
less LED around and you know our appetite is not as compulsive for us

161
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:52,079
so that's one possibility is to kind of play around with whether or not we're

162
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:58,859
being controlled by her belly and then there's also deliberately

163
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:06,420
eating foods that we think that we like or that we think that we dislike and you

164
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:13,500
know that we all have foods like that where you know there's one where we just think oh yeah I love that one and then

165
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:20,880
there's the other ones like I haven't liked that one for 25 years maybe my whole life you know

166
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,880
um and it's not a matter of having an allergy or anything it's just you know we don't care for it and so it can be

167
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,160
interesting to deliberately eat um each of those foods and really watch

168
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:38,460
instead of just going with the like or the dislike the kind of major feeling tone that comes with it actually watch

169
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:44,880
what's going on in the mind like notice where does that feeling arise from how

170
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:51,540
long does it last you know if I take a bite of something I don't like is it just instantly and uniformly unpleasant

171
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:56,640
for the entire time and it you know or is there like variations in that when

172
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:02,520
does it come on can I redirect my attention such that it's not really as

173
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:08,339
problematic and again this is about developing a healthy relationship with

174
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:14,640
different kinds of food such that we're not as controlled and led around by the

175
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:21,000
Duke and you know and craving that arise with it it's an interesting exercise it

176
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,460
won't hurt you really um it's also interesting to get just in

177
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:33,060
general very intimate with the process of eating so you know normally eating is

178
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:39,780
completely focused on loading the fork getting it into the mouth and and you uh

179
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:45,180
you get that first hit of what it tastes like and you chew on it for a while and

180
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:51,180
then as soon as that gets a little bit less interesting you know because the taste does fade we're busy loading the

181
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:58,200
fork again before we've even swallowed and it's interesting to watch that process like how is the Mind choosing

182
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:04,020
where to put the attention you know when the when the flavor Fades out very

183
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:10,440
quickly the line gets bored and moves on to something else and um you know we can notice that the

184
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:16,200
texture changes it's not as good once it gets all mushy it's kind of not as

185
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:22,200
appealing and so then we're back to loading Fork if we get very intimate with that process then we start to see

186
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:28,020
it just doesn't process it's necessary process we have to feed the spine but um

187
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:35,940
you know can we change our relationship to the different aspects of it such that it's not so there's not so much pushing

188
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:43,200
and pulling in little instances of the mind grabbing on and pushing away because that's Duca actually at a subtle

189
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:50,760
level so try it out there are also things we can do around clothing another area because clothing

190
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:56,099
is related to our image and that's an area where we have a lot

191
00:38:56,099 --> 00:39:01,260
of attachment so we see that these requisites tie in to aspects of mine

192
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:07,440
where we have a lot of cleaning and craving and identification so it can be interesting to deliberately

193
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:14,940
wear unusual clothes there's a class I teach about renunciation and on the day that I talk

194
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:21,780
about being aware of our identity I often wear a dress to teach that class and this is

195
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:27,119
unusual clothing for me I do own a couple but they're not my

196
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:34,740
regular wardrobe and so it's kind of fun for me to put that on and see how it feels and see people's responses or

197
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:40,320
non-responses try it out I remember one time

198
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:46,200
suggesting that someone who dresses rather fashionably as part of their

199
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:51,660
practice to go out to wearing old mismatched clothes and just see how it

200
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:59,280
was to save up the grocery store wearing something that they felt very uncomfortable in yeah yeah I don't know

201
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:07,380
if they did it or not but um can be fun so in general we would you know they're

202
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:14,940
also kind of wise Reflections that monastics do around using things we can do that too just being aware of why and

203
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:21,960
how we're using the requisites of Life are they just supports for us to be practicing or are we bringing in extra

204
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:27,960
craving and cleaning and we can also use various non-material

205
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:34,380
aspects of life we would have recommended using conceit to overcome conceit for example which is something

206
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:40,920
like skillful imitation you know we we compare ourselves that's what conceit is

207
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:47,339
it's a comparison it's either better or even worse or even equal and so we but

208
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:52,740
if you want to use this quality of Mind in your practice instead of just saying okay I'm going to try to not do anything

209
00:40:52,740 --> 00:41:00,000
see that's very difficult so instead We compare ourselves to someone that we admire compare yourself

210
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:07,200
to someone who's more skilled in humility or unselfishness or generosity and then aim to become more like that so

211
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:14,760
we can use the self to overcome attachment to self in a sense so there's a lot of good ways to use the

212
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:21,420
parts of life that we're not going to be able to change immediately at least and then there's also

213
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:27,420
um avoiding you know the opposite so this comes with a quote in the in one

214
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:33,540
of the texts that says what taints should be abandoned by avoiding here a

215
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:40,079
practitioner wisely reflecting a voids this is ancient India a wild elephant a

216
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:46,980
wild horse a wild bull a wild dog a snake a stump a bramble patch a Chasm a

217
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:52,200
cesspit a sewer so these are things that are actual physical dangers and that's

218
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:59,640
sort of Common Sense we can avoid getting ourselves into dangerous or unhealthy situations that might get us

219
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:06,660
agitated um but it also goes on to say that we should avoid associating with bad

220
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:13,440
friends or behaving in ways that might harm our good standing in our community because others might think ill of us

221
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:19,740
then in a sense and maybe you think that doesn't sound very Dharma dharmic you know thinking about how we appear

222
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:25,560
socially um but it does matter in that if we don't think about it we can end up being

223
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:30,599
kind of enslaved to our relational life goodness knows people really go

224
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:37,140
overboard on social media uh into avoiding looking bad and trying to look

225
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:43,920
good and there's a lot of duka around that so we we can be a little bit more wise about that and understand okay I

226
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:49,260
don't need to impress everybody on Facebook but it would be nice to

227
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:55,980
um associate with good friends and be in good standing in a community that I care about for the simple reason that we're

228
00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:03,180
nourished by that and we Thrive when we're at ease with people who share our interests and values

229
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:10,200
so someone about avoiding goes kind of deeply into things that are dangerous

230
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:16,560
for us physically dangerous relationally dangerous and it can even allow us to care for

231
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:23,640
others if we do that carefully but if we look we see that we don't always avoid what we could we run into

232
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:29,520
things that we could have avoided and sometimes we avoid for a while and

233
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:34,920
then we can use so remember that our pair for today is using and avoiding

234
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:40,260
until we have enough capacity of attention we might need to stay away

235
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:47,040
from things or limit them and then when we're stronger we can go into them and learn to be free with them and even

236
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:55,440
learn from them so [Music] um I remember a friend of mine went on a

237
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:01,140
long meditation at IMs and for a while for the beginning part of the retreat

238
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:06,780
she would come right at the end of the meal and you know get her food right at

239
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:13,020
the end so she didn't have to see anybody in line and then she would take it to her room to eat um which you're allowed to do there

240
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:18,420
don't do that at IRC but after a while she you know first she

241
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:23,640
was just avoiding she was just avoiding contact and she found that supportive but at some point she didn't find it

242
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:29,760
supportive anymore and she felt like it would be more supportive to go and be with the group and see the reactivity

243
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:35,099
that came up in her mind and so she started being able to use the conditions

244
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:42,119
of the retreat in order to further her practice so it can change I also have heard a story from ajan

245
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:49,440
Amaro who said that he used to be very upset um he's a Thai Forest monk at a

246
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:56,339
monastery here or I guess now he's in England but this was when he was here is that he used to get very upset if people

247
00:44:56,339 --> 00:45:01,560
misinterpreted him at meetings at his Monastery and so you know he would find

248
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:07,380
that somebody misrepresented what he had said or had misunderstood it and interpreted it wrong and he would get

249
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:13,020
angry about that and he'll go to great effort to be sure that everybody understood his views and he'd have to

250
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:18,960
talk with everybody to make sure that they really got it and then he realized that he was just making a huge self out

251
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:26,099
of being seen perfectly in everyone's eyes so he stopped trying he let people State his ideas incorrectly he let

252
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:32,760
people take credit for things he had suggested he felt what it was like to be seen as stupid or harsh when others

253
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:40,260
interpreted his words that way and he said it was a great lesson in emptiness but he did that from a position within

254
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:46,440
his Monastery of having a good social standing and from an internal space of having enough mindfulness and attention

255
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:53,880
that he didn't get triggered by having these insults to his identity so um

256
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:59,760
there are basically no taints vexation or fever if you don't feel attached to yourself

257
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,920
so using and avoiding um there's a role for discernment in

258
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:10,140
discovering when to do each one of those they're different and what is the

259
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:16,020
Criterion the one that we talked about on Monday are wholesome States increasing and unwholesome States

260
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:21,240
decreasing or are on wholesome States increasing in wholesome States decreasing

261
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:28,200
so check it out maybe we're starting to get a sense now of the heart that's involved in letting

262
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:36,619
go so that's it for today and we'll continue on thanks
