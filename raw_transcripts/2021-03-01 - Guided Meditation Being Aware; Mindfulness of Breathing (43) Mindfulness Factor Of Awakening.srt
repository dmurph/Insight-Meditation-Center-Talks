1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:10,160
so good morning and welcome to

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,720
the first meditation session of the retreat that some of you are doing and for those

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,320
of you on youtube good morning and good day and

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,840
welcome to this monday morning meditation

5
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:44,559
and for this morning's meditation i would

6
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:50,160
like to emphasize the word awareness

7
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:59,199
sometimes i like to think of the word awareness as a synonym or for mindfulness or

8
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:06,080
and i'll talk more about that but what's interesting about awareness

9
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:14,159
is we talk about being aware we don't talk about doing aware

10
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:22,400
someone doesn't say i'm a wearing they say i am aware

11
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:32,320
and i associate being aware or awareness

12
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:40,400
to something like hearing versus listening hearing

13
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:47,280
is something that we can just hear those of us who have the ability to hear we can hear

14
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,320
something without intending to hear it the sound arises in the ear maybe a loud

15
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,759
sound nearby and we hear it if we're curious about it

16
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:07,360
then we turn our attention to it and we listen to it and listening

17
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:16,319
being the active and the intentional quality of what we do with our capacity to hear

18
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:24,879
and um i am so so i am aware

19
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:32,480
is equivalent to the hearing we can be aware without intending to be

20
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,800
aware we can be aware without directing the

21
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:45,440
attention with our interest in our intentionality

22
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,040
and when we practice mindfulness we're bridging the world bridging these

23
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,319
two aspects the non-intentional and the intentional the directed

24
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:05,920
and the non-directed the doing and then not doing and the word

25
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:12,800
awareness gives a little bit more emphasis on the

26
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,959
on just allowing awareness to operate

27
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:25,360
so rather than doing awareness we

28
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,640
are being aware

29
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:38,239
and as such awareness is closer to

30
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:44,319
a state of mind than it is to an activity of mind

31
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:49,920
a particular mental action

32
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:01,360
as important as mental actions can be

33
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:09,599
are just a subset of what awareness can be aware of

34
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,640
and so with this anapanasati mindfulness of breathing

35
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,759
as it develops as we settle in

36
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:27,199
we're getting closer to the state of awareness than we are to

37
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:35,759
moments of knowing moments of what sometimes is called mindfulness

38
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,840
so taking a meditation posture

39
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,160
and finding a posture

40
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:57,840
adjusting your body to a posture that is suitable for you

41
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,800
to be aware in a calm and relaxed way

42
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:13,680
for this purpose it's helpful if the posture is relatively comfortable

43
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:25,840
relatively relaxed

44
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,520
and then it's helpful to

45
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:49,759
settle into your body and one of the ways of doing that

46
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:56,320
is to take a few long slow deep breaths at the beginning of the sitting

47
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:09,039
and the deep inhales are maybe three quarters full three-quarters of a full in-breath

48
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:17,120
nothing that would tire you out or strain you but something that would allow you

49
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:24,319
to feel your body more fully breathing in and that

50
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,680
full breath not only feels your body

51
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,840
but little bit energizes it in a good way

52
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:56,400
and then taking letting your breath return to normal

53
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,840
and feeling

54
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:11,199
your body letting your awareness your attention

55
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:18,160
roam around your body maybe in its own way

56
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,199
to the places where there are some tensions or holdings

57
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:34,400
and as you exhale relax soften the places of holding

58
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,440
perhaps it's a little bit in the muscles of the

59
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,840
belly softening the belly

60
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:59,840
maybe there's some softening around the front of the chest

61
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:13,840
softening in the shoulders

62
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:41,839
and softening in the face

63
00:08:52,640 --> 00:09:00,959
perhaps also there's a some possibility on the exhale to relax the thinking mind

64
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,720
maybe around where the brain is

65
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:22,720
or are there places in the body where thinking has its tentacles and as you

66
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,480
exhale to quiet the thinking mind

67
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,959
allow the thinking mind maybe to think slower

68
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,200
there's no hurry here in meditation

69
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,519
there's no requirement to think of anything else besides the meditation

70
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:02,839
and if you're thinking about what the meditation maybe you can do so quietly

71
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:09,040
calmly slowly

72
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:16,320
in ways that are clearly supportive of the meditation

73
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:25,839
so maybe the thinking is kind thoughts about now turning the attention to the

74
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:37,920
breathing thoughts about experiencing

75
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:47,839
being present for how the body experiences breathing

76
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:31,200
simple thoughts of receiving the inhale

77
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:44,480
thoughts are being present for the inhale just as it begins

78
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:55,519
and letting there be a receptive quality where the the body's ability to be aware

79
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:11,839
to sense and to feel receives the inhale

80
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:18,880
maybe receives it as an upwelling feeling of energy of movement

81
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:25,839
of sensations

82
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:39,839
and then as you exhale to release with the exhale

83
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:49,440
there is a letting go in the exhale allow yourself to exhale

84
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,839
allowing the release

85
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:34,720
inhaling and receiving the inhale

86
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:49,279
in awareness

87
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,959
allowing the exhale

88
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:02,720
to release within awareness

89
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,399
so not so much focusing on the breathing

90
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:17,839
but more allowing breathing to focus itself in the middle of awareness

91
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,440
as if breathing

92
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:31,760
is received it's like the waves received by the beach

93
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:39,199
in which the beach then releases or allows to wash back

94
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,839
roll back back into the ocean

95
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:59,839
across the beach of awareness comes the waves of in inhaling and exhaling

96
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:43,279
and regardless now of what you're thinking about what you're thinking about is less

97
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:48,480
important than noticing the

98
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,399
it as activity of the mind

99
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,759
whatever the activity the actions the energy

100
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:10,800
energetics of the mind are see if you can let that relax

101
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:24,880
as the activities of the mind relax into a calmness of the mind

102
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,639
set a place of subtleness

103
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:37,839
a calm body a calm mind

104
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:26,558
and then we are always aware we're we're always conscious

105
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,640
there's always some degree of awareness going on

106
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:46,080
see if you can allow for a state of being aware or state of awareness

107
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,760
is more naturally there

108
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,799
it doesn't require a doing

109
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,840
but more an allowing to be aware

110
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:43,840
allowing awareness is close to being in a receptive state

111
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:57,840
receiving experiences as they occur in the present

112
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,160
and with breathing at the center of it

113
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,320
all a receptive awareness that

114
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,160
also receives breathing

115
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,559
receives the experience of inhaling and

116
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,840
exhaling

117
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,559
breathing is a rhythm

118
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,000
that reminds us

119
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,480
to be receptive in the awareness

120
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:29,919
not to fixate on anything or get caught in thought

121
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,960
the rhythm of breathing received an awareness

122
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:46,840
in a sense a rhythm that keeps awareness open and

123
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,840
receptive

124
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:03,840
so we stay closer to a place of quiet receptivity

125
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:15,200
a state not dominated by thinking a state more characterized

126
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,679
by receptive awareness of what is

127
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,120
a state of awareness

128
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:35,280
that we repeatedly allow for

129
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,960
repeatedly return to resting

130
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,840
in receptive awareness

131
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:39,760
there is a way of being aware where awareness not doing

132
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:49,039
but more being more a state that we're in a state of awareness

133
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:59,279
and within that state we can register be aware of many

134
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:06,640
different things that occur but those things can occur

135
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:14,960
without intentionality from us without desire without

136
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,240
making something happen

137
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:31,200
and to relax allow for that form of the state of awareness

138
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:35,200
allow yourself to be aware

139
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:41,518
in that allowing allow the experience of breathing

140
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:53,840
to remind you to stay receptive

141
00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:07,840
to be allowing of what is

142
00:40:53,200 --> 00:41:02,480
if we can recognize awareness as a state state of awareness

143
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:09,520
like a state of mind or state of being

144
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,599
that allows us to

145
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:26,880
be content in that state or to be to rest in that state

146
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:35,839
to allow ourselves to be receptive in that state of awareness

147
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:43,680
perhaps a state of awareness where we're not actively involved with what we know

148
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:49,359
we're not for things or against things

149
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:54,559
we're not trying to fix things or get away from anything

150
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:04,880
that there's a willingness to just be aware of whatever is happening

151
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,318
a state of awareness

152
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,838
that's receptive and open

153
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:03,359
and with a state of awareness resting in it content in it

154
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:13,520
you might bring to mind or include in that awareness now

155
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:18,560
some of the people that will be part of your life today

156
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:27,838
the community of people on the retreat or those are not on the retreat

157
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:34,000
in whatever communities you might be in today

158
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:42,480
whether personally or on some form of communication technology

159
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:54,480
and for a few moments to allow for a sensitivity of awareness

160
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,520
of those people

161
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:08,880
that's only possible if we rest in awareness allow them to exist in

162
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:14,640
awareness while we rest in the awareness

163
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,960
or remain receptive in that awareness

164
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:28,400
where we can be we can be aware of people without doing anything or

165
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:37,839
needing to respond act just aware

166
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:56,240
and that being staying close to this way of being receptively aware of others

167
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,839
just being aware of them

168
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:10,480
not paying attention to them but being aware simple awareness

169
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:18,400
that perhaps there in that awareness you can now tap into your good will

170
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:33,520
for others or your wish for their welfare your well-wishing of others

171
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:43,359
and to let that well-wishing radiate from you glow from you

172
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:51,280
flow from you may all beings

173
00:45:51,280 --> 00:46:01,838
be happy may all beings be safe

174
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:09,280
may all beings be peaceful

175
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:29,839
may all beings everywhere be free

176
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:45,200
so good morning and welcome to the beginning of the week and a new theme

177
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:50,960
for these morning teachings and the theme is the seven factors of

178
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:56,960
awakening and it's following

179
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:03,200
the practice and the teaching of experiencing the mind

180
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:08,960
experiencing the mind state the mind state or the mind being

181
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:15,200
a broader experience of our inner interiority our inner life than noticing

182
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:23,119
the particular activities of mind that are operating for example thinking or particular emotions going on

183
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:28,640
and the state of mind is kind of like the mood or the atmosphere or the

184
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:38,640
general state of way we are our b state of being almost

185
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:47,039
and and so as we become experience a state of mind more fully

186
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:54,000
we start becoming aware that there are different states of mind that we can experience or

187
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,520
different qualities different characteristics features

188
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:07,200
of the state of mind and these seven factors of awakening can be seen as both as particular

189
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:12,880
practices we do and also as a state's

190
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:20,559
qualities or characteristics of the state of mind or the state of awareness that as that

191
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:26,079
state of awareness state of mind becomes more highlighted and becomes more noticed and something

192
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:33,520
we can rest in and feel then we can start noticing

193
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:42,558
these qualities of awareness these qualities of our state of mind state of awareness and

194
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:49,920
the um so there are seven of them and the first is usually in english

195
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:55,680
translated as mindfulness the second in english usually is investigation

196
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:04,240
then effort joy tranquility samadhi

197
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:10,480
usually translated as concentration and equanimity and these are considered the crown

198
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:16,960
jewels of buddhism they are sometimes actually likened apparently in ancient india

199
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:25,359
a a monarch had seven jewels that kind of were the represented the monarchy

200
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:35,280
and uh and may and so in buddhism those seven jewels are the seven factors of awakening

201
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:41,520
uh kind of a curious metaphor that's found in the ancient texts is that

202
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:49,440
the um it's like this a monarch that uh has seven special sets of

203
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:57,119
clothes suits to wear at different occasions and and so in the same way that

204
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:03,920
a monarch has a special maybe affluent sets of clothes to wear

205
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:11,359
so buddhist practitioners as they develop in practice have these seven factors of awakening

206
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:17,040
as their suit it's a kind of strange metaphor but i think that

207
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:22,480
maybe what's suggested by it is a suit is something you wear for a while instead of clothes

208
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:29,359
you wear it for a while and so these different factors of awakening at different times different ones of

209
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:34,559
them represent the state of mind we are in and we kind of wear that state for a

210
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:39,839
while so there can be a time when mindfulness involves a great sense

211
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:45,680
of clear awareness and the clear sense of awareness stands out and

212
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:50,720
that's the state of that's the primary characteristics of our state of mind

213
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:57,839
other times it might be that there's a great sense of tranquility or a great

214
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:03,839
sense of joy or great sense of unification or samadhi or a great state

215
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:09,040
of equanimity that uh stands out of the sec

216
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:15,839
seven-factor awakening each one can stand out and be the primary characteristic

217
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:21,359
or it's possible to be aware of all seven um kind of imbalance kind of all kind of

218
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:26,400
working together in a certain way and we can recognize them together and and

219
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:34,800
or maybe see how we need to bring them into balance and um many years ago when i sat a long

220
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:40,319
retreat at some point in the practice these seven factors awakening stood out in

221
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:45,839
highlight and which they can and when the mind is really settled in a peace

222
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:51,839
then these become some of the primary characteristics of what we notice in mindfulness because

223
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:58,800
everything else is kind of abated and gotten quiet and still and peaceful and these seven factors are what remains

224
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:05,599
and i found myself that i was kind of balanced i was actually instructed to balance them bring them into balance and at some

225
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:10,960
point the teacher said i've noticed that when you talk about bringing these

226
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:17,119
seven factors of awakening into balance you never talk about equanimity it seems like

227
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:22,559
you're always tinkering with them and uh and then i realized yes i was

228
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:28,400
always kind of thinking i had to fix them and get them just right and i had no equanimity around whatever

229
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:35,280
state i was in and that helped me kind of to settle back and become more economists

230
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:42,720
so the first of these seven factors of awakening is sati is the is the ancient pali word for

231
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:48,960
it sati and translated a number of different ways and

232
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:55,440
mindfulness is the most common in english and but the way that

233
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:00,800
mindfulness practices come to the west there are many things that are called

234
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:09,359
mindfulness all of them may be appropriately so but sometimes what mindfulness is is referred to as a

235
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:15,760
clear recognition of what's happening so it's a cognitive act act of recognizing hearing if you're

236
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:20,960
hearing my voice right now or or recognizing there's pressure on your

237
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:26,880
butt if you're sitting on a chair or that the recognition oh

238
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:31,920
my hand is cold but my torso is warm and so there's the clear recognition of

239
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:38,319
things and sometimes that's represented by using mental notes where that

240
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:45,760
recognition is a little bit more highlighted and and and focused with the mental noting

241
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:52,720
sometimes what's called mindfulness is um is feeling experiencing sensing

242
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:59,520
experiences and some teachers really emphasize not uh these languages of feeling feel your

243
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:04,799
your breathing sense your breathing experience what's going on and and so

244
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:10,880
it's set more sensory and so we're kind of resting in the sensory capacity of the body to be

245
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:16,720
to be mindful to be aware and sometimes what's uh emphasizes the

246
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:20,160
power of observation

247
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:29,599
just simply observe what's happening and but don't interfere with it and all

248
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:35,040
those three uh recognition feeling and observing

249
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:40,240
are emphasized by the buddha as practices that we can do

250
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:46,640
but it's but it's not necessarily what he calls sati or mindfulness he calls these other

251
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:52,640
words for those activities and and but what those other activities

252
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:59,119
are they're part of mindfulness practice because they're the practices

253
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:05,359
that lead to sati lead to a state of awareness and what we're

254
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:12,799
looking for is we practice these things clearly recognizing what's happening focusing on the breathing feeling the

255
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:18,960
experience more fully the experience as it's happening is what

256
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:24,880
we're moving towards is a state of awareness and

257
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:30,240
the sometimes it's been translated when it becomes a state big body sometimes uh use the

258
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:35,680
translation of lucid awareness and uh there's a sense of lucidity a

259
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:43,200
clarity an openness a luminosity it's all these metaphors that

260
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:50,880
people try to use to describe the state of mindfulness

261
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:58,280
and it's not easy to be there it's not easy to rest in that state or be with it and that's why in the process of

262
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:03,680
anapanasati deepening practice that with time we get a sense of

263
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:10,079
of this the state of mind we can also then become aware there's a state of awareness that's

264
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:16,160
almost coterminous with the state of mind it's almost almost the same thing or occurs within

265
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:22,640
the same domain and so sati mindfulness as a state

266
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:30,079
that we allow for and so i think that the word english word awareness is my preferred way of then translating

267
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:39,440
sati and we can and we are aware as we say i am aware and um

268
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:46,640
and uh so to kind of paraphrase descartes i i am aware therefore i am

269
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:52,839
and um and that and the word i am uh almost applies kind of almost an

270
00:57:52,839 --> 00:57:58,319
identity like this is this this kind of defines me so this

271
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:06,160
i am aware kind of suggests this broad kind of way of being or just existing in a certain way

272
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:11,839
existing in awareness not easy to rest in or be with

273
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:18,799
but it is possible and one of the ways to get to that is to begin

274
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:26,880
living at the speed of mindfulness and this is a particularly

275
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:34,839
valuable to do while on a retreat where you know nothing really has to be done there's no hurry to do anything

276
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:42,079
hopefully and and where there's more time to take it easy and just kind of do things maybe at a slower pace than

277
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:49,760
usual and so to practice at the speed of mindfulness means to uh or say it differently to

278
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:57,280
practice at the speed of awareness and what i mean by that is to

279
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:08,559
do things whatever you're going to do do them at the speed that keeps you close closely aware

280
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:15,359
of being aware that that you're cognizant of yourself being aware as you

281
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:20,799
do it uh in whatever way awareness is for you in a particular time through

282
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:25,920
the recognition of what you're doing as you're doing it by sensing and feeling it as you do it

283
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:34,400
or simply observing it quietly from the kind of in the back of the mind or something that um

284
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:41,280
you um you sense it and feel it so so um the um

285
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:47,839
um so you so you the speed of mindfulness speed of awareness is to stay close you know you're doing

286
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:55,119
it you know you're part of it you're allowing something to register in the present moment around the experience as opposed to

287
00:59:55,119 --> 01:00:00,240
doing things so quickly that you're ahead of yourself you're into the next thing you're more thinking

288
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:05,440
about the next thing and then just really beating for each thing you do

289
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:12,319
and so it doesn't necessarily mean you have to do things slowly i i was a fast order cook after i came

290
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:19,119
back from three years in a zen monastery and i learned to be very aware

291
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:26,079
spinning around and doing many things at once in the kitchen working fast in some ways i found it

292
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:31,920
easier to be aware there because i would just let go of all my distractions just be in

293
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:38,240
the dance of the kitchen so it doesn't necessarily have to be fast a slow

294
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:45,520
but generally especially on retreat generally for most people that's the kind of beginning the access point for

295
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:51,200
that to happen so the mindfulness

296
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:59,040
the first factor of awakening and sometimes seen as a particular activity of mind practice we do and sometimes as

297
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:06,960
a state of mind and hopefully the activity of doing it the practice leads to this lucidity of awareness this

298
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:13,040
state of mind a state of being mindful state of being aware and that you'll feel the goodness

299
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:18,960
of that and the freedom of it and the benefits of doing that

300
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:25,520
so thank you and and we'll continue

301
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:34,319
these morning talks with the factors awakening tomorrow
