1
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,000
so good day

2
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,880
and it's a happy occasion to be here with you all and

3
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:34,160
had the opportunity to meditate together and for me to teach it's a privilege and

4
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:45,840
i appreciate the opportunity thank you and

5
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:59,120
we have this wondrous wonderful mind chitta ci tta

6
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:07,280
that begins to stand out and highlight the calmer the mind becomes

7
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:15,920
so when the mind is agitated it means it's caught up in its concerns its uh preoccupations

8
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:24,159
its agitation its um and uh often then it's the more agitated

9
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:31,360
the mind is the more it's swirling around in its thoughts ideas

10
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,960
feelings and it's the subset it's a particular aspects of the mind

11
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,399
that the mind is focusing on thinking for example or emotions

12
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:48,240
ideas memories and what we're doing is we switch to being mindful of the

13
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:56,960
mind is to no longer have the preferential attention to

14
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,320
particular corners of the mind particular activities of the mind

15
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,759
and so as the activities of the mind get quieter and calmer

16
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:13,440
what's available then in highlight and over time as meditation deepens it

17
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,440
becomes stronger and stronger is there's becomes a felt sense

18
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,599
of the mind as a whole and exactly what that is is not so you know

19
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:31,120
so important what's important is your own way of experiencing it

20
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:38,160
some people might prefer to use the word awareness to represent the mind as a whole the

21
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:45,920
the total gestalt of how things are operating the

22
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:53,280
the uh the sum total is greater than the sum of the

23
00:02:53,280 --> 00:03:01,120
parts so there's something that marvelous that happens as we open up more widely and fully to the mind

24
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,400
and in this early tradition there are sometimes sometimes his mind stands out so much

25
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,560
and highlight that it's anthropomorphiza anthropomorphized sometimes seen as a

26
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:19,599
person as if a person can talk to their mind or work with the mind train the mind

27
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:27,360
it's never seen as the self and this movement of selfing of positive

28
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,840
feelings sensing itself and this early tradition is seen as just another form of mental activity

29
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:41,120
that can also be calmed down put to rest and as it does so that also frees up the

30
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,400
space for feeling the mind as a whole

31
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:53,680
or sometimes it's called the state of the mind or the mood inner mood the general mood of in our

32
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,599
mentality or the heart mind and it begins to shift

33
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:06,159
the orientation of how we live our life and rather than focusing on the

34
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:12,239
particular concerns we have it gives us the opportunity to care for

35
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:19,359
and i love this word care compassionately care for lovingly care for the quality

36
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:25,199
of the mind or the quality of the heart the quality of this inner life that we have that's

37
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:31,759
what's the gestalt the totality of it that here in the tradition is called chitta mind

38
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:38,880
and we can begin settling the mind opening the mind

39
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,320
pleasing the mind bringing joy happiness to the mind

40
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:51,280
and liberating the mind and it's such a phenomenally satisfying thing to switch

41
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,199
from the details and concerns of our life to the present moment experience of mind

42
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:03,840
and caring for that so with that as an introduction

43
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,520
i will take a assume a meditation posture

44
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:16,880
and gently close your eyes and

45
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,720
with the eyes closed and feeling your body from the inside out taking a few

46
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,719
long slow deep breaths

47
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:38,000
deep deep breaths really as if you haven't breathed for a while and finally you get to really fill yourself

48
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,160
with oxygen and then exhale a delightful long

49
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,400
exhale ah here you are

50
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:59,680
here you are breathing in and breathing out

51
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:12,720
and then letting your breathing return to normal for a few minutes few moments and just

52
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,960
sit here and feel your body maybe those deep breaths have had a

53
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,440
influence effect on your body

54
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:30,800
maybe it bodies a little bit more has more sensations to feel

55
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,840
maybe you want to adjust your posture a little bit more

56
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:53,680
and then we'll do a little breathing exercise

57
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:02,080
that maybe will help the deeper relaxation maybe at relaxation deep inside

58
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,680
the heart the mind the cheetah

59
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:15,520
so it involves taking a deeper breath but only about three

60
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:21,280
quarters full but only as far as is comfortable

61
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:28,960
and then when you get to the top of that that particular in-breath hold the in-breath a little bit don't

62
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:35,759
exhale right away and hold it for as long as it's comfortable

63
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:44,080
and then as you release it as you begin the exhale see if that occasion can be

64
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:50,319
one of a deep relaxation letting go it's almost like the holding of the

65
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:56,720
breath heightens the awareness of your body your insides

66
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,840
that there's more available to relax as you exhale

67
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:10,160
so taking a three-quarters comfortable deep in-breath holding it as long as

68
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:19,680
it's comfortable and then exhaling with a deep relaxation

69
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:41,839
and it might be that the exhales can be a little longer than usual

70
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,600
maybe as you exhale you also relax the mind itself

71
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:59,120
softening opening expanding the mind

72
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,199
and even if you can't relax the mind

73
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:23,839
as you exhale feel whatever softness that's in the mind

74
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:33,040
feel whatever transparent boundaries there is to the

75
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,839
mind

76
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:48,480
and if it's comfortable continue a little bit longer and now at the end of the exhale

77
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:56,080
pause a bit just as long as it's comfortable before you inhale

78
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,560
so there's a rhythm of inhaling pausing exhaling

79
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,839
pausing that brings a heightened awareness to

80
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:19,839
your body and mind and a greater ability to relax

81
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:33,839
settle in

82
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:46,079
and then let your breathing now return to normal no special effort to pause or hold and

83
00:10:46,079 --> 00:11:01,839
take a few moments to feel and sense your body again

84
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:19,760
and if there are some memory areas of your body you can easily relax

85
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,519
so softening around the face

86
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,560
releasing the shoulders

87
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:43,839
softening the belly

88
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:57,839
and if the relaxing you've done settling in you've done brings any sensations of pleasure

89
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:07,279
for well-being breathe with a pleasure breathe with a

90
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:13,440
sense of well-being the tingling the warmth

91
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,519
the glow the

92
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:39,360
dancing energy

93
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,879
and allow the thinking mind to become quieter

94
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:52,800
letting go of thoughts so you can have more energy more attention

95
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:58,320
to feel the body breathing

96
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:06,639
breathing with the well-being that might be here

97
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:21,839
however small it might be

98
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:37,680
and you might become aware of how the mind attention is predisposed

99
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:44,000
to focus on particular things concerns preoccupations

100
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:53,279
and if so then you're experiencing a limited aspect of your whole

101
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,959
wondrous mind

102
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:08,639
without necessarily letting go of your concerns can you expand your awareness

103
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,959
to include more of your interior life more of your quality of

104
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:22,160
inner life your mind your heart this state of your mind state of your

105
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,800
inner being

106
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:36,560
something that inclusive because everything that happens happens

107
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:45,839
within the mind

108
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:59,839
and then breathe with the mind breathe through it

109
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,920
almost as if each inhale fills the mind with the sensations of

110
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:21,519
inhale each exhale relaxes and expands the mind

111
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:27,839
settles it

112
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:58,320
becoming aware of the global mind the global sense of any

113
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,519
state of mind mood of the mind

114
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:13,840
the quality of the mind overall

115
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,760
maybe it could include the space of the

116
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:30,640
mind the space that the mind fills

117
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:40,680
so you're not focusing on any particular part of the mind

118
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,099
[Music]

119
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,760
a state which has no

120
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,840
boundaries

121
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:10,320
and if it has a location this mind of yours

122
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:18,720
chances are that there's a little feeling of contraction or gathering together

123
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,840
that gives that feeling

124
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,159
as you exhale relax that gathering together

125
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:37,840
soften let the mind rest

126
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,640
out into the vast space all around

127
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,559
mind with no walls no boundaries

128
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,640
mind that involves no conscious effort

129
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:05,840
that is just there here

130
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:15,039
if there is suffering suffering has a location

131
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:27,279
the mind includes all that is beyond the edges of

132
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:33,919
that suffering that's wider bigger

133
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,720
and to relax outward beyond the suffering

134
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:54,000
so that whatever suffering there is is held in this wide field

135
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:02,880
of open mind open awareness that has no

136
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,840
edges

137
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:18,640
breathing in outward breathing

138
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:24,720
that goes outwards towards the edges beyond the edges

139
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:37,919
all inclusive wide broad open

140
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:49,840
resting into the open space

141
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:17,360
and as we come to the end of the sitting

142
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:23,679
with whatever way that you can rest in open space

143
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:30,159
without the mind getting quickly fixated or preoccupied on any particular

144
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:36,640
thing just open and receptive allowing things just to

145
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,679
flow through you nothing stops

146
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,840
nothing is held on to

147
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:54,399
and staying that way the best you can bring to mind

148
00:28:54,399 --> 00:29:00,240
some person that you might encounter today

149
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:12,080
personally or through some medium of communication phone or computer

150
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:18,080
imagine that you are quietly

151
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:25,120
allowing that person to exist as they are without you fixating on it

152
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:31,679
and anything as if they too can be held

153
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:40,720
in the vast open mind

154
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,919
in that way providing them to get providing them with a gift

155
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:52,159
that they can be just the way they are without any interference from you with

156
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:58,559
your desires aversions agendas reactions

157
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:10,960
allowing someone to be themselves in the vast open space of your mind

158
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:25,279
and in doing so imagining that you're doing so does that give you a different

159
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:32,399
reference point for good will for love

160
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:41,600
friendliness care even respect for this other person

161
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:54,640
and if it does now may be wish them well

162
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,880
may this person be happy

163
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,120
may this person be safe

164
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:18,799
may this person be peaceful at ease

165
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:33,440
may this person be free certainly free of my attachments

166
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:40,159
and may it be that other people that you encounter and other people that you have some

167
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:47,200
contact with or think about today that they also benefit

168
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,760
from this meditation practice you've done today

169
00:31:52,320 --> 00:32:01,840
may all beings be happy may all beings be at ease

170
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:09,518
may all beings be free

171
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:29,840
and may we contribute to that

172
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,840
so

173
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,840
uh

174
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:29,679
so so the topic uh much of this week is

175
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:36,000
step nine of mindfulness of breathing and uh this is the step where we're

176
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,080
experiencing the mind and i hope that the way i'm presenting

177
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:48,559
the mind is something that's not not trying to define it in ways that you have to fit your

178
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:55,840
yourself into the definition but rather that it's um i think it's uh pointing to how you

179
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:02,720
experience the mind the mental state mind state heart state

180
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:09,679
that there's a lot of room here for you to find your own way to this and um but one of

181
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:17,839
the ways to appreciate it is that um we're moving into the the

182
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:24,960
the the the sum total of how we experience

183
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,800
the mind the pasta practice often has a big emphasis on particularity

184
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:36,720
really seeing the particularity of the in-breath the out-breath of sensations that they occur

185
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:42,560
my you know the particular particular activities of the mind as they come in to go

186
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:50,000
and and and uh but there's also some way that uh

187
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,158
part of the particular is also the the harmonious working of all this together

188
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:03,599
or the kind of the awareness or the knowing that knows it all and um and exactly whether mind and

189
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:09,839
awareness are the same knowing is the same or not you know it's very hard to kind of pin down these

190
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:18,720
things to know exactly what the mind is or consciousness or all these kinds of things that are belong to this rather

191
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:27,920
i don't know if amorphous is the right word but difficult to define

192
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:35,760
qualities or experiences of our interiority of inner life and

193
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:42,240
and you'll see now in a moment maybe why it's difficult to kind of put words on it and to find it exactly

194
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:48,320
is that um the concepts that we live with the ideas

195
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:54,560
that we have about our experience actually shapes our experience

196
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:59,839
we are not innocent bystanders of our experience that whatever happens to us whatever

197
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:07,359
experience we're having that it's only happening to us we're also contributing to some degree

198
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:12,400
to that experience that certainly there are clear things that happen

199
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:21,359
to us so to choose something relatively innocent perhaps if i go out

200
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:27,599
well i'll give you the example i've taught many times and i was thinking about it today when i was biking down here it was

201
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:33,760
cold biking down here this morning is um kind of a revelation from you many

202
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,040
many years ago was living in central california and going to college at a

203
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:44,720
college called davis and um and it was um that is a fog early

204
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:50,800
morning fog thule fog and in the winter time the cold fog was really cold

205
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:56,720
and and i didn't have any gloves and i would bike to school and the first five ten minutes of being

206
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:02,640
in class i couldn't actually use my pen because my hand was still frozen and so you know so

207
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:08,640
it was so cold so i used to for a while i was biking to school this

208
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:14,720
way and kind of feeling miserable sorry for myself and it was so terrible

209
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:20,839
this cold that i felt and and then at one point i kind of had a

210
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:28,720
memory that exactly the same feeling of cold that i was having biking to school was

211
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:37,760
as far best of my memory exactly the same feeling of cold i had in my fingers as a kid when i used to go skiing and

212
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:45,440
and that skiing it was exhilarating it was fun it was fantastic it was part of the richness of the whole experience and i

213
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:51,599
realized that that how i was experiencing the same sensation

214
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:58,000
vary depending on the interpretation i had it the context i put on it the ideas i had about it

215
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,160
and after that biking didn't become so difficult anymore i realized that i was adding something

216
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:09,760
to the experience of cold i was adding self-pity and this is going to be tough and hard and i don't know

217
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:15,280
what i was adding exactly and then it became just a matter of fact and simple to have the cold

218
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,880
it was still cold and a little bit painful but i didn't complicate it so much with all the

219
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:27,760
ideas that were kind of subconscious almost i didn't really realize how much i was doing i thought it was just the cold the cold

220
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:33,599
was the cold was painful was bad but we contribute to the experience we

221
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:41,359
have interpretations meaning making predictions of what it means we have self-referential feelings about

222
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:46,599
it this means that i you know if maybe have self-pity about things that are difficult or

223
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:53,440
self-congratulations for things that are good and these inner movements of the mind may be very subtle we don't necessarily

224
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:59,760
see them but they are kind of helping to shape our experience

225
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:06,720
and give kind of the totality the gestalt of it as we practice mindfulness we can start

226
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:13,440
teasing apart the different component elements that are all glommed together

227
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:19,680
we can see that self-pity is self-pity it's different than the cold we can see that the the way that we're

228
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:25,839
worried about the future that comes pulls into the my experience of cold for example

229
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:32,000
is just my thoughts about the future and we begin kind of teasing apart all this the component elements

230
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,040
and and as we do that we begin actually freeing the mind

231
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:44,240
we begin rather than glomming on or focusing on it then we begin to free it because not

232
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:52,480
only is our experience you know like for example me of the cold partly shaped by my relationship to it

233
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:59,119
but it's also shaping how i might experience the mind the mind gets contracted it

234
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:05,119
gets tight they get small the mind gets hot agitated

235
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:11,440
and you can the inner mood the state of mind that we have shifts and changes also depending on

236
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:19,119
what we're focusing on and how we're focusing on it in relationship to things so we're also in a sense shaping how we

237
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:27,119
experience the mind or how the mind can be felt whether that's the mind itself who knows what the mind is

238
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:34,640
but how we experience the mind is what we're really working with in this practice here and so the mind is

239
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:40,560
also being shaped and and the language of the early tradition

240
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:47,200
is that the concepts we are focusing on fixating on um creates

241
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:54,240
limits creates a boundary to the mind an edge to the mind but as we stop focusing so much on the

242
00:40:54,240 --> 00:41:00,000
things and our preoccupations and all this activities of the mind the activities of the mind get quieter and

243
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,720
quieter the shape the the way which we kind of shape the feeling of the mind the sense

244
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:12,720
of the mind begins to lose its edges its its coagulation its contraction

245
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,760
its its gathering together and it becomes more open

246
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:25,599
more spacious and after a while you can almost feel like there's no boundaries to the mind or no boundaries to awareness

247
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:31,200
or no boundary uh boundaries to the state that we're in

248
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:36,400
and to use a little bit dangerous word from what i said earlier

249
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:43,119
no boundaries to consciousness and and it isn't so much again important

250
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:49,760
what all these words point to with a wonderful thing is the experience

251
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:56,640
of no more edges no more boundaries and the mind starts feeling

252
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:03,680
large great expansive

253
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:10,880
and and this is one of the things that can be experienced as we deepen this meditation practice is the

254
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:18,000
mind becomes expansive becomes wide and then they called it a big mind

255
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,200
and uh as opposed to the small mind and the expansive mind rather than the

256
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:29,760
contracted mind the and the the more expensive it gets

257
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:37,520
the calmer it becomes the less agitated it is in the similar that space empty space

258
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:44,079
you know kind of has no agitation and they say that um

259
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:50,000
it's um you know that mind becomes similar to space

260
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:57,119
so less and less agitation and calm it also helps make the mind more malleable and shapeable

261
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:03,599
because when we're really fixated on something the mind becomes hard maybe even brittle and kind of

262
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:09,040
fixated also and if you do the same habit of mind over and over and over again for decades

263
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:15,440
the mind gets kind of locked into being a particular way it's hard to soften it but with meditation enough

264
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,640
time it begins to soften and relax and it becomes malleable and shapeable

265
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:26,720
and one of the ways the mind can be then more what happens when the mind becomes more

266
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:32,560
shapeable or malleable or soft and is it's easier and easier to

267
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:37,920
train the mind it's easier and easier to get the mind focused and

268
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:44,079
centered settled and and that allows for some of the more

269
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:49,599
beautiful qualities of the mind to shine the mind that's fixated and bounded and

270
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:54,720
limited by its agitation and preoccupation doesn't really allow for the luminosity

271
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:00,720
of the mind to show itself the clarity of the mind the cl the mind

272
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:08,560
feel that feels clean the mind that feels bright

273
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:15,359
so this gestalt this wide sense of

274
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:21,359
the attitude of mind the state of mind the mood of mind the quality of awareness

275
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:28,720
that is so wide that it includes all things and it includes our suffering

276
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:35,760
not to deny it but to give it a very different context than if our relationship is

277
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:42,000
is like a locked on to our suffering and it's possible to suffer of different

278
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,280
kinds and and not lock on

279
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:53,599
and to feel that the suffering being held or existing in this much wider broader

280
00:44:53,599 --> 00:45:00,400
context has certain kind of ease or calm that also allows to have compassion for

281
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:06,640
suffering there's space for friendliness and care for it as a that's maybe more difficult when

282
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:11,839
we're locked into it so there's a lot of benefits to

283
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:19,280
discovering the this mindfulness of the mind

284
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:26,079
and for an anapanasati the mindfulness of breathing practice we train ourselves to breathe with the

285
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:33,040
mind breathing in one breathes with one experiences the mind breathing out one experiences the mind

286
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:39,359
and as always with andapanasati this rhythm of breathing in and breathing out is meant to keep us

287
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:45,280
from getting fixated on anything including fixated on the mind so they're

288
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:52,000
just a fluid and relaxed kind of with the breathing breathing in with the mind breathing out

289
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:58,880
with the mind um so how about taking care of one's

290
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:06,079
body by getting mittens or wool socks over hands these days i drive i bike down with mittens on my hands on

291
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:11,520
with gloves i just was not smart enough when i was a college student

292
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:18,720
for that even to occur to me i didn't have gloves and never never passed my mind so some of us

293
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:25,599
you know takes a while to become wise about how to take care of ourselves but in the meantime i got a very good

294
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:33,200
lesson from my story with uh with the um you know my cold hands

295
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:40,318
so thank you very much
