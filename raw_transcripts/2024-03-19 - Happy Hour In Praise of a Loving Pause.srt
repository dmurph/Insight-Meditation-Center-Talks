busyness from the distractedness from switching

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,840
pause

20
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:43,760
a kind pause a pause of

21
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,840
kindness

22
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,760
e

23
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,120
if thoughts are arising and passing it's

24
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:57,000
okay let them come and go let your body and heart rest with the

25
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,879
pause we don't have to follow after everything thought that comes up every

26
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,840
memory perhaps imagine that you're

27
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:20,959
sitting in the comfortable chair very comfortable chair

28
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,280
in the middle of say a cabin the middle of

29
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:32,039
Nature and all around this cabin and there are doors and [Music]

30
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:37,960
windows and little animals Birds show up say

31
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:45,280
Hi and then leave we don't have to get up and follow

32
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:51,240
every little creature that shows up the doors and

33
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:58,639
windows but we can have kindness for ourselves and for everything that's

34
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:05,160
arising in this simile the doors and windows

35
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:11,280
are sense doors the five sense

36
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:18,759
doors or Sensations sounds

37
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,319
smells Etc arise and the sixth one the Mind

38
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:30,919
door in Buddhism is where thoughts arise

39
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:36,240
with the replaying of all the other senses sounds music we can replay it in

40
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,400
our minds so all these doors these sense

41
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:49,960
doors these creatures come they greet they want to take our attention

42
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:01,639
away and we can rest with kindness rest with

43
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:07,120
kindness there can be many distractions in the

44
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,960
world many distractions we don't have to follow

45
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,000
every every thread every little animal that shows up every

46
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,280
chipmunk it's just a [Music] chipmunk it's just a

47
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,560
chipmunk no need to pay attention

48
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:39,520
Let It Come Let It Go not important not worth your

49
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,280
energy not worth your

50
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:56,939
attention making a pause making a kind [Music]

51
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,400
pause one breath at a

52
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
time

53
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
e

54
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
e

55
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
e

56
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:16,240
and taking a pause taking this pause one breath at a time out of

57
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:23,760
kindness for [Music] ourselves out of

58
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:31,360
kindness for the world

59
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320

60
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320

e

62
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,279
see how this taking a

63
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:34,680
pause can be an expression of kindness for yourself and also for others and the

64
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:42,040
world so that you can become more available to

65
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:51,360
respond to respond wisely compassionately to the needs of the world needs of others and

66
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,920
yourself through taking a pause from it

67
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
all

68
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
e

69
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
e

70
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
e

71
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
e

72
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

73
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:43,160
see what happens in your mind in your heart if

74
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:50,000
you just pause if you just stop can pick it all

75
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,639
up in a few minutes and pick it all up what what if

76
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,440
you just pause press the pause

77
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:08,680

78
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:14,759
heart and just say to yourself dear one dear

79
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:20,839
heart we will hit play in just a few minutes right now I'm going to hit

80
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:30,000
pause friendly pause loving pause a loving pause and Praise of a

81
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,560
loving

82
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:45,519
pause the nourishing pause just a key presence with the

83
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:53,880
breath as the conductor of the pause as the conductor conducts an

84
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:59,560
orchestra and hear the breath

85
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:06,240
in breath out breath it's holding a baton conducting

86
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:13,600
the paths for the orchestra

87
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
Within

88
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

89
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

90
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

91
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

92
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

93
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:11,240
and if you find that mind is still busy in thoughts and

94
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:19,880
emotions it's okay no reason to to judge yourself it's okay thinking

95
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:27,720
is what Minds do be kind be

96
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:35,159
gentle and see if it's possible to put it down

97
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:41,919
gently promising you'll pick it all up in just a few

98
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:48,039
minutes and ask the thoughts the memories the emotions if it's okay to

99
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:55,880
just take a pause for five minutes you'll be back befriend them befriend them all

100
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:00,640
don't have to make enemies out of thoughts or emotions

101
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:12,480
they probably say yes it's okay you can take five minutes off to take a

102
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:27,120
pause and then take a pause and loving pause in breath out

103
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
breath

104
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

105
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

106
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:03,799
you can tell your thoughts let's take a pause let's take a

107
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
pause

108
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

109
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

110
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

111
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

112
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

113
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:27,320
and as we come to the end of this meditation session

114
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:34,360
together however this pause

115
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:41,080
was appreciate that you took a pause as much as

116
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:48,440
possible a loving pause a wholesome pause to be more connected available for

117
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:54,520
wisdom compassion for yourself others and that you have planted seeds

118
00:25:54,520 --> 00:26:00,080

123
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,440
practice I enjoy taking a loving pause I hope you did

124
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:47,840
too a so I'll share a practice there was a

125
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:54,200
there was a time when there was this this planning mind coming up planning for something I need to do planning

126
00:26:54,200 --> 00:27:01,240
planning and I realize wait I'm taking a loving pause and and I shared i i as

127
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:06,840
actually said said in my inner voice to the thought oh let's take a pause and

128
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:12,880
the planning mind agreed okay we're going to take a pause we're going to plan about that thing later so so I hope

129
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:19,320
uh this was supportive for you as well and we have a few minutes now for or for

130
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:26,919
engaging together in small groups um to to share with one another

131
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:32,919
what works to for you what works what doesn't work to take a loving pause

132
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:40,399
taking a loving pause through the day do you do that what would support you to do that um maybe during this meditation

133
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:48,440
what was it like to take a loving pause uh was it challenging what worked what did you discover what can

134
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:54,200
you take forward so we'll be in small groups of size three and thank you Neil

135
00:27:54,200 --> 00:28:00,200
for posting information about the HH etiquette and um how to support

136
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:07,320
ourselves and each other in the small groups and um yeah groups small groups

137
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:14,200
of size three which is just such a privilege to be engaging with fellow practitioners speaking for your own

138
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:20,279
benefit not educating not impressing but really speaking for your own um

139
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:27,480
exploration as if you were making a journal entry out loud and the other two people are just holding witness they're

140
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:35,559
not asking questions they're not giving you advice it's it's we're just supporting each other to to explore um

141
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:43,519
what is what is a mindful loving pause what's can we do that throughout our day how um how can I bring more of this in

142
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:50,960
how can it be supportive to to to myself I know that anyway I can say more about it later H everybody is back welcome

143
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:56,480
back everyone and would love to hear from you what uh what did you discover

144
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:05,320
what was it like to discuss taking a uh loving pause and um yeah would love to

145
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:12,000
hear from you so you can uh if you want to raise your Zoom hand or also I will

146
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:20,200
change the chat settings here so you can chat um in Zoom your discoveries

147
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:28,679
Claudia I see our Zoom hand hi um so for me I I love the lab of

148
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:34,480
loving pause because one of the things that I've been working on as I shared

149
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:41,320
with my group is this um you know the gap between stimulus and response and I

150
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:46,440
have called it taking a pause but now I'm going to call it taking a loving

151
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:52,360
pause because it's not only just for me but it's also for the other person

152
00:29:52,360 --> 00:30:00,640
because if I take a loving pause it's like the third or fourth solution that pops in my head is probably the best

153
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:06,200
instead of the first one that seems to be like the one that I really want to do and I want really want to say but you

154
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:12,039
know what if I take a loving pause it's both loving for them and for myself so I

155
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:17,360
love that thank you NY oh beautiful thank you Claudia thank you so much for

feel like I'm like Terri I'm not like really good my Minds writing or reading and I'm wondering if this is normal I

165
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:20,360
still get a benefit out of it's bad as I think I am at this yes I still feel better afterwards is that normal yes AB

166
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:25,440
oh my God I am so glad you named it Sandy because it's it's you know we

167
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:32,639
judge what it we we judge our results in in short term like oh my mind is

168
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:40,080
cluttered or busy or is is not working or a bad meditator and and and yet this

169
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:46,519
this practice as you you just reported it has a different way of working

170
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:51,679
through our bodies brains Hearts this this shift I don't want to just say

171
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:58,159
brains even though you know in our zit guys there is so much of a focus on our brains but but that's limiting the impct

172
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:06,360
of this practice there's something that it just shifts in the way that we are we are taking a pause and that shifts so

173
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:11,440
absolutely this works in ways we cannot imagine we don't quite understand so

174
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:19,559
don't cut yourself short by saying oh you know you're not saying that but like oh um I'm distracted like yeah I I sat

175
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:26,559
that's why at the end of every meditation I try to say don't judge it don't don't judge that it was this or

176
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:32,039
that planting seeds they're going to to flower they're going to germinate in

177
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:38,960
their own time in the ways in and according to a natural law a lawfulness

178
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:45,880
that we don't quite get we we appreciate like yeah this thing is working and yet I feel like I'm just thinking I'm doing

179
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:52,559
thinking meditation and yet it's working somehow so that's exactly it Sandy yeah

180
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:58,799
more power to you like that's exactly how I feel I don't get it and it's I definitely benefit from it I don't

181
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:06,960
understand you don't we don't have to get understand it for it to work this is just great just just accept be kind be

182
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:14,639
non-judgmental and keep beginning again keep beginning again keep beginning again lovingly with your monkey mind

183
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:21,399
which we all have you're yeah thank you thanks thank you Sandy so

184
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:26,480
much get I see your hand

185
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:35,039
please to to both your points I had a very um to me strange experience um I

186
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:43,039
was yesterday I was unexpectedly verbally hurt like in front of others so

187
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:50,639
very uncomfortable situation and uh my normal response would be to um make sure

188
00:33:50,639 --> 00:33:56,240
like the typical loving kindness oh let's understand everybody else and I really feel comfortable and also

189
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:02,399
professionally it's something that I do and I had this I don't know where it came from Sandy to you at a point the

190
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:10,240
sudden awareness of no no no no this is not kind to myself here so I um found

191
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:16,158
ways to set boundaries and um showed up for myself and was very

192
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:22,158
aware that that's what I was doing which is the weirdest thing um it wasn't planned obviously couldn't have been

193
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:28,000
because was also unexpected and um while there was discomfort in this situation

194
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,480
um you know all those considerations what do others think what do I do the right thing because I did something sort

195
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:38,800
of character for myself in the in this particular situation no issues standing

196
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:46,440
up for others and professionally setting my boundaries but this was very personal so it was very very interesting how also

197
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:51,919
it helped me process um it felt like the space we're always talking about giving

198
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:56,960
things the space and it was almost the opposite of what I had interpreted to be

199
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:04,839
a loving pause it was a loving pause not with gentleness but a bit of force and

200
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:11,880
um it had a positive effect so when you asked for this uh today um it it allowed

201
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:18,839
me to reframe it in in in this loving kindness context which I thought was fascinating so so thank you for that

202
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:24,200
yeah thank you so much for sharing it and you know compassion can be gentle

203
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:29,960
compassion may show up as tender and gentle compassion can show up as fears

204
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:37,760
fears compassion and we've talked about it here uh and happy hour many times compassion can be fierce can be very

205
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:44,119
loving and and fierce so what I'm hearing you had to do was to to um have

206
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:51,960
that loving pause and realize ouch this hurts and sometimes actually um when I'm

207
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:57,839
so befuddled when something like that happens to me and I'm just befuddled like wow this just happened somebody

208
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:04,720
just hurt me or publicly I just say ouch it's it's like wow this this is painful

209
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:12,880
ouch as a way to to express so I'm I'm uh appreciating that yes loving paw can

210
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,680
can be uh Fierce love can be gentle tender there are many different ways it

211
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:26,200
can show up as long as there is wisdom yeah and one would hope a net a net

212
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:32,560
kindness effect not adding more hurt to the situation exactly exactly and and

213
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:39,960
and the reason why I I brought this word in ouch is ouch isn't you know it doesn't hurt others it's not a dagger

214
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:47,800
that you're weaponizing it's like ouch this hurt me and maybe the other person didn't quite realize so again this quote

215
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:54,800
unquote boundary setting so much more to say about boundaries but um this quote unquote it's really out of love like oh

216
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,240
I've been hurt and and you know I care enough for you that I want you to know

217
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:05,960
that this is not appropriate for you either for your karma and and for what you're producing in the world

218
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:14,440
so yeah thank you K and let's see I I see two more hands I

219
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,920
see Vicky

220
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:27,800
please hi Nikki thank you mine is is much more superficial but it it was

221
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:32,960
really right on the money for me that uh you said it was a chipmunk we don't have

222
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:39,040
to get distracted by every chipmunk and right before meditation I was quickly

223
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:45,000
writing this long email that in in the process of meditating I thought it could

224
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:52,720
be about one line and make a phone call so it was very much the wise mind too

225
00:37:52,720 --> 00:38:00,000
nice stop yeah thanks nice thanks Vicki thanks for that love that the Chipmunk

226
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:08,800
isn't that a great metaphor when we it really is like it's it's just a chipmunk just like little running hero get

227
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:18,318
going yeah that is great yeah thanks Vicki and Elsa I see your

228
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:28,520
hand i'm in Balden by a person in our small group who when she first spoke

229
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:35,839
said that what she was about to say was somewhat different than what others had

230
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:45,640
said and so I'm emboldened by her courage to say that and um for me um the

231
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:52,400
pleasure of the pause is a kindness to

232
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:58,640
onself is the beginning of being in the actual world world of

233
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:05,920
meditation outside of the personality issues outside of the body feelings

234
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:12,680
outside of anything but the breath I was just

235
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:22,599
um wow and then the next thought that I thought was and how to

236
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:28,319
have balance and Poise and not get knocked around by whatever you want to

237
00:39:28,319 --> 00:39:34,720
call it stuff baggage monkey whatever you know distractions noise in the room

238
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:40,520
the birds tweeting right yeah yeah great I appreciate it Elsa yeah this this

239
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:47,359
sense of thank you for sharing um this you know the the Paw being able to step

240
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:53,480
out of the narrative sometimes this personality and this and that yeah that's that's a beautiful way also to

241
00:39:53,480 --> 00:40:00,319
think of this loving Pa thanks a couple more uh uh Reflections before we close

242
00:40:00,319 --> 00:40:03,359
rain I see your

243
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,760
hand um yeah thank you um and I I want to say thank you for this weekend's

244
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:16,119
Saturday's Retreat I was there and um at that Retreat used the word

245
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:22,880
embodiment a lot and I found the irony tonight was we

246
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,720
were saying you know to take a pause but I have a problems with PTSD

247
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:35,560
and I space out a lot I think I'm pausing all the time I'm not being present and I what was really helpful

248
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:40,839
for me was to take this as a moment to being in the moment but more from an

249
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:48,880
embodiment of I always just checked my breath or touch myself just oh yeah I have you know get back in here so it was

250
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:54,720
we talked a little bit in my group about like the r word like relax doesn't work for people but it was kind of iron

251
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:01,240
ironically for me to stop pausing and spacing out but actually be in my body be present

252
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:07,119
that's so interesting yeah thanks rain I appreciate you sharing this the different connotation that the word has

253
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:14,440
for you and and yes on Saturday we talked so much about embodiment and about mindfulness and and body fullness

254
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:19,640
actually we talked about body fullness and and actually it's interesting um and

255
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:27,520
of course I appreciate that this word pause has um for you has the connotation of spacing out and and for me has a way

256
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:34,640
of has a connotation of embodiment and and let me share how I was trying to bring it into the guided meditation and

257
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,920
um when I was saying oh imagine you are resting in a comfortable chair like an

258
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:47,000
easy chair I think I almost said easy chair but like in a comfortable chair in the middle of this cabin where all these

259
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:53,560
doors right so there's a sense of embodiment you're not getting up to go and greed every chipmunk and every an

260
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:58,599
like oh yeah you're staying in your body you're staying in your body you're

261
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:04,079
staying in your body you're staying this com comfort of this home this chair this

262
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:12,400
this um uh comfortable um abiding where you are and not leaving so that's the

263
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:18,079
the image the metaphor I would like to share with you as a way of oh taking a pause from all the things that are

264
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:24,359
coming and going if that might help reframe it and if it doesn't help reframe it then don't use the word pause

265
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:30,800
it's fine yeah thank you thank you thanks Ray

266
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:38,000
