178
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:25,359
the other reflections mark please

179
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:36,880
this meditation tonight has been right on the subject that i've been

180
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:43,680
working with all day today this morning i read a line

181
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:50,079
a quote from eddie hillson who died at auschwitz in her twenties and she wrote

182
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:55,280
there about there she said most people here are much worse

183
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:02,960
off than they need be because they write off their longing for friends and family as so many losses in

184
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:10,079
their lives when they should count the fact that their heart is able to long so hard and

185
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:17,599
to love so much among their greatest blessings and the author of this book went on

186
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:24,960
to say a line that just rocked me and has been with me all day

187
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,400
she said our engagement and participation in the

188
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:38,799
world begin to shift from viewing this world as a field of consumption

189
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:45,440
get that field of consumption to experiencing this world as a field of

190
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:51,680
appreciation and that's exactly what eddie was talking about

191
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:58,640
instead of looking at the losses of her family and friends in auschwitz she

192
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:05,119
looked at the appreciation that she was able to love them

193
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,440
so much

194
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:18,559
that is profound thank you mark and thank you so much for sharing that

195
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,680
i'm so moved hearing those words and the beauty the wisdom

196
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:31,599
of both words consumption you know the wanting the consumption wanting needing the

197
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:37,599
the loved ones appreciation appreciating them appreciating that you have a heart oh

198
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:44,960

219
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:57,599
yes yes isn't that amazing isn't that amazing and beautiful now i i feel that

220
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:03,440
also practicing together there's a sense of beauty and grace and just landing

221
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:09,040
together that that i definitely sense and feel thank you for naming that

222
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:16,480
yeah um one more reflection inviting joy in felt like preparing my

223
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:23,760
home for guests oh that's lovely anticipating their arrival but not knowing or caring when it would be oh i

224
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,520
love that that is such a sweet reflection inviting joy

225
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:36,800
and felt like preparing my home for guests anticipating their arrival but not knowing or caring when it would be i

226
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:44,000
love that that is such a beautiful way to practice with this with this invitation did you notice how different

227
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:52,079
this was than going out and like thinking you know in some ways actually this this relates to what mark shared

228
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:57,440
earlier it's um it's not so much about going out and

229
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:04,079
thinking about what i'm grateful for or what i appreciate which which can be a beautiful practice in its own way but

230
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:10,240
but this is just the simplicity of just being here just opening the heart

231
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:17,520
and being content there's a sense of contentment that can arise with the joy of just this

232
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:26,000
moment just here just here so dear ones we are approaching the time

233
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:33,280
to invite us to actually now meet in small groups you have bowed to each other in your mind's eye and now you can

234
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:40,880
bow to each other in small groups which is so beautiful so if you can't stay please do meetings are

235
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:47,839
short you know six seven minutes and especially with our theme tonight i think it'll be lovely to continue this

236
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:54,160
practice in small groups and if for some reason you have to leave that's understandable

237
00:44:54,160 --> 00:45:00,560
no judgments but please don't leave because you're afraid of these lovely

238
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:07,760
groups of people but okay so here we go i'm going to create the breakout rooms

239

244
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:56,319

245
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:03,760
what did you notice what came up if anything you'd like to share for the benefit of the sangha

246
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:13,040
greg please uh thank you for the suggestion to uh

247
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:18,640
gently and lovingly reel your mind back in when it goes off on its little

248
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:25,119
thought excursions um i'm sort of in the habit of commanding

249
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:30,480
my mind to come back and having some degree of frustration about that but doing it in kind of a soft and loving

250
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,920
way it's a nicer internal dialogue so thank you for that

251
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:41,119
you are so welcome greg and um just to say that this um

252
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:48,480
actually this way of beginning again just beginning again

253
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:55,440
thank you thanks for your opinion and just beginning again and dropping whatever there was before without

254
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:01,119
animosity without beating yourself up this

255
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:07,520
is a crucial insight this is a crucial

256
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:13,760
insight this is when practice really starts to deepen because up until then we're throwing all

257
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:20,720
these perfectly good moments after these moments of being distracted which is fine but learning to be gentle with

258
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:26,880
ourselves learning to just arrive that's where the practice is

259
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:34,319
knowing that the mind will wander that is normal that is completely normal

260
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:41,359
but what you do the moment you realize the mind has wandered that's where it determines

261
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:46,800
practice versus self-flagellation that's mindfulness

262
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:53,760
mindfulness which has meta in it mindfulness always needs to have meta with it woven in it so that is a moment

263
00:47:53,760 --> 00:48:00,240
of mindfulness so so practice mindfulness which met which has meta in it already so when i say mindfulness i

264
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:05,680
already mean meta so practice mindfulness not self recombination so in

265
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:13,280
that moment especially that's really important so i'm so glad you

266
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:18,319
raised that and really came home for you and i hope it comes

267
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:24,240
from home for everyone to really see that the crucial moment

268
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:31,280
so so the time has come for us to bring our session

269
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:36,400
uh to a close of practicing together it's been so sweet

270
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:41,680
and um this is the uh i'll see you in the new

271
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:46,960

272
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:54,319

273
00:48:54,319 --> 00:49:00,000

274
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:06,160
let's dedicate the merit of our practice may all beings be well may all beings be

275
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:10,359
free including ourselves

276
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:20,200
