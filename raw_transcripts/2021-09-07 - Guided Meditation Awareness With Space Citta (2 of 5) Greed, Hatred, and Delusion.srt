1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,838
so hello everyone and

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,040
it's a special occasion whenever people

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:21,920
gather together to meditate and thank you for being part of this gathering and

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:31,160
and kind of a collective focus on meditation for these next 30 minutes

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,239
and

6
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,320
i would like to uh suggest that you imagine something for this next

7
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:52,480
meditation or perhaps if imagining isn't quite right for you that you assume

8
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:59,239
or perhaps if this is something you already know that you remember

9
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:06,000
and that is that your ability

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,159
to know things in a simple way to be aware

11
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,520
to be conscious of what's happening in its simplest possible ways before

12
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:26,600
interpretations and stories reactions just the simplest awareness

13
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,560
is able to be aware it has enough space is big enough

14
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,600
to be aware of things as

15
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,520
as part of being aware part of the field of consciousness

16
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:51,280
as opposed to the tendency for consciousness knowing awareness to be limited by what it knows

17
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,320
that we kind of lean into the thing that we're focusing on whether it's thoughts

18
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:03,040
ideas feelings things in the world that we see that some the consciousness gets

19
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:10,000
narrowed down contracted and almost as if it be lives inside of

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,840
whatever it's focusing on and it's limited by it is trapped by it caught by it

21
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:23,040
attached to it uh preoccupied with it and that um and so then awareness

22
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,480
becomes as small as what it knows

23
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,000
but in fact awareness it can be feel like much more spacious it has lots

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,519
of room or if you don't like the metaphor of space and size

25
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,800
then the awareness can always remain free of what is known

26
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,239
it doesn't have to lean into it it doesn't have to be defined by it we

27
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:56,720
don't have to be caught in what we know what we know can just be part of

28
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,720
consciousness part of what we know but it doesn't become everything

29
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,159
and that's closely related to the idea of identity because

30
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:14,239
part of what can create the sense of identity is when consciousness awareness knowing kind of

31
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:20,560
leans into holds on to narrows itself into a particular ideas

32
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,680
even if they're accurate ideas we inhabit those ideas

33
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,720
rather than ideas and thoughts and who are experiences and habits awareness

34
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:39,280
so the suggestion for this meditation is that whether it's

35
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,360
using a single word that kind of precedes every act of knowing

36
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:52,640
every act of being aware and that's the word with w-i-t-h

37
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,920
and uh and when you're saying this to yourself you're saying that

38
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:05,280
you're aware with the inhale you're aware with the exhale

39
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,680
you are aware with a thought you're aware with an emotion

40
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:18,238
you're aware with a desire you're aware with

41
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:25,120
some aversion or frustration you're aware with anxiety

42
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,320
and the word with is suggesting to the the mind the heart

43
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,919
that whatever you're aware of does not define you does not define consciousness or

44
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:42,080
awareness does not is not doesn't have to limit your freedom

45
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,720
and so the word with is meant to kind of open you up a bit or loosen you up or

46
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,000
it just it's just a part the word with implies well this is just part of the

47
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,360
big picture it's not it the mind doesn't have to make it the

48
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:06,560
thing that we're caught in for right now it's just part of awareness just part of this world

49
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,479
it's consciousness with these and see if the word just adding the word

50
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:18,880
with it doesn't uh if it creates maybe space in the mind

51
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:26,240
stillness in the mind openness in the mind spaciousness a little bit of freedom less

52
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,919
or it could be simply less locking into things getting glued to things

53
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:37,120
there's so much more here always than what awareness gets locked into

54
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:43,840
and by simply saying with maybe kind of opens the opens it up a little bit and unlocks

55
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:50,400
then the knowing and also keeps things very simple returning to a simplicity of knowing

56
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,479
just this just this without being defined by it leaning into it or even pulling away

57
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:02,800
from it which is also kind of over involvement in terms of awareness

58
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:09,199
in terms of getting collapsing into something so i hope what i say makes sense

59
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,479
so to start

60
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:25,120
giving some care to the posture for your meditation

61
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,960
finding a posture that works for you but also works for you to help you feel

62
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,840
a little more alert awake present

63
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:42,000
a posture that way you too comfortable and you kind of sink into

64
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,759
kind of too much relaxation it might be nice in the short term

65
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,039
but not in the long term

66
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,680
and relaxing your eyes relaxing your gaze

67
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,720
and perhaps closing your eyes

68
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:18,240
feeling the contact of your body and its weight against whatever surface it's resting against

69
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,639
and as you take a few long deep breaths maybe there's a subtle way in which the

70
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,000
pressure against that surface increases with the deeper breaths

71
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,080
and if it does imagine you're becoming rooted

72
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,758
to the present moment here and now

73
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,800
and letting your breathing return to normal

74
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:09,360
and spend a few moments here on the exhale relaxing

75
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:16,400
any place in your body where you feel tense tight muscles are

76
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,759
the muscles can relax and soften

77
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,440
and then becoming aware of your breathing

78
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:23,360
and for a few rounds of breath you might even say the word with

79
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:30,160
as shorthand for being aware with

80
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,839
the inhale being aware with the exhale

81
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,839
being aware

82
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,480
and being aware intimately

83
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:07,279
intimate awareness of breathing in and breathing out but it's not the full picture it's not

84
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:14,560
the totality of awareness awareness holds

85
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,120
doesn't lean into or limit itself with it

86
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:39,440
and similarly if there are thoughts that arise in the sitting or feelings emotions sounds

87
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,800
see if the word with can help you

88
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,000
have the experience of that the awareness is able to hold

89
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,320
contain whatever is happening because awareness is bigger or

90
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,880
more peaceful or less identified just awareness with

91
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:10,480
thoughts awareness with feeling one breath at a time

92
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,120
here now

93
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,559
whatever you're aware of recognize it that awareness

94
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:24,400
is aware with it so that your knowing doesn't become it

95
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:30,559
you don't become it it's just a piece of the bigger picture

96
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:39,840
whatever you're thinking or concerned with it's just one aspect of

97
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,960
life with it

98
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,520
and as we come to the end of the sitting

99
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,240
if you can appreciate your capacity to be aware

100
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:23,440
with things with experience

101
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:31,120
perhaps you can feel or know that knowing awareness being conscious

102
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:39,039
can hold things without being caught in them there's lots of room to know

103
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:46,000
without leaning into it or without reacting to things

104
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,480
without being defined by them in any way or

105
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:57,279
without implying anything about oneself it's just known

106
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:03,520
there's lots of space just to know and perhaps at the end of the

107
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,799
sitting you can imagine or allow

108
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:16,399
your awareness to become so large so open

109
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:21,760
that you can receive the suffering of the world

110
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:29,679
in whatever way whatever particular way that that comes to mind comes to heart

111
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:35,919
and to recognize that now you're aware with this suffering

112
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:42,480
you don't become the suffering you don't lean into it or be defined by

113
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:50,720
the suffering but maybe you can make your heart as wide as the world

114
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,720
and part of the wonderful benefit of

115
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:05,039
not clinging to anything not holding on to anything not resisting anything

116
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:12,559
is that we can become the witnesses we can become the eyes of the world witnesses to what's happening

117
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:20,080
so important to have people know the suffering of the world

118
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:30,000
aware with suffering with awareness as wide as the world

119
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,159
even bigger can hold it

120
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:40,720
and then from the heart maybe there can come the wish

121
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,760
to live for the welfare and happiness of this world

122
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:53,440
and that if all who suffer may their suffering end

123
00:29:53,679 --> 00:30:01,360
all who suffer may they be safe and peaceful

124
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:09,840
that all who suffer may they know that there is compassion and care

125
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,320
that they're not alone in their suffering

126
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:23,520
and may it be that they are all they suffer become happy

127
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,159
and free

128
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:35,158
and may we each of us in our own way contribute to that

129
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:46,159
[Music]

130
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,440
thank you

131
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:05,519
so this will be the second talk on the third foundation of mindfulness and the third foundation of

132
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:10,720
mindfulness is that of becoming aware of

133
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:18,000
the general state of our mind or state of our heart the mood or disposition

134
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,679
that's in some ways more enduring than particular sensations we have in

135
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:29,200
the body that come and go or particular thoughts that we have that come and go

136
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:36,000
or particular sensations that come and go feeling tones pleasant and unpleasant

137
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,159
that come and go and certainly mind states also can come and go but they tend to be more enduring

138
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:47,279
tends to be a disposition through which we sometimes see the world experience the

139
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:54,480
world interpret the world and um and there's this the disposition the

140
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:00,399
state the quality of the mind that through which we're aware is um

141
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:05,600
has a huge bearing on how we live our lives huge influence

142
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,720
and it's also something that's intimate and closer in than the

143
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,159
changing details of the moment that might be here fleetingly

144
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:22,640
and uh it's more kind of close in to who we are in a sense

145
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:29,760
and um and so the general instructions around this mindfulness of the cheetah mind

146
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:36,000
state is in regard to it simply to know it as it is

147
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,519
to know the mind state in regard to the mind state

148
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:47,519
and what this means is that we don't have to add stories and ideas interpretations

149
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:54,880
we don't connect it to a lot of things just know it in the simplicity how it is in the moment right now

150
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:01,440
and then it begins by knowing mind states dispositions that are

151
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,480
characterized by greed or the absence of it

152
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:13,200
with ill will or the absence of it and delusion and the absence of it

153
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:19,360
and um in august if you know a month ago or so a few weeks ago we did

154
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,960
three weeks on each of these greed hatred and delusion and in part that was in preparation for

155
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:31,120
this teaching on this third foundation of mindfulness so those of you who are there perhaps

156
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:37,039
you now you know you're more sensitized they're ready to be mindful of greed hatred and delusion and the absence of

157
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:44,399
it and and so the idea is to become aware of it but not as a fleeting moment of greed or

158
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:49,840
fleeting moment you know of a moment a few moments of it but how it can appear sometimes as a

159
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:56,559
disposition as a general state or mood that we're in um we're just kind of the mood is that

160
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:01,600
of desire the mood is that of ill will or aversion

161
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:07,120
the mood is that of just being confused bewildered deluded

162
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,960
and so it's a little more more um persistent and more more

163
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,079
like more like you know the mood the veil through which we see

164
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:24,079
the filters through which we see the world and but what's very interesting and the

165
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:31,280
buddha says when he gives instructions here he says something he uses the word with

166
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:37,040
in paulie it's not a word it's a prefix but he says that uses this with he says

167
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:42,398
when the mind state is with greed

168
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:50,240
know that it is with greed when the mind state is without greed know that is without greed and the

169
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:56,398
same for ill will and delusion and so this word with is there

170
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:03,200
and and now the idea is to be mindful to know that it's there and the

171
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:09,520
the marvelous thing about when we're really clearly practicing mindfulness to be

172
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:17,119
really mindful really know what's happening really conscious of what's happening part of the mind is not

173
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:22,400
caught in what is known part of the mind is not defined by what is known

174
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:30,400
now if we get distract if we get preoccupied by our thoughts our fantasies that go on in the mind our concerns

175
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:36,640
we can be so involved in it that it become kind of becomes who we are there's no outside of it everything's

176
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:43,599
seen through that lens everything is related to it that becomes the be-all and end-all occasionally

177
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:50,400
so sometimes when there's desire desire takes over and we become the desire and you know

178
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,880
get out of the way sometimes occasionally

179
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:04,560
the um uh occasionally when uh i can get famished

180
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:10,960
and uh i come home and my wife says you had look in your eyes and i'm kind of looking around the kitchen for

181
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:18,560
for food maybe i'm like hunting or something and and it becomes kind of like the my disposition is like wanting

182
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:25,599
and so some people are saying it's frozen with no sound

183
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,880
but other people are not so i'll just continue so um

184
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:38,160
the um so the buddha uses this idea of width

185
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:44,960
and as i did in this guided meditation uh it's possible to be aware to know

186
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:51,359
uh when what we know doesn't make up the whole experience of what's happening it's only part of it

187
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:56,560
and because of that it's like we become make room for it we can allow it to be there because

188
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:02,800
we're not defined by it and we're not collapsed into not leaning into it

189
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,800
the knowing is free of what is known the knowing has space to feel and

190
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:16,000
experience what is knowing and um and this idea i kind of very much like the idea of space for things

191
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,280
we have a capacity to hold things we have a capacity to allow and to know

192
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:28,160
and part of what we're doing in mindfulness practice is increasing that capacity to know things

193
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:35,280
not not knowing you know not knowledge of things but rather the capacity to be present

194
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:42,480
for our experience be conscious of it without reactivity without

195
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:49,200
becoming it without resisting it without being defined by it

196
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:55,440
without making entering into it and becoming it and so we have capacity so we can really

197
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:01,440
hold in a feel and practice really becomes different if we

198
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:08,160
have things like desires greeds hatreds delusions fears

199
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:13,440
and we've learned how to open up how to relax how to make space

200
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:19,359
to know it in and of itself in relationship to our desires

201
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:26,560
greeds we simply know it's greed without a story without justification

202
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:33,760
without putting a value on it even without kind of saying well i'm a bad person now because of i have it this is

203
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:40,800
wrong it's embarrassing i should i should i should feel shame or or getting involved in justification i'm

204
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:48,560
supposed to have desire this is important this is time my life that desire it's just just desire just greed just

205
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:53,839
lust whatever it might be anger hostility

206
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:59,680
irritation frustration all the different flavors of kind of hostility or ill will that might be

207
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,800
there it's just known in its simplicity

208
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:11,040
and this is not necessarily easy to do but this is the direction the practice is going

209
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:16,560
the third foundation of mindfulness is the third foundation one

210
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:22,320
very wonderful way of practicing these is to build towards this

211
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:28,240
so the the the teachings and the four foundations of mindfulness begins with mindfulness

212
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:34,640
of breathing with anapanasati the first tetrad breathing in breathing out

213
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:42,800
breathing experiencing the whole body breathing and relaxing the body it be

214
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:48,000
such a great place to begin and to get settled to get stable to

215
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,599
relax to and then it continues with mindfulness of the body continues with mindfulness of feeling

216
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:59,760
tones how we react and respond to pleasure and and the pain and learning how to be with

217
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,880
that in a simple way and not be so reactive and as we learn the skills and the

218
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:10,960
stability and the steadiness and the and the clarity of knowing

219
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:17,359
then at some point we can become aware of great hatred and delusion that the mind

220
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:24,640
is with it not the mind is it and as i've said i think the

221
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:30,480
um if there's clear mindfulness there's more to the mind there's more to

222
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:37,119
the mind state than greed hatred and delusion uh we've we've created space we've

223
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:42,240
created a healthy kind of sense of distance or independence

224
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,599
from whatever it is we know and so this is something you can experiment with

225
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:54,079
next time you have a really good bout of greed hatred and delusion

226
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:00,160
just stand still or sit down and and see

227
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:06,880
if you could come back into mindfulness of it where there's space for it and room for you to be this way you're not trying to

228
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:13,680
stop it necessarily but you're not participating in it mindfulness is not participating it

229
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:19,200
not reacting to it and just you know it oh here's greed with

230
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:25,440
here's a mind state with greed and here is mindfulness

231
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,480
that is independent from it is free of it and it might take some experimentation

232
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,720
to see what is it like to have a knowing have an awareness be conscious of something where that consciousness

233
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:43,119
is not caught by it reactive to it and the same thing for the absence of

234
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:48,640
greed hate and delusion and here it gets a little bit more interesting because

235
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:54,160
the absence of greed is not quite the same thing as the

236
00:41:54,160 --> 00:42:00,720
presence of greed if the absence of greed is generosity if the absence of

237
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,760
a hatred is love the absence of delusion is wisdom then yes

238
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:12,160
that can be without that can be a mind with generosity with

239
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:18,160
love with wisdom so and the same freedom can be there the same spaciousness the openness can be

240
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:23,280
discovered and however if the absence of greed is

241
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:29,359
simply the absence of greed if the absence of hatred is simply the absence of hatred

242
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:34,640
the absence delusion is simply the absence of delusion then um

243
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:40,480
then that absence kind of overlaps or

244
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,520
shades into or merges with the state of mind

245
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,640
the quality of awareness that's open and receptive and there

246
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:56,079
and and so to experience the goodness of the absence of great hate and delusion to

247
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:02,319
experience the spaciousness the freedom that's there kind of uh

248
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:09,040
allows us to kind of more and more develop or grow in this capacity

249
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:15,760
for the mind to hold experience including the ability to hold the suffering of the world

250
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:22,000
and i'd like to think this is one of the directions one of the tremendous potentials of this practice of

251
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:28,640
mindfulness is that is that it doesn't

252
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:34,079
keep us aloof or distant or unaware of the suffering of the world it actually

253
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:41,839
increases our capacity to experience it without having it weigh us down

254
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:47,520
so this is the beginning and now talking

255
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:53,200
about these instructions for mindfulness of the mind states and i'll continue tomorrow i'll continue for the

256
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:58,400
rest of the week and it develops and grows through here and and as it grows

257
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,680
we enter into kind of more wonderful qualities or states of mind

258
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:09,040
that are available when we the mind is no longer identified or caught in what

259
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:14,280
is known so thank you
