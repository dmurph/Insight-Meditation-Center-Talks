1
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,200
okay so welcome welcome everybody

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,480
a really warm welcome to

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,960
this moment whether you are

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,200
here live or you're listening to this

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,039
sometime in the future

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,359
wherever you may be whomever you may be

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,840
welcome

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,400
so last week

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,039
it was january 3rd

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,078
and i spoke about new year's resolutions

11
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,520
it seems like you know that's something

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,480
that

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,559
we can talk about around the

14
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,679
beginning of the year

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,840
and today i'd like to continue that

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,280
conversation but you might be thinking

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,440
but diana this is a dorma center

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,559
i mean

19
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,160
the

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,199
new year's new year's resolutions like

21
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,559
that's not fairy dharmic

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,920
and maybe i would just like to talk

23
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,799
about this just for a moment here that

24
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,360
sometimes i like to talk and many drama

25
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,040
teachers do this right where we talk

26
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,280
about a drama topic

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,920
unpack it explore it

28
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,400
poke around in there a little bit

29
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,680
and then talk about how we might

30
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,479
cultivate or develop or recognize or

31
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,799
something like this or feel experience

32
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,960
and maybe with some application to our

33
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,400
daily life

34
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,799
maybe not but sometimes there is this

35
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,560
too

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,880
maybe some way in which it might support

37
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,720
our meditation practice or whatever it

38
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,119
might be

39
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,040
but today i'd like to do kind of like

40
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,280
the opposite last week i did as well a

41
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,920
little bit of this let's take our daily

42
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,200
life

43
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,960
are some of these mundane things

44
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,240
new years of resolutions whether or not

45
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,159
we actually make them

46
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,719
this is something that

47
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,560
with this whole idea of this

48
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,360
a

49
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,399
new fresh start

50
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,840
whether it's at new year's or some other

51
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,720
time is a common practice that people do

52
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,000
that our culture does and

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,760
i imagine that many other cultures do

54
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,319
and so can we take something that's i'm

55
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,160
using this word mundane ordinary

56
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,200
maybe not spiritual

57
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,879
certainly in some ways

58
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,640
people practice

59
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,040
on new year's eve may not be fall into

60
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,360
the spiritual realm but this activity of

61
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,000
new year's resolutions of making them

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,800
can we take something as ordinary as

63
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,959
that

64
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,000
and bring it into our practice

65
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,040
or bring our practice to that or

66
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,319
maybe a way to say it is

67
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,560
is there any way in which we're making

68
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,239
this division this artificial division

69
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,280
between

70
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,680
mundane ordinary life

71
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,159
and dharma practice

72
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,680
our spiritual life our inner life

73
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,640
for those of you who have been

74
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,640
practicing a while you know that that

75
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,200
division doesn't really hold up

76
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,720
so tightly

77
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,480
some things that we

78
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,840
experience cultivate

79
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,800
i'll just use those words experience and

80
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,920
cultivate whether it's in our spiritual

81
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,319
life or whether it's in our daily life

82
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,560
affects the other right we're only one

83
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,599
person

84
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,080
we're a single person each of us

85
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,959
with

86
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,040
one heart and mind and body

87
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,120
so

88
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,879
if you're feeling this little protest

89
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,720
you might not be too but if you are

90
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,319
feeling this protest new year's

91
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,920
resolutions and a dharma talk

92
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,239
just an invitation to think about where

93
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,480
do we draw these distinctions and is it

94
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,720
helpful

95
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,120
is it helpful to draw these distinctions

96
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,280
and maybe we can bring the dharma to all

97
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,280
different aspects of our life

98
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,080
to

99
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,400
all of that

100
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,280
so maybe the more specifically i was

101
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,000
going to talk about

102
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,320
if we want to start a new behavior if we

103
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,880
want to cultivate a particular quality

104
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,080
if we want to develop a new habit

105
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,000
we don't use often use this word habit

106
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,400
sometimes habit refers to something that

107
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,000
we do

108
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,040
unknowingly but that i'm pointing to

109
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,840
things that that are intentional but we

110
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,600
do to support our lives

111
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,759
so this new behavior

112
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,240
so one way to really support new

113
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,360
behaviors for example a meditation

114
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,560
practice a regular meditation practice

115
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,240
maybe it's a loving kindness practice

116
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,080
compassion practice whatever it might be

117
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,320
in order to support it it's really

118
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,560
helpful

119
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,960
our environment

120
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,080
it can be tremendous support or it can

121
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,759
be something that we really struggle

122
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,080
against

123
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,280
and

124
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,880
maybe i'll

125
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,039
introduce this idea by telling a little

126
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,639
bit of a story

127
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,199
that comes out of this suit does i've

128
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,039
told this story about the suttas it's

129
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,880
one of my favorites so i tell it in a

130
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,240
number of different contexts

131
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,360
but maybe i'll tell the story first and

132
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,440
talk about a little bit so it's about

133
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,600
this person named megia who's um

134
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,240
at this time he is the attendant to the

135
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,600
buddha so this is before ananda is the

136
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,840
attendant to the buddha

137
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,199
and

138
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,479
megia

139
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,960
he's with the buddha but he wishes to go

140
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,600
elsewhere and meditate

141
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,080
and he wants to go to this beautiful

142
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,000
mango grove that he saw earlier he

143
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,199
thought it would be a good place to

144
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,319
meditate

145
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,319
and that buddha discourages him from

146
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,160
going

147
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,360
and

148
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,319
but

149
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,440
megia asks him three times and it's the

150
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,800
tradition or we see this so common in

151
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,080
the uh sutas that after a third time

152
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,520
there's a shift so i have to say no no

153
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,400
and third time okay yes

154
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,360
so

155
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,319
maybe reluctantly the buddha says okay

156
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,960
meg yeah you can go meditate because

157
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,520
megya was the buddha's attendant

158
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,560
he uh

159
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,919
i'm um

160
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,360
assuming that that buddha was expecting

161
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,160
that megia would whatever buddha's

162
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,759
attendant does that he would stay and

163
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,080
take care of that but instead megia

164
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,960
wanted to go meditate

165
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,960
so maggie goes off and meditates

166
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,639
and

167
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,120
he has a difficult time

168
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,319
and his meditation doesn't go well and

169
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,720
he even um exclaims out loud it is

170
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,880
amazing

171
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,720
that i am ensnared by these three bad

172
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,440
unwholesome thoughts

173
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,160
that is thoughts of sensual pleasure

174
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,560
thoughts of ill will thoughts of harming

175
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,479
so

176
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,639
then he goes and his meditation doesn't

177
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,639
go well and he goes back and it tells

178
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,919
the buddha

179
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,840
and the buddha responds by saying

180
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,680
for those whose freedom of mind is not

181
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,919
fully mature

182
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,680
there are five things that lead to

183
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,360
maturity

184
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,199
what five

185
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,280
here megia a monk has good friends

186
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,199
good companions

187
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,599
good comrades

188
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,000
this is the first thing that leads to

189
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,759
maturity

190
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,520
so when the

191
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,919
freedom of mind freedom of heart isn't

192
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,560
there there's these five things the

193
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,840
first one

194
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,720
is good friends good comrades

195
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,639
good companions good associates

196
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,280
i appreciate that there's this number of

197
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,160
um synonyms here and

198
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,360
we can interpret that a number of

199
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,800
different ways one way i interpret it as

200
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,800
not um

201
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,479
having this same level of intimacy

202
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,879
like we have people that maybe we just

203
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,840
say hi how are you nice to see you

204
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,039
and maybe we don't talk with them a lot

205
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,399
but somehow

206
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,760
just um there's familiarity

207
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,839
example

208
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,399
come to a meditation center

209
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,160
maybe even on the chat box on youtube

210
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,440
just to say hello

211
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,160
there's something about just recognizing

212
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,959
that other people are here

213
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,800
that other people are doing the same

214
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,880
behavior

215
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,160
that we're

216
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,120
supporting one another in this way

217
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,120
we shouldn't underestimate how powerful

218
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,720
this is the buddha lists it in the first

219
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,680
in this list of five things that when

220
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,720
the heart and the mind don't have full

221
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,480
maturity we can interpret that as

222
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,760
liberation

223
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,200
five things that support it number one

224
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,399
good friends

225
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,640
good spiritual companions

226
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,640
good associates

227
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,000
and we can interpret this word good

228
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,920
that i i'm saying

229
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,640
as um it's this translation this word

230
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,360
kaliana

231
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,160
and it might we could also understand it

232
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,320
as beautiful so beautiful is often

233
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,680
something that's uplifting

234
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,519
so

235
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,360
for me it's significant that this story

236
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,200
from the sutas

237
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,920
has megya who is the buddha's attendant

238
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,560
some might say the buddha is the world's

239
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,079
greatest meditation teacher

240
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,000
he's the buddha's attendant he has

241
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
ordained he has dedicated his life

242
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,480
to practice

243
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,399
and he's the buddhist attendant he has

244
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,560
access ready access to this fabulous

245
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,519
teacher

246
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,120
and he still has difficulties

247
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,519
and that buddha says to him something

248
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,160
that can be a support it's good friends

249
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,399
good associates

250
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,320
i'm not it's a list of five i'm not

251
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,079
going to list the other four of my point

252
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,360
here is the number one it's about the

253
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,880
good friends

254
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,839
so

255
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,399
why is this do we think that

256
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,040
the buddha is pointing to and i'm sure

257
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,120
many of you know there's lots of

258
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,800
different

259
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,120
stories or teaching points that the

260
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,640
buddha has made

261
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,000
about the importance of our associates

262
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,399
and our friends

263
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,640
and i

264
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,560
want to believe that the buddha

265
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,399
recognized something that all of us

266
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,640
recognize too but maybe we don't say it

267
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,320
so explicitly

268
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,839
that we learn behaviors from others

269
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,040
we could even say and it's true right

270
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,200
our earliest behaviors not so much that

271
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,360
we learn them but that we imitate them

272
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,920
right from kind of part of natural human

273
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,040
development that we imitate things and

274
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,839
but even as adults we pick up behaviors

275
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,720
and ways of speaking from others ways of

276
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,279
dressing from others of course this is

277
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,959
how fashion works right whether we

278
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,720
intend to or not you know kind of

279
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,519
clothing fashion changes

280
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,320
it's because people get influenced by

281
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,160
one another

282
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,040
whether they intend to or not

283
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,160
this is how dialects regional ways of

284
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,040
speaking get created

285
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,800
as we just you know slowly get

286
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,519
influenced by each other

287
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,519
either we intend to or not

288
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,360
and to be sure some of the power of

289
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,959
social media for good and maybe for ill

290
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:13,600
or

291
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,600
i shouldn't say maybe it's both good and

292
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,959
ill right

293
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:17,760
um

294
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,800
is this power of hitting a like button

295
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,600
or

296
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,200
you know this um

297
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,880
social

298
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,120
i forgot now what the word is but this

299
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,600
idea that well everybody else is doing

300
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,320
it so it must be okay but we only know

301
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,160
everybody else is doing it because we

302
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,639
hear about it on all the social media

303
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,519
platforms

304
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,560
so this tremendous power that

305
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,120
whether it's intentional or not that

306
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,560
other people have around us

307
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,480
so

308
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,959
if we want to have a support for our

309
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,959
meditation practice for our spiritual

310
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,040
practice

311
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,200
it can be a tremendous support to be

312
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,360
with others who have the similar

313
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,279
practice the similar

314
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,000
if not the same

315
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,800
activities behaviors things that they do

316
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,320
for

317
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,639
one because we influence each other as i

318
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,680
was just pointing out but also maybe to

319
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,240
be a little bit more specific about it

320
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,360
is that

321
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,519
if we see other people or

322
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,320
let's say meditating

323
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,320
right if you would have told me years

324
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,120
ago that i would be on youtube sitting

325
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,639
still with my eyes closed

326
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,760
right

327
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,000
it's that um

328
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,760
it's the

329
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,279
i didn't i certainly wouldn't think that

330
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,519
i'd be doing this but there's something

331
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,240
about when we do see other people doing

332
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,240
this it normalizes this and i have said

333
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,320
i'm sure as many of you have

334
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,519
have said

335
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,959
in enough retreats or drama talks

336
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,199
that's what we did

337
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,160
we

338
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,720
had a meditative posture

339
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,760
and meditated together

340
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,279
so it normalizes this behavior

341
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,079
maybe like oh it's actually not that

342
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,639
weird

343
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,480
maybe from the outside it's that it

344
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,160
seems weird right but there's a

345
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,680
collection there's a group of us it

346
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,000
doesn't seem weird at all

347
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,959
so

348
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,600
just to have this um

349
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,240
this behavior modeled by others also

350
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,959
maybe learning seeing like oh okay they

351
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,240
do it that way

352
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,040
maybe maybe that's helpful or they don't

353
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,199
do it the way i'm doing it i wonder why

354
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,199
or you know so not only does it

355
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,519
normalize but we can also learn from

356
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,959
them

357
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,360
like oh that's how you do it

358
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,800
and

359
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,120
there's a little bit uh

360
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,560
i could use this word peer pressure

361
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,600
that's whether it's explicit or not i

362
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,600
know certainly for me

363
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,199
when i was

364
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,839
sort of getting more and more active

365
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,800
here at imc and people were going off on

366
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,320
retreat

367
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,639
and my first meditation retreat was

368
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,560
not a pleasant experience

369
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,760
let's just say that to be sure it was

370
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,320
immensely impactful and ultimately

371
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,440
life-changing but it was not a pleasant

372
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,839
experience it was so difficult it was

373
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:24,839
really

374
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,120
difficult not everybody has that

375
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,440
experience to be sure but for me it was

376
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,759
hard and part of it was just physically

377
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,199
demanding and then when you're in

378
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,800
physical pain

379
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,199
just kind of you know or

380
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,399
we can collapse around that

381
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,079
but

382
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,519
i was seeing people around you know imc

383
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,839
going off on retreat and

384
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,040
as i

385
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,360
uh left that first retreat

386
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,880
that wasn't with imc it was in a

387
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,360
different tradition thinking like oh my

388
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,040
gosh i don't know if i ever want to do

389
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,320
that again

390
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,440
but there was

391
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,800
a little bit of

392
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,079
you know

393
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,959
this being influenced by others i felt

394
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,320
like okay maybe i should do this if

395
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,120
and boy am i glad i did

396
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,000
boy am i glad i did not because it was a

397
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,600
walk in the park easy peasy but

398
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,079
it just really helped support my

399
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,920
practice

400
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,040
so this idea that other people influence

401
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,560
us

402
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,959
and we can use this as a way to be a

403
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,560
support for our practice

404
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,680
so many things are available on zoom

405
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,120
these days it's astounding

406
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,720
to

407
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,399
find a group

408
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,800
that we resonate with

409
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,839
that supports our

410
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,600
practice it can be a tremendous support

411
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,680
whether it's on zoom whether it's on

412
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,800
person

413
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,920
if the

414
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,880
you are in a place a location in which

415
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,560
that's available

416
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,120
maybe when imc opens back up to come

417
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,839
back to imc

418
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,280
irc

419
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,959
we canceled to retreat because if

420
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,918
omacron shifted some over to online but

421
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,240
we are really striving to try to keep as

422
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,520
much as we can in person

423
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,319
safely

424
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,520
so that

425
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,918
if that's uh

426
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,120
in your

427
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,400
realm of practice or

428
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,240
to consider you know practicing in

429
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,039
person with others too

430
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,640
so that's one thing

431
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,039
about our environment that can be a

432
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,919
support for our new year's resolutions

433
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:40,799
really

434
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,559
creating the conditions in which it

435
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,720
makes it more likely that we would adopt

436
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,280
a new behavior

437
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,400
but

438
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,400
i also want to point out another dharma

439
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,360
teaching that's related to this

440
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,320
and that is

441
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,039
there's this three refuges these three

442
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,000
treasures the buddha the dharma and the

443
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,640
sangha

444
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,640
and i think the buddha had some

445
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,840
tremendous wisdom pointing to the sangha

446
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,559
as a refuge partly for just what i was

447
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,840
pointing to

448
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,480
the support to have a community of

449
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,039
people that are practicing together

450
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,880
but that's not only

451
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,919
the

452
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,320
reason that's not the only

453
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,840
benefit of the sangha

454
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,840
at the beginning of the anapanasati

455
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,600
sutra that is the suta that gives the

456
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,200
mindfulness of breathing instructions

457
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,760
and sometimes when we read suitas

458
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,720
we might

459
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,320
gloss over the part of it that's not

460
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,200
about the actual instructions

461
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,880
but this is really a foundational

462
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,919
text in this tradition

463
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,720
the mindfulness of breathing

464
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,160
and it begins with setting the scene

465
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,960
with

466
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,400
quite a few paragraphs talking about

467
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,440
how there are these monastics all

468
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,600
together

469
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,039
and there's the

470
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,760
senior monastics teaching the junior

471
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,640
monastics

472
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,039
and it's described in such a beautiful

473
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,760
way and that buddha coming and seeing

474
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,320
this and i don't have the quote here

475
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,160
but it is being very pleased by how

476
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,440
there's this helping of one another and

477
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,960
people practicing together

478
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,840
so

479
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,559
this idea of

480
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:43,679
just the

481
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:44,880
support

482
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,960
maybe

483
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,240
indirectly

484
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,880
by just showing up together but maybe

485
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,240
there's support or other people directly

486
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,679
also by

487
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,000
teaching one another as how that part of

488
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,440
the wave with this as suta shows

489
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,000
but there's another part of the sangha

490
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,280
and another part of this practice

491
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,760
is that

492
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,400
i've been talking about how we're

493
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,520
influenced by the our environment and

494
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,039
of course we're influenced by

495
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,600
those that are in powerful positions

496
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,640
either directly or indirectly often you

497
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,200
find people kind of like imitate those

498
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,400
who are in power

499
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,159
the sangha they have

500
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,919
when i'm using the word power i'm

501
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,000
thinking about their

502
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,559
power of

503
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,559
dedicating their life

504
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,280
to what's important to them

505
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,080
and there's this practice of

506
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,600
recollecting the sangha

507
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,240
and the buddha describes it this way

508
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,280
the sangha of the blessed ones disciples

509
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,559
who have practiced well

510
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,559
you have practiced straight forwardly

511
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,080
who have practiced methodically

512
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,640
who have practiced masterfully

513
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,960
so he's describing

514
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,679
this the sangha as these

515
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,000
disciples these followers

516
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,799
who have practiced

517
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:30,080
straightforwardly methodically

518
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,640
masterfully so he's referring to those

519
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,400
that have some meditative attainment so

520
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,600
i've

521
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,799
tasted

522
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,279
freedom

523
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,600
and so bringing to mind like yes other

524
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,480
people have been on this path before

525
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,679
and they have done this practice and

526
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,960
they have found some freedom

527
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,120
maybe we know people who we find

528
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,120
inspiring

529
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,400
we often we

530
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,039
know that it didn't just happen

531
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,480
overnight

532
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,640
but it's through the results of some

533
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,200
practice

534
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,600
but this is more specifically in the

535
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,559
tsutas there is this idea that

536
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,480
recollecting the sangha

537
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,320
being inspired by other people who

538
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,400
have

539
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,400
dedicated their life who have found

540
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,880
their way

541
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,480
to this practice

542
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,520
and that it brings some gladness to the

543
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,880
heart

544
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,080
some

545
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,840
uplift

546
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,840
the

547
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,799
polyurethamoja maybe some delight

548
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,480
and then last week i talked i talked

549
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,880
about the gladness penta

550
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,600
and i one so this recollection of the

551
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,840
sangha not only can we be like

552
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,799
influenced by those who

553
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,120
have gone before us and who have really

554
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,960
dedicated their life

555
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,840
but

556
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,000
this activity of recollecting them can

557
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,400
also

558
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,840
bring some joy some gladness some uplift

559
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,039
some

560
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,400
um

561
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,640
i don't know i find myself smiling when

562
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,280
i think about how many women

563
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,039
how many men

564
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:19,840
have

565
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,919
through the ages since the time of the

566
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,919
buddha

567
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,679
have dedicated their life and how many

568
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,760
have found freedom

569
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,840
and how many people have found freedom

570
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,640
as lay people as well right

571
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,039
so it doesn't have to be entirely

572
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,960
dedicating their life

573
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,760
but it brings a certain gladness

574
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,400
and then this gladness penthouse

575
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,360
of

576
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,200
gladness that

577
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,880
leads to joy

578
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,520
which leads to tranquility which leads

579
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,600
to happiness which leads to

580
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,640
concentrations or collectedness we might

581
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,880
say

582
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,039
and this flowing from one to the other

583
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,080
of this gladness

584
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,440
pentad

585
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,200
is another way and which can be a

586
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,480
support for new behaviors

587
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,520
this

588
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,840
the gladness joy tranquility happiness

589
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,440
concentration or

590
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,880
maybe concentration i could say

591
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,440
collectedness is a way also in which we

592
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,960
can kind of remain focused on

593
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,279
what is what we're doing here what our

594
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,840
priorities are what's important to us

595
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,240
so

596
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,880
an environment that's supportive

597
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,159
for

598
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,480
having new behaviors new activities new

599
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,559
things we want to do

600
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,760
being inspired by others

601
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,400
that have done this

602
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,880
being inspired in such a way that it

603
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,360
touches us

604
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,480
having some appreciation for people who

605
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,960
have found a way

606
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,080
people who

607
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,480
are teach others to

608
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,480
for themselves to find a way certainly i

609
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,159
have gratitude and appreciation for my

610
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,159
teachers

611
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,679
and then allow

612
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,520
this gladness

613
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,640
itself

614
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,679
to be a support

615
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,120
for practice not only for practice maybe

616
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,360
but for this

617
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,559
allow it to have this joy tranquility

618
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,080
and happiness

619
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,159
that leads to some collectedness and the

620
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,919
collectedness can be a support also

621
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,240
so in this way

622
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,760
we can think about new year's

623
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,799
resolutions like oh i'm you know

624
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,960
there's countless ones that we can do

625
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,000
right

626
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,840
but is there a way in which we can

627
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,320
actually think oh there's a dharma way

628
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,360
in which we can

629
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,600
use this as a support

630
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,520
for our new year's resolutions i've been

631
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,279
pointing to

632
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,039
support for developing a meditation

633
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,640
practice but many of the things that

634
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,039
i've been talking about here

635
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,200
can be applied to

636
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,000
other

637
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,080
new habits or behaviors we'd like to do

638
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,159
and then this way bringing the dorma to

639
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,320
new year's resolutions is that way also

640
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,080
we might kind of like meld or

641
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,159
knit together any divisions we might

642
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,480
have between okay this is ordinary

643
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,720
mundane stuff and this is dharma stuff

644
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,760
but is it is there really any need to

645
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,240
make a difference

646
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,840
maybe there's

647
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,720
no difference

648
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,200
maybe that's the

649
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,320
what we discover

650
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,880
with our practice

651
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,720
as there isn't

652
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,880
a time when the dharma is

653
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,159
on or off switch it on or off but

654
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,360
allowing it to blossom and permeate and

655
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,200
flow

656
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,320
in all areas of our life

657
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,120
and if we find that it's stuck and not

658
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,320
able to permeate certain areas

659
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,840
we could have some curiosity about that

660
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,559
what areas are we thinking that we

661
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,960
are excluding

662
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,799
what do we think that

663
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,279
needs to be separate

664
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,279
from our derma practice and

665
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,799
all the things that we're learning and

666
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,158
practicing and cultivating

667
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,039
so the dharma comes to new year's

668
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,039
resolutions

669
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,399
wishing you

670
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,440
a beautiful 2023.

671
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,679
thank you

672
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,360
you
