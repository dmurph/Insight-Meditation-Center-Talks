1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,720
so hello and welcome everyone to happier

2
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:19,520
so for today's practice um the theme i'd like to invite us to

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,560
explore is the theme of

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:31,119
of [Music] mind habits or habits of the mind

5
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:38,399
our habits of the mind that we create habits of the mind that become habits of

6
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:46,719
body action etc and um there is a and and how it relates

7
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:54,960
to meta because in the practice of meta we try to cultivate we try to cultivate

8
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,240
a way of thinking being considering um

9
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,439
[Music] ourselves and others

10
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:12,159
uh meeting our friends and meeting our thoughts meeting ourselves meeting others with friendliness with good will

11
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:18,560
with the sense of good will as a way of cultivation

12
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,350
so this quote i want to share with you as inspiration

13
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:30,400
[Music] is a quote from mahatma gandhi and he says

14
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:37,360
keep your thoughts positive because you your thought becomes your word

15
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,439
keep your words positive because your words become your behavior

16
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:50,320
your behavior becomes your habits your habits become your values

17
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,560
and your values become your destiny it's quite profound

18
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,920
uh let me bring it into the space one more time

19
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:09,280
your thoughts become your words your words become your behavior

20
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:16,879
your behavior becomes your habits and your habits becomes your values

21
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:24,400
and your values become your destiny quite powerful it all starts our destiny

22
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,680
or our life this designing our life really starts

23
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:37,200
with our thoughts starts with how we incline our mind as the buddha

24
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,040
says inclining our minds do we incline it towards loving kindness

25
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,560
do we incline it do we just let it go wild in ill will

26
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,080
towards ourselves judgmental thoughts bad bad bad terrible terrible do we let

27
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,879
it run wild do we let it run wild or with ill will towards others

28
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:06,239
or do we gently say okay sweetie all right a little time to

29
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,800
for some cultivation for some cultivation and again not to self-flagellate if you notice your

30
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,800
thoughts are running wild that would not be helpful that would be pouring more

31
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:25,200
gasoline on the fire of ill will because if you you see that right if you have ill will

32
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:32,319
towards yourself or having ill-will towards yourself or having a world towards yourself or ill-will towards others it's not exactly

33
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:38,239
stopping the cycle this so it's only through kindness kindness

34
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:44,400
towards yourself if you notice if the mind is it's going on a tirade against

35
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:51,519
yourself or against others oh sweetheart sweetheart compassion kindness kindness

36
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:59,239
a stick is not the solution a carrot might be

37
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:08,080
so [Music] and one last thing i want to say and bring into the space

38
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,360
is this idea this idea of of our thoughts and

39
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,040
leading to action and our behavior and our destiny etc

40
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:26,800
really isn't so some so different from the idea of karma in the way that

41
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,080
every thought every action every way you know not to think of karma as this

42
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:38,240
complicated thing from some past life that we don't even know what we did not in that way

43
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:47,360
that's not very helpful but in the way of every action every thought really sets into motion

44
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,280
a habit pattern a way of being which then sets into motion

45
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,600
further thoughts further actions further habit patterns so

46
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,720
so in the equanimity phrase is actually

47
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:11,280
where it is said that we are heir we're owners to our actions

48
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,720
and heirs to our actions owners and heirs i want to unpack that a

49
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:25,120
little bit actually so it is said that comma is actually the womb from which

50
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:33,759
from which we spring which is so poetic it's pali it's kama yoni kamayoni so kama our

51
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:39,360
karma our actions is the womb from which we spring

52
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:46,000
so powerful and also we are inalienable owners of

53
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,840
our deeds kamasaka for those who like the pali comma

54
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,600
saka so we're the owners we're the owners it's both the womb we spray out

55
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,440
from and we are the owners

56
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:10,720
and it's also our heritage it remains with us our actions remain with us forever

57
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:17,680
remain with us we inevitably return to our heritage

58
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:29,520
and our good deeds are our refuge our refuge that we can take refuge and can be laid the sense of

59
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:35,840
if there's fear uncertainty we can take refuge in our kama patissarana

60
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:43,199
so our karma our actions as as refuge so this is such a beautiful

61
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:51,120
teaching and the last one is our karma our deeds as our friends as our friends

62
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,039
when our minds are serene um when we have cultivated

63
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,080
good thoughts and actions are with a sense of equanimity sense of

64
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:08,080
peace we have comma bondu b-a-n-d-h-u

65
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:14,160
comma our our deeds serve as our friends so

66
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,520
i think this is such a beautiful teaching inspiring teaching

67
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,560
it's actually such an empowerment it's a teaching of empowerment

68
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,639
that we ah we're the owners we're the heirs where

69
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:36,240
it's so so much that we put into place ourselves so

70
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,919
with that let us cultivate some wholesome thoughts leading to some

71
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:47,680
wholesome actions and and wholesome karma

72
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:56,840
it's not so complicated so let us practice loving kindness cultivating goodness

73
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:05,120
together with that as motivation so like to invite you to settle

168
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:46,480
made the impact of my cultivation this goodness

169
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:54,480
be a cause and condition for freedom for peace for myself and all beings everywhere

170
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:00,200
may all beings be happy may all beings be free

171
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:19,480
thanks everyone thank you for your practice

172
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:27,200
so we have a few minutes for reflections for comments

173
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:34,560
and you're welcome to type them in chat if they're typed to everyone i will read your name if they're just typed in me

174
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:41,680
i won't read your name and only read the reflection you're also welcome to raise your zoom hand

175
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:47,119
what you noticed what were some insights that came up

176
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,519
questions comments complaints it's all welcome

177
00:38:53,040 --> 00:39:00,640
and one thing i'll share as i'm waiting for your reflections to come in is with the uh

178
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:08,160
quote from gandhi that i read at the beginning i think it is quite powerful connecting that with

179
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:14,000
karma and the part i think the full quote is keep your

180
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,359
thoughts positive because your words become your behavior become your

181
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:27,200
your behavior becomes your habit you have it becomes your values and your values become your destiny

182
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:32,400
so that link that seems like the link one leads to another that's a beautiful

183
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,520
arc to keep in mind and yet to keeping the thoughts positive that

184
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:43,040
that's the part i'm not emphasizing at all because that almost sounds like

185
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:50,240
happy happy just be positive no matter what and psycho psychological research actually shows that

186
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:55,839
false positivity is detrimental to our state of mind and our state of

187
00:39:55,839 --> 00:40:01,680
health um so i want to make a distinction and if that's not clear you're welcome to raise

188
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:06,960
your hand and ask me to expand more but i hope it is clear

189
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:13,200
and i don't and i don't think of of this practice of meta as kind of false

190
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:18,400
positivity that's not the idea here now says orienting towards kindness is

191
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:25,520
like constantly steering a ship on a wavy sea thank you for your guidance thank you now thank you for that

192
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:31,440
and uh what's actually what's beautiful uh and very

193
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:37,359
cogent the observation about the constantly staring a ship because um

194
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:45,280
it turns out that you if you're trying to get from eight to b even if the c's are calm you always

195
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,560
have to to course adjust you always have to course adjust it's not like you set the

196
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:56,079
compass and off you go um and um

197
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:02,720
so we always have to course adjust it's not like we set our intention and values yep i'm going to be kind to myself and

198
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:09,839
everyone else from now on and done doesn't work that way it's like steering the ship

199
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:16,880
always always every moment every moment gently gently course adjusting thank you

200
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:24,160
for that enough other reflections what did you notice

201
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,480
what came up for you what was challenging

202
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,240
yeah yeah

203
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:46,079
and also they'd be connect connecting this to karma as i gave a little dharmat

204
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:53,040
at the beginning regarding these different aspects of karma karma being the womb

205
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:58,319
we being the air of our own karma the friend the refuge all of that

206
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:05,440
and karma isn't isn't said but in our actions

207
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:11,040
and and in buddhism actions thoughts are considered actions of the

208
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:16,880
mind which is pretty cool i think so we have actions of mind actions of speech

209
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:24,240
actions of the body so we have three different types of action and all of these produce karma so the way we think

210
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:29,520
we set our our way of being

211
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:35,359
he said our course in the world so

212
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:43,280
jerry says i noticed how critical my mind is having not noticed it before i started

213
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:49,920
today great great to notice it yeah yeah

214
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,680
nice thank you for sharing that

215
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:01,440
i'll give one more pause for reflections

216
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:10,880
sarah says where do emotions fit in with what you are saying oh yes

217
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:18,079
so so with the um

218
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:23,839
with the practice today with cultivating kindness or

219
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:28,880
cultivating kindness also towards our emotions

220
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:34,560
because emotions are energy in motion the reason why they're showing up given

221
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:41,119
all the causes and conditions so we are kind with emotions

222
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:48,480
being with them and not pushing them away even if they're challenging or difficult

223
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:54,560
emotions like for example anger or sadness but meeting them with kindness

224
00:43:54,560 --> 00:44:02,640
meeting them with kindness um and it doesn't mean that we act out of

225
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:08,240
them because acting out of them or feeding them so continuing to mindlessly

226
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:13,280
feed the sadness mindlessly feeding the anger is

227
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:20,240
is the thought you know in that way your the emotions are setting our karma our way of being in the world

228
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:26,880
as someone who's always angry always sad but meeting it with kindness meeting with kindness it

229
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:34,000
provides awareness so kind awareness provides this

230
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,040
container for them to be met for them to be

231
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:44,800
to move through to be processed whatever needs to happen in the body

232
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:51,119
i hope that answers your questions there next reflection i'm going through a

233
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:56,400
fertility process and i felt very grateful for my body instead of upset

234
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:01,920
that it doesn't behave the way i wanted it to i felt grateful for all my body has

235
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:09,359
carried me through in this life oh that is such a beautiful beautiful reflection thank you for sharing that so beautiful

236
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:14,880
so to be grateful for the body instead of being upset that it doesn't behave

237
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:21,280
