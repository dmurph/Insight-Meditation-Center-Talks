1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,280
so as i've been talking over these last

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,839
days about the 13th step

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,400
of mindfulness of breathing being

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,000
you're being the observation

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,320
settling back and observing the

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,720
inconstancy of phenomena

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,039
how things are constantly renewing but

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,600
also constantly passing

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,640
and that appearing and disappearing of

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,039
our experience moment by moment

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,960
certainly sometimes it's unfortunate

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,800
that things pass away

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,640
sometimes we're very fortunate that

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,200
finally it's no longer here

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,719
and sometimes we're fortunate that

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,640
things are

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,800
are arising and sometimes it's

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,559
unfortunate what's arising

19
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,280
it's painful or something and sometimes

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,200
it's neutral

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,680
so there's no particular um

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,680
prioritizing or valuing or or how to say

23
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,039
it

24
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,640
putting a value on the particular

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,760
arising of passings that occur

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,640
it's not it's not a discounting of

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,760
things it's not a

28
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,400
celebrating of things necessarily it's

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:12,880
just

30
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,560
seeing that actually this is kind of the

31
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,000
nature of

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,680
when we're really settled really

33
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,840
peaceful not overlaying concepts and

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,359
ideas on top of experience

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,920
can we can kind of um that's what we

36
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,520
experience we're in the flow of our

37
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,040
experience flow of

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,479
sensations and experience

39
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,320
and but the great value of it is not in

40
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,840
and of itself like we're supposed to

41
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,560
celebrate it or supposed to

42
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,920
be depressed by it or something it's uh

43
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,200
that we can't it's it becomes a

44
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,119
reference point

45
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,880
for how valuable it is not to cling to

46
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,600
any of it

47
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,159
not to contract around any of it not to

48
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,880
resist any of it

49
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,479
and especially and in meditation

50
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,159
in real life you know there's certain

51
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,239
things that should be held onto

52
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,879
or resisted perhaps but in meditation to

53
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,360
really learn to free ourselves from

54
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,080
any movement of being for against

55
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,680
holding on or pushing away

56
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,879
and because the kind doesn't work but

57
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,000
also because

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,400
this ability to observe and not get

59
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,959
engaged and attached to things

60
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,840
begins feeling so good i feel that's

61
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,840
where freedom is

62
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,040
and uh and the core kind of uh

63
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,280
catalyst for freedom in the teachings of

64
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,400
the buddha

65
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,360
is this experience this deep insight

66
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,360
into inconstancy

67
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,840
and so the way in which the more free we

68
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,160
become

69
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,920
the more inconsistency is a support for

70
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,680
greater freedom

71
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,560
the more free we are the more we see

72
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,760
recognize how we're

73
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,440
trying to hold on to what is constantly

74
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,200
changing or how we've

75
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,480
left the flow or how we you know like

76
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,319
put our hand out the window of a car and

77
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,159
we have wind drag

78
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,000
we're going to have wind drag we put our

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,840
hands into the river and trying to stop

80
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,360
it

81
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,840
we picked up a bunch of handful of water

82
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,440
and we left the river

83
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,599
thinking we have the river still there's

84
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,080
all these ways in which we recognize

85
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,120
that we've we've kind of left the flow

86
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,159
of inconstancy the flow of life

87
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,080
because we've gotten excessively

88
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,519
attached or involved or

89
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,519
clinging and so see that in meditation

90
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,200
and to see that we're actually better

91
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,640
off uh

92
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,599
backing off better off not clinging that

93
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,159
it's not so

94
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,200
interesting to cling or to want and so

95
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,720
there's a begins to be an

96
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,599
inner psychological change that happens

97
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,879
and

98
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,879
some of that is starting to become a

99
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,000
a relaxing the search

100
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,920
relaxing they're trying to do something

101
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,760
or get something

102
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,439
or relaxing the need to know

103
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,680
and searching to know and because all

104
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,879
that is kind of

105
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,720
is too much it's like leaning forward

106
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,560
when we can just settle back

107
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,000
in the sense and then the

108
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,040
uh all these attachments we have starts

109
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,199
we start feeling them as being wind drag

110
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,120
we start feeling them as being

111
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,240
um interfering with the the

112
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,160
radiance of the heart the beauty of the

113
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,000
mind the freedom of

114
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,680
of of our lives and we can see that

115
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,360
they diminish us the clinging the

116
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,120
attachments that we have things we hold

117
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,479
on to and so there starts to be a fading

118
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:42,880
away

119
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,160
disinterest and a fading away

120
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,160
of uh jealousy and envy and conceit

121
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,680
and and craving and

122
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,840
hatred and resentments

123
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,880
you know you can go on the list is long

124
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,560
of things that we begin recognizing oh

125
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,320
this doesn't really serve me this

126
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,639
i'm not so interested in this anymore

127
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,000
it's not like i have to be a good

128
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,680
buddhist and this is bad that i'm doing

129
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,600
this that i have to stop doing it

130
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,160
it's more like i'm no longer interested

131
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,880
in this

132
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,039
this is less and less interesting to do

133
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,479
i've been resentful for

134
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,960
30 years and i think that i'm getting

135
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,320
tired of it i think i see

136
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,039
that it's not so interesting i've been

137
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,639
chasing after

138
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,000
having the perfect physical physique for

139
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,039
decades and at some point i'm not really

140
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,080
interested in

141
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,680
presenting myself always with the

142
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,840
perfect human physique whatever that

143
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,880
might be

144
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,639
and we start losing interest in it uh

145
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,800
always wanting to make more money or

146
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,080
have status or

147
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,360
i don't know what to all these things

148
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,000
we're kind of chasing there's a healthy

149
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,400
kind of

150
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,759
oh wait a minute this doesn't serve me

151
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,080
this is not the best place to be this is

152
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,840
not the most wonderful way to be

153
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,560
to be preoccupied with these things i'm

154
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,440
beginning to know something better

155
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,440
i'm knowing something about freedom and

156
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,680
ease and peace

157
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,560
and i want to stress over again that the

158
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,160
primary reference point for what i'm

159
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,759
talking about here now

160
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,199
is in fact meditation because

161
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,280
outside of meditation you might argue

162
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,319
well wait a minute

163
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,080
isn't it okay to do it here or here we

164
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,080
need to do it here

165
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,280
i don't want to get into those

166
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,919
discussions what i want you

167
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,240
is to really discover that in meditation

168
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,360
you don't have to be

169
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,919
pursuing the perfect physique more money

170
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,000
more status more

171
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,680
whatever it is that you're trying to do

172
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,240
in meditation you can feel it meditation

173
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,960
itself it's

174
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,840
better easier just to let go or not be

175
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,120
involved

176
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,840
and then to really have an experience a

177
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,720
qualitatively high experience of freedom

178
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,319
of ease of peace where we're no longer

179
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,800
grasping or holding or resisting or

180
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,520
tightening or contracting

181
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,160
that becomes your teacher rather than

182
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,960
debating me

183
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,360
with me about wait a minute aren't you

184
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,960
supposed to hold on here or

185
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,400
resist that it's not so interesting to

186
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,840
debate with me

187
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,639
it's really for real spiritual life you

188
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,039
should be debating with yourself

189
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,120
when you have this deep reference point

190
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,080
for peace

191
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,360
deep deep reference point for freedom

192
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,199
that's that's where it gets really

193
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,560
interesting that's where it really

194
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,680
comes alive this practice of freedom

195
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,000
and uh and really kind of explore and

196
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,039
find out what

197
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,400
what is really true for yourself

198
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,080
so with this uh observing and constancy

199
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,680
then there's a fading away of the

200
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,160
interest in some of our attachments

201
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,240
and then there's a fading away of the

202
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,440
attachments themselves

203
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,639
and and so

204
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,759
the word for the 13th

205
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,199
step of anapanasati the pali word is

206
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,240
v raga v i

207
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,479
r a g a and uh

208
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,240
there's two different translations of

209
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,400
this word and the one that i'll

210
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,319
stress today is um it means the fading

211
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:16,879
away

212
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,039
when observes the fading of the fading

213
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,520
away of these attachments

214
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,879
and the fading away of

215
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,720
of our interest their our addiction to

216
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,520
uh addictive interest in in certain

217
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,279
things that are not really serving us

218
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,479
anymore

219
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,399
and so they're fading away or fading

220
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,719
away and this speaks to something very

221
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,959
important about this path of liberation

222
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,240
in buddhism

223
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,919
that sometimes there's a tendency to

224
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,080
want to look for

225
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,399
you know a sudden experience that the

226
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,160
key to it all that just unlocks it all a

227
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,680
number free forever

228
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,160
just like but a more mature way of

229
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,519
seeing it is that

230
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,519
a lot of it has to do with just fading

231
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,040
away fading away

232
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,240
a wearing away dropping away

233
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,360
drop by drop everything

234
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,959
dries up or falls away the evaporating

235
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:09,920
of it

236
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,360
phenomena of our attachment and

237
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,519
so raga the root of the word viraga

238
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,519
can mean a dye that we call our cloth

239
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,399
with

240
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,600
and the raga the prefix means of fading

241
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,000
away or separating of that dye

242
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,839
and so one of the meanings is to fade

243
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,040
away the dye you put

244
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,399
you know you dye some clothes and you

245
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,160
leave it in the sun for too long and

246
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,920
it gets bleached to get the color fades

247
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,240
away and so or just time

248
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,279
fades it away and so the fading away the

249
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,720
fading away

250
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,000
and um and this uh when we really feel

251
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,880
the

252
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,000
the um unsatisfactoriness the

253
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,440
the offness the the

254
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,120
discomfort of attachment of clinging of

255
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,399
addiction of

256
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,480
all these movements of the mind that we

257
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,680
have

258
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,880
and we start to feel ah

259
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,200
this is lightening up it's loosening up

260
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,399
there's a

261
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,959
lightening a lifting a lifting of a

262
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,320
cloud and

263
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,360
letting go relaxing and then the

264
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,360
mindfulness practice is to be available

265
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,040
to that fading to be

266
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,160
open to that fading to allow for that

267
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,680
fading

268
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,279
because if we go right back into

269
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,240
clinging we reinforce more clinging

270
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,320
we strengthen that capacity to cling and

271
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,320
attach and resist and

272
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,959
be addicted to things but once we start

273
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,680
feeling this process of fading away

274
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,360
then the mindfulness practice is to be

275
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,440
available to that fading

276
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,160
available to it so we don't reinforce

277
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,480
the opposite

278
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,680
so one trains

279
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,200
breathing in observing

280
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,000
fading away one trains breathing out

281
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,839
observing fading away

282
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,200
and uh and uh

283
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,560
so that's one of the meanings of the

284
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,560
araga and then tomorrow

285
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,240
i'll talk a little bit about the second

286
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,760
meaning which is

287
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,800
dispassion and uh

288
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,880
at least that's all you often how it's

289
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,640
translated into english

290
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,120
and um and probably not a very good

291
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,880
translation but

292
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,079
that's for tomorrow so

293
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:42,000
thank you and this comes to an end
