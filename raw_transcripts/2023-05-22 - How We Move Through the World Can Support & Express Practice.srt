1
00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:06,660
good morning everyone and welcome my name is Dawn Neil

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:14,099
is the volume okay so we will break with tradition and do

3
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:19,199
some lightly guided meditation most of it will be in silence but I'm just going

4
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:25,140
to offer a little bit of guidance to help us settle in and for the benefit

5
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,220
of our friends online

6
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,140
so the invitation is that wherever you are

7
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,800
wherever you've come from

8
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:53,059
to settle in and acknowledge where you are right now

9
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:06,860
scanning through noticing any energy that it took

10
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,200
to get here to sit down in meditation

11
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,240
and acknowledging too

12
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:29,299
the generosity or aspiration or intention

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,460
in your heart and mind that you're bringing to this meditation

14
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:46,640
feeling into that feeling it into your heart your body your heart mind

15
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,340
and taking in the goodness of whatever that is

16
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,620
and if you haven't already perhaps taking two or three slower maybe a

17
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,819
slightly deeper breaths

18
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,780
letting go on the exhale allowing

19
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:34,760
releasing releasing any excess energy your tension

20
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,280
and inviting in a sense of being nourished

21
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:50,239
nourished by your life's breath on the in-breath

22
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,980
and releasing any special way of breathing any controlled

23
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:13,920
kind of breath and allowing

24
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,900
allowing the breath to be natural

25
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,159
writing your belly hang Softly

26
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,420
and inviting the rhythm of breathing

27
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:42,379
to soften everywhere the sensations touch

28
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:02,780
sweeping through your body inviting a softening there to

29
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:13,579
balance of relaxation and alertness

30
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:35,660
and inviting an openness a kind internal gaze

31
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:43,580
to whatever arises in these moments of meditation

32
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,740
non-contention okay

33
00:04:52,740 --> 00:05:00,319
settling settling in on whatever object of attention

34
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,060
feels most soothing prominent steadying

35
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,660
for you

36
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,500
thank you

37
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,380
if something else arises in consciousness

38
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:16,940
flurry of thought to sound it's okay

39
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,940
acknowledging it noticing

40
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:28,580
this too is a moment of awareness mindfulness

41
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:39,319
and then return Ed to this moment now

42
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,840
the anchor of present moment awareness

43
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,180
thank you

foreign

56
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:46,200
taking a moment again to feel into

57
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:52,380
what this was like maybe with a tiny kind internal gaze

58
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:59,460
noticing whatever nourishment goodness benefit

59
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:06,440
even little tiny glimmers may have come in our time of practice together

60
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:13,460
and the invitation then is to turn that internal gaze outwards

61
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:20,040
advocating this time of practice to an intention

62
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:26,419
of goodness kindness towards the others in your life

63
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:32,240
may all beings benefit from our practice together

volunteers here who help make IMC happen and some quite a beautiful thing

77
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:18,060
so um this morning I want to talk about

78
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:26,700
some beneficial ways of moving through the world that both support and express maturity

79
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:32,099
of Buddhist practice or spiritual practice more broadly

80
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:37,500
and I'll do that through a series of of stories or vignettes we'll kind of tease

81
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:44,760
it out as we go along so knowing that's where we're going

82
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:51,180
Once Upon a Time imagine yourself back in Ancient India

83
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:56,339
North India the time of the Buddha more than 2600

84
00:36:56,339 --> 00:37:00,079
years ago it's the Bronze Age

85
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:07,920
the snow-tipped peaks of the Himalayan Mountains jut up against a pristine vast

86
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:14,700
sky planes and Rolling Hills it's an agrarian society and it's

87
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:21,900
heavily influenced by caste and as we zoom in on these little nation-states proto-nation states that

88
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:29,339
were evolving at this time the winds takes us to a country called

89
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:34,740
kosala it's a good country led by a benevolent

90
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:40,320
monarch king possanity and

91
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:46,140
his rule is proficient

92
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:50,420
skillful kind

93
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:59,460
Sula is among many many different protonation states at that time that are kind of jockeying for power or a place

94
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:05,760
in ancient North India and at the time of which I speak a

95
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:14,099
neighboring king the king of a country called magada decides to unprovoked attack

96
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:20,460
the good Kingdom of kosova so suddenly kosova finds itself at War

97
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:26,099
and so far in this story we're more or less in the realm of historical fact

98
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:31,619
all of this happened commentaries on the ancient Buddhist

99
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:38,820
teachings commentaries I relate to more as ancient myths with all the embellishments and

100
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:45,119
the wisdom that myths have they have stories about this time

101
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:50,460
and one of these stories is of a peasant girl young woman

102
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:56,640
the daughter of two flower Growers and her name in English is Jasmine or

103
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,980
Jasmine bud and she like pretty much all kids back then in

104
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:08,640
agrarian societies helped her parents out with the flower growing business

105
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:15,720
in one day she's walking to the field for a day of work Gathering flowers and she has her

106
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:23,280
whole days worth of meals with her all three meals in her basket and as it happens on that particular day

107
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:29,700
she encounters a group of wandering mendicant monks on her way to her work

108
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:37,140
and the leader of these monks is so Sublime so radiant has so much presence

109
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:42,359
and kindness that she spontaneously

110
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:49,760
kneels down bows and offers all of her own food for the day into his bowl

111
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:56,220
and the Buddha but that's who it was Smiles at her and she goes on her way and he goes on

112
00:39:56,220 --> 00:40:02,520
his way when she arrives and starts Gathering the flowers for the day she just has

113
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:09,839
this joy in her from her generosity from the encounter with this radiant Sage and

114
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:15,780
she's filled with this sense of confidence and joy and it kind of just bubbles out of her and she sings as she

115
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:20,420
works and she gathers the flowers

116
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:27,960
well later that morning later that day the good King posanity was returning to

117
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:34,260
the Capitol from a battle that did not go well tough day

118
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:39,720
and he's riding his horse along the road and he hears Jasmine her poly name is

119
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:47,220
Malika singing and intrigued perhaps pleasantly distracted he rides

120
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:54,720
his horse over to where she is in the fields well filled with that confidence that

121
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:00,960
joy that happiness Malika doesn't do what a normal

122
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:08,160
low-caste peasant would do when a king approaches she doesn't hide she doesn't bow down she doesn't have her eyes Down

123
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:15,660
cast but instead as he approaches she smiles and as his horse comes to a stop right

124
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:22,920
next to her she looks up into his eyes gently grabs the horse's reins and smiles at him

125
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:29,599
and he is transfixed absolutely stunned

126
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:36,420
first words out of his mouth when their eyes matters are you married

127
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:42,060
no sir no Lord I'm not and at that he Dismounts

128
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:48,300
and as The Story Goes he started to confide in her all of the tribulations

129
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:54,359
all of the troubles his concerned for his troops his country his people

130
00:41:54,359 --> 00:42:00,720
confiding in her eventually they sit beneath a tree in her heads and his head is in her lap and she's stroking his

131
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:07,320
hair and consoling him well after some time the king is

132
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:12,960
consoled it's a touching scene right and he rises

133
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:19,980
up and he asks her would you please accompany me on my horse and she agrees so he lifts her up on the

134
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:27,660
horse gets up and together they ride to her parents house where he asks for her hand in marriage

135
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:33,180
isn't that a sweet Cinderella Story right

136
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:38,240
so that is how Malika Jasmine became

137
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:45,660
possanity's first and most beloved Queen she wasn't perfect but she was valued by

138
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:52,800
her King and her country for her compassion her strength her wisdom

139
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:59,520
and above all her concern for all people of all casts

140
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:04,800
her care and compassion for her common the common people

141
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,700
and her lack of any pretentiousness snobbery

142
00:43:11,819 --> 00:43:18,420
so let's pause for a minute and I want to just tease out some of the themes of this story so far

143
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:25,920
so Malika's actions the spontaneous generosity she let herself really feel the joy of

144
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:34,380
that the joy of that giving right and that in turn led to a confidence as

145
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:43,200
she reflected on absorbed her good actions joy and confidence and self-respect

146
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,560
went a long way towards the interaction with this King

147
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:57,420
all of these all of these traits Joy generosity which is the laypersons

148
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:03,060
letting go right some release a giving up

149
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:09,119
the confidence the trust all of these are really beautiful mental

150
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:14,339
qualities internal attitudes to turn back around and bring

151
00:44:14,339 --> 00:44:17,839
to our own meditation practice

152
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:26,819
it's helpful to learn to celebrate or at least acknowledge our own good qualities

153
00:44:26,819 --> 00:44:34,020
our own good actions in particular this feeds nourishes the relationship we

154
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:38,660
have with ourselves and with our practice

155
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:48,839
this doesn't have to be anything complicated if you're like well no I haven't done anything good it can be as

156
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:55,980
simple as the aspiration to suffer less to sit down to practice to develop the

157
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:59,838
mind and the Heart through meditation

158
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:08,280
it can also be as simple as a single act of generosity

159
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:14,660
through your day or your week an act of kindness or a stranger

160
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:20,880
sort of a modern modern anecdote from science about this there's a scientific

161
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:26,579
researcher that has done a couple of studies on the effect of kindness and

162
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:31,740
generosity on The Giver and one of these I think it was his first

163
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:37,800
the study participants were recruited at an ice skating rink so it's cold right

164
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:44,339
I'm not sure if it was indoor or outdoor but they keep those places cold and their task if you can call it that

165
00:45:44,339 --> 00:45:50,119
was to give away free hot chocolate to total strangers

166
00:45:50,339 --> 00:45:56,780
and they followed up both with the study participants and with the total strangers receiving the hot chocolate

167
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:02,400
and some interesting things were learned first

168
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:07,680
the study participants had no idea how good it would make them feel

169
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:12,839
to do this not just in the moment but through their whole day

170
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:19,440
and they also underestimated how good it made the recipients feel

171
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:25,200
not just the Boost in the moment of receiving the sweet treat but the warmth

172
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:31,920
and the kindness of being thought of at all being offered anything at all rippled through their day too

173
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:38,480
and it turns out it made them more likely to be kind and generous

174
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:44,460
so everyone underestimated the power

175
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:48,440
of the kindness and the generosity

176
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:55,380
so that kind of uplifting warm effect on

177
00:46:55,380 --> 00:47:02,220
ourselves and others can be nourishing nourishing to relationships nourishing

178
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:07,859
to practice all right now I'm at act two of the

179
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:16,260
story of Queen Malika and King posanity and in this scene

180
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:22,980
the king and his young fairly new beautiful queen are up on the castle between two parapets they're on some

181
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:28,260
kind of porch or duck type thing and they're looking out it's a glorious

182
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:37,500
Sunset and they're looking out at the Horizon the mountains etched against the sky the Dusky Indigo Villages and Fields

183
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:42,720
and it's kind of a touching scene

184
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:49,920
the king turns to his wife and asks in all the world Malacca

185
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:55,079
and all the world wife Who Do You Love most

186
00:47:55,079 --> 00:48:02,160
who do you hold most dear and

187
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:08,099
commentaries some of them say that pasanati pasanity expected his

188
00:48:08,099 --> 00:48:13,819
wife to answer that it was him and the ancient commentaries opined that

189
00:48:13,819 --> 00:48:19,500
it was because he would have thought that because he lifted her out of poverty to the most powerful position a

190
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:25,440
woman could possibly have in that day and I think of it as more of a maybe a

191
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:30,660
tender vulnerable moment Between Two Lovers husband and wife spouses

192
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:36,000
one feeling may be a little shaky and insecure and turning to the other

193
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:43,440
and asking about their affections in any case the moment stretches on and

194
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:51,060
the silence thickens and Malika finally answers holding both of

195
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:57,359
her hands and his his hands and hers sorry their hands are clasped and she

196
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:05,880
looked straight into his eyes again with all that love and wisdom and says my Lord

197
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:11,280
it is myself I hold most dear

198
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:18,260
oh wait a minute that's not how a love story usually goes is it so much

199
00:49:18,359 --> 00:49:24,660
well he was taken aback too in that moment maybe a little hurt

200
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:31,339
surprised but they hang in there and they stay in the conversation together

201
00:49:32,339 --> 00:49:37,920
and with her luminous eyes her hands still

202
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:43,740
on his she looks up and says my Lord truly

203
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:48,140
Who Do You Love most in this world

204
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:57,420
as happens often between them and these ancient stories her words really give him pause and

205
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:02,460
after some moments of Silent reflection pasaynadi turns back

206
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:08,819
his eyes to hers and still holding hands he admits I do hold myself

207
00:50:08,819 --> 00:50:11,900
most dear

208
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:21,720
so I suppose there are people listening who might think of this as a somewhat selfish exchange a cautious admission

209
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:29,400
between two of the most wealthy and powerful people of their day but I don't see it that way

210
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:36,599
instead though it's impossible to know with ancient India Millennia between now and

211
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:42,540
then what all the cultural resonance was what the cultural context was we can't know

212
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:48,660
that but from where I sit in Northern California

213
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:55,559
two plus Millennia later there's a modern psychological perspective to bring that her love for

214
00:50:55,559 --> 00:51:01,740
herself her regard for herself could be the Wellspring from which the

215
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:07,559
love for her partner flows and for that matter for anyone else

216
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:14,640
and she has the Integrity to say that and encourage and be able to hear her

217
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,859
partner and his perspective too

218
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:27,500
that kind of mutual honesty reads this courage and integrity to

219
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:35,760
and that kind of honesty that positive self-regard those are also very powerful

220
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:42,619
bases for any relationship to others to ourselves and to our practice

221
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:50,400
King vicinity though like this really was on his mind he journeyed a little ways to go see the Buddha

222
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:55,500
consult the wisest Sage he knows the teacher to which his wife has entrusted

223
00:51:55,500 --> 00:52:02,160
her spiritual life and he relates the conversation and asks the Buddha about it

224
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:07,700
and the Buddhist Age We nods and affirms that what Malika has said is indeed wise

225
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:12,800
and true and then the Buddha

226
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:19,559
unpacks the significance of what Malacca has said and he talks about how

227
00:52:19,559 --> 00:52:25,200
searching all directions with your awareness

228
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:32,339
you won't find anyone anyone dearer or more Central to your

229
00:52:32,339 --> 00:52:38,760
life than yourself and it's the same way for others too

230
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:45,059
each person holds themselves as the reference point holds themselves

231
00:52:45,059 --> 00:52:51,720
as most dear and the Buddha is teaching about this whether or not we agree with this

232
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:57,660
presumption in our contemporary Society is that anyone who loves themselves

233
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:06,020
anyone who cares for their own life shouldn't hurt others should practice non-harming

234
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:13,680
so self-love is assumed in early Buddhist teachings and it's taught

235
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:18,900
as the initial basis from which to cultivate love kindness non-harming

236
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:24,740
towards all and

237
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:30,300
for some of us this is challenging this is a challenging assumption

238
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:36,240
for many people raised in contemporary culture so

239
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:43,380
another way of understanding it I touched on as I'm named his teachings which is to notice that for most of us

240
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:50,160
most of the time ourselves our perspective is the most Central and

241
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:55,200
primary even if we absolutely love and sacrifice

242
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:02,880
for our kids or our partner or the people we care for there is that Central reference point of

243
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:10,559
self and seeing this being honest about it helps develop

244
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:17,579
perspectival empathy Compassion Care a true understanding and respect for

245
00:54:17,579 --> 00:54:23,040
other people based on the notion that they too have this Center Point from which

246
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:28,339
they're living their lives all sentient beings do

247
00:54:29,579 --> 00:54:35,839
this is a basis for non-harming

248
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:44,940
at its most mature it's an alternate way of understanding this notion of Buddhist

249
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:51,059
conceit many of you have heard of this idea of being better than or greater than less

250
00:54:51,059 --> 00:54:58,339
than or worse than or even equal to this is um

251
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:04,980
one of the last Fetters one of the last kind of Bindings that hold people back

252
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:11,940
from waking up and instead of that greater than less than or equal to

253
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:18,000
this teaching encourages a sense of wow

254
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:24,660
we're incomparable we're unique each person each life is precious to

255
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:29,819
itself and

256
00:55:29,819 --> 00:55:36,558
common to commonly bound together by the wish for happiness

257
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:43,440
so when the self is no longer at the center of things

258
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:49,800
wisdom arises and when wisdom arises especially in relation to others

259
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:54,839
kindness and compassion naturally flow

260
00:55:54,839 --> 00:55:59,540
in a field of responsive equanimity

261
00:56:00,059 --> 00:56:05,460
and this brings us to the third and final vignette in the story of posneri

262
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:12,660
and his wife Malika there's one night maybe this was some

263
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:18,660
time later where the king had a series of many disturbing dreams 16 disturbing

264
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:27,119
dreams in all there were these visceral kind of nightmares that sound totally real and in them he heard the moans and

265
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:32,400
cries of suffering people but they're they were in kohaid he

266
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:37,440
couldn't make out what they were saying just a syllable here and a syllable there

267
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:43,859
he woke up in the morning perturbed really shaken and began to reach out and

268
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:49,099
consult some brahmana priests who happened to be nearby

269
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:54,420
these Brahmin priests interpreted his dream for him and they interpreted it as

270
00:56:54,420 --> 00:57:00,559
a Calamity a massive catastrophe was coming to the realm

271
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:07,980
wow hassanity was shaken by that too and the brahmanas assured him that a large-scale

272
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:13,140
sacrifice would prevent this horrible event or series of events

273
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:19,200
from happening so somewhat reluctantly but wanting to do the best

274
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:26,520
for his people he agreed and it was a large sale sacrifice not just of animals but for efficacy they

275
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:33,119
were supposed to involve four human beings too innocent human beings

276
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:39,000
so Malika I'm not sure if she'd been away or whatnot but she hadn't been involved or around

277
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:45,180
and she returned to the castle to see all this activity with all these brahmanas preparing for this thing

278
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:51,960
Gathering of animals and people and digging of pits and all this and she goes to her husband and says

279
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:59,700
Dear what's going on what's happening and he explains and moved by compassion

280
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:05,040
as well as perhaps some wisdom she tries to persuade him to call off

281
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:11,160
the sacrifice and he's reluctant he doesn't want to kill and he also doesn't want to harm

282
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:17,099
his realm but she does persuade him to go see the Buddha at some distance so he

283
00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:24,000
Journeys to go see the Buddha and ask for his interpretation of the dream

284
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,579
and the Buddha's interpretation is ethically based

285
00:58:29,579 --> 00:58:36,180
ethically based it um includes

286
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:43,559
the Buddhist acknowledgment of the king's sensitivity of his concern for his realm but puts an ethical lens on

287
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:50,640
the whole dream and pasta Nady is so moved by this that he becomes a

288
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:56,160
follower of the Buddha on the spot and when he comes home he agrees to

289
00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:01,460
Malik as a wish for non-harming and calls off the sacrifice

290
00:59:01,619 --> 00:59:09,599
many lives saved even after they both became followers of

291
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:15,299
the Buddha the king and queen supported many different religious sects many

292
00:59:15,299 --> 00:59:20,940
different kinds of Faith followers and in a

293
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:26,760
gesture of generosity I it was not long after this they dedicated a park

294
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:32,280
in their realm to the Buddha and his followers and in that Park Queen Malika

295
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:38,040
had a Hall built and this Hall was for the purpose of interfaith and

296
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:43,799
inter-religious dialogue peace building tolerance

297
00:59:43,799 --> 00:59:47,420
so they were big supporters

298
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:56,460
so themes here the concern for well-being of others

299
00:59:56,460 --> 01:00:02,819
but when that is dominated by reactivity it can lead to interpretations that

300
01:00:02,819 --> 01:00:09,920
aren't necessarily so helpful or leaning outwards for knowledge in ways that aren't helpful

301
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:15,299
Malika's compassion and wish for non-harming broadly

302
01:00:15,299 --> 01:00:23,160
non-harming and then not arising from reactivity the

303
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:29,339
wise person perhaps in this story the Buddha with concern

304
01:00:29,339 --> 01:00:35,760
what's best for oneself others self and others and all concerned

305
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:41,040
everyone and this is the definition of wisdom one of the definitions of wisdom in the

306
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,760
ancient teachings

307
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:52,619
so to summarize so far the traits behaviors exhibited evoked in these

308
01:00:52,619 --> 01:00:58,559
stories could be described of as practices belonging to the Buddhist sort

309
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:04,440
of Developmental basket if you will of Sila ethical ways of moving through the world

310
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:11,299
concern for other people these include the joy of generosity

311
01:01:11,299 --> 01:01:16,440
laypersons letting go confidence and self-respect

312
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:21,480
that come from appreciating our own good actions

313
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:30,359
Trust kindness positive self-regard or self-love

314
01:01:30,359 --> 01:01:36,299
honesty and compassionate regard for others

315
01:01:36,299 --> 01:01:39,299
non-harming

316
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:48,180
so all of these all of these are also deeply beneficial ways to relate

317
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:54,540
to one's own mind and heart and practice some of them will be more accessible at

318
01:01:54,540 --> 01:02:00,059
times than others and even just the wish for them is a helpful

319
01:02:00,059 --> 01:02:04,520
energy to start to bring to the practice

320
01:02:07,559 --> 01:02:12,599
so here I'll transition because

321
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:18,859
we're moving now into talking a little bit about meditation the samadhi basket

322
01:02:18,859 --> 01:02:26,400
in the Buddhist developmental schema meditation basket of produce

323
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:31,500
and there's a famous discourse many of you have heard of this

324
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:37,260
the acrobat discourse a master acrobat and his Apprentice

325
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:44,040
whose poly name translate to as frying pan of all things so it's a little bit of a playful story

326
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:49,740
and it's got a lot of Truth in it so in Ancient India acrobats these

327
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:55,920
acrobats in a way used bamboo poles to do their tricks and the deal was that

328
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:01,920
one acrobat would be on the ground standing or walking around doing their thing and they would balance the pole

329
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:07,859
either on their forehead or on their sternum and the other acrobat

330
01:03:07,859 --> 01:03:12,900
their job was to be on top of the pole doing their trick

331
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:20,280
so it's quite a precarious Act of balancing right so the master being the more experienced

332
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:26,940
was in charge of sort of holding the polls steady and right before their trick he says to

333
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:32,720
his Apprentice my dear frying pan

334
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:38,220
here's how we're going to do this I'll look after you and you look after

335
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:46,680
me and that way will perform our tricks safely get finish up and collect our fee

336
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:51,960
and The Apprentice considers this for a moment and despite being younger less

337
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:58,980
experienced and a woman in that Society she says I don't think that's the best

338
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:05,040
way to go I need to look after my own balance and

339
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:11,099
you need to look after your own balance and that way we will both be safe

340
01:04:11,099 --> 01:04:16,680
perform our trick and collect our money well

341
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:22,799
they did they were safe they collected their money and at some point the Buddha heard about the story

342
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:29,839
and the first thing he said was that you know The Apprentice is right

343
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:36,540
mindfulness is a way of looking to our own balance looking to our own heart and

344
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:42,960
mind and life and body that not only helps us move through the

345
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:49,500
world in a way that is more harmonious for ourselves but it also protects others

346
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:54,780
protects others from us and

347
01:04:54,780 --> 01:05:00,720
the master was right too the concern the loving concerned regard

348
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:06,180
for others that expresses as ethical comportment Selah

349
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:13,099
that is a way that we take care of each other so they're both right

350
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:20,520
and together these are powerful ways to move through the world that support a deepening of meditation

351
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:26,040
and they can blend together blend together

352
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:32,819
so one last short anecdote the Buddha is often depicted in these

353
01:05:32,819 --> 01:05:39,059
ancient teachings as traveling from place to place often from one group of monks to another

354
01:05:39,059 --> 01:05:45,780
and a group that turns up particularly often is a group with a famous monk

355
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:51,720
named anaruda and this particular group is a joy to

356
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:57,780
visit talks that suit us talk about how pleasant they are to be around they're

357
01:05:57,780 --> 01:06:03,599
described as being like milk and water Blended harmonious viewing each other

358
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:09,900
with kindly eyes wow

359
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:15,180
the group of people living that way they were enacting it becomes clear I'm not

360
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:23,460
going to read this retort recite it but that they are holding themselves in mindfulness and looking out after each

361
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:29,880
other and this enables the harmony to happen they're supporting each other with and

362
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:36,960
I'm quoting here mental verbal and bodily Acts of kindness

363
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:42,059
when these conditions are in place it's possible to go with the flow pretty easily right

364
01:06:42,059 --> 01:06:47,780
and this kind of restraint consideration

365
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:53,400
non-contention lends itself to cohesive Community whether home or work or

366
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:59,280
neighborhood and turning inwards

367
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:05,420
it lends itself to deepening of the meditation practice

368
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:12,240
now getting there isn't always seamless I would say it's not seamless for any of

369
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:18,539
us it's helpful sometimes to consult a teacher in the Buddha when he was traveling was indeed the Consulting

370
01:07:18,539 --> 01:07:25,140
teacher that this group talked to it's also helpful to consult the teacher

371
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:32,339
Within your own heart take time metabolize

372
01:07:32,339 --> 01:07:38,700
turn inward to meet everything that's unfolding The Good the Bad the Ugly

373
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:45,000
patients kindness a kindly gaze of curiosity

374
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:51,920
interest with that kind of internal gaze

375
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:58,640
internal weather our systems naturally move towards most often wholeness

376
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:04,980
integration healing and Awakening

377
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:10,980
discernment will develop and eventually this inner congruent

378
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:16,318
discernment and letting go ripen into deeper levels of spiritual

379
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:23,000
maturity wisdom and unfold towards Awakening itself

380
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:32,178
so those are my thoughts thank you very much for your kind attention

381
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:42,000
we have about 10 minutes for questions comments if anyone would like

382
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:49,460
to offer them I think it's easiest for all concerned if you use the microphone if you have any

383
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:56,338
Floors open and if you're comfortable saying your

384
01:08:56,339 --> 01:09:01,859
name that would be great sure hi first name yeah my name is salsa

385
01:09:01,859 --> 01:09:08,100
uh I just wanted to point out Malika does not mean Jasmine it means Queen so

386
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:15,060
her name already meant Queen and she got the title okay thank you and the poly English

387
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:21,000
dictionary gives Jasmine Bud as one of the definitions of Malika or Malika of

388
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:26,278
Malika m-a-l-l-i-k-a yeah yeah so it's in the

389
01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:31,580
poly English dictionary I'm from Nepal like that's my name is

390
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:36,960
not Nepali yeah yeah it evolved right so I'm sure Malika came to me and queen

391
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:44,338
probably because of her or maybe not but these myths conflate and blend names

392
01:09:44,339 --> 01:09:51,060
like that so but it is um thank you for that I had not seen Queen in the dictionary but in

393
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:57,420
the poly dictionary p-a-l-i not Nepali one of the meanings this flower jasmine

394
01:09:57,420 --> 01:10:03,860
but appreciate it any other comments

395
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:17,880
hi I'm Soul um I'm kind of new to Buddhism and I really loved all your story it was very

396
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:23,460
touching so I'm just wondering like if there is a good introductory book that I

397
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:29,520
could find and read more about it to find out more of our stories like the

398
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:36,300
ones that you told um so most of the introductory books don't have those stories in them but

399
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:41,580
they have more of the principles and the ways of practice in them are you more

400
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:49,440
interested in the stories or learning about sort of the principles and the practice maybe both both okay fair enough

401
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:56,640
so um a great place to start with the practice is a dhamma Donna book a freely

402
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:04,199
offered book that's here which is called the issue at hand it's a series of short essays that kind of unpack the practice

403
01:11:04,199 --> 01:11:11,760
in a really relatable way um they're by Gil franstall and then

404
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:17,219
another good practice book of which there are many is mindfulness and plain English

405
01:11:17,219 --> 01:11:23,580
by Bonte gunaratna and that is in the library on the other side of this wall here you're welcome to check it out if

406
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:28,800
you want to and then as far as the stories go the

407
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:35,159
stories that I conveyed in in this talk are all in an anthology that was

408
01:11:35,159 --> 01:11:43,980
translated by a man named bikubody a very famous and revered translator Monk and it's called

409
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:51,000
something like great Disciples of the Buddha maybe some places to start thank you

410
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:56,340
thank you any other thoughts quibbles questions

411
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:59,300

412
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:19,340
okay in that case I have an invitation for you those of you who are interested

413
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:24,900
um we have about seven minutes left of uh formal morning program and I'll stay

414
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:32,340

415
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:39,239
meanwhile the invitation is to turn to two people near you and welcome them here even if it's your

416
