1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:06,960
so hello everyone who is here today with the youtube and

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,880
listening maybe into the future as well

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,920
and then some ways we span

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,560
geography across the globe and we also spend time into the future with how these

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:32,800
recordings work it's kind of an amazing thing that we share and feel a connection to so much

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:42,640
there are some maybe some of you have heard me say many times i like to divide our experience of life

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,079
what goes on in our with our life moment by moment into two

8
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:54,719
areas there is what is happening and there is how we are with what is

9
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:02,559
happening or our relationship to what's happening and mindfulness practice i put in the

10
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:11,280
lighter camp mindfulness is a practice of showing up and being attentive to what is happening

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,200
and to engage in mindfulness with equanimity

12
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:24,000
has the function of um staying with the mindfulness staying

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,680
with a relaxed dedicated sincere attention to this moment attention to

14
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:36,240
nexus being present being available for the flow of the present moment as it keeps

15
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:43,040
appearing and arising for us moment by moment and and one thing that helps to have

16
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,520
equanimity to just stay present stay with the mindfulness moment by moment

17
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:56,640
is to not think that you are unique that uh not think that your that

18
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,960
but your experiences is unique enough that it's an exception to

19
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,959
what humans experience not to dismiss what you have what's happening to you or make

20
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:16,319
it not to make it kind of unimportant everything is important you're important

21
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:23,520
but what's also important is the steadiness of how we are the steadiness of mindfulness

22
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,959
when we're practicing mindfulness to not it's kind of like we have the bumper sticker that says

23
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:36,879
um i stop for nothing when i practice mindfulness meaning i don't get involved and get entangled and start

24
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:42,160
thinking about things and just a bear recognition oh this is what's happening now

25
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,640
this is what's happening and or available to experience this is what's experiencing this is what's known now

26
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,319
this is what's being experienced now just steady steady steady

27
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:02,159
like when i went on a walking pilgrimage a good number of years ago and it was only two weeks but

28
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:08,400
the idea was just keep walking when we walked just keep walking and walking and walking

29
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:15,840
didn't matter what the ex experience around us was just you walk and you walk so we

30
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,120
are mindful we're aware we're aware with equanimity that allows us to just

31
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,959
continue without getting sidetracked without getting stopping for something and getting

32
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:33,519
entangled and retro retrospective thinking so

33
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,720
to begin this pilgrimage of mindfulness

34
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:47,200
pilgrimage where we don't we don't walk we sit

35
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:55,519
we remain stationary in a stationary posture that works for you

36
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:06,000
and to tenderly close your eyes

37
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:15,840
and maybe tenderly in your heart open to yourself

38
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,919
closing your eyes and opening your heart

39
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:32,560
and taking a few moments to appreciate yourself and value yourself

40
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:41,040
that perhaps that is why we're meditating because we value our well-being

41
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:47,840
and this is a way of finding a valuable important form of

42
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:56,000
well-being happiness freedom from suffering

43
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,720
to take a few long slow deep breaths

44
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:11,919
and exhales really settling in here with yourself in yourself

45
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:18,800
for yourself here in this body

46
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,840
here in this heart

47
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:38,000
here in this belly

48
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,400
and then to let your breathing return to normal

49
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:55,280
and because of maybe with a sense of self-care self-appreciation

50
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:04,160
to as you exhale to continue to relax what can be relaxed in your body

51
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:21,840
face shoulders stomach belly

52
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,800
and then letting then settling in just to your breathing

53
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,560
no walking pilgrimage it's the feet that walk

54
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,160
it is a stationary pilgrimage of meditation

55
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:17,840
can you it's your breathing breathing in and breathing out

56
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:26,639
and to have the simplicity of breathing be something that we

57
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,039
allow to come into our awareness

58
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,440
a simple sea of breathing is where awareness lands

59
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:45,519
two metaphors for awareness awareness which receives allows

60
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:53,200
awareness which lands connects whichever is

61
00:08:53,200 --> 00:09:01,440
most useful for you and then with equanimity

62
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,959
that doesn't get alarmed or caught up or annoyed or

63
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:14,000
think that something is unique and not part of the practice

64
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,839
everything is part of practice everything is for the next moment of

65
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:27,519
awareness to trust it's enough

66
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:35,440
just to be aware to trust to just take the next moment

67
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:41,440
for what it is even if it's very similar to the previous one

68
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:50,959
just stay stay

69
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:58,640
the equanimity that allows a steady continuation of the practice

70
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:09,760
come back to that continuity and if things are challenging

71
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,760
breathe with it so that your awareness

72
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,760
rides on the currents of breathing

73
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:33,839
relaxed available present for the experience without getting entangled

74
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:31,519
as you meditate nothing is extraordinary enough

75
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:40,160
to stop to think about or get involved in everything is ordinary enough

76
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,199
it is just one more thing to be aware of to be mindful of

77
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:52,880
in a steady ongoing receptivity of awareness to what is one breath

78
00:16:52,880 --> 00:17:05,839
at a time

79
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,960
and then as we come to the end of this

80
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:56,720
sitting to tenderly calmly

81
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:03,520
open up to the sufferings of the world

82
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,000
and to do so equanimously

83
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,039
meaning that we care

84
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,960
we feel for the suffering we're concerned with it

85
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:29,039
and there's no need to give up this steadiness of our mindfulness

86
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:38,000
steadiness and confidence in remaining rooted in awareness

87
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:48,240
so that we don't get pulled into our reactivity our thinking our predictions

88
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,360
our sense of obligations and should and what shouldn't be

89
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,840
in equanimity it allows us to stay open

90
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:07,279
so that care and good will respect and kindness

91
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:14,880
can flow through that awareness through the field of mindfulness

92
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:25,360
and may it be that as we learn how to be more aware and mindfulness

93
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:32,000
more mindful with equanimity with calm with balance

94
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:38,720
may it be that we can show up for the challenges of this world

95
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:46,240
and stay close to our goodwill well-wishing kindness friendliness

96
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:52,799
compassion may all beings

97
00:29:52,960 --> 00:30:01,039
be happy may all beings be safe

98
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,480
peaceful and free

99
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,840
and may my heart and mind

100
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,000
have this good will this well wishing for others

101
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,320
so that in some way or other it spreads from me spreads from each of us

102
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,639
into the world that we encounter today

103
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,519
may our love and compassion

104
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,399
spread from this meditation session out into our communities and out into

105
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:51,840
the world may all beings be happy

106
00:30:53,410 --> 00:31:03,730
[Music]

107
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:53,919
so today is the part two of the equanimity factor of awakening

108
00:31:53,919 --> 00:32:00,240
and um you know it's also part of this series

109
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,519
on mindfulness of breathing which the buddha presented a little bit like a path

110
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:11,120
that as we stay present for our breath that we're cultivating and deepening the

111
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:20,640
meditation practice um with a deep relaxation of the body a deep relaxation of the mind until

112
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,840
we're not just focused on the details of our life the particular activities of the body

113
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:31,440
or the mind but we start becoming aware of the mind state the state of mind the

114
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,799
quality of our mind the feeling of kind of the gestalt or

115
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:42,640
the wholeness of awareness that can just be here holding it all

116
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:48,559
and it's a fairly you know mature place in meditation that we might fall

117
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:53,760
into occasionally where the the the mind state is more salient

118
00:32:53,760 --> 00:33:00,720
more prominent than the particular details of what's happening in our body or the details what's happening in our mind

119
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:07,679
all of these all of the all of the above are important but to be more holistic

120
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:14,240
in the practice to some point to get a sense of that the whole the mind as a whole the mood mind state

121
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:20,880
that we have and those mind states have various characteristics uh when we get more and more settled

122
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:27,519
when the mind feels more whole or expansive or clear the greater clarity and mindfulness

123
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:32,799
and the seven factors awakening are part of that and the last one equanimity is part that

124
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:38,480
when the mind when we're really stable in a strong awareness with a strong

125
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:44,000
sense of being aware in this in our mind state a healthy wholesome mind state

126
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:51,519
it tends to come with a strong sense of equanimity and equanimity being very simply not

127
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:57,519
getting caught in the reactivity of the mind of being for and against things and

128
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:02,799
um and it's a wonderful uh capacity we still might be for and

129
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:07,840
against things might have those thoughts or impulses a little bit but equanimity we

130
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:14,158
just simply don't pick it up we don't get involved they just pass through they're just fleeting kind of impulses of the moment

131
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:20,398
that come and they go and and we don't we don't pick it up we don't get involved

132
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:25,679
and it can lead to a tremendous social good

133
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:31,839
because when we don't respond socially into the world by our

134
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:38,480
reactivity by the quick impulses of being foreign against things then uh we're more likely to be

135
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:45,118
impartial in a really healthy understanding of impartiality where we

136
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:50,560
treat everyone equally or we don't treat people through the filter of

137
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,679
our desires and our aversions kind of leaning into and wanting or pulling back because we don't want or

138
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:01,200
something we don't so easily get pulled into our preferences

139
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:07,520
and so a sense of justice a sense of impartiality sense of being someone who's safe for other people

140
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:13,040
um becomes more and more more stronger the the more we have this equanimity

141
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:18,560
this ability to not get caught up in our reactivity or or these impulses of being foreign

142
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:24,320
against all kinds of things there might still be wise being foreign against things

143
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:29,680
but that wisdom builds on equanimity on being stable and settled is not

144
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:36,960
impulsive there's a clarity and a wholesomeness in how we respond to the world so

145
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,320
equanimity is both something for deep meditation and for

146
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:48,800
everyday life it's a really a great boon for life in deeper and

147
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:54,640
deeper meditation um that's some place where some people can really feel

148
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:00,079
this state of equanimity in a very powerful way that gives us a feeling for it and then

149
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:07,599
a support of what it's like to bring that into our daily life but in the anapanasati process it's very

150
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:13,520
much the reference point for it is in meditation and so in meditation

151
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:19,839
the equanimity is what allows the mindfulness to be uninterrupted to just stay in the

152
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:25,200
flow of awareness here here and we don't find ourselves drifting off in thought and coming back

153
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:31,280
to three minutes later we don't find ourselves getting caught and preoccupied by what's

154
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:37,040
happening now we might be very attentive to what's happening but we're not caught by it

155
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:43,920
and so the steadiness of mindfulness it just kills the course holds the course keeps walking keeps

156
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:52,000
engaging step by step equanimity sort of allows that steadiness and continuity of awareness

157
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,760
and equanimity that upekka as i said yesterday has a lot to do with

158
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:04,400
wisdom so having an overview of the situation and it's not a wisdom that's acquired knowledge that we bring with us

159
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:12,320
and apply but rather something that we deeply understand as we go along and there's a variety of things one can

160
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,359
be that it's not worthwhile getting being reactive it's not being worthwhile being

161
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:23,760
caught up in in thoughts or thought up in our reactivity it's just not valuable for us and we can feel that and sense

162
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:29,040
that directly the other is that we can have a clear

163
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:37,359
sense feeling for the impermanence of phenomena the inconstancy of how things come and go and change and

164
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:43,280
to really understand that means we don't then relate to things as if they're going to be there forever

165
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:48,560
or if they're you know something that's fixed that has to be fixed something fixed that has to

166
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:54,560
be fixed and uh and so having a clear sense oh this is impermanent this is change as

167
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:00,720
well can let us set back and just be willing just be present be aware

168
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:08,240
the wisdom of not taking all these things personally that i'm not unique that my experience is not unique that

169
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:15,200
many people have meditation probably all the experiences we've had in one way or the other others have had as well and it's one of

170
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:20,640
the primary roles of sometimes of a meditation teacher is to normalize

171
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:26,560
people's experiences and for the most part to normalize just make it ordinary it's

172
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:33,119
okay it's just part of the process so we can keep coming back to the equanimous mindfulness steady

173
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:38,640
mindfulness that doesn't get perturbed or agitated by no matter what is happening no matter the

174
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:44,400
fear or the pain or the suffering or the experiencing and meditation it's all

175
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:51,040
normalized in a certain way so not taking it personally is one of those ways

176
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:57,119
and so there's a variety of kind of wisdoms that come into play that's really supports this ability

177
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:03,599
to stay equanimous balanced unagitated in our experience the

178
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:09,040
but also this equanimity comes from a sense of balance and balance has something to do with

179
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:14,720
inner strength to be cultivate when there's a strength of mindfulness a strength of

180
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:22,160
concentration strength of stability then it's kind of like we have

181
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:29,760
a a you know a stability we have a

182
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:36,560
something that holds us down keeps us grounded allows us to withstand the winds of the

183
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:41,680
mind the winds of change and things that come and go and to develop

184
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:47,680
that strength by the continuity of meditation meditating maybe almost every day and regularly and

185
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:54,000
developing this the mind is an instrument that can be developed and strengthened and trained

186
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,200
and um not everyone develops their mind everyone trains their mind to be a

187
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:05,520
strong um be strong and part of what ongoing regular meditation practice is

188
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:13,200
about is not just showing up and being mindful of stuff and accepting of stuff but also developing an inner strength

189
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:19,920
a capacity to let go a capacity to really stay present and be steady with experience and not

190
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:25,280
wander off in all kinds of things a a strength of concentration

191
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:31,920
as strength or even joy so as we get stronger and stronger we're

192
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:38,640
not buffeted so much by the winds of change the winds of what goes on and so we're more able to kind of hold

193
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:45,280
the course and hold the course and so as the uh as the ninth step

194
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:52,880
of this mindfulness of the mind is to um start

195
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:59,039
experiencing and sensing that we have this amazing resource this amazing

196
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:07,599
thing called chitta called mind that we want to care for that's a reference point for

197
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:16,400
a well-being a wholeness that any kind of suffering we have is a subset of and so when the mind is

198
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:21,920
really spacious and open expansive present we're aware of the cheetah in a more

199
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:30,319
bigger way it's much harder to take our greeds or attachments or lusts or addictions or

200
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:37,760
hates hostilities regrets resentments our fears as being all there is

201
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:44,640
they all become a piece of the puzzle they're not the whole puzzle the whole puzzle feels more like the

202
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:52,079
mind that can be aware of it all and and there's a lot can be uh

203
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:58,960
feeling of great goodness great rightness great kind of in that kind of sense of a

204
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:07,119
mind or this inner life which is whole and and so whether it's completely whole

205
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:14,560
or feels completely kind of as satisfying as i'm saying here that keeps coming now as we continue the

206
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:20,880
practice of sati step 10 is gladdening the mind or feeling the

207
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:28,720
satisfaction of the mind of being connected to this mind that feels more whole and then the the 11th step

208
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:36,000
is samadhi is concentrating the mind or unifying the mind which we'll talk about soon enough and

209
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:42,319
that's what makes the mind even more whole so it's a fantastic process here and

210
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:49,119
and i know that it's not easy to experience all these things i'm talking about but

211
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:55,839
part of the confidence in practice is to know that you're on a good path and

212
00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:02,880
and part of the equanimity that comes with practice is the confidence this is a good path to be on i can just

213
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:08,640
walk this path steadily keep going i don't have to be too concerned about how far i've gotten

214
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:15,520
because i know i'm in a good path and i'll keep walking so

215
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:20,960
thank you for today and i look for forward as i almost every day do now

216
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:27,839
