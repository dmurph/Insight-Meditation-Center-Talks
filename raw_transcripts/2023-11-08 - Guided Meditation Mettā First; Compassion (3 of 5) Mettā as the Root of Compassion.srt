1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,840
so hello

2
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:15,080
welcome it's Wednesday morning here in now San

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:21,000
Francisco see we have people actually from around the

4
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:27,960
world wonderful to be with you our theme for the week is

5
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,239
compassion and um I don't think you can hear what I

6
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:38,440
hear right now but just above me there is

7
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:44,360
um there's a whole group of Zen practitioners who are doing their

8
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,800
morning practice together and it's uh they're very

9
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:57,000
familiar sounds to me I I lived in this place for a very long time or what feels to me like a very long

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,600
time um and I'm I'm back overnight night in uh Zen Center just for the day so

11
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:11,200
looks a little different around me sounds a little different around me but being here I feel

12
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:19,119
the I feel the the power of the connection of uh a group of so many folks so many

13
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:25,880
people who are dedicated to the well-being of everyone but that's the driving force of

14
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:32,880
the practice so I for you that as we're getting

15
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:41,159
started so today our Focus will be Meta Meta practice and we'll talk we'll talk

16
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:47,520
a little bit more about about that but uh first let's meditate

17
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,479
together and what I have in mind for the the meditation this morning is um as we

18
00:01:53,479 --> 00:02:00,320
always do first let's settle and then um we'll turn turn our

19
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,960
attention to arousing loving kindness arousing

20
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:11,560
benevolence friendliness and letting that

21
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:19,720
um in so many words sort of fill us as best we can almost like a light

22
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:26,040
and then once the once we've practiced loving kindness for a bit we'll make a transition to to

23
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,760
compassion and we'll we will do some meditative cultivation of compassion

24
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,840
that's a

25
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:43,280
trajectory let's find our way into meditation

26
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,760
posture

27
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,000
in the silence settling the attention resting

28
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,879
the attention on the

29
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,920
body on the whole

30
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,640
body each breath calling us

31
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,319
back right

32
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:34,800
here and now is a fine time if you notice any

33
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,280
physical

34
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,919
tensions maybe with an exhale

35
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:01,440
release and just so if you notice

36
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:09,120
preoccupations mental tensions mental

37
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:19,479
contractions maybe with an exhale

38
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,479
release

39
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:44,039
as we settle what is right here in our sensate

40
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,720
world

41
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
immediate

42
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:23,039
with just these few minutes of mindfulness accompanying the

43
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,520
body clearly

44
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:35,399
knowing let's turn our attention to arousing

45
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:41,489
meta loving kindness [Music]

46
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:52,560
benevolence in whatever way works for you inviting the disposition

47
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:05,440
friendliness that kind mental

48
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,839
attitude the disposition of the

49
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:17,240
heart for some a reflection

50
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:24,360
helps tuning into the intention the simple

51
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,120
wish may you be happy

52
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,160
may we be

53
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:29,279
happy may all beings experience happiness and the

54
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,079
causes of

55
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:48,560
Happiness feeling this as a gentle wish for the possibility of

56
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
happiness

57
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:27,579
arousing this attitude of [Music]

58
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,560
Goodwill for some an image is

59
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:39,279
helpful calling to mind someone naturally

60
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:49,160
invites your inclination to benevolence wishing them

61
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,680
well and offering this

62
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,320
intention may you be

63
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
happy

64
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,800
may we be

65
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
happy

66
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:11,680
may all beings have happiness and the causes of

67
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,740
[Music]

68
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
happiness

69
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:52,919
cheing in from time to [Music]

70
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:59,279
time how is the body responding to this reflection

71
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,680
and the

72
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:13,880
mind is the wish for well-being having an

73
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,519
effect

74
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,360
may you be

75
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,760
happy may we be

76
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
happy

77
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:13,919
may all beings be [Music] happy and have the causes of

78
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
happiness

79
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:49,440
warming and nourishing the heart in this [Music] way by arousing this attitude of

80
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:56,559
benevolence now a subtle shift in the

81
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
practice

82
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,759
in much the same way making a

83
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,679
wish may you be free from

84
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:35,880
suffering may we be free from

85
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:50,720
suffering may all beings be free from

86
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
suffering

87
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:50,679
this slight turning of the heart from meta to

88
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:01,600
compassion arousing the wish for beings to be

89
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
free

90
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:25,200
and for the last few minutes of this [Music]

91
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:31,559
sitting pulling ourselves back back into

92
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:39,799
relaxation and settling on a wish for ease for just this one

93
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:43,840
being this one body and

94
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:53,960
mind may I be at use may I be

95
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,600
at

96
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,158
so welcome

97
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:51,399
again on this week focusing on

98
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:59,240
compassion and today turning our attention to meta loving kindness

99
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:06,679
yesterday I was joining you from the Redwood forest in Santa Cruz where I now

100
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:14,240
live and today I'm in San Francisco in the downstairs of San

101
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,480
Francisco's in Center so the the scenery is different the sounds are

102
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:26,159
different that the the practice continues wherever we

103
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:33,480
are so uh I thought it would start with a um

104
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:40,799
a simple story having just just recently moved to inside Retreat Center uh I'm I'm

105
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:47,919
discovering the Flora and the fauna and was sitting on my

106
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:54,440
porch um doing some work on the computer and I noticed a little a little

107
00:31:54,440 --> 00:32:00,679
bird a little bird I think I jum junko had a little black head and then landed

108
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:07,720
on the railing next to me I thought huh that's interesting and

109
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:13,480
then uh it took me a minute to realize this uh they were standing on an empty

110
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:19,480
bird bath and the bird was I'm now

111
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:28,039
anthropomorphizing but I was imagining as the head was turning it was saying to me uh Where is my water

112
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:34,360
Where Is My Water please give me some water and it was so natural it was just

113
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:42,279
so it was like so easily putting one in one together uh this this uh arising of

114
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:47,559
oh yes clearly I I can help this being right now I can I can offer my support

115
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:56,240
in this simple way um and I felt this meta wish come up oh oh little one may

116
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:03,120
you be safe may you take care of yourself with ease may you be protected and so

117
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:08,399
I build up the bird bath and learned how to drink and then flew

118
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:15,000
off in that context it simply made sense to put down what I was doing my my uh

119
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,320
laptop was much less important than offering some care to this

120
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:28,960
bird so an instance of friendliness um thinking about meta

121
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:34,440
uh meta we talk about is an attitude of benevolence or an intention of

122
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:43,159
benevolence it has these um connotations or um layers also of

123
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:48,559
protection uh and this basic disposition of

124
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:56,360
friendliness all of that is there turns out in the in the atmology of the word benevolence this a disposition to do

125
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:04,000
good um it apparently comes from the Latin for uh Good Feeling Good willll kindness

126
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:11,560
which breaks down into the Latin for well and wish it's so

127
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:18,760
perfect H the perfect word for meta benevolence So Meta practice though I I

128
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:25,878
deliberately offer a simple example of how meta can show up in one's life

129
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:32,560
um metha can can can actually operate along a spectrum it can be quite simple

130
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:39,560
and specific offering offering um offering water to this bird or it can be

131
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:45,599
quite powerful and directed to all beings So Meta fills this whole

132
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:51,118
range and U and has quite a a transformative power and the vudi Maga

133
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:57,640
one of the stages of method development in that path is um what they call breaking down the

134
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:05,920
barriers where the the wish for well-being becomes so pervasive that it equally equally um

135
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,640
Shines on all

136
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:17,880
beings one of the one of the very practical

137
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:23,200
um uh teachings regarding meta is that we don't have to do it only on the

138
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:31,400
meditation cushion uh in some ways um I borrow this from bin Alo he says meta loving

139
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:40,320
kindness benevolence provides the Practical scope for expressing one's compassionate

140
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:49,000
intent to me I hear this as when I have the wish for others to be free from suffering I can enact that through

141
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:56,280
through meta and this is possible because we can practice meta through our body through

142
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:03,319
our speech and then with our thinking I love this aspect of method

143
00:36:03,319 --> 00:36:11,280
and it's actually made manifest through our concrete actions they can be big they can be

144
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,839
small I want to illustrate this uh this way that me this meta can be so

145
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:23,680
practical and manifest in in our in our everyday actions U there's a suta that I

146
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:31,359
I point to a lot maaya 31 Chula go Singa sua in which um venerable anuda and two

147
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:37,200
other monks are living together venerable nandia venerable uh

148
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:43,319
kimila the Buddha comes to visit them and I love this after after the

149
00:36:43,319 --> 00:36:49,280
three monks pay respects to the Buddha they all sit down and um the Buddha asks

150
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:55,359
them a kind question he he simply says I hope you're

151
00:36:55,359 --> 00:37:00,440
all keeping up well I hope you're comfortable and I hope you're not having

152
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:07,720
any trouble getting uh supporting yourselves getting alms food and

153
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:13,280
um anuda responds we're keeping well we're able to feed ourselves well uh

154
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:21,079
then the Buddha the Buddha says oh I hope you are living in Concord with mutual appreciation without

155
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:27,760
disputing blending like milk and water viewing each other with kindness

156
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:34,480
eyes anuda affirms that they are and then the Buddha asks oh how are you doing this and this is where meta

157
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:42,000
becomes concrete anuda says that he regularly he

158
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,680
regularly reflects on what a gain it is to be practicing in s to be practicing

159
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:56,040
in community with with these other two monks um that he says it's a gain for me

160
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:03,200
a great great gain that I'm living with these companions this is part of the joy when

161
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:11,680
I sign on in the mornings for the 7 amm sa and I see all the greetings and I I hear anuda oh this is

162
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:18,160
a gain for us this is a gain for us practicing with our

163
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:24,960
Companions and then anuda says as to how he how they're living in

164
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:31,040
Concord he says I do bodily acts of loving kindness

165
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:38,040
toward these others that is to say he he does actions for for them or for the

166
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:44,079
whole with an intention of benevolence may you be happy may this

167
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:50,560
being be happy oh I'll take care of this I'll take care of this may you be

168
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:58,680
happy there's an added to mention that uh these monks they're not only doing bodily actions of loving kindness and

169
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:04,359
benevolence um but they're they're doing them both in ways that can be seen and

170
00:39:04,359 --> 00:39:12,599
ways that can't be seen and both of those are effective they're not U they're not doing metap for the uh to

171
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:18,920
look good to each other they're doing it to nourish this wish may we be

172
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:24,680
happy but not only do they do bodily acts but also verbal acts of loving

173
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:31,599
kindness they say both openly and privately and then mental acts of loving

174
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:36,839
kindness maybe the uh appreciation practice that anuda mentioned could be

175
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:42,119
could be an example of that and then the last part of this

176
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:47,760
section is that anuda says they put aside their

177
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:53,200
preferences this way they say it why should I not set aside what I wish to do

178
00:39:53,200 --> 00:40:00,000
and do what these venerable ones wish to do then I set aside what I wish to do and do what these venerable ones wish to

179
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:08,519
do we are different in body venerable sir but one in mind he says to the

180
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:15,000
Buddha venerable analo has an important comment about this last this last bit

181
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,820
about um setting aside what we wish to do he makes the observation that that

182
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:28,280
[Music] um all three of these monks are engaging in that part of the practice

183
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:35,839
so um it's not an instance of one powerful personality dominating the

184
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:41,599
group and the others sort of go along but all three of them instead have

185
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:48,839
maybe this perspective of what's best for the whole what's best for all of these beings and they act in accord with

186
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:53,280
that rather than their personal

187
00:40:55,319 --> 00:41:02,640
preference so I love this that meta can be manifest

188
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:08,599
in body speech and mind and there are two important ways that this uh connects

189
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:16,640
to our compassion practice and both of these are illustrated by an image from later Buddhist tradition of compassion

190
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,960
as like a tree compassion like a tree and then

191
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:27,960
meta benevolence is like the root of the tree

192
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:33,280
and just in the way that the root of a plant provides two functions it serves

193
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:41,119
as a a foundation and it it provides nourishment and it's just the same with

194
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:48,160
meta So Meta provides the the foundation by being the foundational Brahma vihara

195
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:55,520
was uh first of the heart practices in the four of meta compassion sympathetic

196
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:03,480
joy and equin meta provides the foundation and then it also provides the

197
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:10,359
nourishment I think we get a sense of that when we we look at the way that anuda nandia uh Kimo were living

198
00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:16,720
together that uh practicing mea even just on the level of intention

199
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:22,000
but then also making making it manifest in our body speech and mind how it

200
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,200
nourishes the heart you have a feeling for this maybe in contrast we can

201
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:35,760
consider the way that that um ill will comes with a cost whereas an attitude of benevolence

202
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,880
can actually feed

203
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:51,319
nourish there's a there's a way in which the all four of the brah beara practices work together and balance each other

204
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:57,440
karuna karuna uh compassion can have this way that um if we're if we're not

205
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:03,160
particularly careful or if we if we don't watch out for this it is possible

206
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:11,400
because we're reflecting on someone who is having difficulty may you be free from suffering there's a possibility of uh

207
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:20,000
elevating on self and then then we get into what the visi Maga calls the near enemy of compassion which is

208
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:26,839
pity meta protects against this or it it works as a counterbalance because meta

209
00:43:26,839 --> 00:43:32,960
Shines on everything and everyone equally I'll close with the image of the

210
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:38,280
way analo talks about the four bahad viharas he talks about

211
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:44,960
U all four of them is like the sun shining meta is like the Sun at noon

212
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:50,880
shining brightly and equally on everyone compassion is like sunlight at

213
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:57,240
Sunset darkness is Right nearby uh but the sunlight is shining all the way more

214
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:03,240
beautifully sympathetic Joy is like Sunrise all this Joy like bird

215
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:08,760
singing and then equinity the last of the the four Brahma viharas is like at

216
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:13,640
midnight the cool shining of the light of the

217
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:21,760
Moon I leave you with this this morning this complete set of

218
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:29,680
practices May our meta May our Goodwill n compassion and may it benefit both our

219
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:36,079
own practice and everyone all beings everyone we encounter everyone they

220
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:45,279
encounter and on and on May all beings be happy may they be free good morning
