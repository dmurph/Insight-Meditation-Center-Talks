9
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:04,680
I also that we have here uh three people attending you know all these years that

10
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:12,240
I've been doing YouTube uh from IMC there's always been a loan a couple of times uh one person came a

11
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,479
technician came in one of our Sangha members who helps a lot with it and here we have uh two of the resident

12
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,540
volunteers at IRC and one of the big volunteers who comes here to help and so they're sitting here in the

13
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,659
meditation Hall with me and so it's nice to have company here

14
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,939
so um welcome to the beginning of the week and um

15
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:42,420
last week we did a series of teachings on different ways of being aware

16
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:48,420
and for this day I would like to suggest another variation on awareness that can

17
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:54,979
apply to all the different other ways that you're aware but that is um

18
00:01:54,979 --> 00:02:01,079
to the the choice between letting the awareness be very light

19
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:11,099
and having awareness being I don't know if heavy is the right word but a little bit more intense or serious or weighty

20
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:17,040
and sometimes the idea of lightness kind of like awareness has a very light touch

21
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,800
for what is it's being aware of can be very helpful because anything more than

22
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,680
a light touch can be sometimes too much effort being made

23
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:34,319
and the Art of uh effort is to make a have a light touch a lightness to the

24
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,440
effort but to be committed to it so it's continuous and really stay there

25
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:46,700
and so um a light touch and a light touch with the

26
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,900
how awareness touches the breathing the sensations of breathing a light touch

27
00:02:51,900 --> 00:03:00,860
and how we know it and the knowing of the sensations that if there's mental noting a light touch with a noting

28
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,480
so that'll be the kind of the

29
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:15,260
the addition to the meditation this morning so to take a

30
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:23,239
triple alert posture and to gently close your eyes

31
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,120
and to take a few long slow deep breaths

32
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,319
exhaling relaxing on the exhale

33
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:52,799
and the part of this one can be nice with taking a few deep breaths at the beginning

34
00:03:52,799 --> 00:04:00,360
is that when you stop doing it you can appreciate the lightness or the more

35
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,840
simple way of breathing then it's not intentionally taking deep breaths

36
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:12,659
so you might try that now kind of return to an ordinary breath and appreciate

37
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:18,479
maybe that ordinariness of it or the lack of that extra effort and force

38
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,940
to deep briefly breathe deeply

39
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,960
and just with a light touch be aware of your breathing

40
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:42,419
a light touch that doesn't interfere with your breathing doesn't have any agenda with

41
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:47,780
it just there feeling it coming and going

42
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:02,699
and as you exhale without making a lot of effort just a

43
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:11,759
very light effort almost as if the lightness of the effort is part of the medicine

44
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:18,800
as you exhale lightly relax parts of your body

45
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:28,099
being content with just a little bit of softening at a time

46
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,020
softening in the face

47
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:49,039
softening in the shoulders

48
00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:59,360
softening in the belly

49
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,780
and then settling into your breathing

50
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:41,580
if it's easy enough to feel this have there be a light connection

51
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:46,940
with your body and the movements of breathing

52
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:03,020
feeling that parts of that part of the movement that feels free

53
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:07,520
the movement that feels like it

54
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:17,300
the movement it feels like its moves easily lightly

55
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:25,698
even if it brushes against tightness

56
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,500
pressure

57
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:43,580
and with this emphasis on lightness

58
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:51,319
as you exhale to lighten up on them in the mind

59
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,660
maybe a sense of soft touch in the mind

60
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:34,979
and if there is anything that's heavy or challenging for you as you're sitting

61
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:40,700
here thoughts or feelings Sensations

62
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:52,279
see if the mindfulness of it can be light

63
00:08:52,320 --> 00:09:00,440
almost like mindfulness is a soft feather The Gents gently

64
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,459
brushes are called across whatever difficulty there is

65
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:25,620
where awareness is a soft cotton ball that gently touches what's heavy or

66
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:31,560
difficult and then gently pulls away

67
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:38,519
lightly touches briefly with no Force no insistence

68
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:43,519
just a gentle almost like a gentle hello

69
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,899
whatever a mental effort you're making to be aware

70
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:41,300
mindful here in the present moment

71
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:51,680
can that effort have a lightness to it easing up so there's any ease

72
00:11:52,500 --> 00:12:01,100
in how you're encountering whatever is happening here Moment by moment

73
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:15,420
with a light touch of awareness you can sometimes feel as if whatever

74
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:24,899
the experience is of the moment that it is touching you lightly

75
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:27,600
and if there is any suffering or

76
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:34,460
distress or fear or difficulty

77
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:43,500
when we can feel it lightly the light touch

78
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:50,880
the feather touch then there is more room

79
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,840
for compassion for care

80
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,640
for kindness

81
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:12,799
to touch our challenges with a light touch of awareness

82
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:21,500
so there's a room for a tenderness

83
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:57,919
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

84
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:05,880
to bring to mind some person or animal

85
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:13,200
for whom it's easy for you to have a warm regard

86
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:20,600
love or friendliness kindness

87
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:26,419
maybe an admiration of a kind

88
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:39,919
so someone for whom is easy to have good will

89
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:46,700
think of this person or this animal

90
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:55,260
with a light touch so that the awareness of it is not mixed

91
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:59,840
up with desires and fears and

92
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:12,500
it's just very simple the lightest Touch of Goodwill love

93
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:17,000
that needs nothing in return

94
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,760
that's asking for nothing

95
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,700
love with a light touch

96
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,900
and then that light Touch of Love imagine that

97
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:59,820
it has a door that you can open a wide door that opens up and

98
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:05,419
the same light touch of love or care kind

99
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:12,380
can be extended to all the people in your life that you know

100
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,520
they don't have to know you're doing it

101
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:28,520
a light touch of kind Regard in all directions

102
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:47,240
and with a light touch a lightness of heart

103
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:54,620
opening your good will up in all directions to all beings everywhere

104
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:01,100
may all beings be happy

105
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:07,158
may all beings be safe

106
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:13,759
male beings be peaceful

107
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:19,399
may all beings be free

108
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:43,430
[Music]

109
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:51,019
thank you

110
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,600
so hello and welcome to our Monday

111
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,860
Gathering and uh um today I'm at the insect Retreat

112
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:20,100
Center it's lovely to be in this meditation Hall and um

113
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:26,220
the topic for this week is compassion and uh to talk about it in a particular

114
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:32,460
way building on two weeks ago that theme was compassion as well some kind of building

115
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:38,039
on this and last week the topic was different ways of being aware

116
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:44,399
and the importance of that for compassion is that if we only have one way to be aware

117
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:50,220
that mode of awareness might not be the best and healthiest way for us to be

118
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:56,100
present for suffering in ourselves and suffering in others it might be for example if someone

119
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:01,740
mostly is aware through feelings and that's the only way they know how to

120
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:06,960
know anything is through the vehicle of feelings some of the suffering world might just

121
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,360
feel too much and our own suffering might feel too much

122
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:17,460
it's important to feel but it's also important to find the awareness that we

123
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:23,580
can be present for something where we're not weighed down by what's the experience is

124
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:29,520
and um and so if someone who feels a lot might be able to shift a little bit into

125
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:38,159
an observing mode maybe observing kind of from a little bit of distance or they might be more in a not feeling

126
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:43,200
so much but kind of a clear mental recognition of what's happening and that

127
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,419
the feelings are still there but coming into the mode of recognition knowing oh

128
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:55,020
this is pain this is someone's sadness that then um

129
00:31:55,020 --> 00:32:00,659
it might be uh easier to be present for it might be

130
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:07,799
able to find a place of a light touch being present in a way that has a certain degree of ease or lightness in

131
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:13,320
the awareness itself then that becomes the that lightness or

132
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:21,059
that ease or a little bit of calmness around how we're aware that makes a room for compassion to

133
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:27,360
arise rather than distress to arise rather than fear or alarm arising

134
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,940
and so the mode in which we're aware can affect how we're how we're how we can

135
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:38,220
have compassion and then also if we're compassionate the

136
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:45,059
mode in which we're relating to things the mood in which we're aware can affect how we enact The Compassion how we live

137
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:51,480
from that compassion and so the compassion has lived in a way maybe it's not so heavy or doesn't come

138
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:59,640
from a sense of Duty or doesn't come from a sense of of you know doesn't mix up with fear or

139
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:05,820
ego or all kinds of things that can be there so what I'd like to

140
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:12,080
um do this week is offer you um

141
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:21,779
what I'm calling the seven factors of compassion and they're the same as the the common

142
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:27,960
Buddhist list of the seven factors of Awakening and so the first one is mindfulness so

143
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:33,120
the mindfulness factor of compassion the investigation factor of compassion

144
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:39,000
the effort factor of compassion The Joy factor of compassion

145
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,460
the Tranquility factor of compassion

146
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:50,700
um a concentration factor of compassion and and the Equanimity factor of compassion

147
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:56,399
and um and what's kind of lovely is that when

148
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:03,000
we live from compassion the seven effectors awaking follow along

149
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:10,440
and the first one being mindfulness there's a way in which coming from a compassionate Place responding to things

150
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:18,300
compassionately brings with it mindfulness mindfulness built is kind of comes along without any real having to

151
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:23,339
work at it people only practice mindfulness there are times where it's going to work to

152
00:34:23,339 --> 00:34:30,240
you like it feels like you're doing the mindfulness you don't care I would drift it off that's to come back and had to do it again and

153
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:37,138
um but when compassion is in the Forefront there's a way in which mindfulness can follow effortlessly it's

154
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:43,919
not like we have to work it at um at being Mindful and so so same thing for

155
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:52,080
the other factors so I'll to make this easier to understand this I would like to um

156
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:57,240
give a kind of a school playground example

157
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:02,460
say you're visiting a playground and there's a small child maybe a five

158
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:08,640
six-year-old child four five four five-year-old child who's playing I have lots of fun in the playground

159
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,740
but then the child trips and scrapes her

160
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:19,140
um maybe she scrapes her knee she's wearing shorts and so the knee rubs across the

161
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:26,760
asphalt and gets scraped and maybe it's dirty and there's a little gravel and and so she's quite stunned and shocked

162
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:35,339
that uh you know she was having so much fun and now suddenly she's in pain she's confused she's upset and in pain

163
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:40,980
and a relatively common school yard kind of injury

164
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:48,780
and so she comes running to you and um and so you feel her distress you

165
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:54,900
feel her see that she has a wound but this you've you've had this for yourself in playgrounds you've seen it

166
00:35:54,900 --> 00:36:01,560
before this is a kind of common thing she'll be she's going to be fine what she needs is someone who just cares for

167
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:08,040
her is present in a calm way and begins taking care of her in a nice way

168
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:14,520
and um and so you decide that this you should you know she calms down and say you're going to

169
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:19,980
um with compassion and care you want to clean her wound because it's gravel and

170
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:26,700
grit in there and um and so but it hurts it hurts for to touch it even with a

171
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:32,760
flow of water so you get maybe a soft cotton ball or something or and that's

172
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:38,940
moist and you're very likely tap the wound in order to pick up some of the dirt

173
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:44,280
that's there and you do it with um you really don't want to hurt or you care

174
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:50,579
about her you want to settle her you wouldn't want to agitate her more so there's this love and care to do this as

175
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:57,780
carefully as you can and so you bring your attention into that um you know it to you're paying attention

176
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:04,500
to her very carefully to see what the response will be when you touch so you can pull back quickly if she's if it

177
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:11,460
stings her too much and so but you know just very gently and you that you're very careful about how quickly you do it

178
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:16,500
the pressure you put on on the wound there's a lot of attention

179
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:21,900
what's driving the attention is the compassion the care for the girl

180
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:28,560
What's um what follows in the wake of that care is a lot of mindfulness

181
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:34,560
a lot of attention there to really be present to take in the situation

182
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:39,960
no one needs to tell you be aware pay attention be mindful come back to the

183
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:45,540
present moment that just follows along with this deep

184
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:53,339
motivation to care for this person and to be attentive in a nice way to not cause you know more pain for her

185
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:59,040
and not only do you have to uh you know there's a lot of awareness and attention there

186
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:05,339
there is what in Buddhism is called investigation which is to be very discerning

187
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:11,940
about what causes more pain and what causes less what supports her what doesn't support

188
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:17,700
her what kind of tone of voice to speak what kind of voice not to speak partly

189
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:22,980
taking in the cues from her and as you speak and as you say things and and so

190
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:30,480
there's a lot of care not only in being present but in making distinctions between what is useful here and what is

191
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:36,839
not useful The Compassion takes the lead and this idea of kind of being

192
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:42,599
considerate about you know what what could hurt her more or what's going to hurt her less

193
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:49,380
um it's kind of effortless it's like obvious of course if you want to carefully care for her a wound and to

194
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:55,320
clean it and put a bandage on of course you're going to try to pay attention to the way to do it that causes the least

195
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:01,740
amount of pain for her at least amount of distress tuning in to all these little factors

196
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:09,599
and what what's useful and not useful and um and so that what what's in the

197
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:17,640
lead here is compassion so one way to develop mindfulness

198
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:23,760
is to be compassionate one way to be compassionate is to be

199
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,099
mindful is to develop Your Capacity to be aware in a light way in a calm way

200
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:34,980
and open way so that then the tenderness the warmth

201
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:42,000
of your heart has a chance as a room to be there when we're aware in a heavy way or

202
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,040
strong way or if we're angry and we're being aware the anger doesn't give much

203
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:52,560
room if we're full of desires if we're full of fear there's not much room for

204
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:59,339
anything to arise in the field of awareness but if we can learn the art

205
00:39:59,339 --> 00:40:05,280
even with fear and anger and distress the art of having a light touch a

206
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:12,420
lightness an easefulness in the mindfulness um just that you might find that there's

207
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:19,800
more a little more space to have care and love and compassion kindness for

208
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:24,960
yourself for the distress you have and for others for the difficulty they have

209
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:31,380
and then once the compassion is there to let that be in the Forefront to act

210
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:38,300
on that to live that way to have compassion maybe not in such a way that everyone knows you're being compassionate because

211
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:44,339
that might be a little bit too much for some people but uh but you care you're

212
00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:50,940
bringing a caring and a kindness to your things to people and the events and then

213
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:56,099
then notice that as you do that is there

214
00:40:56,099 --> 00:41:02,160
can you notice the ease easeful way in which you are aware you're mindful

215
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:08,400
can you notice the kind of the matter of fact obvious way in which you're investigating you're making distinctions

216
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:14,820
between what makes it what supports the situation and what doesn't what's helpful and what's not helpful

217
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:21,240
that compassion is wise compassion um when we act on it or live motivated

218
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:26,760
by it brings along a lot of different factors that support

219
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:32,060
the compassion without even sometimes even needing to think about it

220
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:38,820
provided that we don't get locked in with the Compassion or alarmed or fearful or

221
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:44,040
dutiful and the compassion is doesn't become heavy

222
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:49,680
when there's a lot of suffering in the world and we might feel obligated I have to be heavy I have to be serious my

223
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:55,560
compassion has to be strong now Paradox of all this is that the best

224
00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:01,440
form of compassion that we can have is not strong compassion it's or heavy

225
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:07,260
compassion it's light compassion it's calm compassion it's compassion it has

226
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:14,420
lots of room for things including lots of room for yourself and it's that kind of compassion that

227
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:20,640
brings along with it attention attentiveness mindfulness and that

228
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:26,280
brings along with it Discerning about what's helpful and not helpful or that question looking and seeing what years

229
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:31,800
are helpful I'm all with a light touch

230
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:37,680
all with a kind of light touch that is sustainable for compassion over a long time

231
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:44,760
and that's one of the things we're looking for in compassion is sustainable compassion because compassion that is heavy or

232
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:50,780
strong or that's too tight to connect it with other kind of challenges we have

233
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:56,400
we'll have compassion fatigue we'll get exhausted very quickly if you know but

234
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:02,760
this lightness a light touch so maybe think of uh living a life of

235
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:07,980
compassion you know it's more like a marathon than a Sprint

236
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:14,520
and so Marathon also you kind of start off with a kind of a light run and um

237
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:19,980
so um so the seven factors of compassion said

238
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:25,980
that follow along follow built on compassion and today I mentioned too

239
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:31,619
mindfulness and discernment or investigation and you might see as you go about your

240
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:38,400
day-to-day maybe try to have a light touch with your awareness but to have a light

241
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:46,319
Compassion or a light care or light love or kindness that allows there to be room for

242
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:51,480
attention awareness of what is happening in this field of

243
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:57,300
kindness what's happening in this field of compassion and then maybe start seeing how

244
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:03,300
mindfulness can follow compassion how discernment follows and see how those

245
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:09,000
work together and and and maybe you'll find that it's even

246
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,940
easier to be mindful and develop your mindfulness if it's Guided by compassion

247
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:21,920
then it's Guided by a sense of you know it's good for you or something

248
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:27,660
so um thank you and um so we'll continue from IRC

249
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:32,300
tomorrow and thank you for being here
