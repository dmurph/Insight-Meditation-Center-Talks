00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,720
so hello welcome good morning uh to you

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,000
uh those in around this time zone um

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,800
it is uh i know from my nephews it's the first day of uh

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,800
of middle school in berkeley unified school district and you

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:31,599
have a substitute teacher today so um

6
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:37,200
i'm happy to be with you all right my name is matthew princilver

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,399
and um yeah i was um was i'm always happy to do

8
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:48,000
whatever gil asked me to do i feel

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,120
inspired by by his service

10
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,199
and very happy to to be with you and be practicing this week together

11
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,478
and we'll have have uh the usual usual

12
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:11,280
format and um i will guide us in in a meditation for a half

13
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,520
hour and then offer some reflections starting at half past

14
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:25,798
so um yeah let us uh let us sit together

15
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:29,360
so much of meditation practice is about relinquishing reference points

16
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,160
but it's very useful to

17
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,120
to have the reference point

18
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,319
of love

19
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,519
love not so much in the sense of some ebullient feeling

20
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,159
but love in the sense of of knowing

21
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,560
that all experience can soften our heart

22
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,799
that any experience any experience might hurt

23
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,879
but need not harm our heart

24
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,560
so we begin with this reference point

25
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:59,480
and progressively surrender so many of the others

26
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:09,280
and just taking some deeper breath spreading

27
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,479
your breath through your whole body

28
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,599
it's like we we pour the awareness into

29
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,039
the whole body

30
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,400
there's no rigidity but there's a gentle

31
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,879
discipline

32
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:16,960
there's no turning any experience into an enemy thinking or whatever

33
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,840
but we do know why we're doing what we're doing

34
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:37,640
beginning to gather up the fragments of our attention

35
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:49,240
bring them all right here to the body breathing

36
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,720
the urge to fix and secure our life

37
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,279
such natural urges

38
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,839
it's easy enough we just put this down

39
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:29,480
remember in our heart of hearts what practice is about

40
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,480
but uh sometimes the the energy of fixing

41
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,760
securing our life is so strong that it

42
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:53,000
itself needs the blessing of awareness love

43
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,760
and so we move the spotlight of attention

44
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:22,399
from our body breathing to the urgency of fixing as it manifests

45
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,959
in our emotional body

46
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,839
the circuits that light up with the worried thought

47
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,920
or the conclusion we've longed for

48
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,240
the engine of thinking

49
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,240
is affect and so we invade that

50
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,160
in awareness and patience

51
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,480
and then perhaps it feels appropriate to

52
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:09,240
return to the body breathing

53
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,959
the field of attention

54
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,399
more unified

55
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:05,919
in meditation we all experiment

56
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:13,320
practice becoming temporary monastics

57
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,880
a monastic in the sense of

58
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:28,080
privileging the life of awareness

59
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:37,640
over [Music] our life of projects

60
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,679
and so to be mindful

61
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,600
is actually quite a deep surrender

62
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,600
it's good too uh good to sit with you

63
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:45,440
so um yeah happy happy to be with you

64
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,440
um

65
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,000
so in in

66
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,880
clinical treatment research um

67
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:08,880
there are uh two really two often two key questions

68
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:15,600
does this treatment work and if it does how does it work

69
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,640
yeah so the questions around efficacy or effectiveness

70
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:26,399
doesn't work and then the mechanism of change how does it work

71
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:32,880
and the the buddha made

72
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:38,240
claims about efficacy this works this is not a shell game

73
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:46,080
yeah and that's part of why it's so helpful to

74
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:52,880
have new experiences on this path bliss or insight or love or something

75
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,840
but new experiences because it helps confirm the sense of

76
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:07,200
like that we're we're not being conned like there's something on offer here

77
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,240
and um and so we start to get some sense of how

78
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:19,760
yeah this can work right so the buddha made those claims

79
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:26,399
but mostly the the teachings really unpack a

80
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:31,679
vision of the ways that practice transforms

81
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:38,960
the mechanisms of change and that language you know is

82
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,399
is borrowed from from pharmacology where uh

83
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:50,320
question of how how a medicine works it well it stimulates this

84
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:55,519
receptor system or and down regulates another receptor

85
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:00,080
activity and

86
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,000
i use that language here because um

87
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:13,120
all dharma talks implicitly embrace some mechanism of action

88
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,880
yeah when we give a meditation instruction or a talk or

89
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:24,960
something we we have a mechanism of action in mind we have a

90
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:32,880
theory of change in mind this is how practice gets under our skin this is how

91
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,640
freedom from suffering unfolds

92
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:48,080
and we talk explicitly or implicitly usually implicitly about the mechanism of action

93
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:53,440
for at least a couple reasons first really to

94
00:33:53,440 --> 00:34:00,880
encourage you to keep going we really do need a strong why why do we

95
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:08,158
do this and why should we ever be willing to experience suffering

96
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:15,440
consciously yeah we we need a strong answer to that

97
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:23,040
to keep going and much of what dharma teachers do

98
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:29,200
is more or less just to say don't give up

99
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:35,040
yeah this is how practice works this is its mechanism

100
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:41,760
it's supposed to feel like this even though a part of our mind

101
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:47,118
is utterly unconvinced we're ever supposed to feel

102
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:53,358
like this so

103
00:34:53,359 --> 00:35:01,040
relka says uh no feeling is final just keep going

104
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:09,680
don't let yourself lose me nearby is the country they call life

105
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:15,520
you will know it by its seriousness give me

106
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,240
your hand

107
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:30,400
so we we talk about the mechanisms to encourage you to keep going

108
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:36,000
and also when we understand how practice works in a deeper way

109
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,000
we can reinforce the positive effects and minimize the side effects

110
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,280
we can really determine what's what's important on the path and emphasize it

111
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:54,640
yeah and so classically you might say that the mechanisms of change what points to

112
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,799
the mechanisms of change is sila

113
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:10,400
ethical training ethical conduct samadhi the training of the mind gathering of

114
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:17,599
attention and pania wisdom these are maybe we say the classical

115
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:23,280
mechanisms of change sila

116
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:29,920
purifying purifying our karma

117
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:39,040
you can't really expect to be happy if you're perpetually

118
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,838
harming yourself and others

119
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:49,359
and the the kind of hatred and paranoia or separateness

120
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:54,880
that's bred by harming is not actually compatible with deep

121
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:02,720
happiness and so we start to build the foundation

122
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:08,960
of our spiritual home uh you know on on

123
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,880
uh the ground of non-regret

124
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:20,400
yeah there's so much that our ethical

125
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:26,960
alignment does build on the foundation of non-regret

126
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:32,640
and and there's a kind of transparency in our life we can't be found out

127
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,680
when we're acting in alignment with our own deepest values we we can't be found

128
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:45,200
out so like twain says um um

129
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:51,200
something like when you tell the truth you don't have to remember anything right

130
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:56,320
our whole life becomes like that

131
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:03,720
non-defended we don't have to remember anything

132
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:13,599
and there's samadhi there's samadhi in the deep enjoyment of being secluded from

133
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:19,359
the bombardment of samsara yeah

134
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:24,240
this this realm this realm of existence

135
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:33,280
i thought of uh bob dylan yeah i was

136
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:39,280
burned out from exhaustion buried in the hail poisoned in the bushes and blown out on

137
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:45,839
the trail hunting like a crocodile ravage in the corn come in she said i'll give you

138
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:49,119
shelter from the storm

139
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:59,119
just being human is a little overwhelming moment to moment a little overwhelming

140
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:06,160
and so uh we have to take shelter one of the ways we take shelter

141
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:12,640
is to um to rest in attention

142
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:19,520
and to really open to the kind of intensity

143
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:25,119
of the human condition without the shelter of some samadhi

144
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,838
it's it's too much it's too much

145
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:37,280
and so we take our seat and

146
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:44,480
sometimes we usually usual way we understand samadhi is the kind of stillness of the discursive mind

147
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:50,160
and that's that's real but there's almost another sense of samadhi

148
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:56,160
of just um sense of our body all being in one place

149
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:03,359
and even even when the mind is very active there can be a sense of

150
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:09,160
something is gathering something is stilling

151
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:17,760
and so we we settle down

152
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:23,200
we take our protection and the kind of

153
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:31,200
spotlight of attention isn't shaking so sharply anymore and we start to

154
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:39,440
perceive the objects of attention more clearly this is said to lead to

155
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:46,880
wisdom clear seeing yeah understanding understanding what brings happiness what

156
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:52,240
brings suffering perceiving the kind of hallmarks of

157
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:57,200
experience the characteristics of experience

158
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:02,640
understanding beginning to understand the

159
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:10,079
cause and effect in a more nuanced rich way

160
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:17,920
our maps of happiness are impoverished when we begin practice

161
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,280
we start to fill them out

162
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:29,839
complicate them see them in more detail what is happiness

163
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:36,640
what is it really how does pleasure differ from satisfaction

164
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:43,359
what is conducive to heart at rest

165
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:50,040
so these are the kind of maybe we say the classical

166
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:56,400
mechanisms of change and

167
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:02,240
this week for whatever it's worth i'll um

168
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:08,319
offer a kind of alternative map of the the mechanisms of action

169
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:16,160
yeah just a different way of framing how practice functions for us how it

170
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:22,560
gets under our skin how it begins to transform our heart

171
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:28,960
and it emerges from yeah from my own practice and

172
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:35,359
also from my encounters with clinical clinical research psychotherapy

173
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:40,560
research and um and so over the next four days i'll

174
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:48,400
unpack four mechanisms through which practice may

175
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:56,800
transform and inform our heart and hopefully feel familiar and fresh at

176
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:03,040
the same time and hopefully will will

177
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:08,480
animate your practice so that you keep going so

178
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:18,720
you know what's useful so that you have a strong strong why why to stay why should i stay

179
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:27,400
