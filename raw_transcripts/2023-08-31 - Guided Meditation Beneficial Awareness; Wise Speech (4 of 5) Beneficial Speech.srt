1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:06,899
so hello everyone welcome to this meditation session

2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:12,799
and the talk that will follow and um

3
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:23,340
and of some words about meditation before we

4
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,220
start or mindfulness

5
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:35,399
it can be useful to divide up our experience into two halves

6
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,280
and give each half equal value

7
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:47,940
and one half is whatever is happening to us whatever our experience is

8
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,340
the other half is how we're aware of it the mindfulness

9
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,739
of it commonly we're concerned with our

10
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,840
experiences our thoughts our ideas the content of our

11
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:11,040
of our thoughts and and it's appropriate to do so to be

12
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,580
concerned focused be aware of that but sometimes we're so aware of it so

13
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,040
involved in our thoughts so involved with our experience the conversation we're having

14
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:30,180
that we're not really attuned to this whole other half

15
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:38,100
and that is how we're aware how we're attending how we're mindful

16
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,619
and by giving it so much value in this little description I wonder if it's real

17
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:49,920
on seven emphasites it's really important to be aware of how we're aware

18
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,079
and it's actually a kind of key to living a more

19
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:02,100
happier life a more easeful life peaceful life calmer life if we're not

20
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,380
consumed by or preoccupied by or fully engaged in

21
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,660
the content of our experience the experience itself of the conversation

22
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:18,540
the what's happening in the moment involved with our thoughts about the

23
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,700
past the future and our ideas and Fantasies

24
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:29,040
but rather than being absorbed in those or completely caught in them to open up

25
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:36,000
and really take into account the other whole half and that other half of awareness being

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,800
aware of it being mindful of it that's the domain that's the place where

27
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:50,160
um the huge place where that's where we discover and are tuned in some

28
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,920
meaningful and deep way to ourselves that's where we began discovering

29
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,940
freedom so there's a simple

30
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:09,239
excuse me there's a simple

31
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:15,060
um guideline for what I'm talking about today and that is

32
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:22,500
whenever you're aware of what's happening to you the breathing the body your emotions your thoughts The Sounds

33
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:28,500
around you whatever it might be ask yourself

34
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:36,060
is the way that you're aware of it beneficial is the manner in which you're receiving

35
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:42,720
it registering it is it enjoyable is it satisfying is it

36
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,879
peaceful or is it unsatisfying is it agitating is

37
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:55,200
it conflictive is it resistant is it assertive and greedy and

38
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,299
all kinds of things what comes along with that way of being aware

39
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:06,540
and see if you can find a place that no matter how uncomfortable the experience

40
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:13,379
is how you're aware of it is comfortable no matter how agitated your experience

41
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:20,940
is maybe you're agitating your body your emotional life how you know how you recognize oh I am

42
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:28,560
agitated that is not agitated no matter how sad or depressed you might

43
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:36,000
feel the knowing that you're sad or depressed that is not said or depressed that is

44
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,120
there's a Clarity there's a receptivity it just feels like it's very simple

45
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:49,139
and it isn't so much that we have to make ourselves that way but rather it's the nature of awareness

46
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:55,500
to be very very simple and in that Simplicity if we can recognize or find that Simplicity that's

47
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:04,020
already there that you might find that it's beneficial it's enjoyable it's it's nourishing it's

48
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:10,139
just a nice place to be and it doesn't deny everything else but

49
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:17,160
it changes the half the whole ecology changes where we can then now be with

50
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,320
our experience in a way that might actually be much more beneficial much

51
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:29,039
wiser more caring more non-reactive

52
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,800
so in this sitting today to ask yourself the question

53
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,560
am I aware in a beneficial way and if not

54
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,440
can you relax and find some way to be aware that simple and much more

55
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:53,340
satisfying so assuming taking on a

56
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,680
entering into a meditation posture

57
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:09,560
and lowering your gaze or closing your eyes

58
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:17,039
and to begin right away as you now bring your attention to

59
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:22,979
yourself in meditation checking in and recognizing what's here

60
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:26,539
for you and your experience

61
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:35,120
is how you're aware of your body your mind your heart

62
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:42,780
are you aware in a beneficial way or a satisfying

63
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:51,080
way or even an enjoyable way

64
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:02,539
and then becoming aware of your breathing

65
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:12,740
the body's experience of breathing and taking a few long slow deep breaths

66
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,780
relax as you exhale

67
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,840
settling in Here and Now

68
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:13,020
letting your breathing be normal and with every exhale

69
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:18,780
see if you can let go or loosen up

70
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:23,840
lighten up around your thinking

71
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:39,080
letting go of thoughts and settling into your body

72
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:17,959
and sitting here quietly aware of your breathing

73
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:24,140
noticing whatever it is that takes you away from the breathing

74
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,699
then returning again to your breathing

75
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:44,180
let's see if you can adjust your knowing the way that you know

76
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:57,260
that it feels like it's Pleasant enjoyable

77
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:05,820
that the knowing in and of itself is beneficial not that what you know is beneficial

78
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,760
but how you know how you're aware

79
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:20,339
maybe you can be relaxed around it calm receptive

80
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:31,680
maybe it's a awareness knowing that has no boundaries around it

81
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,200
and so the spaciousness of knowing

82
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,100
feels good

83
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:16,440
not being in a hurry and knowing but whatever you know

84
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:24,240
to know it clearly as if you're making a greater room for

85
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,899
the experience

86
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:36,079
that the awareness has greater room feels good

87
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,320
foreign

88
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:17,900
how clear is your awareness now

89
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:28,020
can you be aware of in a way that's clear open receptive

90
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:32,299
making room for what's happening

91
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:42,140
so that awareness is not hijacked by our agendas and her desires

92
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,220
our impulses

93
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:00,539
being aware in a way that you appreciate being aware

94
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:06,980
feels good feels beneficial

95
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:35,940
so then as we come to the end of the sitting

96
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:40,580
to spend a few moments considering

97
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:47,960
ways in which your awareness your knowing of what's happening in the present

98
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:55,620
is something you can appreciate there's a value there's

99
00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:04,940
a rightness of peacefulness in how you're aware

100
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:13,799
maybe awareness is not hijacked by selfish assertion or

101
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:17,720
self criticism

102
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:26,480
awareness is receptive open

103
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:34,679
this has a room to experience whatever is happening in

104
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:37,158
the present

105
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,039
in whatever sense you have of awareness that has this

106
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,320
goodness to it or rightness to it

107
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:57,419
consider what it's like now to be aware this way

108
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:04,519
of other people of others when you're together laughs

109
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:12,600
maybe nothing's required of you you don't have to speak but is there some way to be aware

110
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:19,340
of others in this beneficial awareness

111
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:26,778
what's it like to be aware where you're giving room for other people to be as they are

112
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:33,740
we're being aware of them is not mixed up with

113
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:38,299
our desires and our aversions

114
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,620
our self-concerns

115
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:54,600
almost as if there's lots of room in our mind our hearts

116
00:28:54,600 --> 00:29:02,240
for others to be as they are and in all that room

117
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:08,299
then there's more space for our kindness our care

118
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:17,580
our good will for others and as we end this meditation

119
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:23,580
may the good will we have travel out

120
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:27,320
into the boundless space

121
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:34,100
of awareness Beyond awareness

122
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:39,860
may all beings be happy

123
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:47,120
may all beings be peaceful

124
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:56,840
may all beings be safe may all beings be free

125
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:03,799
and may we and how we're aware

126
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:16,039
support people in being free at least free of ourselves

127
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:40,278
thank you

128
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:33,659
so good morning good day so this is the fourth talk on why speech

129
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:40,020
and today's talk is about beneficial speech the Buddha gave five

130
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:45,240
criteria to be used as a reference point as a support for

131
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:53,100
wise speech and to repeat what we've done so far is um

132
00:31:53,100 --> 00:32:00,720
is to is that um and now my mind just went blank

133
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,059
is it um like I

134
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:11,640
yeah so that's amazing to have a mind that can't recall just a little bit

135
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:19,260
about coming out of meditation right now that uh the um the words are not quite here yet

136
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:28,020
but today's talk is is the speech beneficial and the

137
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:34,500
so uh the question then is when we're about to

138
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:40,679
speak or when we're speaking it does it have a good impact does it have the intent is it beneficial what

139
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:46,320
we're doing is it helpful to have a conversation

140
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:54,960
and the the question is that is one that makes us consider what is it

141
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:00,679
we want to accomplish is it um

142
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:08,960
timely that's where the timely is it true is it uh

143
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:16,019
Pleasant is it something that people the way we speak

144
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:21,299
it is in a way that people will listen with a feeling that this is coming

145
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:26,399
across with a kind supportive voice does it touch people's hearts what we're

146
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:31,440
going to say but is it beneficial and there are certainly times when we

147
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:38,820
feel that we need to speak what's true times we feel like you know you kind of

148
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:45,659
we think it's time to do it I mean we've been waiting for a long time or there's can't be any other time

149
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:51,480
and we might feel that it's uh you know yes we're going to do this in a in a

150
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:59,100
in a kind way Gentle Way and um but the person we're speaking to

151
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:05,279
is not capable of hearing this of registering it of taking it in

152
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:11,220
and uh and no matter how much we think it's true how much we think that yes it

153
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:18,440
has to be talked about the person is not to be capable the person's shut down the person is not

154
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:24,960
receptive in any kind of way and and so then to exhaust ourselves

155
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,780
trying to say trying to explain trying to find a way to kind of get in and make

156
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:36,419
ourselves heard is a waste of our own energy it's kind of harmful for us

157
00:34:36,419 --> 00:34:43,080
sometimes and sometimes it's hard to believe that people are not amenable to a

158
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:48,358
conversation not available to hear the truth not available to have a serious

159
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:53,398
conversation and so you know we keep trying and keep

160
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:58,619
trying and but there are times when it's not

161
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:03,859
beneficial to have a conversation with someone sometimes it's not beneficial it's it's

162
00:35:03,859 --> 00:35:10,740
because there'll be retribution they'll be angry they'll be upset then we know if we

163
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:17,700
bring something up there's a they don't have it that's that's what's going to come back maybe because they're in a bad

164
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:25,280
mood and you kind of feel that there's a you know a Angry Cloud over the person

165
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:32,640
and if we if you come talk to them about something you feel is really necessary to talk about they're going to just kind

166
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:37,700
of react in such a strong way that makes the whole thing worse

167
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:43,920
uh some people are just too guarded and defensive that they're not going to

168
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:50,940
lower their guard they're not going to allow any kind of valuable any kind of truthful conversation to happen they'll

169
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:57,900
just shut down they'll avoid they'll deny so at some point it becomes a waste of

170
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:03,960
time at some point it no longer becomes beneficial at some point it's actually harmful

171
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:10,800
there's people who use the truth to harm people and so I'm just saying I'm just speaking

172
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:17,460
the truth sometimes people are receptive and ready to hear

173
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:24,300
something hear the truth but the way we say it is so harsh so judgmental in it

174
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:29,339
that because of how we're saying it is not beneficial

175
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:35,339
and and so if what you're saying is not going to be beneficial the Buddha says

176
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:41,760
don't bother uh don't exhaust yourself when it's not beneficial

177
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:48,480
and this goes back to the question of timeliness is that sometimes you have to wait a

178
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:55,440
long time before someone is ready and receptive and uh there's something that something

179
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:01,020
has a shift and change in their lives and so sometimes there's the wisdom of waiting

180
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:06,420
sometimes the truth is true but we

181
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:13,740
haven't learned how to say it we haven't learned all the details we haven't learned all the aspects of it that we

182
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:18,839
it's true what the piece of it we know but we don't know the bigger picture

183
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:24,359
and and so for example one way is that the event what's happened between the

184
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:32,220
person has done what we can see the action the person has done might seem terribly misguided or wrong

185
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:37,320
but uh so it's true to point that out to them but what we don't know is

186
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:44,099
internally the challenges they're living under maybe they feel really afraid maybe they

187
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:50,040
feel insecure maybe they've had just had a terrible loss that they're grieving a

188
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:55,800
grieving with and so coming with the truth or the

189
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:02,460
action it really misses the person and so the truth doesn't work in the circumstance

190
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:09,420
where someone's inner life is in turmoil they're difficult so is there more truth to open up to do

191
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:15,240
we have to take time to get to know the person better what's happening and then to

192
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:21,359
um to uh you know to be gentle and kind even gentleness and kindness this

193
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:29,400
doesn't come across well to some people so so one of the ways to find our way

194
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:37,440
with speech is to not come assertively not begin our speech with being very

195
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:44,280
assertively or aggressive but to begin with simple questions that

196
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:49,980
tries to understand what's going on in a bigger way what happened what was happening to you what was happening with

197
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:58,560
you when you did X or I'm you know I was really troubled by what happened before and I you know you

198
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:05,640
know can you can you what was from your point of view what was that happened there when um you know when

199
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:12,660
you you said to me you know that x y and z so don't come immediately with

200
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:18,900
assertions and like as if you know what's going on but uh ask simple kind

201
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:24,060
of almost innocent questions to find out more discover more what was like for

202
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:32,460
that was hard yesterday what was going on for you or how was that for you and and um and then as you start unpacking

203
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:37,980
and learning what's going on then you might learn oh what's beneficial well

204
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:45,660
that's just that is beneficial to get to know the person better and learn what's going on and then slowly kind of fill in the

205
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:52,200
picture of all the pieces that you're missing of what was going on for the person and then once you understand a person

206
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:58,320
better then you can have a better sense of the beneficial way to speak to them

207
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:03,480
and um and maybe you know more you could offer

208
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:10,440
an appreciation or some gratitude or or some some empathy for how they are

209
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:18,180
and only then is it beneficial to speak so so to not go ahead log into a

210
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:24,359
conversation but find a way to ease into a difficult conversation if possible

211
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:30,480
so is is what I'm going to say beneficial

212
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:36,780
and maybe you're unsure about it so in that case maybe you go about in the

213
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:42,960
roundabout way maybe you find other things to talk about for a while that are beneficial or

214
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:48,839
are supportive or are connecting that creates a kind of more richer relationship

215
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:56,520
and after after a while of doing that then you switch over I've been in conflict with people and

216
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:02,040
um and have asked to meet with them and sat down and have said like before we're

217
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:08,579
going to talk about this challenge we have can we just check in with each other I'd like to know how you are and what you're up to these days what's

218
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:14,820
going on for you and that now I've entered the conversation in a more beneficial way beneficial for me maybe

219
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:20,280
beneficial to the other person that now I'm just trying to establish a human connection and get to know the person

220
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:27,720
better and what's going on and once that's established then it's okay you know now you know I'm ready to

221
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:33,420
talk about our challenge that we have if I started to do it immediately

222
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:38,460
then um it would have been challenging to um

223
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:44,339
to do it and and finally is it beneficial to

224
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:51,480
speak it isn't only what's beneficial for the other person but what's beneficial for us and are we in a

225
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:56,520
situation are we in a state of mind state of heart where having the

226
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:03,839
conversation is going to be beneficial and uh and do I need to somehow

227
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:10,500
uh come come in a different mood or come more rested or become more not so

228
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:15,780
charged from the events that are going on do I need to walk around the block so

229
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:23,099
I can come back and be available in a beneficial way so even though it's it's timely even

230
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:28,800
though it's true even though we can speak gently even with that

231
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:35,640
um it addressing certain challenging topics might not we might not be in a

232
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:43,800
state where we can benefit from it or where we're not triggered and get exhausted or we are somehow agitated or

233
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:48,839
over activated by it so this question of benefit is it

234
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:54,599
beneficial is it useful and finally it's also connected to the purpose that we

235
00:42:54,599 --> 00:43:00,119
have for the conversation is the pr to ask ourselves why what's my

236
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:05,160
intention in speaking here what am I trying to accomplish am I trying to put the person in their

237
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:11,640
place am I trying to jab the person with as uh you know with my anger or my

238
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:19,200
criticism to harm them am I trying to find a way to understand them better and

239
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:26,280
by trying to establish some kind of richer human connection with the person what's the intention

240
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:33,060
and to ask ourselves what's the purpose that I want to speak and is that purpose beneficial

241
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:39,359
and if you have one answer what the purpose ask again and if that's the purpose what purpose do I have that

242
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:45,300
purpose for to really be clear that the purpose you have is beneficial

243
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:50,400
and I'd like to propose and this is the way I like to live my life

244
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:57,380
is it beneficial for everyone concerned can we be have the welfare of everyone

245
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:03,359
on our minds and so for certainly our own welfare but

246
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:09,720
what is best for the person even if this person has done something that's been harmful to us

247
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:15,240
within reason there are times where what's best for this person this person

248
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:20,300
really needs something and needs to just having the person stop what they're doing

249
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:27,060
or tell the person the piece of our mind um is that really what's beneficial for

250
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:33,000
them and so this concern for the welfare of everyone

251
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:39,540
and that's what the Buddha championed is this anacampa this care where we care

252
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:45,900
for the welfare and happiness of everyone even the people we're challenged with

253
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:53,700
so um to to keep in mind this

254
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:59,400
guideline is it beneficial and it's a multi-dimensional aspect to ask that

255
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:06,240
question so as you go about your day today you might um consider this

256
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:12,900
and before and after you speak you might look for times but when you know you're going to say something or you're going

257
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:18,960
off to have a conversation with someone to spend some time in a request what's beneficial here what's beneficial for

258
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:25,800
myself what's beneficial for the other what's is the purpose of the conversation beneficial is how I'm going

259
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:32,640
to have it can be beneficial and then also do that after the conversation after it's all over review

260
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:39,000
what happened and consider was that beneficial how is that beneficial did I miss an

261
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,059
opportunity there and all that

262
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:49,560
so um may your conversations be beneficial for

263
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:57,060
all involved may they be helpful and may it be a way of living your life

264
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:02,760
to that such a way that brings you greater peace greater well-being

265
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,420
thank you
