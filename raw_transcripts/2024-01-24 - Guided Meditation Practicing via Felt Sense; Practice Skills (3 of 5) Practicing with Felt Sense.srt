1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,519
we start with a sound of a bell for our

2
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:28,480
meditation pausing to let the sound of the Bell fade

3
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,960
away

4
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,800
pausing with a momentary

5
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,320
mindfulness being

6
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,239
present

7
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:06,159
aware maybe being present with the

8
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,600
sound being present with the

9
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,360
thoughts being present with a global sense of a body

10
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,159
sitting or lying

11
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,840
down

12
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,680
pausing to allow an alchemical process to

13
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,680
unfold

14
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:06,119
naturally arriving Here and

15
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:19,480
Now what is the felt sense of arriving for

16
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:36,040
you just a feeling just

17
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:45,550
sensing words are not [Music]

18
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:05,560
necessary for me there is a felt sense of in or slowing

19
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:21,200
down some energetic feel of energy settling

20
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:31,680
downwards or the body resting down and resting back

21
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,560
back arriving Here and

22
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,680
Now

23
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:11,360
a feeling and sensing is innate

24
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:20,880
capacity within the body within this very

25
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,960
being we simply become available to

26
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:41,639
allow this being to feel and to

27
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,560
sense

28
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:15,520
being available have a particular felt sense

29
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,840
to

30
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,479
it

31
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:42,840
maybe there is a kind of a deeper relaxation and

32
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:58,199
opening a sense of openness in the heart

33
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,520
space in the

34
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:24,240
body being available feels like

35
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
this

36
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,280
it's as if my nerve systems can

37
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
relax

38
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,198
my breath can flow more

39
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:22,759
EAS and the sensations in the body have more

40
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:26,960
room to dance their

41
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
dance

42
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:48,720
And the emotions and thoughts have a lots of a space around

43
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
them

44
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,080
the felt sense of a being

45
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,560
available is unique to

46
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:31,240
you at this moment

47
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,040
my words are just some

48
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:05,240
poters at your own home felt sense is a whole

49
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:21,079
field don't let my words are your own

50
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:27,160
limit the whole field of the felt

51
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
sense

52
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,040
from there's a field of

53
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,360
availability inviting

54
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:45,120
aligning aligning with our

55
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:51,000
aspirations deepest

56
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
intentions

57
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:12,680
aligning with our heart's wish to be

58
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:25,360
free noticing how aligning feel distinctly

59
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:35,200
different from available and

60
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,800
arriving staying with a felt sense of

61
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
aligning

62
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:09,360
I often feel a slight straight straightening

63
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:17,120
up of my spine as I

64
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,320
align kind of inner

65
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:30,879
uplift sense of dignity

66
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,440
a wholesome

67
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:04,040
feeling aligning feels like

68
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,160
this right now

69
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,800
here there may be a felt sense of a grounding

70
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,240
or grounded coming

71
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:45,839
in when we feel we're aligned with our deepest

72
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,079
intentions our hearts can be at

73
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,759
ease maybe even slight happiness

74
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,440
maybe a kind of a

75
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,680
trust aligning with the Buddha Dharma and

76
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,399
s aligning with the Noble eight-fold

77
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
Path

78
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,920
stay with a felt

79
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:30,160
sense our body knows

80
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,600
her heart

81
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
knows

82
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,839
sometimes right here being aligned and

83
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:16,839
available there can be a sense of

84
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:23,680
collected composed and

85
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,519
unified

86
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:56,560
the felt sense of the body can come forth

87
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
vividly

88
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,799
sounds become

89
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:30,400
clear in silence are pable

90
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:56,759
from this aligned and available

91
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:04,559
field open to

92
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:13,600
receive the felt sense in the

93
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,039
body and our

94
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,519
emotions and the

95
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
mind

96
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,840
you may choose to stay with the felt sense in the

97
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,600
body your FAL sense in the

98
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:04,679
breath the flow of the

99
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,400
breath

100
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:15,919
movements

101
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:30,600
vibrations or simply staying what it Al

102
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,480
liess that's right

103
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
here

104
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,579
[Music]

105
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:54,600
where I am the sound of horing

106
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:59,880
rain is very full

107
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:29,799
vibrant when we [Music] touching we alive vibrant

108
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:39,440
receptive field there can be a kind of a

109
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,119
tenderness it's [Music]

110
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
enlightening

111
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,200
in this last moments of our meditation

112
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:39,519
together reconnect with the felt sense of being

113
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:42,880
available and

114
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:59,320
aligned what does it feel like right now

115
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:15,640
for me a wave of gratitude come

116
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:24,320
forth knowing that we can always

117
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:31,278
return to this ground of being available and

118
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,170
aligned [Applause]

119
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:32,880
so so wonderful to be with you all

120
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:42,200
um it was really nice to sit in the pouring ring I just notice

121
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:49,240
that let me start to uh lightening up slightly where I

122
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,320
am so today I brought yet another PR

123
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:04,039
practice a skill to share and this is um practicing with

124
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:12,000
felt sense you've heard me a lot using this

125
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,919
phrase um this last few days

126
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:23,639
repeatedly when I first heard this phrase repeatedly on a retreat some

127
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:29,720
years ago that are offered by uh the teacher Philip

128
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:37,600
mfet and he would use this again and again um at some point I thought to

129
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:43,039
myself wow he really meant

130
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:51,519
it so you've been hearing me saying this phrase again and again and I'll say that

131
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:57,960
I really made it practicing with the felt sense

132
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:06,440
so why am I emphasizing a lot um this practicing with the felt sense

133
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:13,919
is based on a recognition I think of many teachers um or practitioners would

134
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:20,279
recognize at some point that um we often practice

135
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:26,000
mindfulness and practice meditation from a very head centered

136
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:34,320
orientation we lead our our meditation uh from Concepts ideas

137
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:40,440
beliefs that we have uh we think we're supposed to uh be

138
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:47,440
with the breath and then we just kind of a manage and direct somehow um from a

139
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:55,919
very conceptual framework G sometimes so we use this phrase that or this say this and that we

140
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:03,799
tend to have a control tower approach uh in our meditation and I resonated with that a

141
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:11,158
lot um I know for myself and the first um probably one of

142
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:18,800
the first major breakthrough of my meditation is to come un

143
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:27,158
awareness that um I was really shoehorning my breath into the way that

144
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:34,118
I thought it is supposed to be using my mind using my head and I was doing it so

145
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:39,720
much from this control tower that I was literally suffocating

146
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:49,200
myself it was not until I recognized that that was happening and all of sudden something

147
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:55,280
happened I realized oh this doesn't

148
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:03,960
work I have to let loose of this control tower approach or practicing from this

149
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:09,720
conceptual framework so that opened a whole new

150
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:18,560
gradual training gradual learning to let loose um of this orientation of a

151
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:25,800
practicing and I think I am not particularly unique uh many people have

152
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:34,320
um uh come to recognition that this was kind of a deeply rooted tendency in

153
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:43,240
US U Philip in one of his books uh spoke about um uh the effect of a practicing

154
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:48,880
um or importance of a practicing with a felt sense and I want to read uh this

155
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:55,720
little portion here and so he said learning to access the felt sense of the

156
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:03,160
larger dimension ality of a body and mind such that you're able to

157
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:11,440
disengage from Deep seated habits of viewing yourself and the world strictly

158
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:20,359
in Concepts you may not even realize how much of your inner experience even in

159
00:36:20,359 --> 00:36:26,920
meditation is based on conceptualizing such that your thinking

160
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:36,200
mind is acting as a filter between your perceived and your actual

161
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:48,359
experience um this is a really deep rooted force

162
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:53,560
and tendency um we human beings kind of

163
00:36:53,560 --> 00:37:01,720
learned this mode of operating from very young so it's not a mistake

164
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:08,040
and that somehow we're operating in this way even when we come to

165
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:17,880
meditation and yet there is a cost when we live uh in the world of Concepts and

166
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:24,359
ideas we want to recognize that the thinking Logics a

167
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:31,680
conceptualization is one aspect ECT of Being Human but there is also a broader

168
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:40,240
dimension of Being Human that is not boxed up only by Concepts and

169
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:49,599
ideas so when we're strictly living through our um uh ideas and beliefs we

170
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:54,319
can be at odd with our actual

171
00:37:55,079 --> 00:38:01,880
experience the concept and ideas can last for a long time but the actual

172
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:07,920
experiences of what the concepts are pointing to may be changing very

173
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:15,119
rapidly and so for example uh the idea that I am an angry

174
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:22,680
person that's an idea it can last for a long time maybe for sometimes a lifetime

175
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:28,520
you know we kind of identify by that but in

176
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:35,280
reality that's not even possible we can't be angry at all the

177
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:42,800
time that's not possible and that our system is not functioning like that but

178
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:50,000
we can lock ourselves um by the boxes of the

179
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:57,520
ideas and so that's a form of imprisonment it's duka you in opposite

180
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:04,760
of a freedom and so um learning to uh

181
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:10,480
practice with this um felt sense way is

182
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:18,760
a wonderful approach to un unwind this kind of a conditioning that we view or

183
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:24,960
relate to the world uh through con conceptual

184
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:31,079
Frameworks and so we're cultivating practicing with a felt sense and that

185
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:37,560
allow us to gradually come in harmony with the reality of our

186
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:45,480
experiences or in the Dharma phe or come in harmony with the way things

187
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:53,880
are rather than trying to shoehorn the reality into the boxes of our

188
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:59,880
ideas so how do we do that uh in our guided

189
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:04,960
meditation um in the way we're kind of already doing

190
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:10,960
it um we can become available to what's

191
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:18,280
here and there is a kind of a deep trust in this inner capacity of Being Human

192
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:25,680
that can feel our way can sense our way and this is a kind of a primal capacity

193
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:31,480
in US um even right now for

194
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:39,680
example as we sit here maybe listening to the words if you just

195
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,960
pause take a moment to feel and sense what's

196
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:53,200
here what's happening for me I immediately know

197
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:59,760
there is a felt sense even though I may not necessarily have a words for them I

198
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:07,359
may not be able to describe it right away but it doesn't Trump the reality of

199
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:14,040
feeling something and sensing something and sometimes the clear

200
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:21,079
recognition can come forth as I'm staying with the felt

201
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:31,480
sense and so from the perspective of our practice it's totally okay and valid for

202
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:38,800
us to just feel and sense without the necessities of

203
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,680
immediately trying to describe what is

204
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:53,520
happening and as the recognition comes forth let it

205
00:41:53,520 --> 00:42:00,839
be sometimes the recognition can come forth forth with uh images sometimes

206
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:07,560
words uh sometimes visuals that's all valid and this form

207
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:15,200
of recognition is a natural emergence a kind of bubbling up from the depth of

208
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:21,480
our being from the reality of our experience instead of a top down you

209
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:27,760
know kind of a we're imposing something on our experience so you can see see the

210
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:34,599
difference here right and as we practice this way what

211
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:40,680
can happen is we're dropping out of

212
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:46,400
directing our meditation we're letting the way things

213
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:52,480
be letting the way things are to be what it

214
00:42:52,480 --> 00:43:01,200
is and as we drop below our sort of abstract thinking mind um things can get

215
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:08,400
rather simple andir direct we're less caught up by the

216
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:15,160
stories of our experience a lot of a wanting mind and not wanting mind tends

217
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:25,079
to come from the conceptual stories that we have and so um it's actually uh more

218
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:31,359
conducive for us to get collected unified

219
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:40,078
composed and another way of saying that is it's conducive to

220
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:49,440
somebody or or a wealth of inner beauty like a delight happiness and

221
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:55,400
easeful tranquility and as we stay in this

222
00:43:55,400 --> 00:44:02,440
territory what can also happen is our knowing our

223
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:09,760
awareness can become more clear because we're less jammed up by uh the rapid

224
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:15,920
thinking or storytelling and so as we stay in this

225
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:21,240
felt sense Things become more and more

226
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:26,920
clear we can allow more intuitive kind of knowing

227
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:34,520
to surface to Bubble Up and so in this way felt sense is also

228
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:40,750
conducive uh to insights more intuitive kind of

229
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:46,040
[Music] knowing and so my invitation for the

230
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:51,200
rest of the day um is um if you wish

231
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:57,960
maybe exploring feeling and sensing

232
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:06,480
um uh the way and that you're going about your life and uh without necessarily making

233
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:12,280
the conceptual Ling and and and cognizing a problem we're simply

234
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:19,319
recognizing that uh we're opening to a broader perspective of Being

235
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:24,559
Human and allow all of those Dimensions to come

236
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:32,280
alive and so so may you open to all the different dimensions of Being

237
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:40,960
Human and so thank you for your attention May our practice benefit

238
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,720
ourselves and benefit the whole

239
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,960
world
