00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:25,760
practice um we're going to practice turn our attention turn our heart to the

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:32,558

6
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:38,200
heart Gladden the mind um both for our lives and for the

7
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:46,199
benefit of other practices that we do it's it's an important practice and just to bring it to context since the

8
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:51,960
beginning of the year we've been going through the four Brahma viharas in order

9
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,800
spending time with meta with all the categories the concentric circles we

10
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:03,320
spend plenty of time with Aruna compassion the concentric circles

11
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:11,680
expanding expanding our heart and now perfect for a Friday we have just made

12
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:18,360
our way into the next Brahma vihara which is mudita vicarious

13
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,560
Joy um sympathetic Joy different ways it's it's

14
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:31,119
translated I'll say a couple of words about the practice before we start and of course similarly we'll go through

15
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:36,920
this in the next days through the different categories practicing

16
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:47,640
exploring expanding little by little so the practice of mudita mud in

17
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:54,079
poly is the practice of when meta which is

18
00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:02,920
Goodwill kindness consider kindness meeting someone who in a neutral s position in

19
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:10,319
life not really happy not really unhappy it expresses itself as Goodwill may you be safe may you be

20
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:18,440
happy now the same Goodwill if it comes in contact with

21
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:24,920
someone who's suffering it expresses itself as compassion may you be free from

22
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:33,360
suffering may you have ease now the same meta good willll same

23
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,920
warm-heartedness friendliness same emotion same

24
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:46,959
sense um same sentiment let's call a sentiment if it comes in contact it

25
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:53,280
touches someone who's actually has blessings in their lives is Happy it

26
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,400
expresses itself as mudita may you be may your happiness

27
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:06,159
continue you I'm happy for your happiness yay may your happiness never

28
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:12,519
end so there's a sense of celebration of goodness in the world there's a sense of

29
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:21,480
happiness for another person's happiness so that's one way to think of mudita and

30
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:27,319
um the Dalai Lama says if you're only happy for your own Good Fortune you have

31
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:34,040
one out of seven billion chance of being happy but if you cultivate happiness for

32
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:41,640
other people's happiness your chances increase to seven billion because each

33
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:47,640
being each being has something they're happy about some good fortune it may not

34
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:54,439
be everything in their lives so so it's best again we start this

35
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:59,879
practice where it's easiest where it's easiest for us

36
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:07,959
and tonight the invitation will be to start with someone whom you naturally

37
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:13,400
feel happy for yay I'm happy for your happiness and

38
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:21,880
again they don't need to be happy in every aspect of their life but one aspect one blessing in their life that

39
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:28,639
that you celebrate with them you're just happy for them when they call you up they tell you or they share with you you

40
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:37,720
just you being with gladness for them as if it were your own goodness so we start where it's

41
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:43,600
easiest and one thing to say is that the

42
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:50,160
um um this practice the uh near enemy

43
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,400
and far enemy the near enemy of this practice um actually I'll talk about the

44
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,919
far enemy which is Envy which can come up which um again if it comes

45
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:10,280
up um Turn The Meta to yourself because in that moment meta becomes compassion

46
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:19,039
you're holding yourself with oh sweetie you really want this thing and you don't have it a so so it

47
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:25,080
becomes um compassion for yourself so as long as you practiced

48
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,160
kindness um in turned into any way

49
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,720
as long as you practice kindness uh Express kindness for and kindness

50
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,800
celebrating someone else's Good Fortune kindness turn to compassion for yourself

51
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,720
if eny comes up you're doing this practice right okay all right

52
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:55,520
so so let's get started those are the framing commentary for tonight let's get

53
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,759
started so like to invite you now to get into your medit meditation

54
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:09,680
posture ah you may need to shift and move lie down which is perfectly fine if

55
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:16,840

56
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,759

increase may it never

154
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:57,399
end knowing we know there is impermanence but yet we share this wish

as a way to cultivate cultivate Good Will and gladness in our heart for

156
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:09,919
others it's an aspirational

157
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:21,519
practice aspiring to share our good will not attached to the outcome of it in the

158
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:29,159
world that it will be this way it that it will never end

159
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:36,520

make you feel bring them alive in your mind's

165
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:26,760
eye through gladness and see how that brings up the gladness in your

166
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:31,960
heart pillar one leads to pillar two

167
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:42,320
naturally you can share out of pillar two this felt sense of gladness for them can share the

168
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,480
phrases as a blessing for

169
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:55,200

happy may your good fortune continue may it increase may it never

173
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:27,679
end whatever version works for you best

174
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:39,320
by connec by repeating the phrases of

175
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:46,200
choice you can keep connected to the

176
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,279
practice like a thread continuity can

177
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:55,840
develop see what works best for

178
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,080
you for

179
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:56,039
you can connect the phrases with the rhythm of your

180
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:02,279
breathing as if the good good wishes the good Wills coming out of your heart

181
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:08,519
center the middle of your chest shared

182

e

184
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:29,919
e

185
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,880
e e

186
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:50,639
and if at any point the for enemy the opposite Envy

187
00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:59,240
arises it's okay it's a practice of cultivation turn your m uh your good

188
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:06,880
will towards the suffering of the Envy let it hold yourself with compassion if

189
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,480
that should

190
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,600
arise otherwise may your good

end e

194
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,480
perhaps visualizing visualizing seeing this dear being

195

creative in your imagination in your visualization

199
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:18,440
and for the last moment of this

200
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:25,359

appreciation appreciation for yourself you showed up you

203
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:44,920
tried and if mudita vicarious Joy showed up even for one Split

204
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:50,319
Second in this practice yay celebrate

205
00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:56,599
that as a seed planted without judgment or anything else that might have

206
00:36:56,599 --> 00:37:06,680
happened but just to celebrate you showed up you inclined your mind towards

207
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:11,119
goodness and generosity of

208
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:18,440
spirit yay may all beings everywhere be

209
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:24,760
happy and free including us

210
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:42,279
thanks everyone thank you for your

211
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:52,520
practice I have to say with the practice of mudita vicarious Joy it is a happy

212
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:58,400
making practice it is a happy making practice and

213
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:04,599
um having practice with you I feel happier now and again might be different

214
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:13,359
for different people but as I sense there's a sense of more abundance more joy in my heart as I check

215
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:21,520
in there's a smile showing up on my face that wasn't here before so it's nice to

216
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:28,079
check in and take a pulse and see what's happening in your heart in your mind so

217
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:34,880
so we have time for some Reflections if you like to share you can raise your

218
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:40,280
hand uh the reactions or you can uh type

219
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:46,760
in chat if there are questions comments Reflections what did you notice what did

220
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:53,240
You observe um what was challenging what was

221
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:58,400
easy would love to hear and have you share

222
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:05,640
your wisdom and with the community especially if you haven't shared for a while or if you're new would love to

223
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,519
hear from you

224
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:24,760
so yes okay so I have a question and by the way if you send me questions

225
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:31,319
privately I won't say your name if you send them to public I'll say your name so question coming what is the near

226
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:36,720
enemy of mudita I said I would I kind of mentioned it at the

227
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:43,520
beginning so um the near enemy which is what masquerades as Mita they're

228
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:52,640
different ones one is sense of Pride where there's a sense of oh um my child

229
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:59,800
or my friend or oh as if you're really taking birth you're becoming this

230
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:06,319
instead of your generosity of heart sharing your gladness as a gift for them

231
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:13,560
there's a sense of Pride the self kind of takes takes Center Stage so pride is

232
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:19,400
one one of the near enemies the other one um

233
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:25,599
um is um exuberance and this is a fun one

234
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:31,680
actually exuberance is when there is so much mud there's so much gladness that

235
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:36,760
it's almost like you become Punch Drunk on gladness and kind of lose your

236
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:42,720
stability and your settledness um so because mudita can be

237
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:48,839
bubbly but when it just goes a little too overboard it doesn't have the

238
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:55,880
stability of gladness it becomes a little too um yeah it's it's overe

239
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:00,920
exuberance so that's an couple I like to mention tonight and somebody raised

240
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:10,400
their hand and their hand disappeared who was it who had raised their hand please raise your hand

241
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:19,240
again Monica please everyone

242
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:27,079
Hi um yeah I really appreciated how at the beginning of the talk you pointed

243
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:33,359
that The Meta can manifest different ways mudito or karuna and when I sat

244
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:39,440
down and close my eyes I realized I had a lot of pain um physical and emotional

245
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:46,240
pain that I've just been neglecting for a long time and I wanted so much to do the mudita but I thought it was more I

246
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:53,240
saw it showing up more as karuna so I focused on that and I feel I feel that friendliness much more towards my

247
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:59,240
experience feel more present and I feel that kindness so thank you so much oh

248
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:06,000
terrific thank you Monica I so appreciate hearing your inner wisdom

249
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,839

250
00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:18,079
called here right now is the physical emotional pain so hey I'm going to turn

251

257
00:42:58,359 --> 00:43:03,160
question reflection anything it's all

258
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:17,240
good anything you notice that surpris you about this

259
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:30,720
practice either in a challenging way or more easeful

260
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:40,640
[Music] way Neil

261
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:47,359
please I was surprised at how difficult I found this uhuh you know you know it

262
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:53,559
it just you know it just wasn't like a lot of feeling that I felt you know it

263
00:43:53,559 --> 00:43:58,880
was just altogether sort of awkward you know you know there was some jealousy at

264
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:06,040
some point which you know surprised the heck out of me um because you know I I don't you know I can't say I felt

265
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:13,280
jealous of this person or you know whatever was going on before um yeah

266
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:20,559
yeah it was you know it was surprising to me that giving compassion over someone feeling pain seems so much

267
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:27,119
easier than this yeah yeah thank you Neil I am so

268
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:34,200
grateful you brought this up um and all of these practices these four

269
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:40,160
Brahma viharas are also considered purification practices so that as you

270
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:45,960
were saying oh I didn't realize there was jealousy Envy in this relationship

271
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:54,160
but here it is it showed up how interesting how interesting is that without any judgment so these practices

272
00:44:54,160 --> 00:45:00,000
as purification practices will unearth will bring up things we kind of there

273
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,760
but they'll bring them up to our attention um so that they can be purified so that we can be with them

274
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:12,920
otherwise they they are already there we just don't turn our attention to to them

275
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:18,160
and another thing is that different practices might be easier or harder so

276
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:24,760
um right now in this shape for form karuna compassion is an easier one for

277
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:31,880
you and this one oh it's my head so not to say that it's always going to be your Edge but okay this right now in this

278
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:38,520
form this is what can be cultivated in the same way I trust some I trust other

279
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:44,640
practices had a little bit of Edge and as you did them the heart opened up and

280
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:50,800
they became easier and purification happened it sounds like this might be

281
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:56,960
the new way or the New Frontier of stretching a little bit gently gently

282
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:05,720
stretching so I so appreciate you saying that naming it and I invite you as you

283
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:13,960
would expect Neil for you to hang in with this ever so gently not pushing yourself too hard but but trusting that

284
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:20,960
the heart can purify and EXT extend in its um generosity of spirit with this

285
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:27,240
practice I'm actually I'm going to say I'm glad for you that it's so nice when we find our edges if it was easy easy if

286
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:34,800
it was all easy right we would be uh there there wouldn't be any places

287
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:42,240
to grow so now you have become aware rather I want to say you've become aware of this area of your heart that can use

288
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:48,520
more cultivation as if you know one finds a muscle in the gym like oh look at this muscle this one needs a little

289
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:55,680
more work the rest of them are kind of you know strong but this one oh can can use some more practice so thanks for

290
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:01,200
bringing that up Neil thank you thank

291
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:10,960
you so okay um one a comment sent to me and it's a

292
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:16,800
longer one I need to read but time is flying so in order to have enough time

293
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:24,119
for our practice in small groups let me introduce them and open the rooms so

294
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:31,359
what I like to invite us to practice with in the small groups tonight is

295
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:39,040
first um the um maybe spending 30 seconds with

296
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:44,880
meta for each other 30 seconds of Silence just looking at each other

297
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:52,280
holding each other with meta and Goodwill and knowing that you're being held with goodwi and then you can share

298
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:59,839
um as little or as much as you wish about your practice um and appreciating

299
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:07,079
the wisdom of the community so I'm going to create the and and if you haven't

300
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:14,520
done the breakout rooms or you're on the edge you're scared of them the community is really really nice so I I really

301
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:21,240
recommend and suggest you hang in there and you hang in here and you um

302
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:27,880
um yeah you you you try you stay and let's see I'm trying to speak and create

303
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:34,450
the groups at the same time doesn't always work okay here we go all right so

304
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:40,680
[Music] um here we go okay so I've created the rooms

305
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:46,200
and check it out see what it's like here we

306
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:51,599
go and everyone is back welcome back

307
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:57,319
everyone um so there was couple of quick question

308
00:48:57,319 --> 00:49:03,760
sent one is how does one deal with exuberance asked Genie you notice it you

309
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:11,440
notice there's exuberance and you kind of settle and and um arrive

310
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:18,119
back into the grounding be grounded in this this and then another question was

311
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:25,119
asked um do you have to use phrases or is it easier uh um or is it okay to just

312
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:31,200
focus on the feeling it's fine to Fus focus on the feeling if if the word if wordless works better for you there's

313
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:36,920
there are no shs in this practice so let's take one reflection um if you

314
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:44,599
haven't spoken we'd love to hear from you how how was the groups for you how was the experience for you of practicing

315
00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:49,960
Community can type it in chat or raise your hand especially if

316

other traditions and you that ascribe other but here we only really do it for
