00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:09,440
hello everyone and welcome to this week's

2
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,560
time together to sit and to explore the Dharma thank you for being here I'm delighted

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,380
to be back after being gone for a month and um

4
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,779
feels very kind of like a homecoming in a certain way to come back to IMC and

5
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:36,960
sit here and and to be able to be together with you this way

6
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:44,399
reflecting on the Dharma so thank you and um

7
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,700
some of you I'm sure remember that uh in the weeks that I was here before

8
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,579
being gone for a month the overall topic was compassion

9
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:02,399
and that I had divided uh compassion into five different aspects

10
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:09,540
with the idea that if we're aware of the richness of these different aspects that compassion becomes more embodied becomes

11
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:16,439
more considered more wholehearted more wise and considered

12
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:23,460
and practical useful and if we don't have these five things in mind it's very easy for us to have a

13
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:29,159
narrow idea of what compassion is and maybe have it be a call to action that

14
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:35,360
maybe isn't always so wise so these five were

15
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:44,040
General categories are awareness um Attunement appreciation aspiration and

16
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,920
action and action being the last one we often associate compassion with the need to

17
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,759
act quickly or that but to have this be the last after if there's time some kind

18
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:03,780
of deeper consideration and then I was going through each of these five five days on each of them

19
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:09,599
and now we're at aspiration and um

20
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:15,480
an aspiration is a beautiful quality I love the word aspiration and I'll talk

21
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:22,319
more about that later but for now and maybe perhaps we can consider

22
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:30,120
aspiration as a kind of Desire that uh fuels a certain inspiration a certain

23
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:37,620
motivation that is not tied to the outcome

24
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:43,800
it's kind of a little bit like a a wish that certain things something happen

25
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,080
and come with me or we act you can act on an aspiration it's not just wishful

26
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:55,700
thinking um but uh it uh it has a kind of open-handedness an

27
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:03,739
open-mindedness to it that um both it sustains can sustain in action

28
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:10,739
and not have us tripped up around the expectation and the of what will happen

29
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:19,500
or should happen so the same thing with sitting and meditation that we can have aspiration

30
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:25,200
for sitting and being present there's many aspirations for sitting in

31
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:33,780
meditation but in mindfulness practice the aspiration to be mindful to be present with a kind of a Clarity of

32
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,120
awareness to what is here including if that means if there is a

33
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,000
lack of clarity and a lack of to be ability to be present a lot of distractions

34
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:54,360
um the aspiration to be present is even for a moment to recognize clearly oh I'm really

35
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,519
cloudy here in my mind or fuzzy and there's a lot of distractions and a lot

36
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:05,220
of thoughts and in that moment of recognition is the beginning of this if or fulfillment for

37
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:11,939
that moment of the aspiration to be present and then to Aspire to let that

38
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:19,620
aspiration the desire to be present to come from a deep place inside that's why the other so that we keep

39
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:25,620
coming back to that we keep being fueled by that and the fact that the aspiration comes

40
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:32,300
from the words uh for breathing in Latin maybe with every breath

41
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:39,780
every inhale the aspiration to be present that maybe is uh

42
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:48,500
found with every exhale so to assume a meditation posture

43
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:54,680
and to gently close your eyes if that's comfortable

44
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,400
and to take a few long slow deep breaths

45
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:07,580
relaxing on the exhale relaxing the body

46
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:22,680
the Deep inhale that aspires to be connected here to yourself

47
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:28,580
and relaxing the body and the on the exhale

48
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,440
and then letting your breathing return to normal

49
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,500
and perhaps before anything else what is your aspiration

50
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:53,460
sometimes we ask what is your inspiration or intention

51
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:58,979
what's your intention to for meditation but what's your aspiration

52
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:01,979
inspiration

53
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:12,360
and um and if you kind of drop in this

54
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:20,900
as deep as you can Within is there an aspiration and inspiration

55
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:28,319
in Latin aspiration means literally means to breathe kind of out

56
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:36,319
and inspiration I guess means to breathe in the two words are closely related

57
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:47,419
and then to relax further in your body

58
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,720
maybe on every exhale to relax the face

59
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,740
on the exhale the shoulders

60
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,240
on the exhale the belly

61
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:34,440
and perhaps also to relax the thinking mind

62
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,900
any contraction or tension

63
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:48,680
any tightness or pressure and thinking

64
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:58,160
or in mental efforting is there any mental efforting

65
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:15,560
that you can relax and soften maybe let go of

66
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:41,120
and then to sit quietly breathing with your body

67
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,959
allowing the body to breathe

68
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,820
which your body has done for a long time

69
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:04,100
and accompanying the breathing body

70
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:10,100
almost like you're making room in your body for breathing too

71
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,660
do its thing

72
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:41,459
and every inhale maybe connect to some deep sense of

73
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:46,620
aspiration might be a clear

74
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:52,279
wish or desire to be present to be here

75
00:09:53,040 --> 00:10:00,380
to be kind to be generous in being aware at the present moment

76
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:05,899
or it could be an aspiration it doesn't have any words

77
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:17,339
it's there but it's not a clear that lent doesn't lend itself to a words

78
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:24,860
or clear idea and on the exhale

79
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:32,100
to be inspired to follow through on that aspiration to

80
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:37,560
give it space and room support you

81
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:42,200
to be here and mindful and present

82
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:02,420
perhaps your aspiration is modest

83
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:09,740
and that is it's something that can be fulfilled

84
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,079
with each breath

85
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:25,079
or can be fulfilled in a time it takes to breathe in or to breathe out

86
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:32,839
no bigger goal just this to be here

87
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,680
with some degree of clarity recognition

88
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:46,220
hear this now

89
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,260
thank you

90
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:14,720
what might be the aspiration the desire

91
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,240
that's carried along with each breath

92
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,880
foreign

93
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,360
and as we come to the end of this sitting

94
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:47,120
the dedication of Merit that's often done at the end of

95
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:53,039
practice is an aspiration

96
00:26:53,039 --> 00:27:00,179
an aspiration for the goodness the benefits of whatever practice we do

97
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:06,360
that we share it with others and it isn't that we lose it then

98
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:13,980
because it's shared with others it kind of gets magnified the benefits

99
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:20,100
because the heart opens generosity that

100
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:25,340
has room for others care and love

101
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:33,559
and may it be as we aspire

102
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:38,659
that not only our practice but our lives

103
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:46,639
are lived for the benefit of all including ourselves

104
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:53,840
recognizing maybe even that such an aspiration

105
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:00,179
does a tremendous benefit to ourselves to have it breaking through the shell of

106
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:04,919
self-centeredness and self-reoccupation

107
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:13,020
may it be that our time together this day meditating

108
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:18,900
in this community may we as individuals and as a community

109
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:26,778
consider ways that we take the benefits from this meditation

110
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:35,299
with us into the world so that we benefit

111
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:42,659
bring benefit for others with us with an aspiration a care and attention

112
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:50,299
to doing so may all beings

113
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:56,580
be happy may all beings

114
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:03,980
be safe may all beings be peaceful

115
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:09,320
and may all beings everywhere be free

116
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:17,840
and may we Inspire to see this happen to support this happen

117
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:34,949
[Music]

118
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,919
thank you

119
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:42,000
so hello everyone again and um topic for this week uh exploration of

120
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,299
compassion is the role of aspiration in compassion

121
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:54,200
a common definition of compassion is to

122
00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:00,779
recognize suffering in the world and to have a feeling for it to have a

123
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:08,520
kind of uh some kind of resonance with that suffering to feel it to have some Son

124
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:13,679
sympathy with it or empathy with it and

125
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:21,179
to have a desire for that suffering to be alleviated and that and is a hugely important part

126
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:26,220
of compassions and a desire for it to be alleviated

127
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:32,039
it compassion can exist without necessarily we being the person who is

128
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:38,159
going to alleviate the suffering but it's still the desires there

129
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:43,679
and um but in certain circumstances they make sense that we have the desire to do

130
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,899
something we have the ability to do it it's appropriate to do it maybe sometimes it's no one else who could

131
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:55,860
help with the suffering that people are experiencing and so we offered to do something

132
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:02,159
and so the common definition does involve a desire but desire is a kind of um

133
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:11,880
somewhat vague word or somewhat broad word and so I prefer to call it aspiration

134
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:19,919
and part of the reason for this is that I think that generally to Aspire to

135
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:25,080
something to Aspire to do something it doesn't come along with Duty or

136
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:33,360
obligation an aspiration comes from someplace deep inside it's an inspiration it's a welling up of uh of

137
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:40,020
of an inner desire that is offered arises freely or arises

138
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:45,140
without need perhaps or without a lot of ego or

139
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:52,020
self-centeredness it has a kind of a deep Source Within and there's a kind of open-endedness to

140
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:58,799
aspiration uh it's different for me different than hope we're wishing uh

141
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:05,880
aspiration wants to see something happen but knows that it might not

142
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:12,419
it's not aspiration is not attached to the outcome

143
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:18,779
and to act in the world of compassion act compassionately from aspiration

144
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:24,960
maybe as a wonderful gift because it frees ourselves from that tightness and

145
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:31,919
the pressure of accomplishment of succeeding and and sometimes when we're

146
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:37,980
compassionate to others it's enough for them to know that we

147
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:45,179
have the desire the aspiration to help we're we're making the effort to help even if we don't succeed

148
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:51,059
the idea that someone cares about you cares enough to make effort to support

149
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:57,480
you sometimes it's the medicine that's what's needed more than the outcome

150
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:03,000
and so aspiration is um the other reason I like aspiration because the word is

151
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,220
connected to breathing and so it has this kind of in my mind this idea of

152
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:13,858
having a deeper Source within our body within our heart that's different than

153
00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:19,080
anything that the Mind comes up with the thinking the logic the analysis of the situation

154
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:24,419
it has some kind of deeper upwelling to Aspire

155
00:34:24,419 --> 00:34:30,780
and to take the time when we're in the presence of suffering or feel it to not

156
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:36,679
rush to judgment not rush to obligation not rush to something has to happen here

157
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:43,679
when that Rush is motivated by our own distress our own discomfort our own

158
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:52,260
sense of uh self centered kind of obligation or that our

159
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:59,820
own need to do something but rather take the time to relax with it than to be present and see what is

160
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:06,599
the aspiration that flows out of us what's the desire the wish for that that

161
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:13,579
is uh that has this kind of open-endedness this freedom to it not something that

162
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:19,079
puts us back in bondage or puts us and clamps us down or Narrows us but

163
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:26,220
something that actually feels like now our breathe now we can breathe more easily as opposed to getting stressed and tight

164
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:32,700
and our breathing becomes more contracted and and tight and narrow

165
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:38,460
so aspiration and um and so

166
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:44,040
this week I'll talk about uh five different these different aspects

167
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:49,320
of aspiration and um the um

168
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:55,920
and for today the simple idea is that part of the aspiration when it's

169
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:03,119
compassionate is to want suffering to stop our own suffering if someone else is

170
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:08,160
suffering to want it to stop but to want them to have that desire

171
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:15,300
that want wanting to to no longer be there is a because we know

172
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:20,700
that life doesn't have to be suffering all the time we don't have to be living

173
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:26,760
always under the pressure or the tension the hurt the pain the stress of what uh

174
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:32,540
you know life brings us and our own struggles and all this

175
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:38,700
difficulties and heartbreak that we can have that there is a there is an outcome

176
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:45,060
there is a way of coming into a very different relationship to this difficult world we are in

177
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:51,300
one in which we don't contribute we don't enact we don't

178
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:59,700
um add to the difficulties of life the kind of suffering of the stress the

179
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:04,920
suffering of contraction the suffering of that comes with attachment and

180
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:10,079
clinging and we can learn and practice that we don't have to do that

181
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:18,180
there's another way of being and as we learn that then we learn how to have aspiration

182
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:23,420
that's free of attachment aspiration is free of force

183
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:29,820
assertiveness aspiration that's free of conceit it's just a puke it's a beautiful

184
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:38,400
quality that have a compassionate aspiration and um and then and to be motivated by

185
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:46,099
that beautiful aspiration is very different than being motivated by obligation or or sense of Duty that

186
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:53,520
responsibility that many people get caught in in a way that's not beneficial

187
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:59,240
so to have a wish to to to not just simply be present for

188
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:04,320
experiences we encounter in the world situations not learn just to be mindful

189
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:09,420
of it not care but to where mindfulness where the

190
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:16,380
awareness of it comes along with a care and I learned yesterday that the the

191
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:22,460
word aware awareness comes from the kind of

192
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:29,040
anglo-germanic source that actually means to care and and so I looked it up

193
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,800
in my native Norwegian and sure enough in Norwegian in English sometimes what's

194
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:41,540
the W in English is a v in Norwegian and

195
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:49,880
which is that means ta means to take is the where take where

196
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:55,740
take care is what it means and so I love this idea that awareness

197
00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:00,900
means to care to take care and um

198
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:07,140
and so to care and in that caring to care enough also

199
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:14,520
about ourselves so with when we're in the in encountering suffering and being present for and being aware of it we are

200
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:20,640
taking the time to look for where is the aspiration here where's the inspiration what desire

201
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:26,339
comes out of inspiration around the suffering to just the

202
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:33,260
inspiration for it to come to an end to stop so um

203
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:39,780
so I would encourage you to spend some time exploring your desires thinking

204
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:45,180
about when you have desires desire to end to stop something that's painful and

205
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:52,859
suffering and to see the quality of that desire is it does it come along with something

206
00:39:52,859 --> 00:39:59,579
that is actually stressful actually that feels you know that it's a grading or or

207
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:06,480
somehow diminishes something inside of you the desire that because of the need the attachment that's there

208
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:13,920
or is this encounter with suffering and the desires that were born from it uh can it is there some place where there's

209
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:20,640
a sense of aspiration or inspiration that supports the desire to stop or to

210
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:25,859
bring this to an end and um

211
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:33,480
the um so those are my thoughts today and um

212
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:38,820
maybe from having been away for a month on a silent Retreat maybe that I don't

213
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:46,800
have many more words and we'll stop early today and I do look forward so happy very

214
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:52,020
happy to be here and look forward to continuing this series on aspiration in

215
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:57,740
relationship to compassion over these next days and I will be here on the fourth of July

216
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:03,060
so I don't know if what you all are doing but I'll continue for the whole

217
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:07,460
week so thank you
