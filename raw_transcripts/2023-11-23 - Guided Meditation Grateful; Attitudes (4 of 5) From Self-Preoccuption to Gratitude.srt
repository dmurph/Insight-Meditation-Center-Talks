12

you on this day of giving

15
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:28,280
thanks and um one of the things I am very grateful

16
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:34,480
for is my meditation practice pra this practice of being

17
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:41,360
present and um I feel like it's been a I do feel it's a gift not only is the

18
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:49,760
practice a gift I feel like I feel very fortunate to have received this gift in my lifetime and I feel very fortunate to

19
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:56,760
for uh what seems to move through or arise as I

20
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:05,360
sit and it leads to a kind of deep gratitude ude to life to being alive to

21
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:12,239
breathing to um all the all that makes it possible

22
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,840
for me to be alive and safe enough and

23
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,360
quiet enough to be able to sit in meditation and to open the Mind open the

24
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,519
heart metaphorically at least when I'm sitting open my hands be open-handed in

25
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:36,560
this World openhearted open-minded and um and it just seems

26
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,879
like such a fortuitous Fort fortunate thing to to have this ability

27
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:49,400
this capacity to this uh opportunity to do this kind of practice

28
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:56,120
so when I bow at the end of a sitting it's often for me an expression expression of gratitude because I

29
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,239
learned early on that um it was good to express it it was almost like you know

30
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:07,840
it'd be hard not to uh some emotions we feel um come to

31
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,879
fulfillment when they are expressed in some form and uh I feel gratitude as one

32
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:21,600
of those that um that needs some expression some movement that

33
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:29,080
goes maybe Beyond on gratitude for me is an experience

34
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:34,880
that um there's something beyond my

35
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:41,240
personal ideas of self my ideas of my agency ideas of

36
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,919
my all kinds of things that are operating here maybe when D Buddhism we call the

37
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:52,759
Dharma and uh and to sit and open to this

38
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:58,639
wider kind of um some people might call it transpersonal some people might call

39
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:05,680
it uh uh the deepest most intimate place that's

40
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,440
non-personal because in whether it's transpersonal

41
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:19,120
or deeper than personal it whatever it is it uh it

42
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,479
gives birth to gratitude so we'll sit today and maybe

43
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:32,840
gratitude can be uh not far away maybe we can begin by

44
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:39,319
considering uh in spite of the difficulties that many of us have in our lives and

45
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:45,240
difficulties that might not be far away as we sit to meditate illnesses

46
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:53,199
and injuries and all kinds of things that um was

47
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:05,240
still huh I wonder what that is there's a

48
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:12,319
beeping it's probably a car outside I don't know if you can hear

49
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:19,000
it maybe the if you hear it maybe it's a

50
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,840
little mindfulness

51
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:35,280
Bell I'm going to take take a look anyway see what I

52
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
can

53
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:14,120
okay so it's a car that does

54
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:20,000
so let's begin and to assume a meditation

55
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:28,120
posture that allows you to spend a little bit of time to

56
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:36,960
appreciate being in a comfortable posture maybe a safe

57
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,160
posture maybe a posture that can be an appreciation for this

58
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,479
body that does so much for us supports us so

59
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,120
much gently close the

60
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
eyes

61
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:17,080
and it's not so farfetched to be grateful for what supports our life for what we

62
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:22,720
receive and with every breath we receive the

63
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:31,479
oxygen that is essential for our living for every

64
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:40,200
exhale we're freeing ourselves from gases which would be problematic if

65
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,680
they built up within

66
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:58,120
us to receive greatfully with every

67
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
breath

68
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,240
and every sensation you have in your

69
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:22,680
body is in part a consequence of the food you've

70
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:31,120
eaten that generates the energy for this whole

71
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:39,519
neural system to operate it allows us to feel and sense

72
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,760
this

73
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:04,000
body and we have a

74
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:14,519
mind even for all its challenges it provides us still gets us about gets us through a

75
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:31,279
day the mental processing that's so sophisticated that we hardly know it's

76
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:36,440
operating that's needed for us to just to get around the basic activities of

77
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:44,000
daily life happening so much of it

78
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,880
happens unconsciously and kind of effortlessly

79
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:58,040
at times to sit

80
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:04,439
here finding gratitude in every

81
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:14,440
breath appreciation and thanks for the ability to sense and to

82
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,120
feel in the body for every

83
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:32,240
sensation appreciating and being grateful for this mind that we

84
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:39,639
have maybe for every thought that arises that every

85
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:43,839
impulse let it be met with

86
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,160
gratitude and a gratitude which is an

87
00:11:57,079 --> 00:12:00,959
attitude a background

88
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,040
attitude by which we receive all

89
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
experiences

for

95
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:31,600
and in the times that you're pulled into thinking distracted from here and

96
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,240
now to what degree is that a self-

97
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,049
involvement self- [Music]

98
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:56,880
concerned and all too often when we're self-concerned there's little

99
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:05,319
room to receive the gifts of Life the gifts of the spiritual

100
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:12,560
life the gifts of our

101
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:21,800
practice and self- concern all too easily interferes with

102
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:27,440
an open sense of

103
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,519
gratitude

104
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,199
that we receive so much more than we

105
00:16:52,319 --> 00:17:00,480
give that all that gives Keeps Us Alive is a again

106

and as we come to the end of this

130
00:28:51,559 --> 00:29:00,120
sitting to appreciate that when the mind is

131
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,519
settled not

132
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:12,559
preoccupied when the heart is settled and

133
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:19,760
open and when we're just sitting here at peace

134
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,399
calm then there is the space in the heart

135
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:34,720
space in the mind for greater

136
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:40,440
appreciation of our life of this

137
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:50,120
moment a greater receptivity to all

138
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:55,158
that makes it possible for us to live our

139
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:03,840
life to recognize that our whole

140
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:09,000
lives are built on receiving so much from

141
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,720
others from the world from the natural

142
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:25,640
world and when we're settled there's more room for

143
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:32,760
gratitude a thankful fness for all that we

144
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:41,279
receive so many people work to keep the food in our

145
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:45,000
kitchen electricity

146
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:56,240
on who work in the stores where we shop who grow the food

147
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,240
and

148
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:12,120
everything we touch virtually that's man humanly made is something that's been made by

149
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:20,639
someone for us to use to appreciate to interact

150
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:28,480
with the roads that were built

151
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:36,880
electrical wires connecting our homes the list goes on and

152
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:42,559
on things that people have done that made our life

153
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:59,159
possible to appreciate how much of our life has been

154
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:06,240
built on the work of other people built

155
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:11,679
on the gifts of the natural

156
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,399
world and to sit in

157
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,638

00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,359
gratitude that comes from one of the one of the very significant Scholars of

174
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:12,359
religion professors of religious studies in the United States named um Houston

175
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:18,359
Smith and he was uh he did a great amount of work uh spending a lot of time

176
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:24,160
living in different countries entering into the uh uh some of the major world

177
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:31,760
religions and participating them in them and studying them in a very deeply appreciative way and having deep kind of

178
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:37,960
personal relationship with people in all kinds of religions and over his very long

179
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:43,520
career and um and uh he tells the story of

180
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,760
practicing Zen in Japan at a very strict

181
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:56,079
Zen Monastery and he was there for a month uh engaged in this practice and

182
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:01,119
ended with a week-long intensive uh Zen Retreat where you get some like three

183
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:07,359
hours a night of sleep very intense and um it was you certainly

184
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:13,280
challenging for him and um uh but then at the end when he was

185
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:18,920
going to leave he went to pay his respects to his teacher his the Abbott

186
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:25,079
goto roshi and um and he was a bit stunned by what he

187
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:31,640
was told he'd been working is a rinai monastery been working on Coons these enigmatic questions that you struggle

188
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:41,160
with and uh he'd been meditating a lot and um the Abbot said to him um uh Coons

189
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:48,760
these in enigmatic questions can be a useful exercise but they are not

190
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:57,880
Zen so he thought he'd been doing Zen and sitting in meditation he went on

191
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:04,280
that is also not Zen so I think Houston Smith was quite stunned and surprised and what he had

192
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:12,319
been doing he came to study Zen and some of so much of it was meditation intensive meditation and and um and

193
00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:19,079
these Coons and those aren't Zen so what was he doing

194
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:25,040
um uh and so the um the Zen master then said to

195
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:34,680
him uh so you be flying home tomorrow right and um and then he continued don't

196
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:41,200
overlook how many people will help you get home ticketing agents Pilots cabin

197
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:48,119
attendants those who prepare your meals he bowed placed his palms

198
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:55,640
together um and bowed in deep gratitude then he did this bow of

199
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:02,000
gratitude to me and he said make your whole life

200
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:11,200
unceasing gratitude he said what is then simple simple so

201
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:17,839
simple infinite gratitude toward all things past infinite service to all

202
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:25,520
things present infinite responsibility to All Things future have a safe journey

203
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:32,119
home and he gave me a wonderful smile and Saidi glad you

204
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:37,720
came so so here this zen master identifies

205
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:44,839
the heart of Zen with maybe with gratitude and um for all that we

206
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:50,319
receive and maybe Zen is not

207
00:38:50,319 --> 00:38:57,200
meditation but maybe Buddhism is not the meditation but meditation is what clears

208
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:04,240
the heart it clears the mind so that we can see and feel and experience this

209
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:12,200
life from a place where we're not self-centered self- preoccupied

210
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:18,599
self-concerned so it's so easy for us to be pulled into the world of self-c

211
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:24,200
concern that uh uh everything is referenced in relationship to Me Myself

212
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:31,319
and mine uh we are thinking about ourselves we have an attitude of self

213
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:36,440
preoccupation an attitude of self-c concern and not just it's reasonable to

214
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:43,119
have self-c concern reasonable to take care of ourselves and know where we are and what

215
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:48,400
what's going on but when we have an attitude of it it means part of our mind

216
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:55,920
is always preoccupied with self always preoccupied with uh what's in it for me

217
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:01,599
or I'm not enough or I'm a problem

218
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:08,880
or um I deserve more or I um you know I

219
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:15,240
need to make myself safe and and there's an attitude of that's a lot of emotions

220
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:21,880
that are centered around this uh self a cluster of um of

221
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:29,480
preoccupations that's centered around a fundamental attitude that we carry with us a mood or a state that's referencing

222
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:37,520
Everything To Me Myself and mine and um it involves tension it

223
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:44,079
involves uh shutting down it involves not really being able to connect fully to the

224
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:50,000
situation and so meditation is a way to kind of quiet the self-c concern the

225
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,800
self- preoccupation and a lot of the reasons meditation is de-stressing is because

226
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:02,599
there is less self involvement in meditation and so the source of stress

227
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:07,720
is not operating so strongly unless we bring it with us into the meditation

228
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:12,880
self-c concern am I doing well enough am I concentrated I need to get do better

229
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:18,359
so all this game of self that goes on so letting that that selfing mind become

230
00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:24,800
quiet that attitude be decrease and then it can be replaced or

231
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:30,240
it can be filled in with an attitude of

232
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:37,880
gratitude grateful thankful um there's a Zen saying that to

233
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:45,880
uh move forward asserting the self is delusion to settle back and receive all

234
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:54,359
things is Awakening and there's so much that we are receiving all the time just to be

235
00:41:54,359 --> 00:42:00,720
alive so many people who are working just like maybe how many of you are

236
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:06,240
working um in a way that supports other people so our lives are working to

237
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:14,040
support are supported by so many people and um every day those of us living in

238
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:19,520
you know the modern United States driving on roads using electricity

239
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:27,839
taking water out of a tap in our kitchen um the um having maybe insulated homes

240
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:33,559
having our heater heater systems in our homes keeping it warm all that has been

241
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:40,880
put in place by countless countless people the food that comes to our table has whole series of people have had

242
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:46,680
their contributed bringing it to from the ground up into our

243
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:53,280
kitchen and um wow there's a lot that's we receive if we're

244
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:59,040
self-concerned it's easy to complain there's not enough we want more it

245
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:06,240
should be different um it's been said that

246
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:14,040
um when we have an attitude of gratitude we can be happy

247
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:19,680
anywhere if we have an attitude of complaining we would complain even in

248
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:27,440
hell even in heaven that um there's no

249
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:32,599
the um um

250
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:37,960
so to enter into maybe this

251
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:46,480
day appreciating that the lowering of self- concern self- preoccupation at

252
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,760
least where we're preoccupied where we're not good enough we

253
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:57,240
don't uh we're not enough we're

254
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:03,760
the situation is not enough for us it's not right for us that for us it should be

255
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:09,839
different that quieting that so no matter what the circumstances

256
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:16,319
we are to appreciate the goodness of it the gift of

257
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:21,920
it not being able to appreciate the gifts that we receive I think makes

258
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:27,680
spirituality impossible because the spiritual States

259
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:37,240
spiritual Freedom The Awakening the practice of mindfulness the the deepening subtleness the is really a

260
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:43,839
gift we can't demand it we can't assert ourselves to it we can't we can't really

261
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:50,400
use it to build up the self because then the beauty of this

262
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:57,240
life the beauty of our hearts the freedom of heart the freedom of world

263
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:04,920
um is not really available so to see spirituality as

264
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:09,119
entering into a world of gift

265
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:16,839
receiving we receive so much and perhaps in receiving those

266
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:24,000
gifts that in the present moment we can also give give our Smiles give our

267
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:30,359
well-wishing give our deep appreciation for others and who they

268
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:37,920
are and in our gratitude and appreciation we can have a vision for a

269
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:46,760
better tomorrow that we contribute to make for all of ourselves all of us not just

270
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:54,079
ourselves May our gratitude May our deep appreciation help us work for a better

271
00:45:54,079 --> 00:46:00,160
future better tomorrow no matter how difficult it

272
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:07,359
gets let's step forward to contribute in such a way that in the

273
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:15,440
future people have reasons to be grateful for us for what we

274
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:23,240

275
