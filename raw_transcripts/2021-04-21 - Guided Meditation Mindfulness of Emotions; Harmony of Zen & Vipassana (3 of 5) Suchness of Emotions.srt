1
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:20,640
so just a comment before i start that when i just sat down now the

2
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,279
my youtube screen for this my laptop here had frozen so i had to

3
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:34,160
refresh it and yesterday i noticed that there were a few like three or four or five maybe

4
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,879
comments about kind of in a row of people who were um i guess their screen has frozen too and

5
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:48,079
needed to be reset but mostly not and it seemed to go fine after that so i just want to say last week we had a

6
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,360
big problem with this and i finally got it to work by

7
00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:00,320
switching our service provider we have two here at imc so if this should happen again today and

8
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,479
it becomes a big deal then just i will switch the service provider

9
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:14,479
probably take me a minute or so or two to make the change and and so hopefully uh you'll come back if

10
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,758
that's you know what's going on

11
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,759
so good morning and uh welcome to the meditation

12
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:37,680
and uh this week i'm going through the basic sequence the sequence of the basic

13
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,600
instructions for mindfulness practice that we i teach here at imc

14
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:50,479
where we focus on breathing the first and then the body and then emotions

15
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:58,000
thinking and then something interesting on the final day and and so here today is the day on

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
emotions and certainly emotions are an important part of life

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,440
and but i think it's useful to consider that emotions are probably not

18
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,280
what you think they are and they're probably more important in

19
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:24,480
ways that you can't imagine or don't really know at the same time as being less important

20
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,000
than maybe you realize for people who maybe have very little contact with their

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,680
emotions maybe for some of them that

22
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:45,440
they're probably more important than they realize and for people who are very much touched in contact with their emotions

23
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:52,319
there's a way in which maybe they're less important than you realize and either direction is a

24
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,360
is a corrective in the direction of becoming free

25
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:05,760
kind of freedom to emote to freedom of emotions in a particular buddhist way

26
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:13,680
so in the teachings of this mindfulness practice there are four

27
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,319
dimensions or four aspects of mindfulness of emotions

28
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:26,480
and these can happen all at once in some kind of holistic way or they can happen to each

29
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:33,120
distinctly as is appropriate as is useful as whichever one is the most freeing

30
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:40,480
in the moment and that begs the question of what does freeing mean

31
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:47,280
but so the one is to simply recognize to clearly recognize an

32
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:54,400
emotion which is there is powerful to recognize that we're happy here to recognize we're sad or grieving

33
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:01,120
to recognize we're angry discouraged inspired there's something that happens

34
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:08,799
in their recognition that if the recognition is very simple just the recognition that uh there's

35
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:15,439
something freeing in that just allows it to be there makes almost like making space for something

36
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:23,040
the second aspect is allowing and whatever the emotion is to allow it

37
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,840
and meditation practice whatever your posture is whether it's sitting or even walking meditation standing

38
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:38,479
meditation there's something about that's very special about the posture that we settle into or or or intentionally

39
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:46,000
place ourselves in when we meditate that becomes a posture that's meant to be able to hold and make

40
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,080
room for anything that we're feeling inside in daily life it might not be possible to

41
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:59,120
allow all our emotions their freedom just flow through us we might make a mistake what we say and do

42
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,560
we have to care for people in ways that sometimes our emotions wouldn't if we

43
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,160
just let them be expressed but in meditation it's meant to be a place of real no

44
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:17,280
shame no embarrassment and no blame no needing to run away from no need to

45
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,800
collapse lean forward and grab just sitting upright

46
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:29,919
and allowing it to course through us and and stay present stay aware

47
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:36,960
so once we recognize it we can allow the third is to feel

48
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:43,039
and the fields is a to really experience the

49
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:49,680
physicality of the emotion the physical expression of it manifestation of it

50
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:57,360
and almost all emotions that we feel have some kind of physical manifestation

51
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:04,960
that lets us know that we're having an emotion and and so you know it could be that the

52
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,000
chest is tight and compressed it could be the jaws are clenched it could be the stomach as

53
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,720
has butterflies in it it could be there's a warmth that kind of that kind of radiates from the heart

54
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:25,199
that feels so good or the hands feel delightfully tingly or there's a wonderful thrill that runs

55
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:34,000
through the body and when there's joy or something and so to feel it and to trust the body's

56
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,479
experience and one of the reasons it's so useful to feel the physicality of emotions it's a

57
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:47,680
it's a way of stepping away from the story making mind the stories the ideas the projections

58
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,199
the planning the reactivity of the thinking mind which has a way of fueling and

59
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:59,599
continuing the emotion it's a little bit like someone who reaches down to grab a beach ball on the

60
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:06,080
ground and as they do so their foot kicks the ball further and so they walk

61
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:12,000
up to the ball reach them to pick it up and they kick it then they're never able to pick it up because they keep

62
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,160
kicking it forward so the same way with our emotions there's a way in which our story making mind or

63
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,319
ruminations about there's what's going on keeps kicking the emotion forward and so

64
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:31,680
we're never quite able to get a clear view of it or a clear stepping back and holding it in a

65
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:39,840
loving compassionate way or wise way liberated way and so feeling is not the same thing as

66
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:47,039
story so it's a way of allowing the body to process the emotion and the fourth is something that's a

67
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,080
little more complicated which means teasing apart and that's meant to be

68
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,280
something very very simple but to begin distinguishing between

69
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:03,919
things have been different aspects of the emotion this for example the physical manifestation versus the

70
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:09,199
story making mind the difference between our attitude

71
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:15,199
towards the emotion and the emotion itself and so these very simple distinctions

72
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:21,840
that makes kind of breathing room to be present so it's easier to be there with it without having these knotted up with

73
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,360
each other when our reactivity and attitude is knotted up with the emotion uh it

74
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:34,000
can be very difficult and in some ways we keep kicking the ball forward

75
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:42,640
so those these four recognize allow feel and tease apart

76
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:49,600
makes up the acronym raft and with this raft we can float

77
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:58,160
on the wonderful current of our emotions rather than drown in them

78
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,680
so assuming a meditative posture

79
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,519
and gently closing your eyes

80
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,760
or keeping them open if that's your practice

81
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,279
and with your eyes with your sitting just like you are

82
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,720
just check in with yourself and how are you feeling right now

83
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:37,839
what's your mood your emotional state how is it

84
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,399
and i have a few moments of clearly recognizing it

85
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,600
and seeing if that recognition can be very very simple

86
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:58,720
just the recognition oh it's like this and if you it's very vague how you're

87
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,079
feeling then you can just recognize that you're having a feeling just that's all you

88
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,000
have to name it more specific than that

89
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:19,839
or if there's no feelings or emotions or mood states then recognize the absence

90
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:30,800
and however you are feeling what was it me what does it mean

91
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:37,920
for you to allow it now give room for it

92
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,640
not assume it should be different

93
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,200
in a sense giving permission for however you're feeling to be there

94
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,160
unconditioned unconditional

95
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:05,839
permission maybe as if your emotional state has

96
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:14,480
never had permission to be out in the sun it's the sun of awareness

97
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,399
and finally it's allowed to just exist and be felt the known

98
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,839
and then feel it in your body what parts of your body are most active

99
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:35,440
or alive or with sensations associated with

100
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:43,519
how you're feeling and it could be anywhere

101
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:49,200
the face the hands the belly the chest

102
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:57,839
the head the back the feet

103
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:13,600
and then to tease apart to notice tease apart distinguish

104
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,440
between your thinking your reactions your judgments

105
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:27,200
about what you're feeling and the simplicity of the feeling itself

106
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:34,399
tease apart the stories you telling yourself about it

107
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,839
from the embodied experience itself

108
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:51,360
and with this kind of beginning of recognizing how you are

109
00:12:51,760 --> 00:13:00,720
taking a few long slow deep breaths three quarters full the inhale

110
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:08,639
may be inhaling and into the body that's feeling

111
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:20,560
and the long exhale softening and relaxing the body

112
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,920
around how you're feeling

113
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:35,839
long exhale and settling in to your body here

114
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:47,920
and then letting your breathing return to normal and with a breath and breathing kind of

115
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:54,320
itself on the exhale relaxing the muscles of

116
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,839
your face letting those muscles fall away from the

117
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:08,160
bone muscles of the face do so much work

118
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:17,839
throughout the day and now sitting here you can let it rest

119
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:32,320
and then maybe on the exhale to soften the shoulders

120
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,240
release the shoulders

121
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:59,839
no no need to carry the weight of the world for these minutes you're here

122
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:13,839
and softening your belly

123
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:45,279
and then within your body as part of your bodily experience

124
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,120
become aware of how the body

125
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,839
experiences breathing

126
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,880
and when you're exhaling perhaps from time to time you can let go

127
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,680
of your thinking

128
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,839
or quiet your thinking

129
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:32,959
so you can better ride along in the rhythm breathing in

130
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,839
and breathing out

131
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,840
so

132
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:53,679
and then quietly calmly

133
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:02,960
without disturbing things too much or at all how are you feeling now

134
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:13,840
what's the emotion emotional tenor mood that's present for you

135
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:26,320
calm or agitated content or discontent

136
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,919
happy or sad

137
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:37,360
irritated or

138
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,840
friendly

139
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,559
whatever it might be for you

140
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,840
recognize it for what it is

141
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,960
without being too concerned with how accurate the recognition is

142
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:11,679
like it has to be the exact word maybe it's a silent recognition an

143
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,559
acknowledgement

144
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:27,759
and in that recognition is there some freedom some

145
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:34,639
non-entanglement like stepping back and

146
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:38,559
non-involvement

147
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:55,440
and make room for how you're feeling allow it to be there

148
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,360
and in that allowing is there a kind of freedom

149
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,840
non-entanglement

150
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:33,600
and then gently how does the body experience

151
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,720
your emotion how's it felt in the body

152
00:24:42,159 --> 00:25:01,840
perhaps trusting the body's experience

153
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:45,360
and then teasing apart the simplicity of your emotion your

154
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:51,520
state your mood in any kind of way that you define

155
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:58,240
yourself by it or judge yourself by it or

156
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,799
identify yourself by what you're feeling

157
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:12,799
those are two different things the emotion that can be independent

158
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:20,320
of any conclusion you make about what it says about you yourself

159
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:28,880
those conclusions are tease them apart and maybe the conclusions

160
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:39,840
can drift away

161
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,919
and then as we come to the end of the

162
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:06,080
sitting the respect the care that we give to

163
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,278
our emotional life

164
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,760
the ability to be physically sensitive

165
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:25,840
heightened sensitivity to the manifestation the arising of emotions

166
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:31,520
is the sensitivity that also makes room

167
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:36,559
for compassion and kindness

168
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:41,440
love and good will

169
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,440
and a sense of care and caring

170
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,200
a tenderness of heart

171
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:03,120
a tenderness that has room for

172
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:13,840
a sympathetic resonance with others

173
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,960
in the coming to the end of the sitting perhaps with whatever sensitivity you

174
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,799
have tenderness warmth

175
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:36,559
to now bring into your mind and heart the people of your life

176
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:43,679
people around you and your neighborhood and your communities

177
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:51,440
people that you're maybe communicate with or in your extended family

178
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:58,320
or strangers that you're liable to run into today

179
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,320
and to regard them kindly

180
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:18,080
to kindly gaze or kindly consider these people

181
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:26,158
and perhaps consider how wonderful would be if some of them could be happy

182
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:33,039
if some of them can be could be peaceful and

183
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,240
contentedly inspired in their life

184
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:50,080
and to wish that that was so to let you yourself have some good will towards

185
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:59,360
them may it be so may these people i know or meet

186
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:04,960
may they be happy

187
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:13,039
may these people that i maybe meet today may they be safe

188
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:23,279
may the people that i meet today think about today or communicate with today

189
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:32,320
or learn about today may they be peaceful

190
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,398
and may they all be free

191
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:45,039
and finally in ways that are appropriate and inspiring

192
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:50,960
for me may i

193
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,679
contribute to this possibility for

194
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:06,240
others for each of us in ways that are

195
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:15,519
right for us inspiring for us not an obligation but an inspiration

196
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:22,159
may we live this day for the welfare and happiness of others

197
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:29,840
may all beings be happy

198
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:43,919
so emotions are probably not what

199
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:51,679
we think they are and maybe more often than not

200
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:58,399
thinking about emotions the way we think about them and conceive them maybe there's some way that keep us from

201
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:04,960
being liberated and free maybe even keep our emotions from being

202
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:10,480
have a certain kind of freedom i'm very fond of the idea that in

203
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:17,200
english the latin root for the word emotion motion means motion movement

204
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:23,520
and the e part prefix means out so moving out and i'd like to interpret

205
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:30,240
that that all emotions are processes so there are activities they're movements

206
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:36,638
and they all want to move out they all want to kind of spread

207
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:43,760
or process themselves and and our inner life has an amazing

208
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:50,398
capacity to process emotions to let them unfold or dissolve or

209
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:55,760
unfold the way that there's some wisdom to doing

210
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:01,599
and we often interfere with that wisdom we interfere with the natural process

211
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,880
i i love this

212
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:15,359
i love this way of thinking that i can cut my you know cutting vegetables

213
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:20,560
in the kitchen i might cut my my thing my finger and my bleed and

214
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:26,960
i have a responsibility or opportunity to take care of it by maybe washing the wound and putting a

215
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:32,480
bandaid on it to protect it and but the actual healing

216
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:39,040
i can't do it's a physiologically much more complicated event that i could ever possibly

217
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:45,599
engineer and understand figure out send the right antibodies and proteins and

218
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:51,359
hormones or whatever it goes it's involved into the right combination of things and

219
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:58,160
make the whole thing heal again what i do is keep the wound

220
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:04,000
clean and safe and protected so the body knows has the wisdom to heal

221
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,200
the wound usually and the same thing with our emotional life

222
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:16,400
our hearts our inner life knows something that if we get out of the way can allow

223
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,920
it to unfold and to move to some resolution or some solution or

224
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:28,560
some unfolding or some place depending on the emotion that's there

225
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:35,839
and and many times we don't allow that because we're so involved in either the

226
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:41,599
emotion reacting to it or something or we are

227
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:48,000
spinning the story even more uh spinning the story so like they say that one of the leading causes

228
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,680
for depression and not the only cause i don't want to get to give that impression but one of

229
00:36:53,680 --> 00:37:00,480
the leading causes is rumination one of the things that makes grief a lot more

230
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,839
difficult than it needs to be is rumination is thinking and rehearsing and

231
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:12,960
remembering and and keep feeling guilt and blame and all kinds of things and

232
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:19,200
that get in gets in the way of really trusting and respecting the grief

233
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:26,079
and and so this uh um uh you know so it's like the beach ball

234
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:33,599
you know that we are constantly kicking up before we can pick it up and hold it gently and in the palm in the palms of

235
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:40,960
our mindfulness and and so instead of you know keep the

236
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:48,640
momentum going all the time in mindfulness practice we're learning how to kind of get out of the way

237
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:54,320
with the deep respect for emotions and i like very much the word respect as

238
00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:01,119
kind of a synonym for mindfulness or phrabipasana because uh respect it comes from the

239
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:08,880
latin of prefect again and spec like spectator or spectacles to see

240
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:15,359
so to look again to respect our emotional life is to take us give it a second look and

241
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:20,880
really kind of what is this and then see it clearly and

242
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:26,320
allowing it to unfold and be there and whether that's useful in all

243
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:32,480
circumstances in life i don't know but it is very powerful and effective to do

244
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:38,240
in certain circumstances of life and meditation is one of them sometimes when

245
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:44,560
i have strong emotions that are difficult for me i will go for a walk in the mountains and go for a long walk and

246
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:51,359
the walking i find very useful because there's something about the movement of walking that allows

247
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:58,800
that keeps me from getting locked into the emotion and the thoughts and i can let all of it just flow and uh

248
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:04,560
and do what it needs to do uh sometimes when i've had strong

249
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:09,599
emotions uh difficult emotions uh i'll sit in meditation

250
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:16,960
and i don't try to stop anything i don't even try to stop my thinking mind per se but i'll constantly come back and

251
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:24,160
compost the strong emotions in my body just let them which means for me that i keep

252
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:30,160
returning to feel what's happening emotionally in my body like mixed space and really feel it

253
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:36,160
and when i do that i'm stepping a little bit away from the thoughts that are spinning um and if i

254
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:42,240
only thought i'd probably get into all kinds of trouble and go crazy but i step away from it but not to stop

255
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:49,200
it but to kind of change the context and really feel what's there as if the body knows how to process it

256
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:54,640
and unfold it and um and then i'll do it again and again as i compost

257
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:02,960
what i'm feeling so there are some emotions that are clearly a byproduct of what we

258
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:10,160
think and i've sat in meditation and i had a perfectly lovely peaceful time

259
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:17,359
and then for reasons that i have no idea why i'll think about

260
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:23,599
some conversation i had with someone 20 30 40 years ago now getting to be almost 50

261
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:29,760
years some of them so um and then just somehow that comes through the mind

262
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:36,880
this thought and with that thought boom i get angry or irritated or afraid or something

263
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:42,960
and um and uh and then you know i can see you know as i keep telling the story

264
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:49,520
she said i said um i should have said why didn't i say i could feel the emotions and the heat

265
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:56,480
kind of operating and it was clear that the thinking the thoughts seemed to be really central to keeping

266
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:02,400
this thing going and and then i've had times when i've learned to kind of

267
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:08,720
quiet the thinking mind and just be with the feelings and the emotions and it's really clear that i'm not no

268
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:15,200
longer feeding it i'm not like pouring pouring gasoline on the fire and uh and then something different begins to

269
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:22,720
happening something's cool and quiet and subtle and rather than solving our

270
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:29,440
emotional problems sometimes they dissolve sometimes what happens is that the you

271
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:34,480
know some emotions that we i feel many of us feel have nothing to do with

272
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:40,480
our external life but maybe it's has you know to do with physiology

273
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,760
and uh and so uh it's not a matter of what we're thinking a lot

274
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:51,440
but it's a feeling in the body and not identifying with it not making a

275
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:58,400
story out of it and a story about oh for me i'm bad or i'm wrong that i should feel this way

276
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:04,240
and and making a lot of space for it so that their mood or the emotion that

277
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:11,119
we have is not a filter through which we see ourselves and see life

278
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:17,200
and that ability to not let it be a filter that sees what's going on has a lot to do with this ability to

279
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:22,800
really stop and look and respect what's happening here and

280
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:31,200
and acknowledge it recognize it really feel it and know it and to um

281
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:36,480
um uh maybe tease it apart and just let it be simple

282
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:42,480
for itself and then that's a kind of liberation that's where freedom can happen

283
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:49,119
where we're no longer entangled and caught up in all this and we can just allow everything in its

284
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:57,119
uniqueness to be there for itself and this is a beautiful kind of generous thing

285
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:03,359
to grant to give all the particularities of our life its

286
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:10,800
freedom to let an emotion give its freedom to emote to be there in the quiet and the safety

287
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:17,280
of just being present for it to allow you know our reactions and

288
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:24,079
identifications with it to let that be free meaning we don't kind of get involved

289
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:30,400
and keep thinking it and you know scratching the itching scratching the scab

290
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:36,240
we just let it kind of okay you're there and okay you're free but you're free in a sense

291
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:43,680
that you're not casting a light back on me and i'm not defining myself by it

292
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:51,599
so this wonderful part of mindfulness practice in a rich part is uh bringing mindfulness to

293
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:59,839
real careful respectful attention to the fullness to the richness of our emotional life

294
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:07,520
and but not to be involved with them and not to celebrate them and not to denigrate them

295
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:14,079
but you just allow them to be there in their simplicity and what happens with that at some point

296
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:19,119
we start seeing that there are two classes of emotional

297
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:26,560
in the emotional life do classes of kind of emotions or attitudes that we can have one of the ones that

298
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:31,920
one side they're the ones that are clearly involved arise out of our reactivity

299
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:37,200
arise out of our contraction and resistance and pushing and wanting and

300
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:42,720
not wanting and the ways at which we build ideas of self

301
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:48,720
me myself and mine or attitude towards others and they're a little bit more compulsive

302
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:54,240
it's a little more automatic and they involve what in buddhism early buddhism might be called some to

303
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:59,440
some level of craving or drivenness lack of freedom

304
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:06,160
there's a whole other class of emotions that come when there's no reactivity but rather

305
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:13,359
it's the free and unfettered response of our psychophysical system some people

306
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:18,480
might say of our hearts and those feelings and emotions

307
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,599
seem to grow and expand the more we're present for them rather

308
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:28,640
than dissolving because we're not feeding them anymore with our attention and our stories and all
