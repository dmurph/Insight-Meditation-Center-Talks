1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:08,559
welcome welcome nice to see you all it's nice to

2
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:15,240
practice together and today I'm going to continue

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,600
on this theme of it's January it's the beginning of the

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,920
year and you know it's not unusual for us to have this idea like okay you know

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,040
to assess maybe how the last year went and what I'm going to do this upcoming year

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:39,200
and heaven forbid we might make some resolutions all those things that we think we should be

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,239
doing and making a little joke out of it sometimes it can be really useful right

8
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:49,520
to uh set an intention at the beginning of the year

9
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,680
maybe uh start with a meditation practice or boost your meditation

10
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,760
practice or you know eat all those things that we know we should eat and

11
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:06,840
not eat those things that we know we shouldn't eat and exercise more all these things all these

12
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:13,520
things so there's this's way that uh January I might have mentioned this last week I can't remember I don't think I

13
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:21,000
did that I was kind of pleased to discover that it was named after this Roman god Janice right to of

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,759
beginnings and so it's not unusual maybe that there's this sense of

15
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:34,320
beginning with the new year and in the Buddhist tradition we don't

16
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,680
really emphasize Beginnings there isn't really this uh

17
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,719
pointing to Beginnings so much of course Beginnings are implicit within endings

18
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:51,320
but in the Buddhist tradition and maybe I'll just say as a

19
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:58,079
little aside when I say Buddhist tradition like Buddhism is really vast there are so many different Traditions

20
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:05,240
within it so Within this lineage this tradition that we practice here at

21
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:11,039
IMC there isn't a creation story I I never really thought about this before

22
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:17,800
until I until I did I guess thought like oh yeah there's like not an emphasis like how things

23
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,239
began there instead there's this idea that things arise due to causes and

24
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:31,440
conditions that things happen because the conditions are there for them to happen and that's how things begin so

25
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:39,000
then instead of just you like one particular thing that was a beginning in some way you might say there's not a

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:48,040
beginning and in the same way something that I really appreciate also about this tradition that um the only kind of like

27
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:55,120
um celebration that we have here at IMC is one that's common in Southeast Asia

28
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:03,040
and that is this uh visak we pronounce it vak there's different ways to pronounce it and this is like this real

29
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,080
efficiency like okay the Buddha's birth so that's the beginning but it's also

30
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,159
the day to celebrate his death and also the day of his Awakening

31
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:22,319
which is also a beginning right just all these kind of put together like just in one celebration that happens on the full

32
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,599
moon uh in the month of May usually in the month of

33
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:34,319
May and we might even think like well what like the symbol of Buddhism is a

34
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:40,959
wheel right with eight Spokes and this kind of implies this uh ongoing movement

35
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,799
it's not like a beginning and an end but something that's in

36
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:56,040
motion so instead what we talk about uh here in this tradition is about the

37
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,360
endings of suffering the end in of

38
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,400
difficulties like that's bringing this to an

39
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,159
end and of course the word is Dua that I'm translating as

40
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:17,639
suffering and uh Dua stands for this I kind of like this one word for such a

41
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:24,280
wide range little bit of stress on one end just something mildly uncomfortable

42
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,400
to something horrifying just tragic terrible things

43
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,520
that are happening on the other end so this one word for this wide range so for

44
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:41,000
the end of Dua is where this uh focus is on with

45
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,639
Buddhism and we might say related to that this ending this idea of ending the

46
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,160
ending of Dua but also this encouragement for us to notice and it's

47
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,800
a big part of practice is to notice the changing nature of

48
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:04,560
things in some ways you might say everything's ending and everything's

49
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,160
beginning and it's true that when you have a some real subtleness and some uh

50
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:17,960
often this happens on Retreat you can start to see oh yeah things are like flickering they're not as stable and

51
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:23,570
constant and as we imagine them to be as we are experiencing them to

52
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:29,240
[Music] be and so this idea of beginning maybe

53
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:35,199
is there implicit in this state of ending we might say the ending of Dua is

54
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:41,680
the beginning of peace wellbe

55
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,120
freedom so this idea of beginning like beginning in January I know that uh when

56
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:56,960
I lead uh guided meditations I'm often using this phrase begin

57
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:03,199
again so that if you're if you're using the breath as the anchor of your

58
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:09,720
meditation it's natural for the mind to drift away again unless you've been on a

59
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:17,639
retreat or sometime then the mind can really stay for a long time but usually if you're meditating for example just

60
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:23,720
coming here for 30 minutes of course I should say of course the mind is

61
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,840
drifting chances are you just came from a lot lot of doing maybe from work or

62
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:36,280
something and the mind is busy and so that busyness gets carried into the meditation and it takes time it takes

63
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:42,840
time for the mind to settle so the Mind drifts and then we just begin again with

64
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:48,919
the anchor which most often is the sensations of breathing we just begin

65
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:54,400
again so this idea of beginning again without this sense of oh you're going

66
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:01,800
back to the start as if you had never done anything now you just begin

67
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,360
again and we might say that this idea of beginning again is inherent in this idea

68
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:13,000
of cultivation of developing building up some of our

69
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,240
capacities as skills that we have could be mindfulness like what I uh

70
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,639
just described you know with the mind just coming back and just coming back and then the mind just starts to get the

71
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:31,680
hang of you know just hanging out there with the with the anchor but the same as true for loving

72
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:38,120
kindness maybe we're have a specific loving kindness practice when with that

73
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,400
the Mind might wander and but we come back again to this state state of you

74
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:50,638
know Wishing Well wishing others to have peace and happiness and

75
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:59,039
well-being we might even say this also about uh ethical practice right Sila

76
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:05,400
ethical practice the behavior the way we show up in the world the way that we treat others the way that we treat

77
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:12,159
ourselves this again is like begin again when we find ourselves maybe gossiping

78
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:17,759
something that's you know not helpful or taking that which isn't freely offered

79
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:25,000
in a way that I know there was a time when I was working uh I used to work for the US

80
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,159
government at one time and uh there was this real emphasis on don't take any

81
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:38,159
extra paper or pencils or anything these are us taxpayers are paying for this don't take anything but then when I went

82
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,640
to Corporate America after that they're like just you know take whatever you want and a lot of people were right they

83
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:49,959
were just taking stuff home that you know didn't really need but maybe I don't know why they were taking it home

84
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:55,800
but so just these are subtle thing not subtle these are minor things taking

85
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:02,079
pens and paper but there is this way in which uh

86
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:09,040
if we find ourselves maybe not following as closely to some of this ethical

87
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:15,560
ideals of not causing harm and not taking things that are not freely

88
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:21,760
offered to just begin again like oh yeah okay I used to do that let's see what

89
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,399
it's like maybe if I have a real commitment to my ethical

90
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:34,760
life for me this was a big movement in uh my I would say my spiritual

91
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:40,079
life in the beginning it was hard to meditate I just yeah had a hard time

92
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:45,200
with it but I thought well okay I'm going to give it a go with this these

93
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:53,920
precepts of um specifically um not I'll just say not

94
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:00,640
telling lies there's different ways we can translate it but cuz I used to

95
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:09,480
I used to say this a lot oh sorry I'm late the traffic was bad the traffic wasn't bad I just was

96
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:15,839
disorganized and just didn't leave the house on time or something like this or sorry I'm late there was you know I was

97
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,040
just make up some story about why I was late and I said you know what I'm going

98
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:27,399
to see what is it like to not tell these little white lies which we tend to think are like inconsequential who cares there

99
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:34,600
just a small thing turns out that they are consequential because I had made this

100
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,959
commitment to myself I wasn't going to do that anymore I had to show up on

101
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:45,360
time and showing up on time meant I had to be a little bit more organized and it

102
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,959
felt better to be a little bit more organized and to show up on time and not have to apologize it felt good to be

103
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:57,880
showing up on time and this just had these repercussions in my life my friends noticed like oh you're always on

104
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:04,959
time but this is something a small example I'm giving but this idea of beginning

105
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,240
again whatever we might choose that we want to cultivate mindfulness loving

106
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:17,079
kindness some of e ethical practices this commitment to not causing harm this

107
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:22,200
commitment to working towards a way in which there can be more peace and ease

108
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:28,480
and well-being so I'm going to say uh here's

109
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,839
a short little poem that talks a little bit about this it starts by talking

110
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:39,680
about endings and then it turns towards

111
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:46,880
Beginnings those of you who hear me regularly will not be surprised who the poet is it's Rose Mar

112
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:53,480
traumer uh she's just such a wonderful poet and um she wrote this poem at the

113
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:59,360
end of December in 2020 so we all know what 2020 was like

114
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:06,519
like and so she was reflecting back on that year when she uh wrote this

115
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,560
poem it's called bonfire of the

116
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:18,519
heart I throw in any tallies I've been keeping the ones that record who did

117
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:26,040
what and when I throw in all the letters I wrote in my head but didn't

118
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:32,839
send I throw in tickets I didn't buy to places I didn't visit I throw in all

119
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:38,240
those expectations I had for myself and

120
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,639
the world last year and countless lists of things I

121
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:50,639
thought I should do I love watching them ignite turn into

122
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:57,959
Embers to Ash I love the space they leave behind

123
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:04,600
where anything can happen love this last line I love the

124
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:13,120
space they leave behind where anything can happen so this idea that endings leave a

125
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:20,720
space and she's pointing to anything can happen it's like this beginning there might be something new that

126
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,480
arises there's this way that even the notion of Beginnings as a sense of you

127
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,800
know possibilities has this this idea of maybe this opportunities that uh we

128
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:39,680
aren't aware of or hadn't even thought of before so beginnings of course are

129
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:47,639
associated with endings but there's this maybe there's this uh way in which part of Beginnings

130
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:56,600
also have this uh inherent optimism something this idea of like okay something new can arise it's possible

131
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:02,079
this grind that I feel s stuck in perhaps maybe it's possible for

132
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:07,639
something different to arise but it might require that some

133
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:14,560
endings happen some of the ways in which we are holding on to our sense of self

134
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:22,680
some of the ways in which we are holding on to ideas of how we think things should be or how we think things should

135
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:28,120
not be not that we have to give up any ideas

136
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:33,320
of how we imagine the world could be or some of the ways in which we would like

137
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:39,320
it to be but it's the holding on and clinging to like No it should be this

138
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:46,199
way no I want it to be this way can we just hold these things

139
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:52,040
lightly can we hold our ideas our hopes for the world lightly this way in which

140
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:58,279
we hold on tightly just reaffirms this sense of me against the world sends up

141
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:05,560
this sense of of all these problems out there US versus them and everything has

142
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:14,240
to get fixed out there instead of this sense of well you know maybe there can be some growth that happens

143
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:22,839
here so starting a new after some

144
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:29,160
endings so the Buddha in his life story of course he had a number of beginnings

145
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:35,279
and we tell part of his biography we often aren't focusing on this instead

146
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:43,000
often there is this idea you know he's held up as an idealized uh individual somebody who has um attained

147
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,920
Awakening it makes perfect sense to do this one way we might understand that is

148
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,959
I would I would my understanding he was an extraordinary person but in this

149
00:15:53,959 --> 00:16:00,079
tradition we really highlight the humanity of the person who be became the

150
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:06,800
Buddha and in this version of his story everything is part of what the tradition holds but I'm going to change a little

151
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:13,040
bit some of the emphasis that we place instead of everything that was um

152
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:19,519
wonderful or idealized point out some of the ways in which he had to begin again

153
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,959
had to begin again over and over quite a few times there's this way in which you know

154
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:31,480
of course we are beginning again too when we're cultivating things with whether it's mindfulness or whatever it

155
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,920
is in your professional life or in your personal

156
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:42,560
life so many of you know that uh the person who was to become the Buddha

157
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,880
started out as uh having a life with you know we could say of

158
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:53,360
luxury with uh lots of sensual indulgences and whatever ways uh we

159
00:16:53,360 --> 00:17:00,560
might imagine probably that was being experienced but then he realized oh

160
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,919
there's something more and I want to seek

161
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:12,079
it so um the way that this gets captured in the ancient Buddhist L literature is

162
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:20,240
that he wanted to seek the Supreme state of sublime peace Supreme state of

163
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,918
sublime peace notice it's not some great

164
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:31,080
philosophical uh thing that he's after it's just he just wanted some

165
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:39,880
peace I appreciate this very much so he left his uh life of sensual

166
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:47,880
indulgences and all this uh niceties and luxuries and began with learning some

167
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:54,120
meditative practices was able to achieve some meditative

168
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,559
States but then he realized well that actually wasn't the Supreme state of

169
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:05,240
sublime peace even though some of those meditative states are very pleasant it's

170
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:11,120
not the highest and when they end they end and they always will it's not like

171
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:17,600
you can get into those States and stay there forever so then he began again with okay

172
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:24,559
well this didn't work these medit attaining these meditative States maybe I can try some of this um

173
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:33,120
asceticism extreme asceticism that some practitioners were doing at the time and so he was doing a

174
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,640
number of um practices including not eating so practically starving himself

175
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:46,000
to death and he he's at this time he's practicing with uh five other

176
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:53,200
individuals and so the six of them are doing this extreme aestheticism and uh the person who was

177
00:18:53,200 --> 00:19:00,799
to become the Buddha says yeah this isn't the Supreme state of sublime peace either and I

178
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:07,480
don't think I can get there from here because I'm he's not saying this but there was just so much

179
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:16,360
suffering so then he has a Insight he has a memory about earlier in his life

180
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:23,240
he had had some meditative states that weren't like these really high meditative states he was um practicing

181
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:29,000
earlier but he felt like okay from there that felt like there was some ease there

182
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,840
so then he started to begin again with a middle way not sensual indulgences not

183
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:41,000
ex self mortification but something that had some pleasantries but also had some

184
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,080
discipline the middle way and it was practicing that way in

185
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:53,240
which he became awakened and then became the individual that we call the

186
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,720
Buddha so he had to Begin Again a number of times like you know trying practices

187
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,880
until he found a way and then after

188
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,960
Awakening then what and it seems that he wasn't sure

189
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:17,080
what to do he had thought well he was hesitant to begin teaching he thought that I'm not sure

190
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:22,200
that I'm going to teach and the literature says that if I were to teach

191
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,679
the Dharma others would not understand me and that would be wearing and

192
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:36,120
Troublesome for me so he's saying yeah I don't think anybody else would get it how do I explain this to

193
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:42,720
others but then he is convinced to teach by a deity that comes down and convinces

194
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,960
him tells him no no no there are people that will understand so he he does he

195
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:56,919
begins to teach and he has in his mind who is he going to teach and uh he settles on

196
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:04,400
teaching those five individual uals that he was practicing with before the ones that were doing the

197
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:10,360
asceticism and on his way to walk to where they are it's about 130 miles or

198
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:17,200
so so it's a you know it's a journey uh to walk there and he he meets

199
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,320
somebody who uh says UPA is his name and

200
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:28,640
UPA meets the Buddha soon after his Awakening and notices wow there's some

201
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:37,640
something different about this person here and he says your faculties are

202
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:42,799
clear your skin is pure and bright who is your

203
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:48,840
teacher so this would would have been a common thing to say like who is your teacher like who is your who do you

204
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:55,279
follow but they noticed like okay must have been what is this that your skin is pure and bright and your faculties this

205
00:21:55,279 --> 00:22:03,120
could have been like his eyes seemed like something's different about this person that just became awakened and

206
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:10,679
like who's your teacher and I'm imagining the upaca is wondering well maybe I'll go you know to that same teacher because clearly you've had some

207
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:16,559
benefit and uh maybe I can go to that teacher

208
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:23,600
too and then the Buddha replies uh I'm excerpting some of this I

209
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:29,840
have no teacher and one like me exists nowhere else else in the

210
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,679
world I am the accomplished one I am the teacher

211
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:43,960
Supreme so opacus shakes his head and say if you say so and turns around and

212
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:52,240
walks away so I kind of like this like okay so the Buddha he begins teaching but the

213
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:58,000
first person he meets he's not able to teach that person instead he kind like

214
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,880
Pro proclaims that he is the Buddha and UPA was oh

215
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,039
okay and shakes his head and turns and walks away they they say they he walked

216
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:18,120
um I forgot what the expression is it's like an alternate route you know he kind of wanted to avoid the Buddha so for me

217
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:24,640
is kind of an interesting thing so even his beginning teaching didn't uh go you

218
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:31,080
know wasn't like he immediately knew what to do So eventually he comes to this group of

219
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:37,320
five that he had been practicing with before and they have a different

220
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:43,440
reaction they see him and they can see that he has been eating and looks better

221
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:49,240
and has more energy and they say amongst themselves they see him in the distance

222
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:55,159
and they say to themselves Let's uh not uh treat him give him the honor or

223
00:23:55,159 --> 00:24:00,799
respect of a of somebody that's coming to to meet us we'll just treat him like

224
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:07,279
somebody that we know and um they show

225
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:12,559
up and they see him and they recognize oh yeah

226
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:17,960
something is different about him and then he has a conversation with

227
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:24,600
them and they say okay yeah we recognize something has shifted in you maybe you

228
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:31,679
can teach us so then he teaches them but they don't all immediately become

229
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:39,159
awakened only one has the first stage of Awakening kund is his name and it takes

230
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:45,360
some time because the it's reported how they are going out for MMS round so that means you know every day they're going

231
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,440
out to get more meals it takes some time before the first person becomes um

232
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:56,039
awakened and then it takes a a little bit more time for all five of them too

233
00:24:56,039 --> 00:25:03,720
so now there are six people in the world that are awake the Buddha and he helped five other people his former uh

234
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:09,760
companions when he was an athetic so he began with people who were

235
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:16,760
already spiritual Seekers and then the sixth student uh

236
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:22,559
the Buddha went to the opposite extreme to a very wealthy lay person who had no

237
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:29,200
interest in the spiritual life his name is Yesa

238
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:37,640
and teaches him and he becomes awakened and then I'll just say then y's

239
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:45,799
father and then y's mother so here's the first woman and then y's wife is uh the

240
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:53,200
second woman so persons uh let's see six seven persons 8 and nine to get uh

241
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:59,559
awakened are women I just want to slip that in there

242
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:05,760
so this idea about Beginnings right this little biography

243
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:12,440
of the Buddha I kind of like start the new year often kind of like talking about some of this and I'm highlighting

244
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:17,760
how we had to begin again it's not like everything was easy and fast and

245
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:24,320
simple and so we begin again and you've had chances there are

246
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:31,320
lots of Beginnings in your practice first time coming to a meditation center first time coming to IMC first time

247
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:37,240
meditating maybe first time going on Retreat or maybe you're feeling inspired

248
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:44,880
that uh sometime this year you'll go on a retreat if you haven't or maybe going to a day long a whole day of practice

249
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:53,320
here at IMC or something like this so this idea of

250
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:59,559
beginning such a like an inherent part of practice to begin

251
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:08,840
again but I'll also say well what was the beginning teaching what was the

252
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:14,320
teaching where did the Buddha begin or let me say a different way how did he

253
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:20,600
start beginning or what what was the beginning thing that he taught to lay

254
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:27,799
people to Yesa he started with generosity he started with teaching

255
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:35,520
about generosity because generosity is this movement right of like letting go or of

256
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:45,120
uh giving or opening up or unclenching unclenching our minds or our um ideas or

257
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,799
with uh maybe with time or our resources generosity doesn't have to be about

258
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:58,320
money can give people the benefit of the doubt so it's this movement generosity

259
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,360
this movement of the heart and mind about letting go and we might say that

260
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:11,039
this whole practice is about letting go letting go of all the ways in which

261
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:20,039
we are holding on and limiting ourselves I'm not saying that we have

262
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:27,640
to accept everything and be passive I'm talking about this the opposite of this

263
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:35,880
movement of feeling like I need more I need more I need more this way in which we can feel like

264
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:43,080
okay things will be okay or I will start behaving better or um doing showing up

265
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:48,880
in a way that I want to in the world as soon as something else happen as soon as I've

266
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:55,840
acquired whatever it might be acquired that new job acquired uh something in a

267
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,919
with a relationship a um retired or as soon

268
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:07,159
as our life situation has changed in some particular way or as soon as you

269
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:13,960
know I've done X Y and Z it's endless so there's this way we feel like

270
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:20,559
we have to either acquire experiences or we have to acquire money or acquire

271
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:28,200
objects or acquire respect or acquire whatever it is relationships

272
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:33,919
before we can start practicing and so much of this practice

273
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:42,919
is about letting go is the opposite movement and if we find it difficult to

274
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:47,720
even uh think of this idea of letting

275
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:57,200
go then we can just have some curiosity about well what is it that's underneath

276
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,518
this idea that I need to have

277
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:09,559
more to be sure I'm not saying that we shouldn't have more money I wish everybody all the wealth that they need

278
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:14,919
of course that would be great right just imagine the how the world would be if everybody felt like they had enough

279
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:23,960
wouldn't that be fantastic of I'm not saying that we have to just accept for what what we have I'm

280
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:31,679
pointing to this idea like this discontent this feeling of no I I I need

281
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:37,600
more and what's underneath that what's fueling

282
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:43,440
that because this Sublime peace is not going to come around as long as we're

283
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:50,200
ignoring that this feeling of no I got to have more whatever's here is not good

284
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:57,519
enough I refuse to accept it I have to have more there that's often this underlying

285
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:06,440
belief that we have that we're not even noticing and it kind of like fuel some

286
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:14,240
drive to do a lot of good in the world so this I'm not saying that uh we

287
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:21,120
should just be Bliss blobs or something like this and pointing to this can we

288
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,679
let go of this idea

289
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:35,000
that the Sublime peace or any kind of Peace can only be found in the future

290
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:41,240
can only be found when things are different generosity is kind of like

291
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:50,000
this opening it's pointing towards this letting go and this generosity with literal

292
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,480
things with our time or with our resources helps us to learn about

293
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:03,120
ourselves helps us to see see that what is it that uh what are some of

294
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:10,240
these beliefs about what's really valuable what are some of our beliefs that we have about what we need more

295
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,960
of and part of the way that generosity is the first teaching is it helps us to

296
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:21,960
understand ourselves more understand okay what is it that I

297
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:27,360
think is valuable what is it that I think that uh maybe some people deserve

298
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:33,279
and other people don't deserve or you know some of these beliefs that we might

299
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:43,080
have because Awakening is the greatest letting go it's the deepest letting go

300
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:49,840
it's letting go of this sense of that there is this uh Essence this inherent

301
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:55,840
core um to me and to which everything's

302
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:03,120
happening like there's this Bond changing thing and everything's just happening to

303
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:10,240
this and as soon as this thing feels good then everything's going to be

304
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:16,960
fine but with practice we start to see actually there isn't anything there is

305
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:22,279
there isn't a inherent thing it's just a collection of

306
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:29,159
experiences that we're just having over and over you know again and again and again that's turns out to be all what life is

307
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:35,679
but you don't have to just because I said it you don't have to believe it and you don't have to try to make sense out

308
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:41,919
of this either this is usually it's something experiential it's usually something that with a meditative

309
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:48,279
experience or something that can be like oh wow yeah there really yeah there isn't a self fear actually in the way

310
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:53,759
that I thought so it's not something you have to adopt is a

311
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:03,600
belief so part of the reason why the Buddha was talking with yes and this beginning with generosity is because

312
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:09,398
letting goes this this movement is all about what this practice is about and

313
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:16,240
generosity we help to learn about ourselves what are some of our beliefs what is it that's fueling this

314
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:23,118
sense of that there has to be more instead of this letting go but not only

315
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:28,960
that this generosity like literally being generous with our time time or

316
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:36,158
giving people the benefit of the doubt or with our expertise it also helps build

317
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:43,240
community gen generosity is a way whatever we're generous with in whatever way

318
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:50,800
volunteering I know that uh through volunteering I've like in different organizations different places

319
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:56,200
I've really have had a a sense of community like PE us coming together to

320
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:03,079
do something you know to something that's important to us so generosity is also a place that

321
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:10,200
builds community and this practice what a difference it makes if we have some

322
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:19,680
community so this idea of beginning again beginning with whatever is

323
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:28,320
important for you something that you Aspire for and to recognize that just be

324
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,760
beginning again I like this idea again recog it's like honors and

325
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:40,520
respects the human tendency to not do things in a straight line we're not

326
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:48,280
machines we we are off you know get uh distracted we lose our

327
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:53,480
motivation we sometimes uh get filled with doubt

328
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:59,119
you know all these things whatever is happening can we just begin

329
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:07,520
again just begin again and the Buddha just began again and if you feel like

330
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:14,440
well with your spiritual life you're not sure where to begin or maybe you do have some clarity but I can of offer a good

331
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:21,720
starting place for all kinds of things is generosity for your spiritual practice for working on your

332
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:27,359
relationships or your professional life all these things generosity can be a

333
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:34,480
good place to begin so I'll end there and then I'll

334
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:40,720
open it up to see if there's some questions and comments thank

335
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:57,359
you do do we know how long it took yasa and his wife to get enlightened after

336
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:03,720
the met the Buddha the story is the same day they

337
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:09,760
met come awakened that's the story that's the

338
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:17,680
story there's a story the uh the Buddhist literature is filled with all kinds of people who meet the Buddha and

339
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:24,160
become awakened and also people who don't who need time and have to practice and who are monastics under him or

340
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:31,800
followers or lay people under him and who don't become awaken and immediately so there's a whole range of people in

341
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:39,520
the sutas wouldn't it be nice well actually maybe if you meet a Buddha right

342
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:47,280
maybe do you think there are there are people nowadays who meet somebody and

343
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:54,440
get in light that doesn't happen anymore if it happens I don't know about

344
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,440
it

345
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,880
anybody else have a comment or

346
00:38:15,319 --> 00:38:22,440
question yeah uh thanks for the talk um I think um some parts of it reminded me of

347
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:29,040
some concept I came across and there's a newsletter um there's a concept of uh

348
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:35,800
not knowing um and then there's a phrase associated with it which is like not

349
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:41,000
knowing is not the same as knowing nothing but it's this idea of holding

350
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,200
beliefs lightly um and so part of what this talk is

351
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:52,760
inspiring me to do is to try and like um build that intuition for how to become

352
00:38:52,760 --> 00:39:01,200
more comfortable naturally I'm a pretty I would say like anxious thinker tend to over um over anchor on oh I know all

353
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:08,400
these things therefore it might lead to XYZ risk um but the idea of not knowing

354
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:14,839
is pretty refreshing so I don't know if you have more kind of comments on that as a concept or ways to get more

355
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:20,160
comfortable with that but um that's just kind of what I'm what's going on after

356
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:27,359
this talk yeah yeah yeah not knowing it's uh this is a great topic and uh

357
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:34,960
especially like uh I'm somebody who I spent my life trying to know things to figure things out and uh it was uh such

358
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:42,800
a relief when I realize it's like oh we don't have to know things and this

359
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:48,200
uh but what I think it requires is a little bit of

360
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:53,480
uh yeah confidence that okay things are going to unfold the way they're going to

361
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:59,920
unfold whether I understand them or not or whether I uh yeah whether I

362
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,960
understand them or not

363
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:11,760
and so how to work with this is to recognize sometimes the freedom I guess

364
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:19,000
a few things I'll say one is there can be a certain Freedom like okay I'm not going to try to figure that

365
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,720
out and just like not try to figure something out whereas you know there's

366
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,920
cuz there is a nice feeling like oh yeah I just got it like that's like a nice uh

367
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:36,359
feeling but there can also be a feeling of uh a nice feeling with you know what

368
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:41,880
this can just be how it is and I don't have to try to figure it out because so

369
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:47,520
often I mean some things we can figure out like why isn't the checkbook balanced like usually those things with

370
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:53,920
numbers we can do right but why is it that this happens when that doesn't happen I can't think of an example off

371
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:59,200
the top of my head but to there's something about like you know it's just

372
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:05,560
that way and I don't know why and that's

373
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:12,839
okay there can be some real Freedom there so to not

374
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:18,200
knowing and then I'll say that um

375
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:26,280
often what the reason why we do want to know is because there's some unsettledness underneath there's some

376
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:31,800
like uncomfortable like okay this and actually The Knowing

377
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:39,240
is a distraction trying to trying to figure it out turns out to be a distraction from something that's

378
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:45,560
uncomfortable and the uncomfortable thing is an emotion or um a disturbing

379
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:52,680
thought or something like this and it turns out that as long as that uncomfortable disturbing thought is

380
00:41:52,680 --> 00:42:01,680
there we will always we will just find more things to figure out just as as a way to distract ourselves from often our

381
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:07,520
life so it's not like okay as soon as I figur out might there be a moment oh okay I figured that out yeah but then

382
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:13,960
there's that other thing and it just never ends it never ends

383
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:19,839
so that to be okay with not knowing makes space for us to stop distracting

384
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:27,559
ourselves from what's actually happening which might be bad news cuz we might be

385
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:33,640
I'm saying it's bad news because it's not what we want we we're trying to figure things out in order to not be

386
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:41,280
with what is but to be with what is is the way forward this is how you'll find peace this is where the this the peace

387
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:49,000
is is to actually be with what is and not always distracting ourselves with trying to figure things

388
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:59,119
out thank you well set yeah back there

389
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,720
I feel like I'm having a really warm response to and I'm going to try and

390
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:17,559
choose my words carefully here but like you highlighting the fallibility of the role model of the spiritual practice we

391
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:23,400
have and it's one thing I've always kind of enjoyed is that he always had to start again and as you were sharing

392
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:30,480
about starting over for the Buddha I for some reason popped in my mind his relationship with his son Rula

393
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:35,800
like he pieced out like I'm going to give you a name and I'm gone and then he

394
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:41,920
his son comes to him and then going through and teaching having to start over and over with his son over again

395
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:48,680
like teach him as a monastic and just I know with relationships in the new year that just really touched a sweet cord in

396
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:54,520
my heart so thank you thank you thank you Conrad yeah I kind of skipped over that

397
00:43:54,520 --> 00:44:01,000
part of the story those of you know the budh story know that uh the Buddha left

398
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:08,319
to on his spiritual quest uh right after his son was born and there was like wait

399
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:12,960
what maybe I'll talk about that another Dara

400
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:21,520
talk okay so I see that we're at the end of the or it's at the half hour 8:30 so

401
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:30,240
thank you all for your practice and your kind attention and I wish you a lovely rest of the evening thank you you
