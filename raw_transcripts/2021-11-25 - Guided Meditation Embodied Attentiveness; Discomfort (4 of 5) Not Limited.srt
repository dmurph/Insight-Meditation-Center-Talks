1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:07,200
so good morning everyone and on this thanksgiving day thank you all

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,799
for being here and participating in this um

3
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:18,240
daily meditation we've been doing many of you have been coming for a long time and i'm

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,080
grateful for that and grateful that we've been able to have this

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,599
time together and share the dharma together and and the practice and

6
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:36,640
and uh certainly i felt very much the large sense of

7
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,719
community of people participating and i hope that all of you also will feel some sense of that you're actually

8
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,840
participating in a in a maybe a loose community but a definitely

9
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,039
a dharma community sharing something wonderful and perhaps

10
00:00:53,039 --> 00:01:01,440
also together bringing a good influence into our world

11
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,440
so

12
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,360
one of the characteristics of being free freedom is

13
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:26,439
being one of the goals of buddhism is to not be

14
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:34,000
limited in an unhealthy way that our life force our

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,200
ability to be present our ability to love to

16
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,439
be with others be with ourselves is not limited by

17
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,240
having embracing ourselves life or closing down or withdrawing

18
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,320
or identifying too strongly with whatever is happening including our

19
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,840
discomfort including our comfort and identifying strongly with our

20
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,759
desires and our aversions our preferences

21
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,720
so that something inside can feel open and unlimited

22
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,440
and one of the things we're exploring in meditation whether it's consciously or

23
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,760
unconsciously is how to be have a sense of

24
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:34,560
no limitations nothing that defines us nothing

25
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:42,640
restricts us nothing diminishes us including any desire or wish to be

26
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,480
unlimited to become and identify with being unlimited

27
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,000
and to prefer that so it's a little bit you know

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,519
so there is a little protection from overdoing this stuff and this delightful thing of being being

29
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:08,080
not limited not restricted so

30
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,000
to be able to sit here and breathe with what is

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,680
is symbolic or represents just being with what is

32
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,280
but breathing through it breathing with it being mindful of it

33
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,319
where the mindfulness itself and maybe that may be the breathing

34
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:36,159
is not defined by whatever comfort or discomfort is

35
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:42,319
happening so assuming a

36
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,840
a posture which will support you

37
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,720
confidently

38
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,959
in being open not collapsing

39
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:07,920
not diminishing yourself in any way but not puffing yourself up a posture

40
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:14,720
that maybe has some stability and strength

41
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,479
as if the posture

42
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:26,400
can manage fine with whatever happens the posture has a as if the posture has

43
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,960
a capacity to hold whatever goes on for us

44
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,800
without us collapsing to it

45
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:46,080
in lowering your gaze softening your focus

46
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:53,160
and perhaps gently closing the eyes

47
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,039
and to then gently

48
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:11,840
maybe slowly as it's as it's comfortable take a few long slow deep breaths

49
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:31,120
one of the functions of the deep inhales is to stretch up against and

50
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,160
through maybe places of tension and holding

51
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,800
in the body places where we are kept limited

52
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,639
gently almost as if you enjoy it take a deep breath stretching into the

53
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,759
chest the shoulders especially places that are still

54
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,039
held or tight

55
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,120
and then on the exhale to relax

56
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:34,120
and then letting your breathing return to normal

57
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,639
and with a normal breathing whatever that is for you right now

58
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,280
imagine that your breathing

59
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:53,840
moves freely through whatever way you feel uncomfortable or

60
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:00,479
any way that you feel contracted or

61
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:06,720
tense agitated in your body or your mind

62
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:14,080
imagine that your breathing can just move through that gently

63
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,880
like a self that soothes whatever is there

64
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,560
perhaps relaxing as you exhale

65
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:36,399
and then settling down to just breathing experiencing how the body

66
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,320
feeling how the body experiences breathing

67
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,040
and letting breathing be at the middle of everything

68
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:39,920
as if maybe you're doing some very your person is doing very fine work

69
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,200
even even with the lots of activity in the room around you

70
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:54,000
you get completely absorbed in the work you're doing something that's delicate and careful it

71
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,399
needs to be carefully done watch repair or

72
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,399
surgery

73
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:16,399
and let yourself imagine that the breathing is the delicate work

74
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,320
that you give yourself over to

75
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,760
partly so you're not defined or reactive to anything else

76
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,279
leave everything else alone

77
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,120
let everything else take care of itself and for these minutes

78
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,760
breathe mindfully that's the work

79
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,680
at hand for now and if other things arise that are strong

80
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,959
stay with your breathing that's where the work is

81
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:08,839
but breathe through or breathe with this other thing

82
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:49,200
after these minutes of meditating is there some

83
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:58,480
better quality capacity you have for being simply present for yourself

84
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:09,200
and search around inside for the your capacity for simple presence

85
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,000
open available to experience

86
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,960
not asserting yourself and not distracted

87
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,760
but here in this with a simple

88
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,720
attentiveness

89
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:38,799
maybe an attention that's embodied embodied

90
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,799
mindfulness

91
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,639
and how might you call upon this capacity

92
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,278
today how about you let it

93
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:16,400
come to the forefront so that you are not limited

94
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,640
by circumstances

95
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:34,240
and as we come to the end of the sitting may our capacity for simple presence

96
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:41,000
simple attention embodied attentiveness

97
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:50,080
allow us to listen deeply to others

98
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,399
to receive others in our hearts

99
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:05,760
to make room for our friendliness our good will

100
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:16,600
it may it be that this day and all days

101
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,960
and we spend time actively

102
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:29,880
expressing good will and well-wishing for others and for the world

103
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:37,440
and to do so in a way that it's at the same time

104
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,919
a good thing for our own hearts

105
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:51,600
that it's medicine for ourselves as well so it's not a duty to have good will

106
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,360
it's more like a

107
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:04,320
a healthy momentum arising from ourselves

108
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:11,559
may all beings be happy

109
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:17,120
may all beings be safe

110
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,360
may all beings be peaceful

111
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,120
and may all beings be free

112
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,600
and may our capacity for simple attentiveness

113
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:41,720
unrestricted unlimited attentiveness

114
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:47,760
contribute to these things

115
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:54,399
happening may we be a force

116
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:58,440
of goodness in this world

117
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:12,699
[Music]

118
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:28,240
to learn how to be wise about discomfort

119
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:35,120
one of the interesting questions around discomfort

120
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:42,559
is to consider what is the function of discomfort what's the message certainly as we asked

121
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:48,880
yesterday but what is the what is the function how does it what does it do for us

122
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:56,000
and is a function healthy for us or not healthy supportive or not supportive

123
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,840
and certainly there are times when we feel uneasy about something that we should feel uneasy about it feels like

124
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:08,880
it's not a healthy thing or ethical thing or something or safe thing

125
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:15,039
and so the function of our discomfort is to let us know sometimes before we're consciously aware

126
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:23,279
that oh there's something here to to be careful for but sometimes the function of discomfort

127
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:29,760
is to have us hold back have us

128
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:35,679
restrict ourselves or limit ourselves or close down not because there's any real danger out

129
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:41,360
there but because we're uncut we are uncomfortable and easy about

130
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:47,600
things which are good things that are healthy that somehow we assume there's

131
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,799
threats where there is no threat or we project

132
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:58,720
uh we bring along with us a concept definition of who we are

133
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:06,080
and who we need to be that maybe it's not necessary but it's the definition the self-concept

134
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:14,640
which is we feel oh it's going to be threatened here or there's a discomfort because we

135
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:20,640
for what we want or what we don't want or we don't want to be we want to be seen by others in a

136
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:26,000
certain way and we're you know so there's there's ways in which then

137
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,519
when we're uncomfortable we hold ourselves in check

138
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,720
and in times when we actually

139
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,799
limit ourselves unnecessarily where it's actually we don't avail ourselves of the goodness

140
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:47,919
the wonderfulness the potential that's here

141
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:53,760
and one of the ways that's kind of dramatic is when we feel uncomfortable about

142
00:32:53,760 --> 00:33:00,880
love uncomfortable about warm feelings and warm-heartedness that we might have

143
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:06,080
or that others have uh we might feel like you know threatened

144
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:11,600
by people's warm-heartedness or feel like we're obligated to return it or do people favor or

145
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:18,320
or we just we're uncomfortable with intimacy uncomfortable with kindness sometimes some people are

146
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:26,159
or we're uncomfortable with expressing kindness expressing love expressing care and some people feel very uncomfortable

147
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:31,278
with expressing gratitude even though it's thanksgiving

148
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:38,000
saying thank you to others or expressing our appreciation of others

149
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,000
and sometimes we're uncomfortable simply stay to stay present without saying anything without actively expressing

150
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,799
love or friendliness or or gratitude but we're afraid of

151
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:57,760
just staying fully present aware receiving whatever is happening in the room

152
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:03,279
when what's happening is good people are being happy and celebrating and

153
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:08,480
maybe people are appreciating you and so then we don't feel that

154
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,040
we don't allow ourselves to to to be with it

155
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:18,878
so one of the interesting issues around the word comfort and

156
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:23,919
discomfort is that the word comfort comes from the

157
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:31,200
french word for strength with fault

158
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,878
with with uh it's related to the english word force but we're not talking about a force here

159
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:42,320
which maybe seems aggressive but rather a strength with strength

160
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:49,839
uh with power and so discomfort is can be seen as a way in which we

161
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:57,200
limit we hold back we killed and check our own strength to be comfortable is not to be have a

162
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:02,960
pleasant abiding and have a wonderfully comfortable couch to to live in

163
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:09,520
but rather in the dharma uh comfort is to have a delightful

164
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:17,200
peaceful but strong kind of inner strength in our attentiveness in our presence

165
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:22,640
in our posture in our ability to be with what is

166
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:28,240
and this turns the concept of comfort and discomfort around a little bit

167
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:33,680
and um and uh so that um the idea of not letting

168
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:38,960
discomfort limit us not let discomfort allow some natural

169
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:45,680
life force to blossom and bloom and be present

170
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:52,800
in a peaceful way maybe even a gentle way because when we're with people

171
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,880
uh sometimes when we want to be careful that we're not asserting our will

172
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:05,760
on them asserting our power on them our strength but in the dharma

173
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,680
this practice we do the movement is in fact to becoming

174
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:18,079
strong buddhism is often associated with being peaceful and calm

175
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:23,680
and that seems to go against the grain for being strong kind of goes a grand

176
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:29,440
against the grain it doesn't seem like the two are compatible but they are and that's kind of the

177
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:35,440
wonderful thing that it's possible to be have strength in calmness

178
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:41,200
strength in peacefulness and uh and uh

179
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:46,880
and one way to have that is we're not diminishing ourselves when we're peaceful and calm there's a

180
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:52,320
embodied attentiveness so we're there and present for what goes on

181
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:58,640
uh we don't need to go to the back of the room and pretend we don't count we don't need to

182
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:07,040
be in the middle of the room and be the one who has all the attention but we could be fully in the room

183
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:14,640
in some balanced way that is uh with our with a kind of peaceful strength peaceful confidence

184
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:19,680
that here i am um and the advantage of that

185
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:26,960
is that when we are present in a in a confident way and a strong way where strength is there we actually have

186
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:32,160
more to offer other people our love for others our kindness for

187
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:38,320
others our friendliness for others is um is uh it kind of

188
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:44,880
has more i want to say embodiment has more strength has more fullness to it

189
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,720
um you know if i'm kind of slumped in the couch completely slumped and half asleep

190
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,400
and and uh and kind of look over to someone and say oh yeah you know

191
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,920
you know i think you're great you know and then i fall asleep you know it's there's no strength to it

192
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:08,640
but if i'm standing with someone i walk up to them in an unthreatening way and just really there in a strong way and

193
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:15,040
say i really appreciate you that appreciation has so much more value

194
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:22,160
than uh than you know slumping in the couch is kind of mumbling something before i fall fall asleep

195
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:27,839
so it may be a dramatic contrast but but

196
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:34,720
today in other times when be careful with how you restrict yourself or limit

197
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:40,800
yourself with your discomfort this uh discomfort one of the functions

198
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:46,800
is to limit us is to protect us when it's necessary

199
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,839
but we often succumb to it when it's not really necessary

200
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:56,880
and so what we learn in meditation to happy have a simple embodied

201
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:05,520
attentiveness and really be here for our experience without holding back or collapsing or

202
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:11,599
cowering or just fully here and not asserting ourselves not insisting on who we are

203
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:18,480
but just here in a full way is something that

204
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:25,760
we can learn to do if we learn how to be wise about our discomfort

205
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:32,640
how to recognize when it's there how to recognize how we

206
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:38,640
how it causes reactivity the hindrances come up and we and they take over not rather than

207
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:44,400
discomfort and how we might limit ourselves and define

208
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:51,119
ourselves through the discomfort we can learn how to stay grounded and

209
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:56,480
present in the midst of this discomfort to breathe through it to

210
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:02,800
it know it's there but not let it limit us to be able to uh

211
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:08,960
to tell someone how much you care for them or how much you appreciate them or how wonderful they are or something in

212
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:15,760
an appropriate way it might be uncomfortable to do it maybe you're shy or something

213
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:22,480
but it doesn't have to be the discomfort of the shyness doesn't have to limit us

214
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:28,640
and so this is what we're learning and meditation to breathe with things and and uh breathe through things and to

215
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:34,560
allow things to be there but still to stay present for the breathing then we can learn to stay present for

216
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,160
what the task at hand is without being limited or defined by

217
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:45,280
some of the inner voices or inner feelings that might keep us limited

218
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:52,040
so sometimes we can we can relax and let go of our discomfort

219
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:58,160
sometimes we can not let it limit us and do what's wonderful to do in spite

220
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:03,280
of it and the advantage of really recognizing the discomfort

221
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:11,520
is we get to maybe look get the messages from it we can pay attention to it enough to know whether it's

222
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:16,640
we want to have it limit us or we want to use our skills

223
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:22,880
to be present in spite of it and offer ourselves

224
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:28,960
so it may be comfort we can translate now

225
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:36,079
into english as something like with our life force

226
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:42,720
and discomfort is without our life force and perhaps our life force when it's

227
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:50,319
most healthy most free is a peaceful force

228
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:57,680
one that has a lot of space and room for warmth and kindness and friendliness

229
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:05,680
generosity and respect appreciation for others

230
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:11,839
so on this day please

231
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:21,440
use these lessons as a way to live comfortably with your own life

232
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:26,720
force whether you're doing that alone or with other people that

233
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:34,960
it's a wonderful any day is a wonderful day to let your peaceful life force

234
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:40,880
arrive and offer you as confidence bring confidence

00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,838
and strength and presence to your life

236

and if you have time today to meditate a little bit

237
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:59,000

238
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,838
