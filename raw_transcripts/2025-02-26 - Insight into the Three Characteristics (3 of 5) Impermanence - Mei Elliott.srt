1
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:11,799
good morning dear ones let's start with a sound check let me know if you can hear my voice and let me know if you can

2
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:14,320
hear the

3
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:31,960
bell and also let me know if you can see the video

4
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,280
so we'll give that just a moment or two to um get to you and come back on the

5
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,718
chat usually takes a minute

6
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:07,799
let's get started good morning all my name is May Elliot and I am beaming in from Santa

7
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:14,720
Cruz California and today we will begin our investigation of the three

8
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,960
characteristics um in our meditations uh will start each day for for the

9
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:25,439
following uh the upcoming three days um each day we'll start by uh cultivating

10
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,000
some of the supportive conditions for insight um so we'll begin each Day by

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,960
connecting with contentment uh then we'll cultivate somadi You by settling with a breath by uh inviting the mind to

12
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:47,079
stabilize and then we'll open to whatever our Insight theme is for the day uh and the theme for today is Ana or

13
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:53,200
impermanence inconstancy and uh while I'll be

14
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,479
offering a practice that deliberately cultivates the perception of anich of

15
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,840
impermanence uh know that you can still have insight into a n without doing this

16
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:11,000
specific practice um there are many practices that aren't even intentionally or deliberately deliberately cultivating

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,319
Insight which still reveal insights so for example um you might be doing a

18
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,400
basic mindfulness practice like open awareness also called choiceless

19
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:30,040
attention and just not noting whatever arises in experience and a practice like this

20
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:36,120
reveal insights even if you're not looking for them even if you're not directly trying to cultivate them so

21
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,440
even though um uh we'll deliberately cultivate each of the Insight themes in

22
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,760
our guided meditations each day uh know that this isn't the only way to open to

23
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:53,000
Insight you don't need to go looking for it so uh with that said let's get

24
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,519
started go ahead and find your your meditation posture

25
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:08,599
connecting with a uh position that is both upright and

26
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,440
relaxed taking a moment to connect with the

27
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,400
body allowing yourself to soften

28
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:43,760
connecting with whatever is here for you whatever is happening in the heart in the mind in the

29
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:57,239
body and what you find it might be pleasant it might be unpleasant it might

30
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,599
be neither somewhere in between

31
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:11,840
and can you connect with some modom of contentment regardless of what you

32
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,480
find even if it's a very quiet

33
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,440
contentment a very subtle contentment

34
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,840
so actively bringing forth this sense of goodness remembering the goodness of

35
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,520
just getting to be still I have this opportunity to train

36
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,440
the mind and the

37
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:57,039
Heart maybe sensing a a sliver of gratitude

38
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:28,160
let's place a simple contentment however slight uh will

39
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:37,080
connect with our home base our anchor whether that's the breath or the body allowing yourself to

40
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,800
land if it's supportive for you you can continue the practice we discussed

41
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:02,520
yesterday connecting with the moment an inhale begins and coasting on the rest

42
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:08,319
of the breath almost like a bird flapping in

43
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,440
coasting gliding in the

44
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
air

45
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,560
e e

46
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,610
allowing the Blizzard of the mind to [Music]

47
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
settle

48
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
e

49
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
e

50
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,360
e e

51
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:09,480
maybe recalling the image of the sun cresting over the

52
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:15,399
horizon as being like that first moment the inhale

53
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:19,200
begins seeing the

54
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
sunrise

55
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
e

56
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
e

57
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,240
e e

58
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:44,519
having taken some time to open to the breath to settle with the

59
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:50,880
breath we'll now shift our attention to the changing nature of

60
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,839
experience to a n in

61
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,040
constancy well there are many ways to ATT to anicha but today we'll do it through the

62
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,240
changing nature of the body and the

63
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,959
soundscape starting with the body rather than having a narrow focus

64
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:21,959
of attention on the breath uh allow yourself to widen the attention almost

65
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:31,120
like widening the aperture on a camera so that you can take in the whole body

66
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:38,920
and when you do this you'll notice other Sensations come

67
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:45,680
into view you might notice that some

68
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:52,079
Sensations are more predominant than others at any given

69
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:02,880
moment if you do you know a predominant s sensation allow your attention to go

70
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:09,600
to that sensation to really sense it and explore

71
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:16,319
it maybe it's uh in the palm of one

72
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,920
hand so you're sensing and exploring the sensations in the

73
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,880
hand as long as they're

74
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:34,240
predominant you might notice this tingling

75
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:38,759
pressure

76
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:58,480
temperature you'll notice that the felt sense of the body of this sensation is

77
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,639
different then our mental image of that part of the

78
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:12,279
body it's different than our thought about that part of the

79
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:21,199
body we're staying with the felt experience the felt Sensations

80
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:41,040
it may be that that area of the body is no longer as predominant or there's

81
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:48,440
another Sensation that draws the attention which you in which case you can allow your attenion to shift to the

82
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,759
new

83
00:15:54,440 --> 00:16:01,399
area so being receptive receiving sensation [Music]

84
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:07,800
allowing the attention to move where it's called

85
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:58,399
it's fine if the breath becomes predominant and that draws your attention back

86
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,640
wherever you are in the body noticing tingling or

87
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:19,240
pulsing can you sense the changing nature of the

88
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:27,000
experience the fluxing shifting nature of

89
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
experience

90
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,840
e e

91
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:36,759
staying with a sensation until a another draws your

92
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:48,320
attention and seeing the way Sensations arise and pass as the attention

93
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
shifts

94
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,720
e e

95
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:31,320
even though the body is our primary Focus for the

96
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:40,360
meditation you may notice that emotions or moves or thoughts come

97
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:46,799
through these other experiences May draw the attention for a

98
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:53,360
time and if so rather than relating to them as

99
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:59,679
Intruders or distractions can you include in them in

100
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:07,159
your perception of anicha and you see them

101
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:15,640
arise flx and pass away as you return to the

102
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
body

103
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

104
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,520
e e

105
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:07,120
even Sensations that seem to be ongoing see if you can notice any

106
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:14,159
pulsation or vibration if so this is revealing some

107
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,000
change some Inc

108
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
constancy

109
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,440
e e

110
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,760
you might also include the soundscape

111
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:45,480
now noticing any sounds that

112
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:55,360
arise those sounds might be mirror maybe within your own

113
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:03,000
body breath [Music]

114
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,480
digestion maybe even the sound of the

115
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,640
heartbeat there might be sounds in the room you're in the

116
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:25,039
sound of my voice or sounds

117
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:30,320
Beyond maybe outside coming through

118
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,840
through noticing sounds coming and

119
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,679
going arising sustaining and passing

120
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,278
away e

121
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:39,120
even sounds that seem to be ongoing was there an inconstancy to them

122
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:45,120
maybe a pulsing a [Music]

123
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:51,360
vibration or sounds that may seem constant become

124
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:59,520
inconstant when the attention shifts to a different object momentarily maybe sensing the body for a

125
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:05,200
moment before noticing that same sound [Music]

126
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:11,440
again seeing this Inc constancy the shifting of the

127
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,559
attention and the shifting of the object

128
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
itself

129
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,120
e

130
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,120
e

131
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,039
e

132
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,039
e

133
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,039
e

134
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,960
e e

135
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:39,559
welcome back and welcome to those of you just arriving again my name is May May

136
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:46,639
Elliot and I'd like to start with a brief story I spent about eight years living

137
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:52,480
at Zen monasteries and temples which were all in the lineage of Suzuki roshi

138
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:58,200
and once a long time ago uh Suzuki roshi was giving a lecture

139
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:03,679
uh and afterwards in the Q&A uh one of the Zen students asked a question he

140
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:11,919
said something like Suzuki roshi I've been listening to your lectures for years but I just don't

141
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:16,360
understand could you please just put it in a

142
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,120
nutshell uh could you reduce Buddhism to one

143
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:29,399
phrase so of course everyone laughed Suzuki roshi laughed and then he

144
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:33,159
SL everything

145
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:42,440
changes so this is our one constant Everything Changes this is what uh this is Suzuki

146
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:49,559
Roshi's Buddhism in a nutshell everything changes so today we'll be discuss

147
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:56,919
discussing anicha translated as impermanence or inconstancy and this is the first of the

148
00:32:56,919 --> 00:33:03,440
three characteristics that I'll be discussing over the next couple days and as I shared

149
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,679
yesterday uh when we're not when we're not lost in the blizzard of our thoughts

150
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:13,799
uh when the blizzard settles we're able to see more clearly and what we're able

151
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:21,720
to see clearly are the three characteristics impermanence suffering and not self in other words uh we're

152
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:29,240
able to see the changing nature of things we're able to see that clinging leads to suffering and we're able to see

153
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:35,279
that there's no fixed uh Center fixed core no fixed abiding

154
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:43,559
self to this being that we refer to as uh me myself

155
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:51,120
mine so as we enter into this territory um I really want to be clear that these

156
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:58,919
three characteristics uh they're not things that you need to believe uh they're not views you need to hold about

157
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:06,120
reality um yeah I'm not I'm not here to convince you that the three characteristics are true um you know as

158
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:13,118
a belief system or view but rather to support you in seeing them for yourselves that's what becomes

159
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:18,599
transformational um so not beliefs you need to hold but insights that are

160
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:24,679
revealed so uh let's focus in on ana um

161
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:31,079
impermanence so um many of us here about impermanence in relationship to the Dharma this is you know a common

162
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:36,358
teaching so I'd like to discuss what it is and why it's significant um so

163
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:42,520
insight into impermanence is often considered the core most important

164
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:48,079
Insight of the Buddha and it creates the groundwork for the two other insights

165
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:56,679
insight into suffering and not self the poly word MAA n i CCA means

166
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:02,240
constant anicha means inconstant so this is you know one of the reasons we can

167
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:09,279
translate anicha as inconstancy we're having insight into

168
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:15,000
inconstancy but when we live in the thinking mind the mind that's dominated

169
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,800
by Concepts our reality can seem pretty fixed and unchanging so for example we

170
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:28,359
can live in fixed Concepts like um my parents are unsupportive

171
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:34,440
or my spouse is unreliable or I hate my job you know and

172
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:41,640
there can be this sense that you know this is how my job is and it's always going to be this way it's a fixed idea

173
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:47,000
but really um there's what's happening and then the story that we tell

174
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,319
ourselves about what's happening so you know two things that are happening at any given time what's actually happening

175
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:57,680
and in the story we tell tell about it um and what's actually happening is

176
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:03,720
always changing but our stories tend to calcify our experience the stories we

177
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:08,839
tell ourselves about what's happening often hold a fixed view so we end up

178
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:14,920
creating a story that ultimately we feel trapped by and this is how uh as some

179
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:21,000
say uh we can build ourselves a prison in Paradise know our stories they're

180
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:28,640
like uh conceptual overlays made up of of thoughts of ideas of belief Bel and

181
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:35,599
we can feel imprisoned by them at times so when we're not living in our

182
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:42,240
thought World um when we're not lost in our thought world uh we can begin to get in contact with what's actually

183
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:49,720
happening what's actually happening um beneath the tick or tape of our narrative beneath the ticker tape of our

184
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:55,920
storyline and when the thinking might has settled and the mind is clear what we see is that phenomena is arising and

185
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,760
passing over and over and over and this can facilitate a lot of

186
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:07,280
freedom so there are there are two primary ways impermanence is discussed

187
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:14,440
in the sutas first there's the repeated arising and passing away of experience um uh

188
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:20,680
what I think is easiest to refer to as inconstancy and then secondly uh is the

189
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:27,640
way that things change over time and this latter point the way things change over time is what most people typically

190
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:33,480
associate with impermanence and what um what most people can very easily

191
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:39,200
perceive you know it's seeing on a more gross level that things change for good

192
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,280
you know our body looks and feels different when we're 70 than it did when

193
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:51,680
we were 17 and we're not going to get that 17year old body back um or you when

194
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:58,119
a loved one dies they're not returning to us uh when we break a teacup we see

195
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:05,560
its transitory nature so this is all demonstrating this more gross level of

196
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:11,800
impermanence so some people think an Nicha only refers to the way things pass

197
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:17,920
away for good you know either dying or ending but the core Insight of the

198
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:23,400
Buddha uh has a little bit more to do with the inconstancy of things which is

199
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:29,119
that first type of impermanence that I mentioned so for example

200
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:35,640
uh if you feel the sensation in your hand and you might notice uh tingling

201
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:45,200
pressure fluctuation um like a a a kaleidoscope of changing

202
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:51,319
Sensations so there's change happening there right there's um

203
00:38:51,319 --> 00:38:58,240
flexing a rising and passing of sensation or say we have a difficult

204
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:03,880
mood maybe we wake up feeling uh sad or depressed and at first glance that

205
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:09,000
sadness or depression it can seem like a constant everpresent

206
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,599
state um but often when we look more closely we can see um that there's some

207
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:22,720
fluxing from moment to moment that the mood might be very strong say when the moment we wake up and then uh we have a

208
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:30,960
sip of coffee and the attention goes from the mood to the coffee and there's a glimmer of pleasure in the mind and

209
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:38,599
then the attention goes back to the Moon which might be a little lighter now and then maybe um the sound of rain

210
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:44,720
falling off on the rooftop starts coming in uh so the attention notic is that uh

211
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:50,079
and then it goes back to the mood again so um this is just like a a tiny little

212
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:57,640
snapshot of showing the way um uh there can be both a change in the object um um

213
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:04,160
you know uh and the CH a change in um what we're perceiving so a shift in

214
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:12,720
where we're paying attention so the um you know the attention goes from the mood to the coffee back to the mood to

215
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:19,359
the sound of the rain back to the mood and so there's um there's inconstancy in

216
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:24,760
the object of attention where the attention is going and then in each of those objects you the sound of the rain

217
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:32,359
is flexing the flavor of the coffee is flexing so um so this is that um um pointing

218
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:39,400
just to the way that uh there's so much inconstancy in any given M moment the mood itself is changing and the objects

219
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:44,960
of attention are changing so uh rather than a mood being a monolith it's a

220
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:51,839
little bit more like swiss cheese like moment after moment there are holes being poked in our fixed P perception of

221
00:40:51,839 --> 00:41:00,599
what's happening so our sadness is punctuated by other experience experiences it's it's arising and

222
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:08,520
passing so anytime uh we think something is fixed um we're typically not seeing

223
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:13,720
all the change that's present and on a really subtle level our

224
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:20,599
experience of the world is in constant you know seeing hearing smelling touching tasting always arising and

225
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:25,680
passing every moment of hearing there's change emotions and thoughts always

226
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:34,119
arising and passing so even things that we might initially uh perceive as stable or as fixed

227
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:39,160
something like pain in the body when we investigate it more closely we often

228
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:45,800
find that even pain itself is a fluxing kaleidoscope of changing

229
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:53,640
Sensations so uh why is this important who cares if things are impermanent you

230
00:41:53,640 --> 00:42:01,560
know what's the big deal um well uh when we know on a really deep level that

231
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:09,800
everything changes uh that everything passes away um we're much less likely to Crave and

232
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:17,440
claim so if we know that everything will be pulled through our grip we're not going to hold on so tightly and this is

233
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:24,160
really important know remember the four noble truths first Noble Truth there is

234
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:32,839
suffering second Noble Truth no sour of suffering is craving third Noble Truth there's an end

235
00:42:32,839 --> 00:42:38,839
up to suffering the release of craving and the fourth the path to the

236
00:42:38,839 --> 00:42:46,040
end of suffering um so I'd like to just zoom in on that second and third Noble Truth the

237
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:51,359
source of suffering is craving uh craving and clinging so to let go of

238
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:56,440
craving and clinging is to let go of suffering so this you know this um

239
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:04,079
inextricable link between craving and suffering so um how does this relate to

240
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:09,680
impermanence um over time we see when we see closely you know impermanence pulls

241
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:15,200
everything through our fingertips um we see that if we hold reality really

242
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:21,720
tightly if we cling we suffer uh when we hold a rope really tightly if it's

243
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:27,280
pulled through our grip we get rope burn the same thing happens with

244
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:32,640
anything we cling to with our heart and mind but if we grasp anything really

245
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:39,559
tightly when it's pulled through our grip because of impermanence we're going to suffer and the heart's going to get

246
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:46,079
rope burnt and ultimately insight into impermanence it

247
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:51,640
supports a deep Letting Go it teaches us to let go in other words it conditions

248
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:57,800
non- clinging so when the mind is steady

249
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:03,920
and we see change over and over and over the Mind learns on a really deep level

250
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:10,520
that there's no use holding on when it sees this it learns to let go um and it

251
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:17,480
also learns not to cling to begin with because it knows better right it knows that clinging doesn't work it knows that

252
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:22,800
clinging hurts so the Mind heart uh knows this as

253
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:28,280
deeply and as intuitively as we know not to put our hand into a pot of boiling

254
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:34,640
water it's like clinging ouch that hurts right so so when we see inconstancy over

255
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:40,720
and over we learn to let go we learn not to Crave and claim and this wisdom that

256
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:46,599
develops is liberative now with all this said I want

257
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:52,920
to acknowledge that seeing impermanence um it doesn't always feel good um it can

258
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:59,559
even be destabilizing to see the inconstancy of things because when we see this really clearly

259
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:07,319
over and over we see there's nothing lasting that we can hold on to there's nothing uh reliable in the way that we

260
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:12,760
thought it was um and while this can be challenging if we've sufficiently

261
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:18,079
cultivated stability and well-being somebody and contentment uh we're not

262
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:25,319
going to be as unored by it we're not going to be as UNM mored by seeing the inconstancy of things and of course the

263
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:31,559
gift of impermanence uh is that our suffering can change too um so our

264
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:37,599
Neurosis compulsion uh our depression and anxiety also

265
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:45,520
impermanent you know these aren't immate as rir Maria RKA says um uh let

266
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:52,520
everything happen to you beauty and Terror just keep going no feeling is

267
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,520
final

268
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:04,160
because things change UNH wholesome qualities of mind can diminish and

269
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:09,319
wholesome qualities can grow we all have the capacity for

270
00:46:09,319 --> 00:46:15,720
Change and as we see the changing nature of things over time our impulse to Crave

271
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:21,319
the next object or experience uh begins to fall away because we've seen for

272
00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:27,200
ourselves how transient they are and through this process our

273
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:32,040
suffering our Dua can come to an

274
00:46:32,359 --> 00:46:37,920
end so uh today may you be aware of the changing

275
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:44,800
nature of things and may it condition a mind that is free from suffering so

276
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:52,359
thank you all for joining me today and I look forward to seeing you tomorrow take care
