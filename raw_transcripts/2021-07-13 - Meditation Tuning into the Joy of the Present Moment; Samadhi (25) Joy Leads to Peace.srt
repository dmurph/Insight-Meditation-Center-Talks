of calming settling collecting the mind also known as

5
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:38,239
samadhi so for the theme of today's practice

6
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:45,840
i'd like to offer a quote by arjun sachito as inspiration

7
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:54,480
he says i think of enjoyment as receiving joy and samadhi

8
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:02,079
as the art of refined enjoyment i love that the art of refined

9
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:09,520
enjoyment it is the careful collecting of oneself

10
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:17,439
to the joy of the present moment joyfulness means there is no fear

11
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:24,840
no tension no ought to there isn't anything we have to do about

12
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:32,240
it so there is stillness it's just this

13
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:41,280
so the careful collecting of oneself to the joy of the present

14
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:49,360
moment so with that let's just begin

15
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,640
and i will share guidance as needed to invite us

16
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:03,040
to turn towards joy so settling arriving

17
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:09,840
in our bodies

18
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:23,840
in this moment just as it is

19
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:37,840
turning our minds turning our hearts

20
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:54,640
to the stability to the quiet inside as if underneath

21
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,800
all the waves of thought

22
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:05,840
[Music] plans

23
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,920
all the preoccupations

24
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:19,040
ah there is stillness there is quiet

25
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:27,040
there is peace and ease trusting even if we can't find it in this moment

26
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:40,000
trusting and as if we were to turn to tune

27
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,840
to tune our radio the radio of our hearts and minds

28
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:57,040
to this channel of peace which we know exists and at first it might sound crackly

29
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,640
but we tune we tune to it

30
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,519
and for tuning to this channel

31
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:16,799
we settle with the breath with the body to tune to this channel of peace

32
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,720
turning our attention our awareness

33
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:43,680
our gaze inward to the body

34
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,000
inviting the body to soften

35
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:57,840
to relax to let go of any holding a tightness

36
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:10,479
the shoulders the neck

37
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:19,440
in our face forehead jaw

38
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,840
the back of the eyes

39
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,840
to soften

40
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:06,479
inviting our chest

41
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,919
oh dear chest

42
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:21,840
the home of the heart and the heart center

43
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,280
the proverbial housing of emotions to relax

44
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:49,759
it's okay whatever is here is okay

45
00:06:49,759 --> 00:07:03,840
to invite our abdomen our lower abdomen

46
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:15,198
to drop inward ah giving

47
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:23,280
away its weight the weight it's been holding to the sit bones

48
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,520
and for the sit bones to relax

49
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:45,840
and let go of their tightness and tension to the earth

50
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:10,080
inviting the feet to rest on the earth

51
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:16,960
feeling the contact points of the feet or the lower legs if you're

52
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:26,000

54
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:41,839
offering their weight to gravity to the earth

55
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:19,680
receiving the breath receiving the breath however it is

56
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:37,839
whether the breath is short or long receiving the breath just as it is

57
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,240
allowing the breath

58
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:55,360
to fill the body

59
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:05,839

63
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:43,839
to tune to the breath the rhythm the flow of the breath

64
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,880
as if the breath is the dial

65
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,600
that helps us tune

66
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:03,040

so as we continue to explore

118
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:32,480
this week different supportive aspect to establish samadhi

119
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:39,600
settling calming the mind

120
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:47,519
yesterday the invitation was to put down what's not needed to put

121
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:54,080
down windrack to put down to put down now today this is the other side of the

122
00:32:54,080 --> 00:33:00,399
coin the other side of the coin one side is to put down and the other

123
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:08,240
side is to notice that actually it's lovely it's wonderful it's delightful it's

124
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:16,240
delicious the simplicity of this moment and wrapping ourselves in the simplicity of

125
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,640
this moment so

126
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:30,480
we often only do the putting down the thoughts arise we put them down

127
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:38,240
we put them down distractions arise we put them down and actually sometimes we

128
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:44,000
throw them down it's not so it's like the stick method stop stop being

129
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:52,000
distracted stop bad meditator bad meditator and instead so putting them

130
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,480
putting things down is is wise but with gentleness bowing to them thank you not now not

131
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:06,799
needed not wholesome not for my benefit and now the other side which is

132
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:12,398
the the carrot method oh wow it's actually lovely the

133
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:17,520
simplicity of this moment is delicious is

134
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:24,720
is yummy then the mind doesn't want to go away doesn't want to wander off

135
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:31,158
in fact that the putting down or this the seclusion the

136
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:37,520
relinquishment becomes not so much needed because the mind is so still

137
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:44,079
is so in love is enjoying is delighting in what is here

138
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:51,200
have you noticed when you do something that you love um a hobby whatever it might be

139
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:58,400
you don't want to stop come have a meal no let me finish this i want to finish this

140
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:05,440
puzzle gardening knitting whatever it might be this game um because there's so much joy

141
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:13,359
so much delight so tuning into that delight into that joy into that simplicity and

142
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:19,680
we often don't see it because we're so focused on okay put it down put it down come back put it down and it

143
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,880
becomes so much it conflictual relationship somewhat

144
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:31,460
with practice whereas if we tune into oh this is actually quite lovely and it might be subtle

145
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:37,760
[Music] and also to say a lot of times we wait we wait for that

146
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:44,400
delight that deliciousness that stillness to arise and then we tune into it after

147
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:51,520
we've done this pudding down a lot and then we realized oh wow yeah it's

148
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:57,599
pretty calm it's delicious it's lovely so the invitation is to try to tune into it

149
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:02,720
earlier to tune into it with the breath with the body

150
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:10,480
trusting that underneath the waves there is this deliciousness this

151
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:16,880
safety this calm this this piece and trusting as if you're

152
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:22,560
tuning a radio yes it's it's crackly but something is coming through there's a memory of

153
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:27,839
you know it's there it's been there you trust it's there even if you haven't experienced it yet

154
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:33,839
you've heard you've read that it's there so trusting that you're not different from

155
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:41,838
the other seven billion people it's it's there for you also trusting trusting

156
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:49,920
and coming back to to this joy i shared a

157
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:57,200
a quote at the beginning by arjun tsuchita i like to read it

158
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:04,000
again in case you some of you might have missed it earlier

159
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:12,720
and he says arjun suchito is is a a senior monk in the

160
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:20,560
arjun cha's forest tradition and he says i think of enjoyment as

161
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:26,400
receiving joy and samadhi as the art of refined

162
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:33,839
enjoyment it is the careful collecting of oneself to the joy of the

163
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:38,880
present moment i love this

164
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:44,480
samadhi as the art of refined enjoyment it doesn't say the art of okay

165
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:50,079
concentrate bring your mind to it hard work oh it's the

166
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:56,240
art of refined enjoyment it's the careful collecting of oneself

167
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:03,200
to the joy of the present moment and there is a lot of joy in the present

168
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:10,000
moment it's just that our minds are so used

169
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:17,040
to the cacophony the the busyness the the the diet of

170
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:24,400
constant stimulation constant uh sound noise

171
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:31,359
news facebook conversation this that so so if the mind

172
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:36,400
becomes tuned only sees that delight the enjoyment in thinking

173
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:44,800
or in reading or in interacting and doing and the same way that um

174
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:50,400
say a subtle subtle flavor could be lost on someone who's

175
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:56,079
tuned to just uh really complex with i'll share this with you when i was

176
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:01,520
when i was very young i only liked say rocky road

177
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:06,640
and chocolate flavored ice cream things that had a lot of flavor in them

178
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:13,760
i couldn't understand why would people ever eat or enjoy vanilla

179
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:19,680
my taste buds couldn't quite tune into the subtleness and only when i became older i realized

180
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:27,680

181
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:35,599
