1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:10,920
The Poetry of practice so I've been these days taking

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:18,720
poems that have uh been written perhaps for a general audience and then kind of like pulling out some Dharma teachings

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:26,359
from them maybe that was the intention of the poet maybe it wasn't but uh there's I kind of like

4
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:33,040
this idea that we can find teachings we can find support for our practice ice everywhere right whatever you know life

5
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,360
is offering us uh and I'm choosing specific poems to

6
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:45,840
support that but today I'd like to do something a little bit different as we end our time together on the Poetry of

7
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,280
practice and I would like to share a poem that is by somebody who is a

8
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,399
Buddhist practitioner who is practices in our tradition here and is using

9
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:04,680
poetry to express her practice who is like explicitly she's

10
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:11,520
not a poet right she's a practitioner and a way to like that's a

11
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:18,000
straightforward you know using you know clear language um

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,280
to express practice and what I think is a beautiful and inspiring

13
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:30,320
way it's um one thing to like take the dorm out of the Poetry but maybe for

14
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,840
this last day were putting the Poetry in the Dharma you know pretending like they're

15
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,079
different poetry in Dharma but maybe there's some way what you right you know of course there that uh distinction is a

16
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,479
little bit too artificial or heavy-handed but there have been times

17
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:55,360
when I've I've been on some long Retreats I've jotted down short little poems just as a way to I don't know like

18
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:03,719
I felt like that could express something that uh was being experienced or known or I don't know

19
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:10,599
what it was exactly just these short little poems and it's not uncommon right there are a number of uh practitioners

20
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:17,080
who put together poems and uh publish little books of them I know some people

21
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:23,680
have uh sent me a number of people have sent me Po books of their own poems that

22
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,160
they've that are associated with their practice so today as I've done in the

23
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,000
preceding days during the guided meditation I'll drop in a poem and then

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,560
um talk about a little bit in the D afterwards and again you don't have to

25
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:48,560
like these poems you don't have to agree with them you don't have to understand them you don't have to do

26
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:55,360
anything you we just allow them to be heard and it's that simple it's that

27
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:03,959
simple and of course that's what practice is right it's just meeting what each moment brings as best we can and we

28
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:12,840
can do that with these poems as well so just

29
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,400
um taking a meditation

30
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:24,000
posture that expresses Our

31
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,920
intention to meditate and to

32
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,920
be present for whatever each moment

33
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:55,360
brings tuning into just the experience of the body as

34
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,799
a whole like inhabiting the body

35
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:06,159
bringing a sense of aliveness sense of presence to the bodily

36
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,360
experience in general

37
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:47,520
nothing in particular needs to be happening or just

38
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:55,120
allowing the mind and the body to get on the same page so to speak

39
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:26,160
as I've done the earlier days feeling the body resting on its

40
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,720
sitting surface

41
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,120
feeling the

42
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:44,720
contact there's a way in which the Mind might have a feeling of flying

43
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:52,879
around and a Dreamscape and the body is here

44
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,639
here e

45
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:40,639
noticing if there are any areas of tightness or

46
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:50,160
tension and then just gently resting our attention

47
00:06:52,160 --> 00:07:00,039
there maybe in the same way that we put our hand on the back of

48
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:06,440
just slightly touching someone's back as a way of support

49
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,440
or

50
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:15,479
consolation care

51
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:03,520
notice if there are any any feelings

52
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:12,319
sensations of well-being maybe a certain amount of

53
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,720
okayness this might be a small part of your

54
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,159
experience it might be your dominant

55
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:30,080
experience whichever it is can you rest attention there

56
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:45,279
is there a location in the body is a feeling of

57
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:54,399
okayness well-being dare I say contentment

58
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:26,480
and we let that experience get as big as it would

59
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:34,120
like this is an allowing this is not a doing

60
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:27,160
and can we abide in this with this as

61
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,319
this sense of well-being

62
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:39,240
okayness even if it's just a small part of your experience

63
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,600
staying here in this

64
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,279
moment e

65
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,959
you find the Mind wandering just very simply

66
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:25,000
gently begin again either with a feeling of okayness

67
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,160
well-being or with the sensations of breathing

68
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,120
e e

69
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:23,560
tuning into the bodily experience feeling

70
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:31,040
embodied and is there a way you can just abide

71
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:37,839
in the body in this

72
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
moment

73
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959

[Music]

113
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:11,360
thank you thank you for practicing

114
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:20,679
together so as I said at the beginning of the guided meditation that rather

115
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:28,679
than I'm taking the like the Dharma in a poem uh today we're looking uh the

116
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:34,000
Dharma being expressed as a poem Dharma practitioner somebody describing her

117
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,799
practice uh with this in poetry which you know sometimes it's like we can't

118
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:46,519
find the words maybe it's not so clear I know I've been in I've um offered

119
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:53,080
practice discussions and I've um been a student in practice discussions where the practitioner is like can't quite

120
00:29:53,080 --> 00:30:00,000
find the words exactly how to express what's uh happening and so maybe like

121
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,360
poetry is a way in which we can you know it's a different way to

122
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:11,480
express we can use it you know some to recognize the to point indirectly

123
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:16,880
to what's being known or what's being

124
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:22,039
experienced so this uh poem is called My

125
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:28,080
Religion a maid and d and maybe I'll before I read the poem

126
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:39,120
say a little bit um about the the person who wrote it so she uh this person was born in

127
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:44,360
Canada um maybe I'll say a little bit about her name so her ordination name so she's a

128
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:52,000
Canadian um Mid Andi is her ordination name a means sister so this is something

129
00:30:52,000 --> 00:31:00,639
that's um given to uh nuns in our tradition the um instead of like biku um

130
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:07,080
she would is a here and midan Andi her name means we could say it's like maida

131
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:13,039
is wise and anandi is a joy wise Joy or

132
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:19,039
the way that poly works it could also be the joy of wise fullness or uh the joy

133
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:25,120
of wisdom wise fullness I made it up a new word there but um I don't know I love

134
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:32,679
the these two qualities wisdom uh sometimes it can be translated as intelligence but I like wisdom and joy

135
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:41,320
so the happiness of wisdom or I don't know this a beautiful name a beautiful name so she ordained as a 10 precept nun

136
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:47,720
in 1988 this is quite some time ago with under SAA

137
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:55,200
upand and then when Burma closed their borders uh she left

138
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:03,039
and went to uh England and practiced there in aan charage at amaravati some

139
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:11,120
of you might know amarati this arano Aran Amar over there and then um it wasn't until 2007

140
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:19,120
maybe almost 20 years later that um she received full ordination and that was in Taiwan and

141
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:25,679
then in 2008 she returned to Canada so there a inspiring woman I would say who

142
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:33,960
had this dedication to practice that ordained even before full ordination was available for women and now she's the

143
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:40,600
founder of Sati sarinia this is a Hermitage a monastery

144
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:47,480
for women in Canada in Eastern Ontario so here's somebody who's

145
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:54,200
dedicated her life to practice and I'll just say Sati Saria we could translate

146
00:32:54,200 --> 00:33:00,320
that as maybe these are two words like sey mindful Seria we could say is a

147
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:06,559
friendliness friendly mindfulness being mindful of friendliness or I don't know

148
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:14,639
there different ways we could uh translate that so here's somebody who as I said

149
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:19,679
has dedicated her life to practice and something that I appreciate so much in

150
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:26,000
the sutas we see that the Buddha he was taking the words of the dominant

151
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,360
religion of his time it's would have been brahmanism kind of like a Proto

152
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:38,039
Hinduism and he used words of that dominant religion and then redefined

153
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:46,320
them uh for what he was teaching so he was using words that people would have been familiar with but redefining them

154
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:52,919
we find this all throughout the sutas and here I am is doing the same thing so

155
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:58,360
this is a subtle thing that maybe if you didn't know about the sutas it wouldn't appreciate as much

156
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:04,760
but when I read this I just loved how she's conflict um I'd be finding a way

157
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:10,280
to bridge between the dominant religion which I would say is judeo-christian in

158
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:19,240
Canada and the United States and uh her practice so here's this poem called My

159
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:28,079
Religion by I am Andi to live and die without regret

160
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:37,638
that is my religion to taste the cup of the sacrament of this moment now my only

161
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:43,320
moment how otherwise to spend it for tonight I may

162
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:50,720
die to abide in the fragrance of goodness in this world enduring

163
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:59,440
awake to bring no harm to myself or anyone to be a cause for kindness and

164
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:06,720
compassion a joy that defeats despair to smile with courage through

165
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:13,079
life's storms and trials trusting the inherent principle of

166
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:18,960
love to pray to live and die a simple

167
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:25,000
way I don't know I feel really touched by this you know there's the real

168
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,560
Simplicity of the words that she's using kind of like supports this Simplicity of

169
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,880
she wants to have her life to be and I like how it's kind of like a list of

170
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:43,400
things to do this to do this to do this so she has this uh Clarity and this uh

171
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:50,160
simplicity so maybe I might say we could summarize this as

172
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:57,800
purpose maybe I could say presence maybe presence Integrity compassion

173
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:04,160
presence Integrity compassion for this to be one's religion

174
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:12,599
what a beautiful thing what a beautiful thing to move through the world this way so I love this uh this opening

175
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:19,960
stanza is to taste the cup of the sacrament of this moment now my only

176
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:26,280
moment taste the cup of the sacrament of this moment this way of bringing

177
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:33,599
something uh maybe Divine or something uh bigger than

178
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:39,319
oneself or to uh maybe um something that

179
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:45,400
is feels holy to this moment to taste the cup of

180
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:51,319
the sacrament of this moment I know I feel touched by this just recognizing

181
00:36:51,319 --> 00:36:57,079
the preciousness maybe of each moment because later right she says um for

182
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:04,079
tonight I may die just recognizing that you know why put it off like why think

183
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:11,000
that you're going to be mindful later why are you going to be present later you might not have a later we're not

184
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,720
promised anything so why not test the Divine the

185
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:23,560
holy I'd say maybe the beauty the grace of this moment and to drink the cup or

186
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:28,960
to taste the cup of you know to taste so it's not that we're thinking about it

187
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:38,000
it's more that we're experiencing it so presence and then Integrity to

188
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,319
bring no harm to myself or

189
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:52,359
anyone I would say can you imagine what a world it would be if all of us decided even to do one

190
00:37:52,359 --> 00:37:57,960
of these no harm to myself or no harm to others

191
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:03,560
like to have this commitment to do either of those how the world would be

192
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:11,400
different how the world would be so different because there's a way if we have this commitment to not harm others

193
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:18,680
means that we also can't harm ourselves or to not harm ourselves or not harming others also right there's a this as our

194
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:27,520
practice deepens we start to see how you can't separate harm from oneself or others there's a way in which we can um

195
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:33,200
think that we're not going to harm others and then we end up harming ourselves because we're bending over

196
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:38,520
backwards and allowing boundary boundaries to be crossed or something like this when we're trying to not harm

197
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:44,640
others but if we like really have this as a guiding principle of one's

198
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:51,240
life then we start to see how it's just this non-harming in general and we can't

199
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:57,720
make a distinction between ourselves and others in the beginning there is there definitely is but as we go deep deeper

200
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:04,319
and deeper and more and more um flavors and colors our life we start to see oh

201
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:10,680
yeah this commitment to not harm impacts

202
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:17,880
everybody and instead this idea of to abide in the fragrance of goodness in

203
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:23,599
this world fragrance of goodness the sense of

204
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:29,240
that goodness is maybe something um like not so tangible you

205
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:35,079
know sometimes maybe you uh walk into a home and somebody is uh finished baking

206
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:42,960
cookies or in a bakery and it smells like fresh baked bread there's just the scent of even if you can't quite

207
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,440
precisely put your finger on what it is this fragrance of

208
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:55,200
goodness this way in which maybe you have a conversation with somebody and you feel maybe

209
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:01,119
um it doesn't have to be big up brightness but it's not this like oh oh

210
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:06,560
uh and you felt like you had to protect yourself and maybe in a subtle way or you had to make them feel better or

211
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:14,560
there was a lot of work in the conversation or something like this this way that sometimes we um when

212
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:22,200
we meet a moment there is this subtle feeling of this this is there uh

213
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:27,440
allowing this more openness this more ease

214
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:34,119
more spaciousness is more freedom or is there not and I would say the goodness is this

215
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:40,040
uh what allows the most openness the most freedom to abide in the fragrance

216
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:46,440
of goodness in this world there is goodness the media wants to tell us

217
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:52,240
otherwise other people want to tell us otherwise but there is goodness I'm not

218
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:58,960
denying that there's Badness I'm not denying that but I feel like I want to overcome

219
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,480
this negativity bias that so many of us have and also point out that there's

220
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:10,760
goodness and then this this uh presence integrity and

221
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:16,119
compassion she uses this word compassion explicitly to be a cause for kindness

222
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:22,960
and compassion a joy that defeats despair recognizing there is

223
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:28,720
despair but to act in a way that with kindness and compassion and to create

224
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:36,040
the conditions in which others can have kindness and compassion this brings a joy that defeats

225
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:41,720
despair can we treat ourselves with kindness and compassion and treat others

226
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:50,160
with kindness and compassion so a an mid

227
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:58,560
and her religion presence Integrity compassion

228
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:04,680
I feel inspired by this may you feel inspired by

229
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:09,800
this maybe there's a way in which there's a if not

230
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:19,800
a actual poem maybe there's a way in which there can be um maybe some unspoken uh just a

231
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:25,640
sense of possibility and some actual experience

232
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:31,160
of presence in integrity and [Music]

233
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:39,160
Compassion maybe with some Simplicity simple uh in there sprinkled in there as well right so here's this poem

234
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:44,599

235
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:52,640
madeand to live and die without regret that is my religion to taste the

despair to smile with courage through life's storms and trials trusting the
