1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,759
so good morning good day good evening hello everyone

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:14,920
and here we are to do this morning meditation or

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:24,720
together and a little bit the topic of

4
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,000
theme of this session of mindfulness meditation

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,360
is what's called investigation or exploration a process of discovery

6
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,960
and as one of the seven factors of awakening it's sometimes said to be the most

7
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,000
important one for the purpose of awakening

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,600
for the purpose of freedom and there's something about

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,320
choosing to explore to discover

10
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,799
to investigate what our experience is which is

11
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:17,520
an expression or a manifestation of freedom

12
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:25,360
no matter how difficult something might be to choose to take

13
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,840
take another look at this to step in a sense step towards it to

14
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,280
see it better or sometimes we step away from it

15
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:45,200
to get a better view of it it's always to discover to see to investigate

16
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:51,040
and when we do that we're not a victim of experience

17
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,799
when we do that we're not under the control of experiences around us within

18
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:03,438
us when we do that we are

19
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,800
our attention is not being hijacked by our hindrances or

20
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,959
our neurosis or our fears whatever it might be

21
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,200
and so this ability to decide okay what what is this what is this

22
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:30,959
experience i'm having and not to answer that question with words

23
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:38,400
not to answer that question with an explanation but to answer the answer it with

24
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,439
um with

25
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:55,280
a clear seeing to answer it with a clear

26
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:05,040
perception feeling for what's happening

27
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,519
so taking a meditation posture

28
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:22,000
and in some sense this expression of freedom which is to take a

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,159
good look begins with caring for your posture

30
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:34,959
choosing to use this wonderful resource of attention

31
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,879
to scan through your posture

32
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,640
and to

33
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,080
make small adjustments

34
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,120
that not only help you be more settled and more relaxed

35
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:06,239
but also a little bit more alert physically alert

36
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:15,840
ready to discover ready to see what's here

37
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:29,759
and then to take a few moments to discover your own breathing

38
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:36,240
without doing any different breathing just notice how it is for you to be breathing

39
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,880
to explore it to feel it and as you do

40
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:52,000
so maybe you can notice a difference between being entangled with your breathing and

41
00:04:53,120 --> 00:05:03,360
wanting to be different or concerned about it or and simply discovering it

42
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:11,840
simply becoming familiar oh this is how it is now

43
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:24,160
without being for or against

44
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,960
without being analytical and

45
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:39,840
preferences just discover it in its own way how the breathing is

46
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:53,840
and then having done so now to take a few long slow deep breaths

47
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,080
as a way of establishing yourself in this body

48
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,160
here and now

49
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:17,520
and then as you exhale long exhale

50
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:25,199
relaxing settling in releasing yourself

51
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,280
the tensions of the body

52
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,159
and then to

53
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:46,880
let your breathing return to normal a little bit more it's useful to release

54
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,319
and relax the holdings of the body as you exhale

55
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,759
and often enough the tensions and holdings of our body

56
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:07,039
give pressure or give yeah maybe a kind of pressure to the

57
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:14,840
mind to keep thinking about things being preoccupied and as we relax the

58
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,240
body there is less of that pressure to think

59
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,840
softening the face around the eyes

60
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,080
softening around the shoulders

61
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:51,199
releasing the shoulders maybe adjusting your hands a little elbows so the whole arm is a little bit

62
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:59,840
more at ease

63
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:27,840
and perhaps softening the belly

64
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:41,120
and then settling into your body breathing in whatever way breathing is most

65
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:48,959
compelling or easiest most pleasant for you to attend to

66
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,880
in the belly in the chest and the nostrils

67
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,839
wherever it might be

68
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:09,839
and then very simply

69
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,800
choose to be with your breathing

70
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:26,000
to discover how it actually is now distinct from how you want it to be

71
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:36,800
in a sense to explore it to discover it to investigate it

72
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,240
feeling the freedom in that choice

73
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:50,640
that you're exercising your your ability

74
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:59,600
to direct your attention to discover and feel and get to know

75
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,839
better

76
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:16,640
noticing the difference between the bodily experience of inhaling

77
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,839
and exhaling

78
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:41,440
noticing a difference between the experiences of breathing where there's some tightness or

79
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,839
constriction and where there's some looseness and releasing

80
00:10:52,320 --> 00:11:01,600
to investigate it to explore it means to let feel it on its own terms

81
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:09,519
step towards it to just get to know it better without it needing to be different

82
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:29,839
without trying to fix it just know constriction here looseness here

83
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,880
and discovering a little bit what it's like for you to be aware of

84
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,560
your breathing what it's like for you to explore

85
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,560
investigate the experience of breathing

86
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:02,160
not to make anything right or wrong but how is it for you

87
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:08,399
to discover the kind of discovery that

88
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,839
of a naturalist

89
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:20,880
simply discovering something in nature patiently observing it as a natural

90
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:27,440
phenomena noticing how you are in relationship to

91
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,800
mindfulness or breathing as a natural phenomena

92
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:39,440
if there's resistance or reluctance eagerness

93
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:47,200
if they're straining or complacency whatever it might be

94
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:53,839
discover it notice it and let it be that simple

95
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:10,160
the simpler the discovery is the more freedom there is

96
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:17,200
freedom to let things just be as they are freedom from our internal reactions of

97
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:24,399
things just being aware discovering

98
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:41,440
seeing and then returning to the breathing

99
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:49,760
maybe seeing how simple the discovery can be just discovery just seeing

100
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:56,880
not seeing anything special or hidden but just how it appears

101
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:03,839
just how it shows itself to you

102
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:31,519
if you get lost in thought that's just another natural phenomena

103
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:37,680
and you the naturalist that's studying it seeing it

104
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:45,839
this is how it is

105
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,839
and then settling back into your breathing

106
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:24,240
a silent discovery a silent dis investigation of breathing

107
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:31,040
where there's an intimacy or a clarity

108
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:41,839
about the different sensations that come into play as you breathe

109
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,800
and to follow along

110
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:54,560
to observe in the distinct sensations of breathing in and breathing

111
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:00,000
out distinct sensations of

112
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:08,480
the beginning middle and end of the inhale beginning middle and end of the exhale

113
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,320
discovering your breathing

114
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:23,199
and very easily with ease

115
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:30,480
maybe you can feel the freedom the independence that you bring to your

116
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,560
experience by choosing to discover it to see

117
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,680
it more fully

118
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:48,839
more clearly without it needing to be anything

119
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,839
different

120
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:41,600
even when our thinking is pleasant if we get preoccupied and lost in

121
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:47,919
thought there is also a loss of freedom

122
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,720
but to wake up our capacity to discover

123
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,000
what's happening here

124
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:07,840
is to enact our freedom

125
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:23,200
and asking the question what's happening here is not to be answered per se

126
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:30,480
but to encourage taking a gentle clear

127
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:36,240
look what is happening here just seeing and feeling

128
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,399
just what's obvious no need to

129
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:51,279
think or probe just discover

130
00:27:51,360 --> 00:28:03,840
what is showing itself to us now

131
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:18,240
to investigate does not need to involve a contraction or a

132
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:24,240
tightening of attention or the mind

133
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:30,399
it's more useful to have it be involved in opening an expansion of attention of awareness

134
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:37,840
of the mind it's open and receptive

135
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:55,440
and you know and it's possible to let this investigation factor

136
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:06,559
come to its fullness in simply being mindful of the breathing

137
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,799
breathing with greater intimacy and

138
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,960
clarity discovering

139
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:27,279
the obvious experiences of breathing in and breathing out

140
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:32,720
with clarity and

141
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,600
distinctions

142
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:46,399
with a quiet mind a mind that gets quieter

143
00:31:46,399 --> 00:32:01,840
the more we discover

144
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:06,480
so to bring this sitting to an end

145
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:16,000
to use your freedom and investigation

146
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,280
your ability to discover be open be available

147
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:27,599
to you see if you can use it to have that freedom of openness of

148
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:34,480
discovery for others to allow them to be

149
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:51,839
as they are because you are free

150
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:04,560
so and i see that you could hear my phone

151
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:12,079
calls with my wife so perhaps you can hold all this in investigation and freedom

152
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:19,839
and simple discovery how it is and in so in doing so

153
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:28,000
may all beings be free may all beings

154
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:39,680
be peaceful may all beings be safe and may all beings everywhere

155
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,839
be happy

156
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,640
you
