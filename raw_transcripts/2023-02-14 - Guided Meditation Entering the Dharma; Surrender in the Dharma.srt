1
00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:06,540
so uh so welcome welcome folks um

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:13,679
yeah nice to see the names over there thank you to whoever said yesterday that uh it appeared that uh we were double

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,880
booked you were correct and um

4
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:26,160
and so this was the uh the arrangement we got since both were publicized in different ways

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:33,719
um so Meg took the the 7 A.M I'm taking the 8 A.M and uh that's how we're uh

6
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:40,500
we're proceeding I know normally we reserve the 8 A.M for unconsciousness seven for

7
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,200
mindfulness eight a.m Consciousness but we're switching it up today and uh

8
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,460
anyway it's sweet to be with you so um

9
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:59,879
yeah I knew something was different yesterday because the the there were some familiar names that I didn't see

10
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:06,060
inside around other stream anyway welcome to you all happy to uh

11
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:12,380
happy to be with you so um

12
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:22,080
yeah that's um that's it that's uh yeah we enter enter enter into

13
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,200
the Dharma enter into the Dharma

14
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,680
in this uh this ritual we we create and in practicing together

15
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:41,060
maybe uh beginning each of our days with a kind of reminder

16
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:48,180
uh and the reminder the reminder of the Dharma

17
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:54,899
becomes very tactile even just to say those words to enter

18
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:02,040
into the Dharma has a kind of its own effect

19
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:11,940
and this very dense web of meanings and connotations of memory of feeling

20
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:19,379
is evoked for me in that phrase for you you find your own

21
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:23,420
to enter into the Dharma

22
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:33,120
and so not to get burdened with the sense of a technique and doing and busyness and

23
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,360
fixing myself and doing a kind of psycho spiritual surgery

24
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:49,040
on my own heart no no no just entering entering into the Dharma

25
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,640
and so finding finding a posture

26
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:11,400
just letting the the nectar settle to the bottom of the glass of juice as uh

27
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,540
technology says

28
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:09,259
we recollect Buddha Tama Sangha

29
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:26,419
the measure this blessing of the lineage

30
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,380
so many ways to suffer

31
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,860
in so few ways to be free

32
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,720
but this is one of them

33
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:43,680
so we wrap ourselves up in that Dharma blanket of sorts

34
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:50,180
sense of sense of coziness

35
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:53,899
being held by something

36
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:42,560
then the breath begins to remind us of the Dharma

37
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:48,720
remind us of devotion

38
00:09:55,260 --> 00:10:01,339
remind us of change and poignancy

39
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,920
the preciousness of having been born

40
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,480
you just let all that suffuse body and mind

41
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:43,920
letting life come to awareness

42
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:53,459
rather than reaching out to hold experience

43
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,579
the heart and a kind of posture of surrender

44
00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:35,899
surrendering to samsara

45
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,540
surrender to imperfection

46
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,819
and trusting that this gesture of surrender

47
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:18,500
strengthens weakens heart

48
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:57,799
in other words we we abide in receptivity

49
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:34,039
uh our minds must always doing double duty trying to

50
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,700
Shore up our lives

51
00:23:41,299 --> 00:23:46,279
incredibly uh when it actually

52
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:52,760
to see the movements and machinations of our mind

53
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:03,960
and testifies to the bigness of the world

54
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,820
and the fragility of our condition

55
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,960
but sometimes

56
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,600
we seek our safety

57
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:47,720
from somewhere else we seek our safety

58
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:53,480
from within the surrender

59
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,779
foreign

60
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:11,840
our heart can be nourished even by imperfection

61
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:33,179
we develop a kind of faith in openness receptivity

62
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,580
foreign

63
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,880
foreign

64
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:10,020
so we are welcome to our

65
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:15,080
um so

66
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:21,260
at the the and towards the end of his life

67
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:26,580
reflecting on his kind of happiness and suffering

68
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:32,159
uh Leonard Cohen was asked by by an interviewer about his kind of his art

69
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:39,779
and um asked if he suffered in the ways that he uh that he used to

70
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:45,539
and he says no and then adds um

71
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:51,120
it's not so much that I got what I was looking for

72
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:56,158
but the search itself dissolved

73
00:31:57,059 --> 00:32:04,860
so yesterday the theme was was a wonder and awe and

74
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:10,380
today it's a surrender surrender

75
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:16,559
and surrender is is not so much a word from our

76
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:24,539
tradition Associated more with mono monotheistic traditions

77
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:32,120
and um it was a couple of beautiful lines from

78
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:37,740
Augustine's um confessions

79
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:45,659
we are but a particle of that creation thou awakest us to Delight in the praise

80
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:51,360
for Thou made us for thyself and our heart is restless until it

81
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:56,760
Repose in the hide not the face from me let me die

82
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:04,440
lest I die only let me see thy face my soul is like a house

83
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:11,340
small for you to enter but I pray you to enlarge it

84
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:19,140
it is in Ruins but I ask you to remake it it contains much that you will not be

85
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:25,380
pleased to see this I know and do not hide

86
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:33,440
but who is to rid it of these things there is no one but you

87
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,779
let's have kind of curious that I find that um so um

88
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:48,059
beautiful given kind of my my own turn away from

89
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:55,019
theistic tradition and yet the the potency of that

90
00:33:55,019 --> 00:34:01,440
seems very clear so what is the role what's the role of

91
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,980
surrender and Buddhist practice on the one hand

92
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:12,240
we are encouraged to be independent to

93
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:17,280
be in the phrase Guild loves independent in the Dharma

94
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:25,260
to verify the teachings for ourselves that famous you know uh

95
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:30,740
language from the Kalama suta when you yourselves know

96
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:38,099
when you your you know for yourself that these these

97
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:45,679
practices these teachings are skillful when you know for yourselves

98
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:52,500
there is a kind of theme of it of um the in the resourcefulness of the

99
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:57,900
individual heart you know in this fathom long body we find

100
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:05,940
suffering and its end and uh and so there is this self-sufficiency

101
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:11,220
something like this uh maybe that's not right self-sufficiency

102
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:18,480
but there is a kind of encouragement certain kind of self-reliance

103
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:24,720
and surrender of course is it's a dangerous thing and word and many of us

104
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,839
at some point have surrendered to to bad ideas or bad

105
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:38,160
people bad habits and so I'm cautious with that word but

106
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:45,660
so much of the the goodness of the path requires

107
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:54,540
surrender our our maybe we say in the Dharma comes

108
00:35:54,540 --> 00:36:00,119
from a kind of surrender and we're not surrendering in this

109
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:06,900
tradition to someone exactly but surrendering

110
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:12,920
to the moment and trusting that it will shape our heart well

111
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:22,440
no Will To Power um the urge to possess or dominate control

112
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:27,540
possess dominate control ourself

113
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:35,280
this can't take us deep into the Dharma it's like all of that willfulness is

114
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,920
such a tangle of so much intense feeling affect

115
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,260
so we practice relaxing it

116
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:54,240
for for me um the the kind of willfulness seems to

117
00:36:54,240 --> 00:37:00,540
draw my own willfulness in practice seems to draw its energy from something

118
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:05,640
like a tangle deep in my own heart

119
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:12,140
it feels almost like this very primitive

120
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:18,720
anger or control and

121
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:25,579
that willfulness kind of masquerades as dhamachanda a longing for the Dharma or

122
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:32,099
masquerades as varia a kind of energetic vigor

123
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:37,140
but um we must all kind of ask like what

124
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:42,180
what does practice look like on the other side

125
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:46,280
of your willfulness

126
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:55,680
the most transformative practice really unfolds

127
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,900
when our ego is all out of moves you know

128
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:07,380
and that that beautiful passage from the confessions is like oh yeah The ego's

129
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:15,480
All Out of moves there and so the path in a sense it begins

130
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:21,480
with surrender to acknowledge at the beginning that um

131
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:29,700
um I don't know exactly how to live I know that this can't work out the way

132
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:35,040
I've been doing it but I don't know exactly how to live let me open

133
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:40,280
to the wisdom of a of a lineage

134
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:48,599
to uh to be present just to be present it is

135
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:54,200
um is really another way of saying we're we're we're

136
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:59,700
ceasing our attempts to govern the future

137
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:06,660
to make this moment about some future moment of security to make this the

138
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:13,200
present a down payment on some future happiness

139
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:19,440
and we have this sense of of always deploying mindfulness to

140
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:26,040
to solve this problem or that problem but mindfulness itself is a kind of

141
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:32,339
surrender and the receptivity

142
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:38,480
an openness to the moment this is a kind of surrender

143
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:48,200
our mind wants to do something to the moment rather than be

144
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:55,920
Changed by it to do something to the breath rather

145
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:01,760
than be changed by it to be suffused by it

146
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:11,880
and so rather than fidgeting with samsara we're opening

147
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:18,960
radically to non-control

148
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,319
and that's that is surrender

149
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,099
in order to to forgive samsara

150
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:38,540
we we have to surrender to it at least in moments

151
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:45,960
just to yeah pause

152
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:51,420
deeply in a sense of like okay I'm not going to be able to

153
00:40:51,420 --> 00:41:00,140
work out the the imperfections in in this realm

154
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:09,960
surrender involved in that and in order to

155
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:17,099
to relinquish uh stories that no longer serve us we have to surrender to not

156
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:22,200
knowing you know like repairing a ship at Sea a

157
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:27,619
little bit um

158
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:34,579
how we don't the nature of insight is is not knowing

159
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:40,400
Insight arises out of the mind that doesn't know

160
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:48,140
we can't know what we'll find it's always insight as always a little surprising

161
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:56,160
sometimes as people deepen in the practice they they describe getting more

162
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:02,180
settled the self getting kind of thinner thinned out

163
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:10,680
and and sometimes they feel like uh the precipice of some some some really deep

164
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:17,040
silence Stillness kind of get jerked back into

165
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:24,540
sometimes into our the worst thought we could have the worst habit we have

166
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:33,119
jerked back into a kind of very congealed sense of self Mara the force of suffering kind of

167
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:38,000
playing his trump card in the moment

168
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:45,119
and so we actually are learning to surrender to groundlessness a trust that

169
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,220
um that Stillness is a refuge even if we

170
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:57,920
lack our ordinary reference points Stillness is a refuge

171
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:09,119
this is how we settle into samadhi to the kind of unification of the Mind

172
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:16,560
there's effort involved but often much less than we imagined or a different kind of effort

173
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:23,460
and at some point in the kind of journey into Stillness effort itself is just

174
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:27,500
another species of agitation

175
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:35,880
and so we settle into silence and Stillness through a kind of falling

176
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:41,280
kind of falling into something and a trusting that the silence won't

177
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:47,359
harm you the groundlessness won't harm you

178
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:58,220
and so we're not so much focusing more closely we're surrendering to to silence

179
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:07,940
so surrender surrender surrender but here's the thing

180
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:15,680
from from surrender we find our power

181
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:23,660
from surrender we find our security

182
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:33,780
so for this fear consideration this morning

183
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:39,660
and uh it's good to be with you

184
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:46,740

185
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:52,160

186
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:56,539
