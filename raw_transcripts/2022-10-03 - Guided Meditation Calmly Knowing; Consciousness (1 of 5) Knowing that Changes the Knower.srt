1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,319
so

2
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:16,219
good morning everyone and good day

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:24,119
I'm quite happy to be back here after these three weeks of being on Retreat

4
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,420
and

5
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:35,880
okay I kind of feel I feel very content to be here with all of you too and maybe a little bit too content since

6
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:42,960
all that occurs to me to say is um is that but we will uh get I'll get into the

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,540
swing of it of teaching here in the morning and

8
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:55,079
so um um a little bit uh kind of

9
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,480
dipping into some of the teachings from this three-week Retreat I taught

10
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:07,680
I want to start with um this simple idea that sometimes floats

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:15,600
around different places and physics and other places that um you can't observe something without

12
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:23,159
changing it and so you don't necessarily see exactly what is there but you see somehow you

13
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,680
see what's kind of core arising with How You observe it

14
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,140
and that could well be but what I'd like to suggest today is

15
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:40,520
that you can't observe something you can't be aware of something you can't know something

16
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:46,200
without changing the Observer changing you

17
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,979
and that the act of seeing something recognizing something knowing something that's happening in the moment

18
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:59,220
that something can also happen to the Observer to the meditator

19
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:06,960
an ordinary life things go so quickly we hardly notice that but in meditation we're allowing for

20
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,599
that to really build a change within us that creates

21
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:19,379
um a a context or can take it creates a

22
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:24,440
container for holding our experience

23
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:31,879
so uh maybe it'll be a little more interesting for you to stay present

24
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:38,340
if you also are aware that this is also bringing about the beneficial change in

25
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:44,519
you maybe not the change you want to see happen if your knees hurt you want the paint go to go away

26
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:50,519
if you're somehow agitated you want the agitation to go away

27
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:58,620
but some in a different way the act of mindfulness begins to change

28
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:06,360
the Observer change you and that can be uh

29
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,519
guided or be augmented in a very nice way

30
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:19,920
if in the knowing of the experience whatever thing we know we know it in a

31
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,879
calm way we know it peacefully and that is and what we can bring to the

32
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:35,040
cut for the bring to the practice is not just our mindfulness but we can also bring a mindfulness

33
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,340
which is calm or peaceful that is not agitated

34
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,920
and the wonderfulness of that is that it's then possible to calmly know

35
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:52,799
agitation calmly know what is troubling

36
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,260
how we're troubled and as we use this calm knowing

37
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:03,080
this changes the observer in a nice way

38
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:09,500
so to take a meditation posture

39
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:18,320
and whatever posture works for you to um

40
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:28,039
to meditate in but ideally a posture

41
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:36,440
that Expresses in and of itself a bit of alertness

42
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,520
some part of your body is made alert with the chest is more open

43
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:57,020
the back is a little straighter a little bit more vertical

44
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:10,680
for some people having their head tipped down and back a bit

45
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,240
is a useful thing to do

46
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:23,699
in lowering the Gaze and if your eyes are still open to let

47
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:31,020
your gaze be soft almost like the hero being a you're

48
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:36,259
gazing with your peripheral vision

49
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,280
now that anything in particular

50
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:56,000
gently closing your eyes

51
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,520
and taking a few long slow breaths

52
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:26,120
as the deep in breath grows to feel

53
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:34,160
more fully your torso the expansion of your chest

54
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:39,860
and as you exhale to relax

55
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,360
let go

56
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:15,080
into and let your breathing return to normal

57
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:25,440
and other further places in your body you can now relax

58
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,099
release

59
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:11,660
and also as you exhale to relax the thinking mind

60
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:22,039
any tension or pressure associated with thinking

61
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,660
let it relax and settle

62
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:45,560
any agitation of the Mind

63
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:51,380
can you allow it to become calmer

64
00:08:53,580 --> 00:09:00,860
like a stormy sea that becomes still

65
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,680
quiet

66
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:32,300
and then become aware of some sensation in your body

67
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:39,380
that's neutral or easy to be aware of

68
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:51,720
sensation which you can be aware of calmly

69
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,540
peaceful awareness a peaceful knowing

70
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:09,980
a gentle and peaceful recognition of the sensation

71
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,240
staying with a sensation for maybe three or four more breaths

72
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,120
or another one if it goes away and with every exhale

73
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:41,339
see if their awareness or the knowing

74
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:50,060
of the sensation can be calmer

75
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:58,760
Maybe by recognizing it a few times each time a little bit more calmly

76
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,959
and the more you can be aware the more you could recognize

77
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:43,220
whatever is happening in a calm way

78
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,920
their recognition will change you

79
00:11:53,279 --> 00:12:00,620
so then now centering your attention on the breathing

80
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:17,839
and calmly bring forth a calm knowing of breathing

81
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:30,200
a calm recognition of inhale

82
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,180
a peaceful recognition of exhale

83
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:52,560
and if there are other things to be aware of during this meditation

84
00:12:52,560 --> 00:13:02,000
experiment with being aware in a calm fashion

85
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,260
no hurry

86
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:28,220
no worry about what your experience is

87
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:14,720
for there to be a beneficial change in you

88
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:20,420
simply through your calm knowing

89
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,279
calm recognition of what's Happening

90
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:33,740
it's helpful to be continuous

91
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,420
in that knowing in that awareness

92
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:51,019
continually renewing it when it fades away

93
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:33,080
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

94
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:41,700
to turn your gaze out into the world Minds gaze

95
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:47,520
calmly imagining or bringing to mind

96
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,740
people of your life your neighbors colleagues

97
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:57,860
people you see on the streets or in the stores

98
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:06,960
in them imagine gazing upon them kindly gazing upon them calmly

99
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,860
peacefully

100
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:21,260
and to wish them well to wish them a peaceful time

101
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:27,480
and to offer them a little taste little

102
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:34,700
peace in how you know them how you look upon them

103
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,778
looking upon them peacefully

104
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:48,500
may they be peaceful may they be happy

105
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:52,880
may they be safe

106
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:58,580
may they be free

107
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:05,480
and may we find a way to be peaceful together

108
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:15,240
and in doing so change the way that we relate to each

109
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,679
other for the better

110
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:35,750
[Music]

111
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:52,279
thank you foreign

112
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:59,700
good day everyone whether it's morning or afternoon or evening for you

113
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:05,880
and um and as most of you that are on right now

114
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:12,720
no I mean wait for three weeks and um happily teaching a three-week

115
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:18,720
retreat the second one we've done at our Retreat Center in Santa Cruz California

116
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:25,080
and I imagine that some of you who are watching today we're at that

117
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:30,720
Retreat I think there were some 140 or so people on it

118
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:36,059
um 130 140 uh about 40 in person and

119
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:41,940
another 80 90 or so doing it online

120
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:49,020
and um so it's since it just ended two days ago on Saturday I feel kind of very much

121
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:53,898
still in the momentum of the retreat

122
00:31:54,299 --> 00:32:00,899
and in without with the teachings there still in my mind

123
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:06,539
I want to say something about uh

124
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:11,820
the consciousness awareness I see Consciousness and

125
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:16,980
awareness is being uh synonyms of each other

126
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:22,380
and in fact in uh in one dictionary that I have you look

127
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:28,980
up the definition for Consciousness it says awareness and look up definition for awareness it has consciousness

128
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:34,380
I'm sure that there are people who will parse apart more better distinctions between them

129
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:39,840
but uh and maybe in a simple person's English that it's very easy to to to

130
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:46,020
treat these as being the same and um

131
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:51,120
but the question is you know what is it what is consciousness what is awareness

132
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:58,919
and I don't really know exactly but I have a theory and it's a working Theory and that it's

133
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:04,140
a theory with which I work the theory the kind of understanding with which I

134
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:11,399
follow them I find my way with I'm in awe by the capacity to be aware

135
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:18,679
to be conscious and I see it kind of as a metaphor is kind of like a spark

136
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:24,360
in a vast Universe kind of like a little candle that's burning

137
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:33,019
then we have seven billion of these candles burning in of Consciousness or brightness of of

138
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:39,179
and Clarity that uh that we all all humans share and

139
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:45,600
to the degree to which we share it with animals and other sentient beings is um

140
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:52,460
you know it's not so clear but there's a lot of different ideas about it

141
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:59,399
and uh so I'd like to kind of relate this idea of Consciousness to the basic

142
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:06,539
tools of mindfulness that Consciousness is not a thing

143
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:13,080
it's not a static thing but rather it's a

144
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:18,419
it's uh the image

145
00:34:18,419 --> 00:34:27,118
or the sense that the Mind constructs for the Gestalt of all the different

146
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:33,780
past cities we have for attention and all the different kind of mental

147
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:39,060
influences that might impact on our attention

148
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:46,440
and so Gestalt means something that's uh kind of a hole that's larger than its uh

149
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:53,760
some of its parts and um and so the mind has this capacity

150
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:00,960
to construct to take and that's the mind is a constructing organ it can it takes in a lot of the

151
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:06,960
data from outside and inside from all the different scent stores we have and

152
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:12,300
the inner from the mind and the minds memories and thoughts and projections of

153
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:20,160
the future and it's an amazing uh the mind is an amazing organ of processing data

154
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:25,680
information that comes in and then reconstructing in such a way that we can

155
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:31,320
find our way in the world one of the ways that I Marvel at is that

156
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:37,920
um you can um someone can throw you a ball

157
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,859
in the air and you your mind will calculate the physics

158
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:50,220
of when and how and where you will catch the bow

159
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:59,339
if it's a beach ball you'll calculate it very differently than if it's a baseball thrown at you as

160
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:06,359
a festival um you know so there's a very different kind of calculation that goes on and

161
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:12,060
that includes the height of the right to throw and the weight of the ball the the

162
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:20,220
size of it all kinds of things come into play and uh and your mind doesn't calculate

163
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:25,740
the physics of it in a conscious way but somehow it knows it takes all the data

164
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:31,700
in maybe the memory of different balls being thrown in before and understands

165
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:36,780
the the particularities of this time so this is the mind's ability to

166
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:42,119
construct and to make things and we know that sometimes it's does so

167
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:49,260
creatively that um or or sees things dynamically that are

168
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:56,460
not really dynamic in a certain way and so the old uh movie films eight

169
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:02,460
millimeter films where there's all these uh individual frames

170
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:11,160
that are still shots but when they pass through the eyes quickly the brain reconstruction as

171
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:16,619
motion there's no motion on the on the screen there's a lot of

172
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:22,980
quick still shots put on there and um and so the Mind constructs

173
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:29,760
something so the mind has a constructive organ and it takes all the different capacities

174
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:35,400
for perception and awareness and knowing and recognition

175
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:41,820
and together forms kind of a whole sense of what that

176
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:49,619
is that can feel like it's the marvelous sense of consciousness of awareness open

177
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:54,660
broad spectrum awareness but the way people experience

178
00:37:54,660 --> 00:38:02,520
consciousness and being aware varies very much from person to person and from an individual

179
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:08,640
from day to day depending on all kinds of mental factors that come into play

180
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,520
that um that's a that the influence that sense of awareness and consciousness

181
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:21,240
so for example if we spend a lot of time being distracted then we hardly even know that we're

182
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:26,579
conscious and aware uh you know we know it in the abstract but we don't live in

183
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:32,400
the in the in the intimate awareness of awareness the Intimates knowing of wow

184
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:38,520
this is amazing whereas other times when we're not distracted and may be in some beautiful

185
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:44,460
natural setting or looking at the sky and clouds we might kind of Marvel at

186
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:50,160
the fact that here we are on this planet aware of the planet and

187
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:56,040
um and how you know special that is and and

188
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:02,160
um and it's you know quite something to be with someone as they die and see that

189
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:07,619
there's Consciousness and then seemingly in that body there's no more consciousness

190
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:12,800
you know it's kind of that'll happen to us at some day

191
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:19,200
so Consciousness sense of it all can uh can depend on whether we're distracted

192
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:27,000
or not distracted calm or not calm um and um so the sense of Consciousness

193
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:33,480
is influence in different ways by different ways in which we know things

194
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:40,619
and in mindfulness practice there are different attentional faculties that

195
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:47,400
come into play and um and different people who use will specialize in different ones of these

196
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:53,339
attentional faculties as they're grounding into mindfulness

197
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:59,280
mindfulness itself is not a particular function of a particular organ of

198
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,380
perception but rather is also a little bit of a Gestalt of different things

199
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:11,099
coming together to help us to be mindful that maybe is narrower or a smaller

200
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:17,000
sphere of it things than what it constructs the idea of consciousness

201
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:23,760
um uh so um

202
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:29,280
so today I want to talk uh today and tomorrow I think a little bit about uh

203
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,380
in the rest of the week some of these different attentional fact of facilities

204
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:41,400
capacities we have and um and what they are so we can recognize them the more we recognize the

205
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:48,839
more we can use them at different times in ways and I'll talk about the other ones that the Buddha emphasized when he

206
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:55,680
taught mindfulness practice and there's about four different things that he ways of paying attention that he

207
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:02,640
emphasized and with a with a principle that we are changed as we use them

208
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:08,520
The Observers when we observe The Observer something The Observer can

209
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:13,680
be changed by the observation and and that's a principle that we're

210
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:22,440
using in Buddhist practice we're observing we're being mindful in such a way that we are changed in the observing

211
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:28,140
the simplest way of seeing it saying it is that as we OBS we observe in a calm

212
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:34,380
way we become calmer and calmer if we observe our experience in an agitated

213
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:39,960
way it's easy to become more and more agitated so

214
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:46,680
um so how we're aware is crucial for this Enterprise of mindfulness and

215
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:53,040
allowing it to change us for the better and so uh what I'll talk about today and

216
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:59,180
tomorrow now it's almost time to stop is what I call knowing

217
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:05,940
which I see as a synonym for recognition a moment of recognition just a simplest

218
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:12,960
recognition of something looking at a at a cup and recognizing

219
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:19,619
that's a cup that can be verbal you know recognition or it can be kind

220
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:26,339
of non-verbal cognitive recognition of a cup we have a lot of non-verbal cognition that goes on all the all day

221
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:31,740
long and um and uh

222
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:37,560
but if you take the time to let your knowing of something

223
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:44,700
to really know it to really kind of in a sense let yourself stop for a moment or more and to really know the experience

224
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:51,180
you're having or know the thing that you're with know the cup that you're with and um

225
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:59,099
and then see if you can know it in a calm way begin experimenting with calm knowing of

226
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:06,180
things and that could be the homework for the next 24 hours if you're inclined is to um

227
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:12,060
is to go you know during the course of the day

228
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:18,240
see uh uh the manner by which you know the world you're in your Pursuit where

229
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:25,319
you're perceiving it but especially how you recognize what's going on is that in a hurry is it agitated is it

230
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:33,000
tense is it contracted is it pulling away what happens if to you to you if you

231
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:40,020
know if you recognize something in their recognition itself has time to be done

232
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:47,220
calmly and then I'll pick up on this tomorrow so I hope that makes sense and

233
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:53,280
um and uh I hope that as we go through this week you'll start appreciating both

234
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:59,339
the different faculties for attention but also how those faculties then might

235
00:43:59,339 --> 00:44:05,339
help shape our sense our construction of Consciousness itself

236
00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:13,880
so um thank you very much and um look forward to being here tomorrow
