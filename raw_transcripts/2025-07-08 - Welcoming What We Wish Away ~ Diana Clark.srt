1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:09,840
Good evening. Welcome. Welcome. Nice to see you all.

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,880
It's nice to practice together.

3
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:25,439
So, tonight I'm going to start with this bold statement that earthworms are often

4
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,119
underappreciated. that they do this work of you like

5
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,239
airrating the soil and creating little tunnels that allow

6
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,760
air and water to move through as well as they eat some of the organic

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:50,239
material and essentially recycle it as uh leaving behind some castings and

8
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,440
but the interesting thing is that you know earthworms of course they're underground but we don't see them

9
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,879
they're doing this work and proving the quality quality of the soil. Probably,

10
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:06,080
you know, this planet wouldn't work as as it does if we didn't have these

11
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:14,159
things under underneath the ground that we didn't see and that we often just simply don't appreciate.

12
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,200
And Ajan Chawa, who's uh one of the he was, for those of you who know, Jack

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,320
Kornfield, was one of the elders in this tradition, and he practiced with Ajan

14
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,759
Chawa in Burma, in Thailand. sorry in Thailand and uh

15
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:36,960
Ajan talked about this earthworm wisdom this idea of doing practices that really

16
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,360
can make a benefit in your life but often goes unnoticed is often like

17
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,640
underground you know not so obvious and not seen and yet what a difference it

18
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,840
makes I myself don't work with soil I don't have earthworms so but I this is my

19
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,680
understanding is that you know What a difference they make in terms of the quality of the soil.

20
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:09,200
So, what is meant by this this idea of earthworm wisdom? I just like that expression. I think it's kind of fun.

21
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,840
Well, part of it, there's a lot we could say that fits under this uh banner or

22
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,680
this uh moniker, this uh statement. But

23
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:29,599
what about this idea of just simply caring for ourselves?

24
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:35,760
Because there's this way in which sometimes we come to Buddhist practice or maybe any spiritual practice with

25
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,440
this sense that things should be different that somehow we are

26
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:48,080
lacking that we are something's wrong with us something is uh broken or I

27
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,120
don't know we have all these uh sense of that's inadequate or insufficient in

28
00:02:53,120 --> 00:03:00,640
some kind of way and then we come to practice with with this idea we have to fix it.

29
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:07,040
We're a problem or there's a part of us that's a problem that has to be fixed.

30
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,280
And this uh kind of what's fueling this what's underneath this a little bit is this sense of

31
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,040
not enough. Something's wrong. I wish it weren't this way. Dang it. And

32
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:25,040
everything would be so much better if it weren't like this. If I didn't have this quality. I didn't have this behavior or

33
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,159
whatever it is. So, there's this little flavor. It's subtle or maybe it's

34
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:37,920
obvious. It can be obvious or subtle. This sense of Yeah, it's a little bit of aversion like

35
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,799
wishing to undo some of some part of ourselves maybe to excise

36
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,959
or remove or get rid of or somehow transform or change. There's this little

37
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,000
slight feeling of uggh. I wish this could be different. Why

38
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,760
isn't it why is it like this? And so perhaps we undertake meditation.

39
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,200
Maybe I'll just say for those people that I see that are putting on warmer clothing

40
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,480
that uh this is the uh air conditioning comes out of these vents right here. So

41
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,759
there's these microclimates. So under the stage is the warmest place when the

42
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:26,880
air conditioning is on. And so just uh just I don't know state maybe uh what's

43
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,919
always thank you Jim for changing the temperature there.

44
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:39,440
So there's this inner climate sometimes that shows up of of wanting to get rid of things. And I could say some of this

45
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:46,240
earthworm wisdom is instead of this idea we have to get rid of and change and fix

46
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:54,080
because there's something wrong or inadequate or insufficient. What if it's uh there's a sense of care

47
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:00,400
that's born out of uh a respect and honor of our experience

48
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,919
because we care about ourselves. Let's have some maybe some warmth. This

49
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:15,039
doesn't have to be obvious or giant or big um self uh arandisement or something

50
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:20,960
like this, but instead just how what if it were just uh because we have some

51
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:27,280
respect for ourselves and that's what's fueling some of this practice like yeah maybe I'm going to

52
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,639
work on this because I care about myself and I anticipate that my life will

53
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,800
unfold in a way that brings more and more happiness. if I do this that I'll be able to bring more and more good into

54
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:45,440
the world. I'll be able to support more people. What if that's what's underneath? What's fueling our practice

55
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,960
instead of this self-improvement project instead of it's a care and respect for

56
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,720
ourselves and for others. I'm not going to sit here and say that I

57
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:03,120
didn't start my practice with uh with this idea of care and respect. It definitely was a self-improvement

58
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,840
project. So I think it's most often we bring us to practice but just this

59
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:16,720
recognition that there can be this shift this uh tilting in the way and what fuels our practice especially the more

60
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,759
the longer that we have a meditation practice.

61
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:28,639
And so what is something that can support this can support this shift away

62
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:36,639
from a self-improvement project and something towards that's born out of a care and respect and and honoring of

63
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:42,960
ourselves and some of that there's a number of ways which we can do this one thing I

64
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,960
want to talk about tonight is this idea of meta practice many of you will be

65
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,240
familiar with this word meta is often translated as loving kindness or I I

66
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:01,520
often think of it as warmheartedness or goodwill or benevolence, care. These are some of

67
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,520
the other words that we could use for it. And I'll just say briefly in kind of

68
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:14,160
like a a big broad brush. Um, maybe before I say that, I'll say for

69
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:21,759
those of you who don't know that on IMC, Monday through Friday, so 5 days a week, uh, 6:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m., there's what

70
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:29,680
we call happy hour. That's uh, on Zoom and sometimes it's on YouTube, not so often, but and uh, it's all about

71
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:36,479
cultivating this. And for years, I taught this a couple of times a week, this uh, warm-heartedness, this uh,

72
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:42,080
loving kindness. Um, and it's and there's people that

73
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:48,960
have been going like every day, five days a week since the pandemic. So, what is that almost five years now? Five

74
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:56,960
years. And they talk about how their lives are different and transformed and changed from just this uh just regularly

75
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:03,599
showing up for one hour on the week nights. So, what is this kind of practice that

76
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,720
we're doing at happy hour? is this uh loving kindness practice, mental

77
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:17,919
practice. We could say again this is a big broad brush is there's three elements to this practice. One is to

78
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:26,960
bring to mind uh an individual. We start with an individual that um we wish to

79
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,719
extend uh goodwill. We always start where it's the easiest.

80
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:38,640
So often uh start with a lovable being in which there's already a sense of care

81
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:45,279
for this lovable being. Some people use kittens or puppies or grandchildren or

82
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:51,519
babies or I know somebody who does squirrels you know for whatever it doesn't matter

83
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:59,600
what it is. So there's the maybe an object or an image of of an individual

84
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,920
and then there's this felt sense of maybe this connection that you feel with this lovable being might be really

85
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,040
subtle and it might not even be there and it's perfectly fine whatever it is.

86
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,640
Then the third aspect is to say phrases that we repeat in the mind. So just like

87
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,240
with mindfulness practice we like have mindfulness of the breath for example and then the mind wanders and then we

88
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:29,040
come back to the breath with loving kindness practice we use the phrases as a way like I have a phrase the mind

89
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,240
wanders and we come back to the phrases as a way to stay with this connection

90
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:40,800
with this warm-heartedness this goodwill this uh benevolence this care that we

91
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,160
have for others. So this practice of loving kindness is

92
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,680
not about convincing ourselves of anything. It's not an effort to pretend

93
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:58,560
or plead or I don't know something like or demand maybe even that uh that

94
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:05,200
there's this warm-hearted feeling. Instead it's just creating the conditions for that which is already

95
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:12,560
inside of us to arise. Sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't. And that's

96
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:18,720
okay. In fact, that's what's expected. It's more just the intention of

97
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:26,320
inclining the mind and the heart again and again towards connection and warm-heartedness with others.

98
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:32,800
It's quite amazing. It's quite amazing. It's a beautiful practice.

99
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:39,120
So, it's about tapping into something that's already inside of us. We're not

100
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:46,640
denying or pretending that there's a lot of awfulness in the world. We are not just putting on rosy glasses and you

101
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,680
know hanging out with unicorns and uh butterflies or something like that. It's

102
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:59,760
more it's just this practice of this continue orientation towards some goodwill towards others.

103
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,920
So it's more than just a feeling though when we do this practice. It's not like

104
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:14,120
we're trying to cultivate something that feels ooey gooey or

105
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,440
that's I'll just use that as a technical term. Instead, it's often what can

106
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:27,200
happen is this sense of openness and spaciousness and ease and warmth.

107
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,920
As I've said, it doesn't it's not doesn't always there. But when we're practicing it, it's not

108
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:40,240
it doesn't matter. so much whe what exact uh uh emotion we're having. It's

109
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,440
more like we're planting seeds. We're just you know neuroplasticity just

110
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:51,200
bringing the mind back again and again and again towards this uh goodwill this

111
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,800
uh wishing well for others.

112
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,480
And there's this way I talked about it as being warm and maybe spacious and uh

113
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,320
open but it also can have a quality when this warm-heartedness this meta arises

114
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,440
can have a quality of being a little bit bubbly like a little bit uh energetic

115
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:21,760
like like an uplift in the heart. It can be soothing in this way. It can be

116
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:29,519
calming. It can be very gentle and it can also be like wow shazam. It

117
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:36,160
can be a little bit of kind of that thing too. It's beautiful how there can be just such a big wide range of it.

118
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:43,279
And so some of the phrases that we offer with uh loving kindness, some of the classical traditional ones and there's

119
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:48,320
nothing magic about these particular words. These are just uh what the

120
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,800
tradition uses. And so you'll find often variations of this. In fact, you're encouraged to find variations that maybe

121
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:00,880
speak to your heart or resonate more is uh why we're have a start for the

122
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,320
lovable being for example. And the phrase that we would say is like may you

123
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,680
be safe, may you be happy,

124
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,959
may you be healthy, may you live with ease.

125
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:23,200
So, it's just this way for us to connect and this uh

126
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:29,440
encourage this warm-heartedness. As I said, this is not a uh it's not so

127
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:36,160
much a prayer. We're not it's not an invocation to any other being. It's just this uh

128
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,120
wish. It's just a wish, an invitation for others.

129
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,839
So this idea of loving kindness

130
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:57,120
is that it expands out out into all beings and importantly it includes our yourself

131
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,920
having loving kindness for oursel turns out this is often not so easy. A

132
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:10,800
lot of people uh will tell me when I'm teaching a mentor retreat or have done some uh with happiness like okay I can

133
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:17,279
like do it for all kinds of people all these beings all these situations yeah but for myself not so it's not so easy

134
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:23,199
and then they just kind of ignore it and I'm just like doing for everybody else

135
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:28,399
but this idea that care for oneself is pretty important it's this uh

136
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:35,680
foundational practice I would say that allows us to meet the world with some

137
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:41,199
warm-heartedness as opposed to trying to get something

138
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:48,880
from other people all the time to feel fill uh holes that we feel in our hearts

139
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,399
and minds in some kind of way.

140
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:00,320
So there's this part of uh not having uh loving kindness

141
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,519
for oneself. There's some resistance to it. This sense that

142
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:11,440
that feels selfish. I I should have loving kindness for other people, not for myself.

143
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,639
Or maybe there's this sense that yeah, if people really knew some of the

144
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:22,560
thoughts that I've had or some of the uh exper things that I've done, they they

145
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:29,279
they wouldn't think that I'm worthy of loving kindness or care. So somehow they feel like they're not deserving or

146
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:35,199
something. So they there's some resistance to this.

147
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:42,160
I just want to say that we often have resistance to so many experiences uh that we're having not only resistance

148
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,600
to loving kindness for ourselves but just there's this way in which we are

149
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:55,199
maybe in a subtle or obvious way saying no no I don't want this experience.

150
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:03,040
No make this go away. No, I this isn't what I wanted. I didn't meditate wanting

151
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:09,759
this experience. Make it be different. Dang it. You know, is this often this thing that uh can

152
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:16,160
show up? So, this idea of resistance, it's a natural response to uncomfortable

153
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:22,720
experiences and it just stems from our wish to avoid discomfort.

154
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:30,480
of course this so it's this urge to push away or deny or minimize the experience

155
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,839
and resistance I'm using this word it says no but it can also just show up as

156
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:43,519
distraction this way in which we are creating stories or narratives getting lost in

157
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:50,320
fantasy with things that we're remembering maybe there's even ideas like oh I can't

158
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:56,240
handle this and off we go into something else. Off we go with our minds or or

159
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:02,959
sometimes even we just literally get up and uh do some different activity

160
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:10,120
in order to distract ourselves from whatever is being uh experienced that's uncomfortable.

161
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:16,240
So it's this fascinating thing that I appreciate so much about Buddhist

162
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:24,240
practice. We often can have this idea and I know I did for such a long time and it wasn't

163
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,679
until I was helping Gil with his book on uh the hindrances that I really start to

164
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:36,240
understand this differently and that is we often have this idea.

165
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:42,880
Okay, I'll get to the practice as soon as this bothersome thing goes away. As

166
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:49,120
soon as you know my irritation with my neighbor, my frustration with not being

167
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:55,440
able to find a parking spot or whatever it might be, as soon as that gets taken care of, okay, then I'll come

168
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,200
back uh to the to the practice.

169
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:07,840
But it's actually is the practice to be with the resistance. It turns out that's

170
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,880
exactly the way to practice is with uh the

171
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:19,120
resistance that we're experiencing. I like the simile that we find in the sutas

172
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:25,440
where the Buddha describes that uh there's um up in there's rain up in the

173
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,720
mountains and then the little uh

174
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:38,559
trickles of water start to trickle down and then they kind of join and become little streamlets

175
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:45,039
that become uh streams that become rivers that eventually find their way to the ocean. Right? So there's rain here

176
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:50,080
that just comes together and finds its way to the ocean.

177
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,120
And of course it's not in a straight line.

178
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,799
And of course it's not that it doesn't meet like you know the big boulders or

179
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:07,039
big uh obstructions. Instead this water just touches the obstructions and goes

180
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:12,320
around and keeps on continuing. So it's the same way with our practice is that

181
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:19,440
we meet these obstructions and part of the practice is to like have contact with them. It's not to just see them in

182
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:29,039
the distance and then go around them. So resistance, how do we work with this

183
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:35,679
is to recognize it and to not resist the resistance.

184
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,720
Just to notice, oh yeah, this is uncomfortable. I wish it weren't here.

185
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,640
And then just to feel into that wish for it to not be here.

186
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:52,320
That's the practice. Feel into recognize,

187
00:19:52,320 --> 00:20:00,519
oh yeah, I'm I'm irritated. I have this aversion. I want this to go away.

188
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:10,000
So instead of fighting the resistance, instead of resisting the resistance, can we welcome it? Can we recognize yeah

189
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,320
this is a natural part of the process. It's a I would say a required part of

190
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:22,240
the process. If it's uh just perfectly easy all the

191
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,760
time then that's where there's not a learning there isn't a expanding of our

192
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:34,159
capacities. It's just maybe a I don't know going down a water slide in the summer

193
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:39,360
like that. It's just entertainment or fun. Not to say that practice can't be

194
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:46,679
fantastic and lovely and all those kinds of things, but sometimes it isn't.

195
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:52,720
And so by acknowledging the resistance, we create space for it to be felt and to

196
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:59,440
be recognized. Maybe in the same way that the earthworms under the soil are making

197
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:05,840
space for air and water that uh for you know something beautiful to be grown

198
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:15,559
from the soil to make this soil fertile and um able to support a lot of growth.

199
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:25,760
So I'd like to introduce a poem here. I'm on this kick of uh doing poems. Uh,

200
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:32,240
sometimes I I pulled together a talk and I feel like, oh, that doesn't feel quite

201
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:39,679
enough. There's got to be a poem somewhere that's going to make this better. So, here we are. Here's uh

202
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:46,400
Diana's attempt making something a little bit more relatable. And I always like poems that

203
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:52,400
have a little bit of whimsy, you know, a little bit of course are relevant to what we're what the topic is, but have

204
00:21:52,400 --> 00:22:00,320
some playfulness or fun or or at least uh or have some imagery. So this poem is

205
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:11,559
called How by Rosemary Tramer. Simple title, How by Rosemary Tummer.

206
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:20,159
Not the tick. No, surely it is not sacred. Do not try to tell me so. These

207
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:26,400
rep repulsive tiny blood suckers. I do not wish to be impressed by their

208
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:33,440
survival. Do not want to respect how they have thrived since the first flowering plants arrived on Earth over

209
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,880
100 million years ago. I do not want to praise their hard

210
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,080
protective shells, nor how efficiently they swell, nor the ease with which they

211
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:53,200
sense moisture, heat, vibration. Rather to vilify what disgusts me,

212
00:22:53,200 --> 00:23:00,159
repulsive little carriers of sickness, vile little vectors of disease.

213
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:05,360
What joy is there in knowing a tick is so effective and good at doing what a

214
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:11,760
tick was made to do? Could it be greater than the perverse

215
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:19,039
joy I get from my hatred? It is clear my repulsion does not affect

216
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:24,880
the tick. Oh clenched heart, oh clenched fist,

217
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:32,159
where is the line between what I love and what I resist?

218
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:38,080
Is it true there is holiness and everything?

219
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:44,480
How do I wound myself when my heart and hand are closed?

220
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:51,520
Let my prayer not be to fall in love, but to open to the prayer I do not yet

221
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,520
know.

222
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:04,080
Let my prayer not be to fall in love, but to open to the prayer I do not yet

223
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:10,720
know. this idea that okay we want to love

224
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,640
everything like you want to hate these things love these things and I

225
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:25,120
appreciate so much right Rosemary Tummer she's really a highlighting like how much we just like ticks

226
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:32,720
and she's saying but I don't wish for love so like to transform this but to be

227
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,520
open to something new open to something else

228
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:47,440
open to the prayer I do not yet know. And I would say that is what care for

229
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:56,159
ourselves allows is allows us to be open to something new

230
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:01,799
to greater peace, greater freedom, greater ease.

231
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:12,640
this way in which um we it stops being me versus the world or us versus them.

232
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:19,120
Instead to be open to a different way of experiencing

233
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:26,039
our practice, experiencing the world, experiencing each other.

234
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:33,200
And so this practice of ma

235
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:42,000
We can bring this to resistance in a maybe radical this is not the uh

236
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,279
most conventional way that I described it uh earlier but rampa he describes

237
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:56,559
this way that I think it's very provocative and very interesting this idea of why don't we bring meta this

238
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:03,600
wish for others usually we think of it as wish for others to be happy, safe,

239
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:10,799
healthy, and living with ease. What if we were to do that to just all

240
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:15,919
phenomena? So, this is not a uh practice for

241
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:21,679
beginners. This is in terms of meta practice. I would say this is something to do if you've already started with

242
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:27,440
meta practice or maybe not. Actually, I haven't tried this as a beginner. So,

243
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:33,120
maybe maybe it works great. I don't know actually. But there's this way in which what I'm

244
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:39,520
about to say can feel a little contrived. It can feel a little like wait what

245
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:45,200
if we employ the thinking mind too much. But there's this way in which it can

246
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:52,559
touch the heart and maybe allow this something different to arise.

247
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:59,120
allow something different than love or hate or resistance or

248
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:06,000
non-resistance. Instead, it uh allows for something different

249
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,840
and that is to radiate goodwill towards all

250
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:17,440
experiences, towards all phenomena,

251
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,480
to what is seen, to what is heard.

252
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:31,400
to thoughts. Those are the three more obvious ones. And then of course uh to aromomas and tastes.

253
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:42,080
So an advantage of like why this might be helpful is because it like uh reduces our tendency to resist our experiences.

254
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:47,120
If we are actively sending them goodwill, our experiences, then we're

255
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,320
not actively resisting them. May maybe there's a little me mixture there before

256
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:58,159
the meta takes hold. But there's a way in which even to have a shift in our

257
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:05,720
relationship to our experiences really opens up possibilities.

258
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:12,640
It's also a shift away from our personal preferences. If we're going to have this meta

259
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:19,440
practice for our experiences, whatever they are, that really starts to highlight how, oh, yep, I don't like

260
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:26,159
that. I do like this, I don't like that, I don't like that, I don't like that, I do like this. You know, just how our whole lives are end up being about our

261
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:34,159
preferences. And this is, oh, how can we just meet what life is bringing us?

262
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:41,360
And this is uh this is the type of care that can really be transformative.

263
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:47,679
So an example would be and I'm as I said this is not the

264
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:55,440
conventional way of doing this and if we think too much about it maybe it just starts to feel too artificial. So the

265
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:01,039
invitation here is just to allow the mind maybe to take the back seat and the

266
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:08,960
heart to take the front the driver's seat or something like that. So we could say phrases like

267
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,039
may this sensation feel welcomed

268
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:21,120
maybe you know allowing the space to simply exist instead of the way in which we're always trying to

269
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:26,960
push away or change or shove or manufacture manipulate engineer create

270
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:33,039
you know our experiences. Instead, the experiences that are already here,

271
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:39,279
already being experienced. Could we say, "May this experience feel

272
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:44,640
welcomed." Wow, what a shift that is.

273
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,840
Or, "May this sensation be allowed?"

274
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:55,320
Really highlights all the way in which we're not allowing it.

275
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:01,399
Or may this sensation feel cared for

276
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:06,960
like this way of treating our experiences with respect and care. Kind

277
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,799
of like honoring what's actually happening. So often we're lost in our head with our

278
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:18,399
expectations. This isn't what I wanted. I thought it was going to be like this and it should be like that. You know,

279
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:25,520
this is often what the mind is doing. And this is like a radical way to say

280
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,559
May may this experience, may this sensation be welcomed,

281
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:36,159
may it be allowed, may it be cared. And then maybe this idea, may it feel at

282
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:44,320
ease because there's this way feeling at ease allows maybe it to arise and pass away

283
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:49,760
and be released. Because this is what sensations do. This

284
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:56,159
is their nature to arise and pass away and be released. It's only when we are get tangled up in

285
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:02,399
them and the tangling up often shows up as resistance.

286
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:09,720
This way in which we are often saying well I want it to be a little bit different here.

287
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:18,080
So this is kind of a different idea. It's like may this sensation feel welcomed.

288
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:27,360
May this sensation be allowed. May this sensation feel cared for.

289
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:34,559
May this sensation be at ease. So then it kind of rise and pass away

290
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:42,480
which is you know the natural course it things are arising and passing away all the time. Of course they are. But there

291
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:48,360
is truth to this statement that what we resist persists.

292
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:56,559
So there's a way in which the we could direct this towards uh maybe even more

293
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:04,080
practically towards the hindrances. Some of you might be familiar with this this uh

294
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:10,320
perennial list of five ways in which resistance shows up or obstructions

295
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:17,760
shows up. One is desire

296
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:23,919
like this way in which we like uh scrolling scrolling scrolling looking for something or shopping for something

297
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:31,200
or maybe there's a way that we're looking at our social media like the craving for some connection.

298
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:37,240
Can we have some care for that experience?

299
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:45,440
And maybe we can recognize that maybe all that desire is just wanting to really feel met and seen.

300
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,960
And there's this way if we say, "May this experience be welcomed. May this

301
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,240
experience be allowed. May this experience be cared for. May this

302
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:03,200
experience feel at ease." is the way in which we are meeting ourselves

303
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,440
instead of waiting for something out there to meet us.

304
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:15,760
Or maybe there's this way in which we have this aversion or ill will resistance to a person, a situation, a

305
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:21,200
institution, anything, right? It's endless. We can have aversion to anything and everything. But there's

306
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:29,039
this way that it kind of like tightens the heart kind like there's this constriction whenever there's there.

307
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:36,080
Maybe having some meta for this experience can uncoil that tightness can

308
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:41,320
bring some spaciousness and ease into the heart.

309
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:47,200
Or maybe there's this way that's one of the the uh entrances about sloth and

310
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:55,440
torper. this uh feeling like practice is slogging through molasses. Like

311
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:01,039
slow and heavy and sticky. Maybe something like this.

312
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:08,800
And can we have some meta? Can we direct meta towards that experience?

313
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:14,320
Or maybe there's this restlessness. Maybe there's a way in which you sit here and then you're just going through

314
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:20,560
the to-do list. Okay, as soon as I leave here, I got to stop by the grocery store. Remember to pick that up because I'm going to do this tomorrow. And oh

315
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:27,599
yeah, when am I going to get the oil changed in the car? You know, there's all this kind of stuff that we might be doing when we sit down to meditate. That

316
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:33,679
sense of restlessness or maybe we just want to leave like, oh, just get me out of here.

317
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:40,638
Can we bring Can that experience be welcomed? Can that experience be

318
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:46,480
allowed? Can that experience be cared for? Can that experience

319
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,720
have ease?

320
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:58,560
And then the uh traditional list of uh the five hindrances, the last one is doubt. And

321
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:04,400
that might be is this even helping whatever practice we find ourselves

322
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,680
doing, whether it's uh loving kindness or mindfulness.

323
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:16,079
And is there this way that meta can meet the doubter?

324
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:21,680
Maybe there's uh this tightness or hesitation or vacasillation that we feel

325
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,880
in the heart. Can that experience be welcomed,

326
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:33,000
allowed, cared for and have some ease?

327
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:40,880
So this idea of meeting resistance uh with loving kindness

328
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:46,800
as a way to help create the conditions that maybe fertilize the soil in which

329
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:52,400
something really beautiful can grow. Something that's different than the me

330
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:58,160
against the world or our incessant trying to just get everything right out

331
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,359
there in the external world.

332
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:10,880
So, let's see here. I I had this phrase that I wanted to say, welcoming what we wish

333
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:17,920
away. Often what we're trying to push away, can we welcome it instead? And meta

334
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:26,320
practice can be a way that we can do that. So, I'll end there and open it up to see

335
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:31,680
if there's some questions or comments. Thank you.

336
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:52,400
Does anybody have something they'd uh like to say or comment on?

337
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:59,599
I can read the tick poem again. I like to read poems twice because some,

338
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:06,320
you know, you have to read them a few times, right? So, maybe I'll read it here. I have to get my

339
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:11,079
find all the pages that have it here.

340
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:26,000
This is how by Rosemary Tmer. Not the tick. No, surely it is not sacred. Do

341
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,400
not try to tell me so. Repulsive tiny blood suckers.

342
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:38,160
It's funny. That's I don't know why it's hard for me to have a straight face when I say that.

343
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:44,960
I do not wish to be impressed by their survival. Do not want to respect how they have been how they have thrived

344
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,640
since the first flowering plants arrived on Earth over 100 million years ago. I

345
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:58,000
do not want to praise their hard protective shells, nor how efficiently they swell, nor the ease with which they

346
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:07,680
sense moisture, heat, vibration. Rather to vilify what disgusts me,

347
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:14,800
repulsive little carriers of sickness, vile little vectors of disease.

348
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:22,240
What joy is there in knowing a tick is so effective and good at doing what a tick was made to do?

349
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:28,599
Could it be greater than the perverse joy I get from my hatred?

350
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:34,160
It is clear my repulsion does not affect the tick.

351
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:40,640
Oh clenched heart. Oh clenched fist.

352
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:46,800
Where is the line between what I love and what I resist?

353
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,920
Is it true there is holiness in everything?

354
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:57,440
How do I wound myself when my heart and hand are closed?

355
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:03,920
Let my prayer not be to fall in love, but to open to the prayer I do not yet

356
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,920
know.

357
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:15,079
How by Rosemary Tummer?

358
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:32,320
Is this on? Yes. Okay. Thank you very much. That was really interesting and helpful. I've

359
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:39,040
been um doing a lot of studying on about mindful self-compassion and your talk

360
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:44,720
feels very similar. Um but one thing that I've took to heart

361
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:51,920
is, you know, in in self-compassion work, it's often about really, you know, sending kindness to yourself simply

362
00:39:51,920 --> 00:40:00,160
because you're suffering. And you're talking about sending kindness to the ex specifics of the

363
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:06,480
experiences of suffering. So it's like breaking down self-compassion even

364
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:12,079
further it seems. Yeah.

365
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:17,440
Is there a question or do you want me more of a comment? Yeah. So this uh mindful self-compassion

366
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:24,320
is really powerful practice and can really make a lot of difference in people's lives especially because it's

367
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:30,880
amazing how much uh inner critic and how harsh we can be to ourselves.

368
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:36,160
And this breaking it down towards experience is less about the self which

369
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:42,720
the self-compassion is about and it's more about you know just what's arising.

370
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:48,480
Um both of them are beautiful practices. There's just uh yeah, as you pointed a

371
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:56,160
different emphasis and maybe self-compassion um allows us maybe to just settle down

372
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:03,680
and start to feel more whole and collected and steady in some kind of way

373
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:09,599
that then makes it easier to um send meta to different experiences or or

374
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:14,720
resistance I would say. So I is that helpful maybe to say that? Yeah.

375
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:22,760
Yeah. Yeah. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Back here.

376
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:35,359
So let's say we start off and we start practicing meta and we accomplish what

377
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:40,640
you're guiding us toward. Maybe is it wrong to think of that as a

378
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:46,240
self-improvement? Do you have a sense of what would be the

379
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:52,480
disadvantages of self-improvement? Um, I think it depends how how you define it

380
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:59,119
because it could be you could use it in a way that is very counterproductive, but you could also maybe use in a way that is helpful. But I'm wondering like

381
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:04,880
so the Buddha he was a Brahman and he left the palace and wandered around tried all these different things and

382
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:12,000
then under the Buddha sure he woke up to enlightenment out of Mara. Is it wrong to think of that as that he improved

383
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,800
himself? So technically I would say it's not ex

384
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:24,640
yeah it um it's not so much that he improved himself it's that he saw

385
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:31,440
clearly that there is no permanent self no abiding self to which all

386
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:39,280
experiences happen. So it's was a radical shift in uh perspective and

387
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:45,280
understanding rather than like just getting better better just becoming a better and better version of himself. He

388
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:51,920
like transformed into something different. But Matt, I understand what you're pointing to. Um maybe one thing

389
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:57,200
I'll say is this. What's implicit in this idea of a self-improvement project

390
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:04,560
is that a that there's a self, but maybe b that uh there's something wrong with

391
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:10,560
me and it just kind of sets that there's something wrong with me and it seems

392
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:18,000
like there's no end to the improvement that can be done, right? There's self-help industry is, you know, huge,

393
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,240
right? If you go to the bookstore, right? Those aisles where the self-help books are big. So, so it's not wrong so

394
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:30,400
much. It's just think of it of a self-improvement project, but there's maybe some nuances or different ways to

395
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:35,920
think about it. So, you mean that there just a better way of expressing that path, the

396
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:42,000
spiritual path and saying self-improvement? The last thing you said is so there's a

397
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:48,319
better way of expressing the spiritual path itself than just saying it's I'm improving myself like

398
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:54,079
Yeah. Yeah. It's more my my hesitation is more about

399
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:59,520
it's just focusing it tends to be focusing on what's wrong

400
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:06,800
and I'm not saying that everything's perfect and that but it's just the it's the orientation or what's implicit in

401
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:13,800
that. Thank you. Thank you Matt.

402
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:22,160
Maybe we'll end there. So, thank you all for your attention.

403
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:27,280
I wish you safe travels home and a wonderful rest of the evening. Thank

404
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:33,280
you. And if you'd like, you're welcome to come up here and uh talk to me.

405
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,960
Otherwise, uh have a good evening.
