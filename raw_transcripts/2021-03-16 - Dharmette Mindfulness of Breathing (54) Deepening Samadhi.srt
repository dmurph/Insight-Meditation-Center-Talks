1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,160
so

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,599
continuing on the topic of samadhi

3
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,240
and um

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,680
the 11th step of mindfulness of

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,160
breathing

6
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,560
and samadhi is

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,279
sometimes the word samadhi is sometimes

8
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,359
the

9
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,760
generic word or general word for

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,840
meditation

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,040
or the meditation

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,040
and cultivating our mind our body

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,800
cultivating ourselves

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,239
in the meditation practice and then

15
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,760
when we look kind of within this

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,160
universe of samadhi

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,920
there's all kinds of things that where

18
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,239
we are gathering together reunifying

19
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,079
we're coming together

20
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,878
that to develop and grow and enhance

21
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,400
our experience and samadhi is not meant

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:08,880
to be

23
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,760
an experience that diminishes us that

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,400
makes us less and deprives us

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,960
but is actually the opposite it's one of

26
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,119
the richest ways of experiencing

27
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,320
ourselves

28
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,880
enhances fulfill for very fulfilling

29
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,479
very filling

30
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,240
very nourishing and it's developing

31
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:28,880
these

32
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,759
beautiful wholesome qualities these

33
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,320
beautiful wholesome states of mind

34
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,799
but in doing so it's also kind of

35
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,799
getting out of the way

36
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,759
uh of our without adding all this extra

37
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,759
tension and stress

38
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,040
that uh can exist in the mind and moves

39
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,119
us to less and less stressful states of

40
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:49,920
mind

41
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,840
or states of being less and less

42
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,560
activated

43
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,680
places of agitation and moving to deeper

44
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,439
and deeper peace

45
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,399
and as we do so even wholesome states of

46
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,719
mind wholesome activities of mind

47
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,200
that are more energetic than need to be

48
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,120
begin to be shed or relaxed or settled

49
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,920
and it's a movement from more energetic

50
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,800
states

51
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,760
to quieter and stiller states and not

52
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,680
that quiet

53
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,120
think some people have very negative

54
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,760
relate experiences of quiet and

55
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,599
stillness and silence

56
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,160
so we have to kind of try to put those

57
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,160
associations aside

58
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,440
and somehow realize that the quietness

59
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,879
and the stillness

60
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,800
silence that we're developing is letting

61
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,239
go letting go

62
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,800
it's kind of like filling us with

63
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,000
feelings of

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,160
real goodness and contentment and

65
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,599
fulfillment

66
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,560
satisfaction but there is this movement

67
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,360
towards

68
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,319
uh less and less agitation less energy

69
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,360
energetic

70
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,000
movements and things that in that in

71
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,519
that context

72
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,040
of the mind getting peace more and more

73
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,440
peaceful things that were wholesome

74
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,480
and wonderful before can be felt now

75
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,840
they feel like they're a little bit too

76
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,879
agitating

77
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,400
they're a little bit stressful to be

78
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,280
there so for example one of the

79
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,599
things that happens in samadhi is there

80
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,519
can be a lot of joy

81
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,280
but joy at some point seems like it's

82
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,360
too much it's too agitating

83
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,480
and even though at the beginning it

84
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,159
feels like this is the best that anybody

85
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,080
could ever experience

86
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,640
and but as we get more familiar with it

87
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,200
it's

88
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,159
the energy of it seems like too much and

89
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,040
then

90
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,280
we

91
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,959
and then we settle down more and more

92
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:39,680
into

93
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,319
um into

94
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,560
you know peace or more quiet place that

95
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,560
feels even more satisfying

96
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,720
so this movement and this is kind of the

97
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,720
general trajectory

98
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,560
of deepening samadhi developing samadhi

99
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,720
is this movement for more agitated more

100
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,000
energetic states

101
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,799
to less energetic states that i feel

102
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,560
more and more satisfying as we go into

103
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,239
them

104
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,480
and so i say this because it's a guiding

105
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,760
principle

106
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,680
for tuning into our practice that

107
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,639
that the the kind of the way to see the

108
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,720
path forward in samadhi

109
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,440
is to appreciate at some point that

110
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,199
really feel at some point that what felt

111
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,800
really wonderful

112
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,520
at one one stage of practice we're ready

113
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,000
now to

114
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,199
let go of it or let it become quieter

115
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,919
and move to a less energetic less

116
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,800
activated

117
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,520
state and uh and that's the movement

118
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,120
that's the direction that the practice

119
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,560
is going

120
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,680
and um and uh and then there are

121
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,360
various um landmarks along the way

122
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,479
that stand out uh as we do this process

123
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,400
of settling and settling and settling

124
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,080
that goes on more peace that happens but

125
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,600
the principle is removing in this

126
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,960
direction

127
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,199
and it's helpful to keep that principle

128
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,080
in mind

129
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,080
because sometimes when people read about

130
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,120
samadhi

131
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,120
they learn about like four stages of

132
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,479
jhana four stages of deep absorption and

133
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,240
it becomes a little bit mechanical or

134
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,479
technical like am i in the right place

135
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,320
am i at the first john i'm at the second

136
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,880
genre and there's a kind of like

137
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,400
samadhi my numbers that goes on which

138
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,320
can get overdone sometimes and people

139
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,000
are too preoccupied about

140
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,720
the technical definitions and aspects of

141
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,600
this

142
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,240
rather than living in the organic flow

143
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,440
of samadhi

144
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,600
that we can and just allowing things to

145
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,720
unfold

146
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,320
and not be so concerned about the

147
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,080
numbers and stages

148
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,600
and how far we've gotten and

149
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,039
it's easier to do that if you understand

150
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,039
that principle that we're going from

151
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,919
more activated states to less activated

152
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,960
more stressful to less stressful more

153
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,720
from more agitation to less agitation

154
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,639
and so there is a kind of a trajectory

155
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,479
kind of a path and some of the landmarks

156
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:01,680
of that

157
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,919
are

158
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,960
is first is a real appreciation

159
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,160
for no longer any kind of relief from no

160
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,960
longer being

161
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,840
actively engaged in unwholesome ways of

162
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,039
thinking

163
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,360
so if we have spent a lot of time with

164
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,039
resentment and just like why did that

165
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:21,919
person do that

166
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,080
or desire just really want something

167
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,680
hostility fantasy and you after a while

168
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,280
we feel the flatness of it the

169
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,039
two-dimensionality of it the

170
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,560
way in which it keeps us stressed and so

171
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,720
with somalia with developing meditation

172
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,759
we're starting to let go

173
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,479
of those things and when we really are

174
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,479
become separate from

175
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,600
it's temporarily put aside or

176
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,160
deactivated those apps of greed hate and

177
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,960
delusion

178
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,560
the unwholesome it's such a relief

179
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,479
and there's a kind of a gladness and joy

180
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,080
that wells up

181
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,560
but more important as this relief and

182
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,240
the goodness the

183
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,960
happiness of this relief now the

184
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,120
meditation can really begin

185
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,800
to do our gentle work of practice

186
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,280
staying present applying the mind and

187
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,720
staying there

188
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,039
and this idea of the gentle work of just

189
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,120
okay stay here be with us

190
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,240
hang in there come back be here

191
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,520
um now it's done without the stress of

192
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,560
having to

193
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,800
struggle against unwholesome

194
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,599
distractions and difficulties of mine

195
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,680
but there is a kind of gentle work of

196
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,960
you stay here

197
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,280
that can be represented by what happens

198
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,880
on the in-breath

199
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,000
uh we have to the in the beginning then

200
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
breath is a whole new experience

201
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,879
the mind has to connect to that and then

202
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,840
we stay there for the full in-breath

203
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,599
then we connect again to the beginning

204
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,360
of the out breath and stay there for the

205
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,400
whole time

206
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,919
it's a very gentle some people don't

207
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,680
even notice that they're doing it

208
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,680
but there is a kind of little movement

209
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,440
to these two movements of the mind

210
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,560
little working massaging kneading

211
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,599
the dough kind of experience

212
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,000
but it comes along with the relief and

213
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,800
the happiness

214
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,360
of not being distracted anymore finally

215
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,240
being able to be here and do this

216
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,599
as we settle in and we at the stead

217
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,960
we land and and there's a steadiness

218
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,520
and the um we there's less and less of

219
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,759
this need to make the work

220
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,000
of connecting and staying it becomes

221
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,919
second nature the mind is just starting

222
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:32,399
to become

223
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,919
stable and we're just able just to rest

224
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,518
in the breathing and just stay there's

225
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,440
very little tendency to wander off

226
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,399
just there we're here we're finally here

227
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,919
and that gives birth to a different kind

228
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,200
of joy

229
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,920
of just being really now being able to

230
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,600
put aside that extra work

231
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,800
of connecting and being and there's a

232
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,480
kind of a gliding

233
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,680
soaring um sliding

234
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,959
on the experience of of and so

235
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,040
it kind of feels like it's like petting

236
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,279
the cat the pet begins to purr

237
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,399
we're kind of there

238
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,160
being touched in some deep way and

239
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,240
it's kind of like the pleasure principle

240
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,519
where we're just kind of being touched

241
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,279
this beautiful feeling

242
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,800
of just staying with the breath and

243
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,399
being there and being

244
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,440
that a different kind of joy arises

245
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,880
and that can be quite strong and

246
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,200
energetic at times and after a while

247
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,320
that joy

248
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,920
it feels like it's too much and so then

249
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,600
uh it's ready to kind of

250
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,640
to let go of that level of agitation

251
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,760
activation and by tuning into

252
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,920
there's actually a deeper satisfaction

253
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,000
feeling of contentment

254
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,279
and um feeling of mindfulness

255
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,760
feeling of clear comprehension a simple

256
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,800
awareness

257
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,279
simple recognition of what's happening

258
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,440
simple awareness of what's happening

259
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,279
and the goodness and contentment of just

260
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,360
being in this happiness or

261
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,480
this deeper sense of pleasure and we let

262
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,880
go of the joy because

263
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,120
and then as we go deeper in that

264
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,160
happiness

265
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,399
feels i don't know if it feels like it's

266
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,279
too much but

267
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,760
the happiness begins feeling begins to

268
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,519
soften and relax

269
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,560
and it falls away into something that's

270
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,760
much more

271
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,200
satisfying which is a deep sense of

272
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,959
tranquility equanimity

273
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,360
and where the awareness is very pure

274
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,480
um very pure awareness sometimes it

275
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,560
depends how we translate the pali the

276
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,120
buddhist

277
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,360
teaching zone is but its awareness is

278
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,399
very closely connected to equanimity

279
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,880
that its awareness which is purified by

280
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,160
equanimity

281
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,320
and so the awareness is very peaceful

282
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,680
very aware

283
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,839
and and uh very still and because

284
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,600
there's so little mental activity so

285
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,079
little stressful activity

286
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,000
much of our ordinary way of experiencing

287
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,959
ourself has temporarily fallen away

288
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,839
people even have the sense of not really

289
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:06,720
being in their

290
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,040
having a body the body edges fall away

291
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,160
and no sense of being in a body

292
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,079
it's not being disassociated it's

293
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,279
actually the opposite

294
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,360
we're so connected that uh and so still

295
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,600
that we don't need the reference points

296
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,160
we usually have

297
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,399
so um

298
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,959
so the principle of this movement to

299
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,560
less and less activity

300
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,600
as we go into samadhi and part of the

301
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,959
purpose of this

302
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,079
is to clarify

303
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,160
our gaze our ability to see to observe

304
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,760
so it doesn't have a lot of agitation or

305
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,880
filters

306
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,160
or disturbances of

307
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,320
unwholesome thinking but even our

308
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,720
thinking and projections and ideas and

309
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,600
concepts

310
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,600
that we overlay even if the concepts are

311
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,880
accurate enough

312
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,120
to no longer be overlaying concepts on

313
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,560
our experience

314
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,279
and and so it isn't that samadhi we're

315
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,880
doing it for its own sake

316
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,600
but for the way in which there's a

317
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,880
cleans

318
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,920
the our perception cleans

319
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,480
purifies awareness so we can start

320
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,560
seeing in a deeper and deeper way

321
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,680
for the purpose of liberation
