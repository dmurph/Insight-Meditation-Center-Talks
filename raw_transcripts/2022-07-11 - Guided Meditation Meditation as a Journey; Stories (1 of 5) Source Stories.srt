1
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,040
so a good monday to all of you

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,800
warm welcome and um

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:24,240
i hope that at the beginning of this week finds you well and if not i hope that the unfolding of the

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,320
week goes well for you

5
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,760
our companion for this day this morning for this sitting

6
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,079
is uh the statue on the imc altar statue of the buddha

7
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,520
and it's more than just a statue it is a depiction

8
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:59,120
of a particular event in the life of the buddha or to say it more accurately perhaps not

9
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:05,518
just an event but in the story of the buddha and there's a custom sometimes in

10
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:12,240
different rooms in a buddhist monastery the buddha will have a different

11
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,320
will depict a different story in uh some rooms where mostly the dharma is

12
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,560
taught the buddha is hands are in a teaching gesture

13
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,840
in a place where meditation is emphasized he's often in this posture here

14
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,200
where it's a meditation posture and it depicts the moment of his

15
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,880
awakening or just before his awakening and uh his right

16
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:47,759
hand is reaching over his right knee to touch the earth and i'm literally blocking it

17
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,840
the um and

18
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:59,759
um it's a story that is inspiring for many people it's meant to be here to

19
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:06,880
uh represent a story that becomes our own story it's a story of

20
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:14,640
sitting in the middle of our life the buddha sits very stable strong and the uprightness of the buddha

21
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:21,680
is not an uprightness that turns away from anything but sits in the middle and the depiction

22
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,120
if is an occasion where the chaos and temptations and

23
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,760
and worldly challenges of life are all around the buddha

24
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:40,640
and he doesn't he has an equanimity he has a balance in the midst of all all the challenges

25
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:47,120
that are coming in the story that is depicted in the statue and then he's challenged in some deep

26
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,200
way about his right to be awakened and he reaches and touches the earth

27
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,280
calls upon the goddess of the earth as a witness that to his right to his the

28
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,200
appropriateness the naturalness of him becoming awakened

29
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:11,360
and this reference to the earth can can evoke many different things for

30
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,200
different people for some of us for me it evokes the naturalness of it all or

31
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,800
the way in which our are

32
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:29,840
that we are part of the earth part of this nature and that any movement to

33
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:37,599
deny that pull away from it separate ourselves from that

34
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:44,480
with greed hatred and delusion is a loss and we can come back

35
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:51,120
to that place of home of freedom which is kind of our place in nature

36
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,519
so that's a story and the statue depicts a story and in a sense when we sit down to

37
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:04,799
meditate we are participating in a story and a story of

38
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:11,120
finding peace a story of waking up a story of compassion

39
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,440
of discovering engaging in this world not to fix it

40
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:25,520
not to run away from it not to return to some pristine

41
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,199
way in which things used to be but rather to wait to

42
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:38,560
to find our equanimity or calm our peace it's a journey in a sense it's a story

43
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:45,360
in a sense every time we meditate we could tell the story of that meditation of how it unfolded and what the

44
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,360
challenges were and sometimes this idea of that that it's a journey

45
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,520
a story that a journey that we can narrate

46
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,280
can be a distraction for sure but it also can be an inspiration

47
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:09,039
it can give us a sense of possibility and encouragement inspiration to

48
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:15,600
yes here i am on this journey let me stay in the journey let me stay in the story

49
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,800
as opposed to slipping away into other stories of uh

50
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,759
that maybe are depressing or just not to the point or worse

51
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:35,440
so in this story we are here to be present

52
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:42,000
to begin with establishing our presence with our body

53
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
and everyone will find everyone has a little different body so the posture we take will be different

54
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,800
from each other some will sit cross-legged some in a chair some lying down some of you might

55
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,000
actually be standing or doing walking meditation during this time

56
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,120
but to enter into your posture whatever your posture is

57
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,880
with a dignity and a metaphorical uprightness

58
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:20,520
here is the place to be established to be rooted

59
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,560
here in the middle of this world

60
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:34,199
of our your world to sit with a posture

61
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,440
expressing some level of stability

62
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:48,039
calmness rootedness here

63
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,120
and then to gently close your eyes

64
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,840
and to

65
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:12,400
appreciate this body that we have whatever the challenges of the body

66
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,840
might be and it sends this body

67
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,120
is our companion

68
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:32,160
this body has to sit with respect and dignity for this body

69
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,160
to feel it and sense it as it is

70
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:55,520
and with appreciation with love with compassion

71
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:03,440
to take a few long slow deep breaths three quarters full

72
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:17,080
and long exhale releasing relaxing as you exhale

73
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,959
letting your breathing return to normal

74
00:08:52,959 --> 00:09:01,839
and with a normal breath to continue this entering into your body

75
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:07,360
may be similar to lowering your body into a

76
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:15,519
warm or refreshing pool of water entering into your body

77
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:23,240
from the top down with the relaxing of the face

78
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,839
the relaxing of the shoulders

79
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,680
with the relaxing of the chest

80
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,600
the softening of the belly

81
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,360
and within this body

82
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:26,839
to become attuned to the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out

83
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,720
and there is a kind of communion or companionship with the buddha and

84
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:49,360
breathing and that he too meditated mindful of his breathing

85
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,880
and so that some of the sensations your experience of breathing

86
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,000
are the same as his

87
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:31,519
and as we sit here we're engaged in a journey a story

88
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:44,480
of relaxing the mind enough and focusing the mind enough

89
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:54,440
so that we allow ourselves to just be here in this moment's experience breathing

90
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:08,519
touching the earth that's within that we are

91
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,400
so

92
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:50,880
if you find yourself distracted re-enter

93
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:57,840
the story of waking up here

94
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:11,840
of being present here rooted grounded in your lived experience

95
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:31,600
see it as a journey a process of entering the present more

96
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,400
and more fully

97
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:45,399
breath by breath moment by moment

98
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,640
give yourself to the journey

99
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,320
so

100
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,840
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

101
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,640
to appreciate anything that we can be appreciated

102
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,320
about this journey of meditation

103
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,559
to appreciate maybe how you are right now

104
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:46,399
the relief of coming to the end the ways in which you are now maybe a

105
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:52,279
little bit calmer or centered than you were before

106
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:04,559
particular 30-minute story is coming close to an end

107
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,240
and it is what it is the journey

108
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:21,760
and there's a tradition in buddhism to never end a journey of practice

109
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,799
without dedicating the value of the practice

110
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:34,399
for the benefit of others that in whatever ways that can

111
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:39,679
this can work seen and unseen intentionally and unintentionally

112
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:45,760
we aspire we wish that the story doesn't end here with us

113
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:51,679
but that rather the story continues into the world

114
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:58,000
benefiting the world from our efforts here may it be that

115
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,279
spreading from us the hundreds of us that are meditating

116
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:09,919
together this morning may there be irradiating glow or

117
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:15,278
radiating momentum

118
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:23,840
of benefiting the world may the world be better

119
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:31,120
safer [Music] happier more peaceful

120
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:41,200
because we've meditated here today and may we contribute to that

121
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:47,120
possibility in the people we encounter the places we go

122
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,240
the things that we do today

123
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:02,960
and may this journey story of benefiting the world continue

124
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:09,450
for a long time [Music]

125
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:24,130
[Music]

126
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,559
thank you

127
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:38,799
so welcome to this monday morning

128
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:45,600
dharma talk beginning of the week and as usual there will be a five part

129
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:51,600
series and today i'm inspired to

130
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:58,320
have the week be about story and to um

131
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:06,960
have a five-part talk um using the word story as a

132
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:13,200
kind of a um um

133
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,480
each letter to stand for some aspect of story

134
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:24,720
so today it'll be source source story

135
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:30,480
and then trapping stories stories that trap us

136
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:37,039
opening stories the stories that release us from the trap

137
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:42,720
and then is re uh releasing the stories

138
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:49,440
and then there is uh for why i'd like you to use the word yes

139
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:58,639
and what that means we'll have to wait until friday to understand the yes in relationship to this theme of stories

140
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:04,799
and the buddhism this insight vipassana tradition

141
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:10,320
historically has put a lot of emphasis on the fourth

142
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:16,720
theme of the week releasing stories letting go of stories learning how not to live in stories as

143
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:21,839
we meditate not to live in the storytelling mind discursive mind that's

144
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:28,079
talking to itself and thinking and and um and learning to release

145
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:34,079
and that's certainly a very important part of this path of mindfulness practice and

146
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:42,398
something that we learn but sometimes it gets overdone and such a way that we overlook

147
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:48,320
really understanding deeply the nature of

148
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:55,280
how stories work in our lives and their centrality and their importance

149
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:03,040
that not a few people have pointed out that stories are

150
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:10,000
really crucial to human society and human beings it's how we understand ourselves how we form

151
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,880
identities the stories we tell our children are not just stories they're often

152
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:23,440
passing values and understanding of self and understanding of the cultural self how we fit into

153
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:29,119
society and how we are and the stories are what conveys

154
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:34,000
all kinds of cultural values and

155
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:42,560
identities of how we fit into this world and

156
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:50,079
and religions have been pointed out that as much as we might focus on religions as being a set of doctrines

157
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:56,640
that for most people what is most animating and engaging with people around religion is the stories of

158
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,680
a religion that somehow we identify with the stories there's there's a narrative

159
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:06,800
there in which maybe people feel they can participate in or they enter into or

160
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:13,280
inspires them for how they live their lives because life is a narrative life is uh

161
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:19,520
in a sense could be something we explain through a story of what happened you know if a friend asks you how did it

162
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:26,000
go today and you tell them the story of parts of the day and um and they have a bit better sense

163
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,680
of how you are perhaps it's much clearer

164
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,760
so stories are quite important and um the um

165
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,599
and some of the stories that we carry inside of ourselves that influence us are somewhat

166
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:50,560
subconscious we don't always know think of it in terms of a story and so i call this a source story

167
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:56,400
and and maybe it's a bit dramatic to use as an example but it

168
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:04,160
speaks i think to how central stories can be or events narratives that really shape a person

169
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,720
is that um

170
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:15,200
for many years i've been going to san clinton state prison and haven't done it now the next last

171
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:20,560
few years because of the pandemic but i'll visit a particular program a

172
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:26,640
year-long kind of mindfulness-based program um

173
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,480
anti-violence program that helping some certain prisoners deal with their

174
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:39,280
violent past deal with their own past and their difficulties and really confront

175
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:45,680
themselves in a very deep way and the group of prisoners about 30 who do the program every year are really are

176
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:52,720
become each other's challengers and each other's best friends supporting each other to really

177
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:58,000
take a deep look at their lives at the origins the source of the violent

178
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,240
life that they lived and most of the men in the group of 30 have

179
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:09,760
killed someone so it's pretty bad what they've done but what's remarkable is to be there and

180
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:16,160
discover that each of them had a sore story an original

181
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:21,760
event that happened that became the primary pain that they carried with them

182
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:27,280
that became was the was the um

183
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:32,720
the pain from which they they acted violently in the world

184
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:37,839
unresolved festering pain from some event in their life a story

185
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:42,960
often having to do with a parent often having for these men having to do with a father who

186
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:50,720
was violent at home who was violent to them violent to their mother or a father who was killed

187
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:57,119
and then just you know the trauma that a young child that they went through

188
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:03,440
it was so difficult no one then supported them no one helped them they were left with their pain and started

189
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:10,079
acting out and to get away from the pain to somehow

190
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:17,440
try to feel better in this very dysfunctional way and without these prisoners taking a deep look at the

191
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:23,520
source story the source event and really coming to terms with it

192
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:28,880
the transformation out of their violent life can't really happen

193
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:35,920
and it's remarkable to go there and watch to see them grapple and struggle with this and and come out to the other end and

194
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,960
some of these men that i've met you know that they become deeply transformed and

195
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:46,880
changed it's inspiring to see so each of us probably have some source

196
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:54,800
story maybe it's maybe a series of stories that have created an a a attitude

197
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:03,200
an orientation a belief about this world that we live in

198
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:10,960
and and those stories it's kind of a story that led that conditioned us and we carry that with us

199
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,839
so the source story is something like um

200
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:22,720
we when we see the world and go outside we might see that everyone is dangerous

201
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:29,119
there's danger everywhere and no matter who we meet the first instinct is to be afraid of them

202
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:36,160
to be mistrustful of them certainly it's wise to have some mistrust of some people and be afraid of

203
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:42,560
some people but to have that as the policy the de facto orientation

204
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:50,079
pro probably was something that happened in our youth that uh some event that conditioned us

205
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:55,599
that led us to believe that something may be dangerous happened to us

206
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:02,000
other people might have a story of hope that they've somehow taken in a story

207
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,839
that's been told over and over again and they have idea that there's a hope of getting somewhere of attaining

208
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:13,040
something sometimes the hope is unrealistic the hope of becoming rich the hope of

209
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:18,560
becoming famous um the hope of becoming a movie star

210
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:24,640
and um so the um um

211
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:30,480
so what's the story we've been told so what's the source story of your life

212
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:37,599
what have you what kind of orientation story attitude policy do you carry with you

213
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:44,800
about other people about yourself are those stories

214
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:51,599
happy stories are they debilitating stories and people who investigate

215
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:56,720
the narratives that people live their lives by sometimes have

216
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:03,119
divided narratives into three types the narrative that there's some kind of

217
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:08,960
normal life to come back to that's been disrupted and the story is how do we get back to

218
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:16,319
what we had the other story is that the world is dangerous and chaotic and

219
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:22,560
it's not going to get any better and it's just going to get worse and so we have to do the best we can to

220
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:28,640
protect ourselves and to keep the world at bay or keep others at bay or

221
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:35,680
and that's all about our own protection a third story is that of the quest

222
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:42,000
uh that uh yes the world is maybe dangerous it's chaotic it's things change all the time and there's no

223
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:48,640
normal to to go back to but there is a possibility of of engaging

224
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:53,760
in a journey to freedom to peace to transformation to

225
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:59,920
wisdom to make the best out of the situation and be personally transformed

226
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:06,960
to become a better person that's independent of the situation that we're in

227
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:12,720
and so the quest is the one that i think is most empowering

228
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:21,200
and the most realistic the idea of returning to some pristine state

229
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:26,800
is never going to happen when life is always changing the idea that um

230
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:32,160
uh it's all gonna downhill from here that it's a world is chaotic in a terrible place we just have to do our best to

231
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:37,839
protect ourselves or or be afraid or be angry or that everything

232
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:43,440
um is also not necessary so it's very debilitating

233
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:50,319
um the idea that i'm chaotic that i'm a mess that i'm somehow incapable or terrible

234
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:56,400
person that's a story that uh that has no hope and no possibility in

235
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:01,920
it and um and then there's the quest

236
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:09,280
and that uh we don't get bogged down by the stories but where it's a story beyond

237
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,800
stories a story out of the debilitating stories it's a story to

238
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:20,720
discover how to be free so the source story

239
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:27,040
this brief words that i've met i've said today i don't know if they you know speak well enough for your

240
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:34,079
particular situation but you might spend some time thinking about uh what is the source story what's the what what

241
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:40,960
stories what events narratives situations in your life um either a particular one or

242
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:47,280
some kind of pervasive kind of ongoing way of how you were raised something

243
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,319
what kind of uh world viewed as i provided you

244
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:58,560
what kind of philosophy what kind of story about what this life is about

245
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:06,319
have you learned and is there something that is deeper than maybe you're fully conscious of

246
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:11,760
and it might not be a big story it might just be an attitude or a belief

247
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:16,880
an approach to how we are emotionally as we go through the world

248
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:22,560
but to see the source or story and maybe there's a sore story that um

249
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:29,040
that is the the origin for so much of how you live your life understand yourself who you

250
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:33,839
are and um

251
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:39,680
so story i'm doing this uh theme partly i think inspired by

252
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:45,599
um a continuation over the last little while talking about emotions and anger and grief

253
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:51,680
and it's maybe a continuation this emotion theme because uh the chronic emotions of our

254
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:58,400
life most likely are connected to some story what is that story

255
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:03,920
and how do you tell that story and is it the right story does the story

256
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:09,520
change over time what's the source story

257
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:15,359
for the story you tell of your life so thank you

258
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:20,640
and um tomorrow we'll do um

259
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:26,560
trapping stories how some stories trap us in their in their grip in their

260
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:31,960
their in their web thank you
