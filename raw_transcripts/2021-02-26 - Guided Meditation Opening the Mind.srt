1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:09,440
so greetings and uh welcome to the continuation of our

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:16,160
exploration of mindfulness of breathing and by now i think you'll understand

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,720
that mindfulness of breathing involves much more than breathing but that breathing mindfulness

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,840
of breathing is kind of a foundation in which we begin to open up our

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,960
awareness to more and more of our experience

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,760
and at some point this you know as we open up to our body our feelings our mindset our

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,120
mind activities mind states and so there's a kind of expansion

8
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,640
opening the metaphor i like to use and so it's not narrowly focused only on

9
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,000
the breathing and at some point as we do this the

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
the very idea of opening the feeling of opening the experience of opening becomes more and more salient and more

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,439
and more experienced experientiable that more and

12
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:17,759
more this stands out the sense of opening and in contrast to that it's possible to

13
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,040
feel the closing and this movement is that i'm calling

14
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,680
opening and closing can be represented by many words many ideas

15
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,840
and the buddha used the word as a word obstructing that sometimes

16
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:43,920
we cover over and we give certain activities of mind obstruct and others remove the obstruction

17
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,600
and has more expansion and openness of attention and we can see that i think relatively

18
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,759
easy in some circumstances in life where in know very quickly we can suddenly get

19
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:01,119
completely caught up in some concern completely you know the mind attention

20
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:07,119
everything gets focused very tightly around a preoccupation someone says

21
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:12,800
something to us which is maybe disrespectful and the whole universe

22
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,040
collapses around that disrespect our feelings our ideas our thoughts or maybe our

23
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:26,080
fears resentments whatever it might be and where it gets swimming and that's the story of it and

24
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,680
and so maybe there's not much openness anymore to take a bird's-eye view of the

25
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,040
situation and what just happened and what's happening with us and then

26
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,239
other times we have that bird's eye view we have this broad field of awareness and we're

27
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,599
relaxed and open and someone might do the same thing say something disrespectful

28
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:53,360
but we don't close down in fact maybe we do the opposite we actually open even more and like oh

29
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,040
what's going on here what's happening here let's let's uh i don't even know i don't

30
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,840
i don't quite understand all this but this is a time to be present and open and take in the full

31
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:14,239
range of what's happening myself the context the other person and there's a clear feeling of opening

32
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:21,440
being preoccupied caught up in things is something that the buddha says brings

33
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:28,799
blindness and a lack of wisdom this movement towards opening is

34
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,640
movement towards wisdom and vision

35
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,840
and so getting starting to get a sense of this difference is an important part of this practice

36
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,760
and this has this becomes more relevant when in the process and this is in the

37
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:55,680
process of mindfulness of breathing we become more attuned to the state of mind because

38
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:03,120
it's the state of mind that shifts and changes and so to uh so we certainly can know

39
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,799
that we're preoccupied with resentment or or uh caught up in our or hurt or

40
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:16,160
whatever it might be and um the uh or in our desires and we lose touch with

41
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:23,280
everything else around us and we can know that we're involved in that but to appreciate the impact that

42
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,600
preoccupation has how it shifts the mind state it shifts the quality of awareness the openness of

43
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:36,160
awareness the ease and receptivity of awareness that becomes interesting

44
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,800
and and so to notice this movement between closing down and opening up

45
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,440
covering over preoccupied versus kind of available attention that's open and

46
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,560
available because it's not preoccupied as practice goes along

47
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,400
there's a shift of attention from the details of our life the stories

48
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,240
of our life the history of our life a shift little

49
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,759
bit even from our beliefs and ideas desires aversions

50
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:19,919
opinions and to the quality of the mind state and we become the

51
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:25,280
custodians of that quality no one else can be the

52
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:33,199
custodian of our inner the quality of our inner life and so to begin finding a relaxed easy

53
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:41,120
way to to track it and know it and be able to gently keep opening

54
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,600
keep finding the way of peace keep finding the way where the mind state is receptive and open

55
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:56,000
with wisdom with real wisdom so that we're safe in the situation and can take care of ourselves

56
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:03,440
so that's kind of the background for this meditation so if you can

57
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,919
begin by assuming a meditation posture

58
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,960
and if it's possible to do a posture that already in the posture

59
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,840
expresses a kind of openness availability

60
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,400
to life to experience

61
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,360
for me sitting cross-legged i sometimes really like taking my hands on either side of my

62
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,199
hips on the floor or mouth next to me and lift myself almost off the cushion

63
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:45,520
like i'm doing now and so i'm lifting up and then as i'm lifted up then i roll my

64
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:52,960
shoulders back a little bit and release and if i do that the shoulders roll back a little bit and

65
00:06:52,960 --> 00:07:00,000
the chest kind of naturally kind of feels more open and that openness of the chest can be

66
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,840
one or the reference point for being open

67
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:16,960
and then gently closing your eyes

68
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:24,400
and this idea of openness we can be open-handed

69
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:31,199
and you might take a few moments to relax your hands and maybe even

70
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:39,360
turn your hands to palms upward so the hands are open and available

71
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,840
sometimes expressing openness in the posture is supportive for the heart and the mind

72
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,280
to do so become open

73
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,160
and perhaps you can as you exhale

74
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:04,560
relax the shoulders soften in the shoulders

75
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:13,840
and whatever softening release that happens in the shoulders let that travel down into your chest

76
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:26,639
and whatever reference point you have for being open hearted

77
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,599
see if you can establish yourself as openhearted

78
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:41,839
open chested

79
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,800
and then as you exhale relaxing in the muscles of your face sometimes those

80
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:01,680
muscles are very intimately connected to what's happening in the mind

81
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,680
the tightness scrunching up the pulling in very subtly the micro

82
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,800
muscles of the face it's as if there's

83
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:19,839
the mind is a puppeteer with strings that go into the micro muscles of the face

84
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,839
to relax the face

85
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:37,680
around the eyes the forehead and temple

86
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:45,440
the cheeks and the jaw might even be helpful to open your mouth

87
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,760
slightly so the jaw is not clenched

88
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,800
and then gently softly float

89
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:05,839
the teeth back together the mouth back together so there's a light touch with your lips

90
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:21,519
and whatever reference point you have for this as you exhale can you allow your mind to

91
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:27,519
become open to be open-minded

92
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:33,640
to your experience now

93
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,480
open-handed open-hearted open-minded

94
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:50,720
and taking a few moments also to set your body at ease

95
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,839
be easy with how things are in your body

96
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:08,880
maybe easing up if there's any heaviness or contraction

97
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:15,200
resistance in your body

98
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:21,279
see if you can find some even a slight sense of ease

99
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:29,839
being present for your body

100
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:43,839
and if possible set yourself at ease in your heart with your emotions

101
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:57,839
ease up on how you're feeling be easy with it

102
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,160
and then set your mind at ease

103
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:13,680
in whatever way it's you can a little bit ease up on what's

104
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,880
in the mind or be easy with it

105
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,720
so the awareness becomes a little broader

106
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,480
more available to receive

107
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,880
awareness is not recruited

108
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:43,040
to help us focus on our thoughts and desires and aversions fantasies

109
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,600
instead of being recruited to close down and narrow its attention

110
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,440
letting the awareness be at ease and open

111
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,839
receptive

112
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,839
and then within whatever openness that's here

113
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,839
whatever ease that's here

114
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,920
to attune yourself to the breathing

115
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:39,920
the in-breath and the out-breath breathing through or with

116
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:49,839
open awareness ease full awareness

117
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:07,920
as you exhale letting go of your thoughts

118
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,440
and as you do so also see if there can be a

119
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:19,360
opening to a wider awareness or opening to opening

120
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:28,079
allowing the mind to have more space and room to silently

121
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,519
be aware of breathing body

122
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:50,560
appreciating any sense of openness or ease or

123
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:57,279
in the state of mind state of heart

124
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:06,880
breathing with it and notice the small and big movements

125
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:12,399
of losing that openness contracting

126
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,920
getting caught up in something

127
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:24,880
nothing you have to be feel bad about or criticize yourself for

128
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:30,959
but simply to be sensitive to that distinction

129
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:41,519
sensitive to the way the mind moves can move from being open to being more closed

130
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,440
relax to being contracted

131
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:54,160
preoccupied or being available and open

132
00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:00,800
breathing with it all being easy with it all

133
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:09,600
but clearly aware of the difference and how the mind can move

134
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:23,839
around to different degrees of openness and less openness

135
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,840
no need to analyze or figure anything out or

136
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:51,039
stay very simple with appreciating if the mind gets more open

137
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:58,640
or more closed appreciate which direction mental activity is

138
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:06,799
taking you and see if you can keep choosing to stay

139
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:15,679
open move more it's very forgiving

140
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,520
it doesn't require a lot of understanding of what's happening

141
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:29,679
or justifying or criticizing it's just a very simple movement

142
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:36,880
opening or closing and when you can choose the opening

143
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:53,840
choose awareness

144
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,480
being upset about the mind closing down

145
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:58,000
is to do even more closing

146
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:06,559
be equanimous about the mind closing down is to contribute more opening

147
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:14,000
as we become more aware and simply recognize what's happening

148
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,320
allowing the recognition to be wide and

149
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,840
open

150
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,840
uh

151
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,840
ah

152
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:04,130
[Music]

153
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:58,080
and then in the last minutes of this sitting maybe knowing it's the last minutes

154
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:04,399
you could let yourself become more open

155
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:10,960
maybe quiet the mind more and open up in a way that the heart mind is

156
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:16,158
broad and silently receptive

157
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,840
whatever degree of ease just being here

158
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:29,840
in a certain way nothing to do nothing to be nothing to prove

159
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:38,640
just here with awareness open relaxed

160
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,080
maybe even soft

161
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:53,200
and perhaps trying to keep it that way and see or see what happens

162
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:59,279
bring to mind some person that has been part of your life lately or

163
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:05,440
will be today and see if you can hold the image the

164
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:12,000
idea of this person in your mind without closing

165
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,840
without getting caught up in thoughts and stories and feelings

166
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:24,799
just for a few moments let the persons the idea the person float

167
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:31,840
in the openness of the mind

168
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:40,799
and in doing so does that make it possible to have more

169
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:48,640
wisdom more clarity about something about yourself and them

170
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:04,159
might it make little bit more room for a simple good will

171
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:13,840
friendliness or generosity of heart

172
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:23,120
and if so maybe softly gently

173
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:29,279
give expression to that good will with these words

174
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,080
may this person be happy

175
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:42,559
may this person be safe

176
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:55,520
may this person be peaceful

177
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:01,120
may this person be free

178
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:12,799
and may you in staying open and at ease

179
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:17,919
in some ways contribute to this being possible

180
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:27,200
in some simple ways can you contribute to their happiness safety peacefulness

181
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:37,840
and freedom so at least they're safe from you

182
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:50,640
and then to expand that goodwill out into the world more widely

183
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,799
but without closing down

184
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,720
the air on the side of staying open and simple

185
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:11,200
and in that openness may all beings be happy

186
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,840
may all beings be safe

187
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,120
may all beings be peaceful

188
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:47,840
may all beings everywhere be free

189
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,360
okay
