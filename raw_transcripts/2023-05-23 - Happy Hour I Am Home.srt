um kindly this sense of I'm home I'm home

8
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:51,660
I'm home which can be a concept but we can bring up anywhere even when we're

9
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:59,600
not at home to feel at home to feel at home in our bodies to feel at home

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:07,140
in our minds to feel at home with who this person is to feel at home

11
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:16,140
and it can be helpful to borrow the sense of being home from actual sense of being home or maybe

12
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:25,320
you feel home at nature or maybe there's a particular place in your home that you feel particularly cozy and at home about

13
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:31,619
um I um know that there have been times that I felt completely at home in my bed

14
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:37,439
there's a sense of coziness and comfort like oh yeah I'm home I can ah I can

15
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,979

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:52,740
okay it's okay sweetheart it's okay dear their sense of rest a sense of ease sense of nourishment kindness

17
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:58,500
um that can can accompany this feeling of being home

18
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:04,619
so the idea of being home in our heart being home in our bodies

19
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:10,679
bringing this sense of kindness uh and ease so that's the theme that's

20
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:18,480
the invitation for us to explore and um have more invitations in the guided

21

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:47,159
foreign thanks for exploring this this idea of of meta kindness

124
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:52,919
cultivating well-being there's a sense of coming home coming home with kindness

125
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:59,820
special the spaciousness coming home offering herself

126
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:07,200
ourselves a sense of home and others as well the same way that

127
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:16,080

that sense of ease and tapping into that

130
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:33,899
remembering how that feels offering that to us ourselves to kindness care being

131
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:42,000
home at our bodies this home of ours this mind of ours as I

132
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,360
said does not need to be a dungeon what if we see it as a palace

133
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,880
of kindness with plenty of space

134
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:59,179

140
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:44,940

157
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:39,080
arriving in my body in my heart and and the moment the moment

158
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:46,500
and then realizing actually in many ways this this home I carry my home with me

159
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:51,840
always and yet there's this sense of inspiration from being at home this this

160
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:58,200
memory of being home that we can take so that's uh that's pulling the the uh the

161
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:04,080

168
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:46,378

169
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:53,339
the middle of like sort of this negative thoughts and and sort of this and it really did feel like a bit like a

170
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:59,880
dungeon like I couldn't get out and it was um anyway it sort of gave me a little bit of perspective and to think

171
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:07,740
of it sort of like they're a little bit broader and anyway I just wanted to thank you for that ever

172
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:13,079
thank you so much really appreciate you you reflecting on how this invitation

173
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:18,599
actually in in real time was helpful as there were challenging thoughts oh it

174
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:23,940
really does feel like a dungeon this the getting collapsed in it and then opening

175
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:32,760
up oh yeah there can be that realization can bring in a lot more ease and spaciousness lovely thank you dot and

176
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:39,540
now I see your hand please um there's something something happened

177
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:46,020
in meditation and he said absolutely this is a castle

178
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:52,380
uh something shifted actually those negative thoughts and and and unwanted

179
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:59,760
thoughts they used to have funds on me and suddenly with that kind of space home

180
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:05,940
they melted away no no more fans they just come and go

181
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:11,700
so I don't know if that makes sense but yeah it absolutely makes sense thanks so

182
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:18,780
much for sharing that now this is beautiful that just makes my heart so happy yay beautiful thanks for sharing

183
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:24,359
that insight and the way that your heart your mind found

184
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:31,579
in more space but just realizing actually this is a castle I usually

185
00:36:31,579 --> 00:36:38,339
consider it you know my mind has the pattern or the tendency to think of it as well kind of collapse but actually if

186
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:45,300
I realize really how spacious it is the difficult self-judgmental thoughts

187
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:50,339
they ah they relax they Melt Away there's a lot more space this is a

188
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:56,040
spacious Castle so remember that now this is something that works for you this is something that works for you and

193
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:33,240
the warmth of the community of being it's not so much my house because I've

194
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:38,339
only lived I I'm not living in a place that I've been in for years and years

195
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:45,119
and years and yet I'm home I'm home because I'm surrounded with

196
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:50,940
people I love and you know my friends and family my

197
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:57,780

beautiful thank you Barbara I love it it's

200
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:16,680
um it's not so much that home is a place but home is a concept home is the sense

201
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:22,140
of love the sense of Care community that surrounds you so anywhere is home

202
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:28,760
exactly that's exactly right and and here in the Sangha too

203

yeah yeah that is just beautiful exactly so so well said and as you said this

204
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:42,780
it's also reminded me of something um also something that I think maybe happened earlier today in my own

205
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:51,180
practice because for me you know I've lived here for a few years but not that long and and sometimes I've said that um

206
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:56,940
this may sound strange but so so my mom who passed away some years ago she gave

207
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:04,020
me a carpet and being Iranian being Persians carpets are really important to us so so lying on the carpet she gave me

208
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:10,500
that's home I feel surrounded by her love home is where this carpet is where of course this you know the carpet Bay

209
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:16,020
burn in a fire but there's just a sense of being surrounded and cared for by by

210
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:21,240
the community by love so that's home and may we all of us so thank you Barbara

211
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:27,000
for bringing for expanding that even further that the idea of being home so

212
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:34,160

213
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:41,099
