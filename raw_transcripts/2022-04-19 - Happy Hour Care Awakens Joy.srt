i wanted to uh invite us to engage

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:40,719
in the practice of of compassion and care

7
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,079
to explore that as you know as as you might have been uh for those who've been

8
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:53,440
coming or listening to to happy hour there's so many different aspects of these practices there's just not one way

9
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:00,239
to explore these practices there's so many angles so many dimensions so many ways our hearts can open

10
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:06,159
to these practices so um for so for tonight i'd like to invite

11
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:14,400
us to explore a particular aspect a way of um exploring uh karuna compassion the

12
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,320
practice of compassion which is where care which is where love

13
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,880
warmth meets or holds suffering either for ourselves or for others

14
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:34,880
and then there is the practice of [Music] this other beautiful word in pali on

15
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,880
kampa often translated as care this basic care

16
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:47,280
basic care um which we can think of as pervasive just

17
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,560
a sense of caring and both of these practices are beautiful so tonight i wanted to invite

18
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,920
us practically to explore them in our hearts um

19
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,040
in our minds in our mind hearts again in the the pali word is chitta

20
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:13,120
c-i-t-t-h h often translated just as mind but actually it's mind heart it's the more

21
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,120
appropriate translation so in our mind heart exploring care on kampa

22
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:26,319
and exploring compassion karuna and um

23
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:34,560

24
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,160
together and explore and see what arises the first person laboratory which is

25
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,760

58
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,639

59
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,160
knows how to breathe we don't want to make it into a project

60
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:47,599
simply knowing [Music] that light touch that breathing is happening here it is

61
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,240
being breathed in being breathed out

62
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,199

67
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,120
not to be taken for granted

68
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,600
enjoying the breath appreciating the breath

69
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,480
imagine you i jumped in the lake

70
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,320
in a cool lake the summer day and you jumped a little too deeply

71
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,399
it took a while to come back up to the surface and when you come back up

72
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:27,360
the surface of the water oh this breath i've been waiting for you delicious

73
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,839
ah let it be enjoyed

74
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,800
natural breath

75
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:58,480
if thoughts arise not a problem at all thoughts will arrive sounds will

76
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:05,680
arise it's okay it's all okay

77
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,480
arising and passing

78
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,440
greeting the thought with a smile

79
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:29,519
maybe for the benefit of this practice period gently

80
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,760
telling the thought thank you and not now

81
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:42,720
please come back another time i'll be waiting for you but now i'm giving my heart to this

82
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,600
practice to this cultivation

83
00:12:53,519 --> 00:13:00,480
turning turning the awareness

84
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,000
inward internal

85
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:31,040
calming soothing [Music] breath in the body received

86
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,720
just tilling the soil another few minutes just to settle

87
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:44,000
before we turn to explore care and compassion

88
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,560
but here this breath

89
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,320
received

90
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,680
releasing tension releasing thoughts

91
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,360
releasing and re-releasing intending

92
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,319
being with cozily

93
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:08,839
lovingly with this body

94
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:18,480
knowing feeling that the breath as it's received

95
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:26,720
it's like stroking petting a cat

96
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:33,920
our hearts our minds can start to purr with ease and delight

97
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,720
just with this simplicity

98
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:33,280
now i'd like to invite you is we continue to stay embodied feeling the

99
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:40,840
body and the earth touching the earth receiving the

100
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:46,000
breath releasing tightness hoping

101
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:56,400
continuing to feel the body and invite if you want

102
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:03,360
this image into your heart for reflection

103
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,799
and the image invite is

104
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:22,960
an image of care we've often seen interspecies caring for each other

105
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:29,360
perhaps you might have seen videos on the internet

106
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:38,320
if you've seen one you can bring pull one up or i'll describe one

107
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:46,240
little a dog caring for playing with little chicks young chicks

108
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,000
playfully caringly

109
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,240
a dog mothering chicks

110
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,799
or whatever image arises for you

111
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,480
often observing another being caring

112
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:25,360
caring so much caring protecting keeping safe

113
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,600
another being

114
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,440
it kindles it rekindles a sense of care softness

115
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:45,880
as we recognize the sense of care

116
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:16,280
or maybe an image a sense of

117
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:21,679
and loving protecting its own chicks

118
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,039
or a duck it's ducklings

119
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,159
sweet little furry animals

120
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:52,640
young ones being cared for protected

121
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,760
in safety by others

122
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:05,280
witnessing care in your mind's eye

123
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:15,919
let yourself rest in this and see what it arises in you in

124
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:23,000
your heart witnessing care

125
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:26,320
feeling into the sense of care witnessing another being scared

126
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:31,360
maybe it kindles reminds you of

127
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,640
a being maybe a pet maybe a child

128
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:44,320
or maybe an older parent that you have cared for

129
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:50,400
or maybe a friend someone you have cared for deeply cared

130
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:57,200
for there may be perhaps a tableau

131
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:05,720
an image of a moment when you cared maybe fed them

132
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,640
kept them safe cleaned them

133
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,240
took them to a doctor

134
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,840
deep care

135
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:36,320
let yourself appreciate let yourself recognize your own care

136
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:42,640
your own capacity to have cared this is not a time

137
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:48,000
to remind yourself of all the ways you haven't cared or you fell short

138
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:55,919
this is not the time letting go of any self-judgment

139
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:01,840
that may arise and just feel into the care

140
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:27,200
let your heart appreciate feel into its own care

141
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,880
expression of its love for another being

142
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:45,519
i let the sense of care brighten your heart

143
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:53,000
brighten bright light shining gladdening

144
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,640
and maybe there is a being in your life right now

145
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,080
that you care for you care about

146
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:39,919
feeling into the sense of care not clingy care

147
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,960
not with attachment or outcome [Music]

148
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:51,000
but an easy just a sense of care

149
00:26:52,799 --> 00:27:00,600

the eyes with which we gaze through gaze with

154
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:26,320
care turn around and piece at ourselves with care

155
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:34,158
care for this being who is me myself

156
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:40,399
along with others not separate

157
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,799
not separate

158
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:59,720
as being who is me just as worthy just as worthy

159
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,960

160
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:19,960
health well-being and care to take care

161
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:42,919

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:25,679
garuna compassion to bring up

164
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:33,158
perhaps some mild challenge you've been having recently

165
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,398
i let the sense of care hold this challenge

166
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:49,760
not self-playing or you should have done this it's your fault no none of that or sweetheart this is hard

167
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:55,200
this is hard anyone going through this would be having a hard time

168
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:01,840
this is hard dear it's okay now now holding yourself with care

169
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:07,840
tenderness compassion meeting meeting the hurt

170
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,799
with love with care

171
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,398
perhaps extending the metaphor

172
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:45,600
if you see yourself as one of the chicks

173
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,880
maybe you're having a bit of a challenge

174
00:32:54,080 --> 00:33:01,519
maybe you're the one that's running behind doesn't get enough food is the smaller one so the mother hen cares more

175
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:10,360
oh sweetie sweetie let me care for you

176
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,640
opens the heart more even more to care for this precious

177
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:28,120
precious being that is you your own care for yourself

178

and extending extending our care

182
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:32,800
our compassion to others

183
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:40,160
perhaps to the being from earlier that in our mind's eye we're feeling our

184
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,559
care for

185
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:53,359
imagine if they had a challenge our heart would be moved

186
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:03,119
to a tenderness of compassion needing the hurt meeting the challenge

187
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,000
with even more love

188
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,720
and care

189
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,680
and for the last

190
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:45,280
minutes of this practice period extending our care

191
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:54,240
and our compassion our everyday care to all beings everywhere

192
00:36:54,240 --> 00:37:01,040
and all beings who have challenges difficulty suffering which is all of us

193
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:07,200

194
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:14,240
may all beings everywhere have ease

195
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:21,560

have grace in the midst of our pain or sorrow or suffering

197
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:37,839

thank you all thank you for your practice

200
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:12,160
so care and compassion

201
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:19,440
so [Music] in this practice we engaged we felt into

202
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:25,599
a sense of care what i call at the end every day care

203
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:31,040
just caring caring and then that care can be expressed

204
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:36,240
as compassion where it meets suffering and there's a

205
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:44,320
different qualities different nuances to to these flavors

206
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:50,240
and they're both beautiful they're both lovely and also what i was inviting you to feel

207
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:55,280
into at the beginning is sometimes when we feel the care of

208
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:01,839
another being for another being oh that brings up the sense of care in our heart

209
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:09,520
in in uh yeah it enlivens for us

210
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:15,200
so there's a lot of invitations in this practice and i am curious

211
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,440
um i'd love to invite you if you wish to share um

212
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:26,560
reflections questions comments and for the been and this is for the benefit

213
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:31,359
of both yourself to be held to witness if you'd like

214
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:39,280
and also for the benefit of the community all questions are important valuable and aha moments

215
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,800
whatever you like to share you can type them in chat also or you can raise your zoom hand

217

i thank you today i received a

218
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:03,200
copy of a letter that i wrote 60 years ago to one of my cousins

219
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:08,240
uh when i was 10. and i could picture myself

220
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:14,720
at 10 writing that and this is to a cousin who's since been estranged from the family and who i haven't seen in

221
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:20,079
many years but it it helped me see myself

222
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:27,359
in the part of the [Music] meditation tonight where we're extending this care to ourselves

223
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:33,280
which i always find difficulty doing but being able to see myself as that

224
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,480
ten-year-old and seeing the actual handwriting on that letter and actually

225
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,960
recalling the moment 60 years ago when when i did that um

226
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:52,400
made that much more palpable and accessible to me and um and very sweet

227
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:58,640
thank you thank you fred so sweet thank you for sharing this how precious to be able to

228
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:06,720
have access again to this letter um and for it to serve as a way to

229
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:12,240
access the feeling of turning the sense of care to yourself beautiful thank you

230
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:18,319
for sharing this and really um bringing the the

231
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:25,359
um how palpable this is i could feel it in your words so so um i wonder if you have

232
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:30,480

234
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,920
remembering this letter and or put putting it somewhere where you can look at it frequently

235
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:47,359
the 10 year old's handwriting would be a way in would be a way and

236
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:52,480
it's it's you know it's as leonard cohen says

249
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:16,720

250
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:23,440
humanity visiting they were building all these houses for hurricane katrina victims and i remember

251
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:30,560
it just worn my heart and i felt so good watching that just that them doing this action and then the

252
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:35,839
reactions of the recipients getting housing again and that they were so

253
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:41,440
blown away by the kindness of these strangers yeah yeah isn't that

254

262
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:30,400
