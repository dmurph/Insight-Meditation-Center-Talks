1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,680
so hello my friends and uh

2
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,160
it's good to be here and uh

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,599
you know one of the probably one of the primary foundations

4
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:32,800
of my life is the dharma and dharma practice and

5
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,480
it's certainly nice to be able to share it but it's also nice very nice for me

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:44,960
that i have this time to sit here in my meditation posture and to

7
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:52,399
kind of tap into the dharma express the dharma live the dharma in a way that

8
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,399
is meaningful and and connects me to what i for me is this

9
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:05,840
foundation and to be able to live close to this foundation

10
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,439
through one's day through one's years is one of the great

11
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:18,240
vehicles for a meaningful life a peaceful life a

12
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:25,118
a life that brings a lot of gladness a lot of happiness

13
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,640
so each of you who are here whether it's the first time or you've been here since

14
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,240
the beginning of the pandemic are also here to

15
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:43,280
in a sense tap into something within yourself that is valuable

16
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,119
something inside of yourself that can be a refuge or support a foundation

17
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:57,438
that maybe you have some sense that it can be bring you gladness happiness

18
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:04,320
sense of satisfaction and exactly what it is in relationship to

19
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,440
what we do here is probably a little bit individual for each of you

20
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:16,000
but especially for those of you been here for a while now i'm confident that you have something

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,520
that is valuable important that you tap into

22
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:28,879
and perhaps as we go through the today especially it's meditation that it is

23
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,720
not the words that come from me that are important but rather

24
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:42,720
what you recognize in yourself that's important so underneath your challenges underneath

25
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:49,599
your sadness underneath your maybe resentments and

26
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,720
hurts and pains and frustrations anxieties

27
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,000
there is a foundation that's deeper a foundation that is

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,920
enacted to be known that is not something we search for

29
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,920
but something that we live something that we enact that we practice we

30
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,599
engage in and for people who spend too much time looking

31
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:24,239
for a foundation looking for something valuable they miss the

32
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,319
the key thing that it's almost as if the answer is in the looking

33
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:37,440
if the looking if their mindfulness if the awareness is one of being available being open

34
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:44,720
and valuing this capacity we have to know and to enact the knowing

35
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:51,200
and act the the uh presence the attention the

36
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:57,439
the uh the hereness here

37
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:03,920
so maybe this here-ness of your own can be a foundation

38
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:10,799
so to have a meditation posture and one of the advantages of meditating

39
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,840
for ongoingly is that maybe the posture you

40
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,359
find starts becoming part of this enactment

41
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:27,240
of attention of awareness of presence

42
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,840
and so maybe giving some care to your at your posture so

43
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,880
it can be an enactment it can be part of this engagement

44
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,220
bringing forth your [Music]

45
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:56,600
your beings your bodies your heart's capacity for being present

46
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:04,960
and to lower your gaze and even if you have your eyes closed

47
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:13,919
already it might be possible to lower your gaze as if you lower your gaze a little bit

48
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,479
so the eyes can relax in their sockets

49
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:30,160
to recognize that the eyes do not have to work when we're meditating

50
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,639
and then gently closing the eyes

51
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:46,560
and then slowly and gently taking some fuller breath in breaths

52
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:53,719
maybe three quarters full in a slow gentle way

53
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:02,319
and then exhaling with a longer exhale than usual

54
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:10,560
when you come to the end of the exhale maybe there's a way of relaxing

55
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,919
that allows exhale to continue

56
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,720
and letting your breathing return to normal

57
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,039
and as you exhale scan through your body to see if there's places you can relax

58
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:12,880
the face the shoulders chest the belly maybe the hands and arms

59
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:20,720
but as you relax these parts of your body see if that in that relaxation in the

60
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:27,840
softening there might be a little bit more

61
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,520
sensation sensitivity awareness

62
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,840
aliveness in those parts of your body

63
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:59,760
and one analogy for meditation

64
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:06,399
is that the awareness that we enact the awareness that we abide in

65
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,480
is a bit like the ocean broad and

66
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,720
deep and all the emotions and feelings we

67
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,800
have are like the dance of the waves on top of the ocean

68
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:32,760
sadness and gladness happiness and unhappiness

69
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,480
fear or confidence

70
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:50,880
anger or love they all have their place dancing on top

71
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:58,160
of the surface but rest in the depth the fullness of

72
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:04,800
your ocean rest in the

73
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:11,040
depth in which things appear on the surface

74
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:20,160
allow them to be there dancing on the surface without identifying or reacting to them

75
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:26,480
or needing them to be different but don't

76
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:35,360
base yourself on the waves base yourself on the deeper embodied

77
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:43,000
sense of presence attention awareness mindfulness

78
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:54,560
fast like an ocean the ocean does not need to identify or

79
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,760
be concerned with the shape and the character of the

80
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:07,240
different waves on the surface they come and they go

81
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:59,360
if you're sitting here with some concerns especially concerns that have an

82
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:06,720
emotional aspect to them

83
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:15,038
for these minutes think of them as the waves on the top of the ocean

84
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:24,558
they're there because of the winds but that you are not the waves

85
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:30,039
hear the vast profound ocean

86
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:46,160
vast profound ocean of awareness of attention of presence

87
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:53,919
of embodiment aliveness

88
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:04,240
rest in that ocean and allow the waves to do what they do

89
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:11,200
without denying them and without

90
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,559
believing in them

91
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,640
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

92
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:45,679
in whatever way you're feeling whatever way your you are

93
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,760
maybe for these last couple of minutes you're allowed to be that way

94
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:59,039
but in that allowance in allowing and being available and

95
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:07,679
maybe at the same time as you allow yourself to be as you are

96
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:13,039
you can allow for a greater sensitivity greater

97
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:18,559
awareness of others the eyes closed they would just be

98
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:25,679
bringing them to mind but later today maybe it's meeting people in person or

99
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:35,440
and to feel or sense or know people

100
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:42,799
from the place of depths within place of where we enact

101
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:48,799
a sensitivity a attentiveness a receptivity

102
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:58,200
where we feel something different about others than our opinions and ideas and stories

103
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:10,200
the ability to be mindful of oneself

104
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,240
gives us also the ability to be mindful of others

105
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:27,840
with the humanity of others for the ways that others

106
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:34,799
suffer and are happy challenged and successful

107
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,080
may it be that our capacity to feel and know and enact

108
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:48,480
mindfulness allows us to have deeper richer

109
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:55,799
respect and care even reverence for others

110
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,679
may we live

111
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:09,200
offering our attentiveness our care

112
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:15,919
to others may the expression of this practice in

113
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:20,960
the world be wishing for the welfare and happiness

114
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:30,320
of others may all beings be happy

115
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:36,320
may all beings be safe

116
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,880
may all beings be peaceful

117
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,600
may all beings be free

118
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:52,919
and may our life contribute to that possibility

119
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:10,700
[Music]

120
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:19,720
[Music] thank you

121
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:38,960
so good morning and continuing now with this week's series

122
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,240
theme of the appropriate and inappropriate different states

123
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:50,480
polarities that exist in often in relationship to each other the healthy expressions and unhealthy

124
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:57,039
expressions of these things and today the the topic is um

125
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:03,279
gladness and sadness and um

126
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:11,440
there's beautiful inspiring forms of gladness and there are gladness which are not so

127
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,880
beneficial for us to experience there are profoundly

128
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:22,080
human and maybe a very important experiences of sadness to experience

129
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:28,880
and there are unhealthy ways of being sad there's ways that are debilitating

130
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:35,360
and so to be able to kind of begin teasing apart and seeing that

131
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,960
these can take a different shape form often people often enough i believe

132
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:48,080
people when they feel sad well just because it's uncomfortable often that they'll just take it as a bad

133
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:54,720
thing a wrong thing shouldn't be there or when they're glad this is great you're on top of the world

134
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:01,039
and this is fantastic but in fact just because it's gladness or sadness

135
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:08,240
doesn't mean that it's just one is just good and one is just bad one is healthy and one is not healthy

136
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:14,559
they both have their healthy versions and both of them have their unwise version versions

137
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:21,279
and so to be able to uh see those is helpful and it the unwise ones

138
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:27,440
uh the ones that are not so healthy to have tend to kind of live together

139
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,480
and in a as a pendulum swings they tend to rebound and react to each

140
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:38,720
other and live in relationship to each other so for example a person might feel

141
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:46,399
there's a lot of hope and be really glad and be delighted and by the hope the possibility of something

142
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:51,679
and then the and then whatever they're hoping for doesn't work out and so the pendulum

143
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:57,840
swings and then they feel really sad and sorrow and grieving

144
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:05,120
and um and to say it that abstractly does maybe get it across but you know to say that um you know you

145
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:10,320
you uh really had a lot of hope in your the lottery numbers you chose

146
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,919
and so certainly this is the number that and you're so glad that you finally had a strong good feeling these are the

147
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:21,760
numbers that are gonna and then they're not the numbers that win the lottery in and so then you feel

148
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:29,200
really despairing even discouraging especially because you put a lot of money into into that

149
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:34,480
and so here these live in relationship to each other

150
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,679
it might be hope around another person hope in a relationship if if only that

151
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:45,200
can happen then you know and yes that's going to happen i hope for it and it looks like it's

152
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:51,520
going to happen with that person and then it doesn't and then we crash because we we're being

153
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:58,560
energized and pumped up in the energy of hope and and when it doesn't work out then we

154
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:05,280
crash so these kind of exist together some of these that exist together have a lot to do with self

155
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,040
self-identity issues definitions of ourselves or judgments

156
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:17,920
about ourselves and so if we get praised or we do something that we think others

157
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:24,480
will approve of then um or then perhaps we feel kind of glad and

158
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:31,200
happy and kind of energized but um it turns out that what we did

159
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:37,920
wasn't uh approved of appreciated by other people in fact they were discouraged or upset with us and then

160
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,920
we've crashed and there might be a natural kind of feeling of some gladness and sadness

161
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:50,800
that is not so tied to our ego but there might be a lot of it is tied to the ego and so the ego is a fragile

162
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:59,520
thing that can be involved in these swings back and forth and so to begin not just looking at the

163
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:05,920
particular forms of gladness and sadness that we might have but to see how these live in

164
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:14,160
relationship to each other and uh and maybe to begin a feeling deciding that you don't want to live

165
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:20,160
dependent on things that are that are fragile things that swing back and

166
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:27,760
forth from one end to the other you want to find another way of living and so there's gladness and sadness

167
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:33,520
that comes from another way of living we feel glad that we have stability

168
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:38,800
that we're not so pushed around by the opinions of others or

169
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:45,200
fear of rejection of others or that we we're kind of centered and stable here

170
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:51,680
content content just to be present and not needing a lot and that gladness

171
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:58,079
knowing that we're kind of free from a lot of the social drama and games that maybe we were caught up in earlier

172
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:04,480
it can feel like a gladness that doesn't it's not necessarily so much a part of a pendulum or polarity of two different

173
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:11,359
states it can just be cloud itself maybe it's a gladness that comes from relief that i used to be so attached to

174
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:16,400
things and wanting things and spinning out and now i'm not and this new state

175
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,599
is really good and there's a gladness to it or satisfaction in it

176
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:26,800
and then there can be a sadness that is just part of the deep part of human life

177
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:32,640
that is just there because there's been loss there because of change that is so you

178
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:40,400
know that touches us in some deep way there might be sadness that we disappointed ourselves sadness that

179
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:46,960
yes i was in touch with some deeper way of being and integrity and honesty and

180
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:52,000
inner uh goodness and

181
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,400
uh i got distracted or i got afraid and so then i did something

182
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:06,560
that i never would have imagined i ever would have done i heard a friend i lied i did something and

183
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:14,079
and uh and now we're sad and disappointed we hurt someone and that sadness um it's just there

184
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:22,079
because there's been pain pain maybe we cause pain and that's not necessarily a problem

185
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:29,760
in fact it might be a sign of our healthiness that we feel certain kinds of sadness

186
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:35,280
that a life without sadness maybe is not a life that there's a time and place to feel

187
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,320
sad i remember a story i read many years ago about someone who struggled with a lot

188
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:45,440
of sadness and the teacher told this person at some point

189
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:51,920
well be a sad buddha and after many times long period of time

190
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:59,520
trying to sort out and figure out and escape and fix this sadness this little teaching be a sad buddha allowed the

191
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:04,960
person just to relax and say okay this is also a buddhist can be sad so okay i

192
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,320
don't have to fight it or judge myself for it there's time and place for it

193
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:15,760
and uh so just because we're sad doesn't mean that something is wrong

194
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:22,240
it actually can mean that something is right sometimes sadness is a fallow time

195
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:28,079
that some something is being prepared inside of us for a new way of being for a new

196
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:34,079
direction that we're going to go so so a little bit

197
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:39,520
sadness and gladness belongs to the world of evaluation of

198
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:45,599
figuring out the value of something the importance of something so it is a kind of a higher intellectual

199
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:50,880
kind of states than some of the more deeper spiritual states

200
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:56,240
that we can experience but we have to be very careful what we're evaluating what we think is

201
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:03,440
important and and then a foundation

202
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:10,640
for healthy forms of foundation for all forms of sadness and gladness we might experience

203
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:16,400
for buddhists and is what can be called refuge

204
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:24,160
that we have a refuge we have an orientation we have a understanding we have a way of seeing we

205
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:29,200
have a practice that we trust we have a

206
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:35,040
a presence an attentiveness that we trust

207
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:40,640
that we that protects us that informs us that guides us

208
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:48,800
that points us away that shows us there's a way through everything no matter what is going on refuge means

209
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:55,599
there is a way you might not know what the way is but if you practice mindfulness practice

210
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:02,000
meditation just keep practicing living ethically uh the dharma

211
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:09,839
your heart will find a way and so this idea of refuge the ocean of refuge the ocean of stability that's

212
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:16,319
underneath the um the surface waves that come and go and

213
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:23,040
sometimes there's a high wave sometimes a low wave and these are all just a surface manifestation they're important parts of

214
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:30,079
the ocean and and some people will spend wonderful time and difficult times

215
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:36,160
playing and struggling with those waves but there is a deeper place of refuge

216
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:42,640
the foundation for it all and if you remember that you have a refuge if you remember you have

217
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:49,520
you could trust this your practice or trust yourself in a deep way that you don't have to know the way

218
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,720
to know that you'll find your way then you won't have to be so troubled by

219
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:00,240
the waves you can allow the waves to be there you can study them see them carefully

220
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:06,400
learn from them learn which ones are healthy and which are not which are dysfunctional and which are

221
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:12,240
functional um a really important human skill

222
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:18,079
and you can learn to ride the waves you can learn not to identify with the wave so much

223
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:25,119
and and learn to uh trust that there's something deeper here than the waves

224
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:31,838
there's the refuge and there's certain stability a certain

225
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:40,000
home a certain a companion that always follows you along that is there protect you support

226
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,760
you guide you even when you don't know what's supposed to happen you have a refuge

227
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:51,599
and and that refuge can give a lot more clarity

228
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:58,800
and ease around how we navigate and experience the comings and goings of things like

229
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:05,040
sadness and gladness so um

230
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,200
so you might want to look today as you go through your day

231
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:16,960
at the small and large versions of sadness and gladness that come up for you

232
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:25,280
um you know you might not use the word glad gladness very much certain kind of mild joy delight

233
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:31,760
a kind of pleasant aliveness and then sadness can be a whole range of

234
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:37,520
things from depression to still sorrow to sadness

235
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:44,319
so just kind of see how these work for you and can you and without judging yourself and making it worse without the

236
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:49,760
ego coming in and with the swings can you start see it you think that the

237
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:57,280
way that your men this sadness and gladness is this really healthy or does it have a

238
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:03,040
good foundation or is it a foundation kind of fragile and weak and maybe even a little bit

239
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:09,839
diluted like with a lottery ticket for example and spend some time looking that at this

240
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:16,000
but remembering that to do it from this foundation of trust where um

241
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,839
you appreciate it's valuable to learn your spot yourself and be happy that you're learning about

242
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:27,599
yourself trust this learning process more than the judgments oh i'm wrong i

243
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:34,160
shouldn't be this way if you see how you are then you're on the path

244
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:40,160
so study your sadness and gladness and see if they live in relationship to each other like a pendulum

245
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:45,359
or see if there's a kind of a deeper or healthier forms of sadness and gladness

246
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:50,800
which are not a problem or actually healthy to experience appropriate and

247
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:57,839
and are not triggering one the other but that it's part of the richness of life the

248
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:03,040
fullness of life and the depths of life

249
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:08,560
and then can you allow for that maybe that gladness that sadness needs

250
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:14,480
its time with you and you might appreciate very much that's the case can

251
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:20,560
be the case for gladness and the family of glad glad things but you might not appreciate that for

252
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:27,440
sadness there's a time for it go for a walk sit and have tea allow for it

253
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:33,119
and then underneath it all the refuge and if the word refuge doesn't

254
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:39,599
mean something for you maybe what is it that you trust what is a deeper trust

255
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:45,200
wellspring of wellsprings that you can trust that

256
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:50,400
allows you to not be so caught in the waves

257
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:55,280
so thank you and

258
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,880
we'll continue this tomorrow
