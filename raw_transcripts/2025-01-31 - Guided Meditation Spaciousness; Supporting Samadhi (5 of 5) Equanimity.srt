1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:06,759
it's really fun to read these greetings from all over the world welcome everyone

2
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:14,120
welcome to Friday I've really been enjoying this week of practice with you in finding

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:19,320
support for the beautiful Som teachings that Gil has been offering

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:26,599
us and uh also a little bit more time for silent meditation in the morning for

5
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:33,000
Discovery throughout the day to help build the cultivation of this

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,160
practice so uh today one aspect of this

7
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,440
uh of mind that may appear in this cultivation is

8
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:50,520
spaciousness exploring a bit about how spaciousness uh matters in the

9
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:58,399
development of somat or may enter in uh one way that it

10
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:06,320
is uh experienced is giving plenty of room and time for this

11
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,759
development not crowding it with our expectations of what is supposed to

12
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:19,880
happen or when and it you know our expectations and our hurry actually will

13
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:26,920
get in the way it's pretty much guaranteed that expecting something to happen the way you've heard it from

14
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:34,840
someone else um is or or being in some kind of hurry to acquire or attain

15
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:41,439
samadi or the janas or any meditative State uh that pretty much guarantees

16
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:48,360
it's not going to happen because that striving tenses us up and makes it more

17
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:54,280
difficult it's a little bit like sitting a 2-year-old child down to rationally

18
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:59,680
explain why they shouldn't be upset and why they should calm down when they're

19
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,960
in middle of having a tantrum a 2-year-old's brain is not

20
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:11,800
developmentally ready to be rational when they want what they

21
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:19,360
want so when you're doing a cultivation of some it's also a kind of cultivating

22
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:26,440
developmental Readiness in your practice for a collected settled mind

23
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:33,720
and you can't force that development before the mind is ready uh the mind is going through

24
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,239
phases of showing you how it needs to uh

25
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:47,080
be seen the conditioning that may subtly be causing dissatisfaction and suffering

26
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,959
that you haven't yet seen where there's stress where there's resistance the Mind

27
00:02:52,959 --> 00:03:00,000
needs you to see that before it can settle into some

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,360
another way we might think of spaciousness or experience

29
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:13,159
spaciousness is through a physical and a mental sense of just how vast and

30
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:19,799
all-encompassing the mind can be the Mind Body can feel very expansive

31
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:25,400
and receptive to any experience that comes

32
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:31,400
along it's as if the Mind had been like a crowded room there are so many people

33
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:38,680
you could only get a vague sense of them or get to know just a couple of people

34
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:45,159
as contrasted with an empty room where uh you and another you might

35
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:52,920
enter the room and another person might enter and you might be able to see them and get to know them with much more

36
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:59,879
clarity so the key I would say the most important thing of all is not trying to

37
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:04,920
make anything happen instead being present for what

38
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:12,400
shows Itself by paying attention remaining aware or returning to awareness again

39
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,400
and again starting with the breathing in a very clear way not just

40
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:27,600
some vague sense of things but very clearly so with that as a few opening

41
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,120
comments said let's settle

42
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,919
in allowing plenty of time plenty of

43
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:49,039
room for arriving here in the sense of how

44
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:53,720
the body is right now

45
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:12,680
paying attention to what wants to be known and seen in the body

46
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:52,360
time to both allow for relaxation where that can happen and for

47
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,440
softening around or bringing any ease that's

48
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:03,080
possible to any area of of

49
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,080
chronic

50
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:25,319
sensation room for recognition too of how the body is showing

51
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:34,000
us what is happening emotionally perhaps what's going on in the

52
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,639
mind acknowledging

53
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:57,599
it offering all of it perhaps some deeper longer breaths

54
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:14,160
allowing the inhalation to bring energy into the

55
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:22,680
body in the exhalation to release anything that wants to be released

56
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:50,159
and settling into whatever is normal breathing for you right now

57
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:16,560
gently bringing the attention to the arising of the

58
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,639
inhalation following it through the body

59
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,039
allowing any pauses that

60
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:42,880
happen and following the release of the

61
00:08:53,200 --> 00:09:01,160
exhalation noticing how quiet how still the attention can

62
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:08,519
be while following this beautiful cycle of the breath

63
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:51,959
and if it's supportive bringing in counting of the breathing in whatever

64
00:09:51,959 --> 00:10:00,320
way you've discovered helps best to keep you with the breath

65
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:07,519
present with the movement of breathing the

66
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,600
sensations very very softly in the background

67
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,759
the counting as a support

68
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:10,760
allowing such a light touch with all of

69
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:17,440
this that perhaps you can feel the extra

70
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,399
space the room that you have for

71
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,279
it e

72
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:26,360
the breathing arising from ample spaciousness around

73
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,360
us

74
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:40,240
and releasing into that vast

75
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
space

76
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120

receiving what ever is arising

82
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,120
perhaps coming up alongside

83
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:42,160
any else that's showing up for a few

84
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:49,480
moments and gently returning awareness to the

85
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:55,839
breathing to the support in the background of the

86
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:00,839
counting everything can be received

87
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:10,038
everything respected there's plenty of space for it

88
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840

and in the final minutes of the

127
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:06,680
sitting from any

128
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:14,560
Stillness calm

129
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:25,240
Simplicity steadiness spaciousness that's been here

130
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:30,839
with us May there

131
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:37,760
arise nourishment for everyone in this

132
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:44,559
s and for the worlds of people and beings around each of

133
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,720
us may there be

134
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,440
safety May there be health

135
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:07,119
wellbeing may all beings have

136
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:16,160
ease peace freedom from

137
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:26,440
suffering allowing that to arise from the Stillness and flow to all beings around

138
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,480
us e

139
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,359
for

140
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:14,720
there can be a sense of spaciousness in this cultivation when

141
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:22,640
the mind is finally quiet it shows us by contrast how much

142
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:29,318
is usually crowding the mind vying for our attention

143
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:43,760
and with spaciousness can come more equinity there's room for any experience

144
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:52,240
to be received to be understood as things as they've come to be in this

145
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:59,240
moment a natural result of the causes and conditions that preceded

146
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:06,920
and knowing that that can change so we have another opportunity

147
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:14,240
today to notice as we continue to practice and cultivate mindfulness the

148
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:19,880
partner Sati the partner of samadi this mindfulness in daily life

149
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:25,680
can show us when the mind is more relatively more

150
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:32,119
spacious and when the mind is getting constricted or tightened around

151
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:37,680
something we can notice what preceded that state of mind if we check in from

152
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:42,559
time to time during the day with our state of

153
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:50,119
mind just seeing um by paying clear attention we can see that the contracted

154
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:57,280
mind is not the automatic result of a busy schedule it's possible to be quite busy

155
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:03,160
to have a lot to do and maybe you've had the experience at times of settling into

156
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:10,400
a very pleasant state of focus or flow with what you were doing by contrast you may know from

157
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:15,839
experience that there may be a time that you have plenty of time on your hands

158
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:22,200
and yet the mind is still ruminating planning worrying

159
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:28,359
doing active very busy so discovering what actually leads

160
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:34,240
to spaciousness or to contraction is a little bit of a journey

161
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,160
to look forward

162
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:52,200
to having spaciousness in meditation and during

163
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:57,359
the day gives us a little more Breathing Room a little more ability to step back

164
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:03,880
to pause and to receive what's happening with some level of

165
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:11,079
respect it's really helpful to do this in moments when we uh stop during the day and find that the mind is getting

166
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:17,880
constricted or a little too close to something one recommendation I've heard

167
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:23,200
involves uh deliberately introducing more space into

168
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:30,440
meditation or even daily life uh for example if one is stuck on a pain in the

169
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:38,480
body you know feeling really tightened around it and just keep keep coming back to feeling the pain suffering from the

170
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:45,160
pain it's possible to introduce the idea of more space around it so for example

171
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:54,359
think of that pain in the context of the space in the entire building you're sitting in or from a th000 feet above as

172
00:43:54,359 --> 00:44:00,119
though a eagle were flying over and looking at the pain at times when I've

173
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:08,000
really found uh persistent pain difficult I've backed all the way out into space and looked at it it's an

174
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,160
interesting experience to take any thing that we're tightened around and see it

175
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:20,200
from that perspective so today one invitation throughout the day might be to notice

176
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:25,720
stop and notice what the quality of mind is and what preceded

177
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:34,280
that and to feel the effects in the body also uh to continue to check in

178
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:39,319
during the day with any sense of calm with the breathing with any Stillness

179
00:44:39,319 --> 00:44:46,079
within as a support as well and uh there will be again one

180
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:53,960
final 4M silent sitting on zoom and you can find the link on the IMC calendar on

181
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:59,280
the homepage find the zoom link and find the pass password there I just want to

182
