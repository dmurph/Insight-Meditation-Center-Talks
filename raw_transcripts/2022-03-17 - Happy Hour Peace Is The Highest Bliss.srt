1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:07,440
so hello and welcome everyone to happy hour lovely to be together in this space and

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,679
to practice together in community so

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,840
so for today's practice um given what has been happening on the

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,279
international stage the past few weeks um

5
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:31,039
i have been dedicating the sessions of of happy art different practices to

6
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,719
support to support us in in this

7
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,399
new world that we find ourselves with with with the um

8
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:48,719
war zones um and and different practices

9
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:55,120
and for tonight i think the practice that i'd like to bring bring in and support us with is a practice of

10
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:01,120
equanimity equanimity as a support for compassion and equanimity again with a

11
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,400
sense of peace peace sense of um

12
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:14,960
abiding in equanimity arriving to it through calming of the body through the

13
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:21,600
calming of the body the energy body we've worked with in the past couple of times and in a way

14
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,840
continuing that i think maybe calming centering

15
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,320
arriving is really what um what can be really helpful and supported because on top of

16
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,640
that then the practice of compassion can can be more stable

17
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,320
instead of veering into empathetic distress and grief and overwhelm so we

18
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,640
really need a basis a basis of calm base of stability a basis of

19
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,000
groundedness especially when times get rough in the

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,040
world so that's what i would love to invite us to to practice together both

21
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,959
for our own sake whatever is happening in on in our own lives our

22
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:17,280
challenges our bodies or whatever is going on that doesn't stop it just when when

23
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,040
there's more suffering in the world maybe it even intensifies our own suffering our

24
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,200
own individual situations and for all of this we need the basis for happiness can

25
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:36,720
is peace the buddha said peace is the highest bliss

26
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,760
peace is the highest form of happiness and

27
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:52,239
when we first hear that maybe it's a little quizzical because peace perhaps seems so

28
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:59,280
settled you know there's not a lot of happiness or bliss to it seems kind of like peace we think of peace as oh just

29
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,599
peace or as happy is like whoa i want that i want to be happy i want to be yay that's

30
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:11,920
where the juice is um happiness is good it's great not uh

31
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:18,480
bliss is great and yet there is a deep deep

32
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,760
seated sated a deep sated joy

33
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,680
to peace that includes that subsumes

34
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,200
joy bliss is really the highest bliss and we can see that for ourselves

35
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,760
experientially if you if we think about it maybe we don't get it because these things are not

36
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,360
um instead of constantly might have a concept that actually does not really

37
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,920
correspond to the true exploration and and i'll share with you

38
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,239
that from myself having explored this path this meditative path for

39
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,599
for decades now um yes states of joy states of bliss

40
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:17,040
delicious yummy wonderful yay and this states of of peace deep d peace

41
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:24,000
ah the most blissful the happiest state of all so

42
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,479
so given that this is happy hour the states of peace

43
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:38,000
are the epitome i would i would claim of of happiness so

44
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,199
and of course they serve as the basis for

45
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,320
for equanimity for compassion practice for meta

46
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:55,520
for all the good beautiful gifts of the heart comes from peace of course they can lead

47
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,039
to peace also but come out of peace all of these practices are related they

48
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:07,039
connect to each other it's like a cloth you take a thread you pull it the whole

49
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:14,720
cloth is one thread even though she's like oh this is this part of the claw this this part but it's just one

50
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:21,840
thread so so with that let's practice together

51
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:29,199
let's practice being peace let's practice being peace together

52
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:35,520
so arriving arriving in your seat

53
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:44,639
whether you need to move a shift right now to be more comfortable this is the perfect time to do it

54
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,720
moving shifting

55
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,440
perhaps even lying down if that's what your body needs

56
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:08,639
and then arriving arriving in this body landing in this body

57
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,600
here here

58
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,120
can we invite this body this living breathing body

59
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,919
to soften

60
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,560
to let go of any tightness or holding

61
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,400
and also releasing releasing preoccupations and thoughts

62
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,240
worries entanglements

63
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,280
of course we all have lives full complex lives

64
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:39,400
and in this moment bowing to all the complexity

65
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,520
perhaps smiling at it all saying thank you i'm taking a moment of

66
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:56,560
refuge right now entering this temple of my heart

67
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:05,919
entering this temple entering a temple taking refuge

68
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:13,120
in peace for the sake of stability

69
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:20,720
for the sake of groundedness for the sake of myself and all beings whose lives

70
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,879
mind touches directly and indirectly

71
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,800
release release with each breath

72
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:34,040

body

112
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,320
at some point maybe the mind maybe awareness

113
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,919
meets more peace clicks with

114
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:24,880
yeah there is peace there is calm in the middle of the storm

115
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,679
it's here it's always been here

116
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,559
awareness clicks connects

117
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:53,440
and settles more deeply into the still point

118
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:05,799
however small it might be it's here it's always been here

119
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,039
and always will be

120
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:30,720

121
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,840

122

let the body and mind relax the breath ah

123
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:48,960
be the guide a gentle loving

124
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:55,120
gentle loving guide the entirety of the breath

125
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,840
to reconnect

126
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,039
this

127
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:04,200
the still point inside outside expansive

128
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:33,720
still point so expensive space of peace

129
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:43,600
whether or not we're aware of it or connect to it in this moment

130
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:49,159
or as much as we're able to connect with it

131
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:57,440
womb the space of peace is a womb

132
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,679
of equipoise equanimity

133
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:10,399
the risings and passings the comings and goings

134
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:18,519
to ten thousand joys and ten thousand sorrows

135
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:25,399
being breathed being breathed being priest

136
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:56,000
realizing there is so much more you can contain

137
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:03,398
than you've realized being peace

138
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:13,720
the strength the power of peace

139
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,920
and as we bring this practice period to a close

140
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:46,480
knowing that our peace our peace

141
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:55,599
is the biggest gift to ourselves to those in our lives and all beings everywhere

142
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:01,200
offering peace peace

143
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:07,359
starting from within not hatred not ill will

144
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:13,680
but peace love

145
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:20,079
offering our peace this cultivation as our gift

146
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:26,240
to ourselves to others expansively

147
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:36,599
may all beings everywhere have peace

148
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,240

00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:29,040
practice i was leading you was not a practice of open awareness it was a practice of

169
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:36,319
actually bringing the breath into awareness as the energy body calming calming

170
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:42,079
and then um to actually bring peace into your

171
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:47,359
awareness so is it directed it was not open awareness because open awareness is

172
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:53,760
open spacious undirected whatever the wherever awareness goes it goes so these

173
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,800
two practices are different and their point

174
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:04,000
their uh point their their objective is different also

175
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,040
thank you for that question catherine says i was sitting in the

176
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:16,400
garden [Music] being with the sunset and when i was done i felt

177
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:24,560
like flowers i felt the flowers as my friends oh that's sweet i love that the flowers is

178
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:32,240
your friends the flowers is all of our friends thanks for bringing the flowers in catrin i feel them in the space yeah

179
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:39,760
sweet yeah another reflection privately relieving anguish

180
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:45,119
relieving anguish yeah may it be so languish doesn't serve

181
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:51,280
anyone in the world ourselves or anyone else for that matter

182
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:56,880
not in this state to be supportive so i'm glad it's being relieved through

183
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:03,440
this practice ah

184
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:09,920
so so we're feeling pretty quiet so [Music]

185
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:17,920
so before i set up the groups tonight i wanted to say a few words about engaging how to

186
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:24,000
engage in [Music] the the groups in the small groups

187
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,599
especially as there has been some requests to give more guidance more

188
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:36,720
instructions so please consider the breakout groups a

189
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:42,720
sacred space sacred space both for yourself and especially for

190
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:49,040
others is a way to really respect each person's experience

191
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:54,560
so please consider

192
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:59,599
first of all being embodied being embodied it's not a place to talk from

193
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:04,800
your head and just blah blah blah maybe you actually don't say anything and you just

194
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:11,839
hold witness kind compassionate witness for others that's perfectly okay

195
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:17,599
and if you choose to share as you choose to speak please speak from your own

196
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:23,440
experience i me my experience and it's a way of

197
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:28,960
again not trying to impress others not trying to educate others

198
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:35,760
you're just sharing what feels safe and comfortable for you in order for others to hold you witness

199
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:41,359
you're speaking for your own benefit i say it again you're speaking for your

200
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:47,839
own benefit not benefit of anyone else it's a very different way of relating

201
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:53,760
your speaking for your own benefit it's quite revolutionary you're speaking

202
00:43:53,760 --> 00:44:01,359
for your own benefit i'm going to say in one more time you're speaking for your own benefit

203
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:07,440
and you only speak from your own experience not

204
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:13,200
asking questions of others probing others

205
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:18,400
commenting on their experience please don't you're not here to

206
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:24,800
facilitate in small groups or especially if you act in

207
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:30,240
as a therapist or other helping professions please leave

208
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:35,839
that outside leave their profession outside here you're only speaking from

209
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:43,359
your own experience if you wish maybe you're just being silent that's okay but do not reflect do not give

210
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:50,079
advice to one another be very careful in this sacred space

211
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:55,599
it's a very beautiful sacred space of of relating to one another we really learn

212
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:01,520
how we can be different with friends and family and others this is a precious

213
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:07,280
sandbox don't take it as oh yes small groups all right here we go chatting

214
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:13,599
please don't and in fact also be very aware of the time so the

215
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:19,599
format i'd like to suggest from now on is that you don't do a monologue for

216
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:25,920
like two three minutes and then pass on no each person just say one nugget just one nugget

217
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:33,200
and then the next person will say a nugget about their experience and then the next person says something

218
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:40,079
about their experience and then again the first person and then you go around it's a spiral format you go round and

219
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:47,200
round just sharing or and it comes to you you can say pass i'm holding witness tonight and just holding other that's

220
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:52,880
okay just relating in this way a very different way it's not just

221
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:58,960
go chat amongst yourselves so i really want to take time tonight um

222
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:04,400
again you're speaking for your own benefit please do not manage

223
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:09,680
or or facilitate just

224
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:17,040
his spiritual friends a space of spiritual friends and entering with respect entering this temple with two

225
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:22,480
other human beings whose come whose lives are as complex

226
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:29,440
and dear as yours are to you so

227
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:35,760
so having said all of that having said all of that i'm going to

228
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:41,280
create the groups and um

229
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:47,200
take a moment here to do a bit of rearranging

230
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:54,160
arranging okay i think i uh oh wait one more thing i have the groups

231
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:59,680
okay so all right all set i'm going to open

232
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:04,720
uh open the rooms oh no i need to recreate them hold on it's always this

233
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:11,760
always happens numbers change left so meditate with peace meditate with peace

234
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,800
as the counts keep changing okay

235
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:23,839
all right ah so so opening the rooms take care of

236
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:30,400
yourselves and each other here we go everybody's back

237
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:36,559
any reflections you like to share from from this breaking out groups and what

238
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:42,240
it was like especially today with extensive invitations as how to be in the group

239
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:47,839
was it different i wonder in terms of the reflections

240
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:54,559
you're welcome to raise your hand if you want or type in chat

241
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:07,040
raise your zoom hand because if it's your physical hand i may not see it

242
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:13,279
any reflections about the practice about what you discussed

243
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:22,079
short one 30 seconds ah nice nancy says we were all appreciating

244
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:27,280
the silence between sharing beautiful oh i'm so glad there was a lot of silence

245
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,960
nice esther please

246
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:38,480
hi um i appreciated the instructions

247
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:44,319
it helped me to relax actually it helped me to feel like

248
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:49,680
safer and i like i appreciated the framework

249
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:56,000
and i felt that i could open up within that framework

250
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:02,720
beautiful thank you thank you for that reflection appreciate it so feeling safer that can open up great

251
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:06,160
thank you barbara

252
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:15,359
i also appreciated the instruction i think my tendency would be to

253
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:21,839
ask a question and i refrained so there was much more

254
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:26,960
um quiet reflection so it had a different

255
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:32,880
feel to it so great great beautiful thank you for that

256
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,160
and meredith please

257
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:44,400
hi thank you yeah i also i'm an overtalker

258
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:50,960
and um i found the silence comforting

259
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:59,280
great i also found a tiny tad of dialogue with someone extremely helpful

260
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:04,640
nice great but and i appreciate that it seems like the dialogue came out of the silence which

261
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:10,559
is a different way right to have a dialogue yeah beautiful thank you for that

262
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:17,040
reflection yeah thank you all thanks to all of you for the reflections that you share this is very very helpful so i

263
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:22,240
think maybe moving forward always giving more instructions about going into the group

264
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:27,359
and well we're out of time now one last reflection catherine says love the flow

266
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:40,800
so thank you all thank you for your practice being peace for yourself

267
