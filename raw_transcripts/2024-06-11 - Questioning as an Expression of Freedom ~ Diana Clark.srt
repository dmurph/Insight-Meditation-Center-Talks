1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,279
welcome welcome everybody can we turn down the volume just a tiny bit so I

2
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:11,679
don't have to feel like I'm whispering let's see is this better if I

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:18,080
if I'm speaking in my regular voice oh maybe that's a little bit too low I'm sorry Jim this is hard to here we go

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,760
okay great thank

5
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,800
you so tonight I'd like to continue on the topic of question

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,120
that I introduced last week this idea of questioning as a part of

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:44,840
practice I want to expand on that a little bit and talk about how questioning is actually you know in some

8
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:52,399
ways we can consider it an expression of Freedom right to

9
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,800
ask is you know a a sign that we're not

10
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,879
locked in or stuck or um somehow not

11
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:11,000
even realizing that there could be an alternative or if maybe we are in a

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,280
situation where we're just not allowed to ask questions whatever kind of situation that might be people in power

13
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,280
sometimes like this nope don't ask any questions this is the way it

14
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,399
is maybe our parents say something like because I said said

15
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:36,880
so just as the you know rationality you don't get to really ask but

16
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,600
why because I said so and that's enough yeah so this even this whole

17
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,880
notion of be able to ask questions about anything or

18
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:54,640
everything is this uh maybe it's an assertion of a certain amount of Freedom

19
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,039
certainly we don't think about that often we think that we're asking questions just because we want to know

20
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:05,280
the answer but what if we start to think

21
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,400
about it as an expression of freedom and that this path of course is

22
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,560
leading to greater and greater Freedom greater and greater peace and

23
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,000
ease and well-being and it's not like there's no Freedom no Freedom no Freedom then bam

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:31,280
there's Freedom right it's just there's the All Along The Path all along the path is what's near is at the end

25
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,480
there's more and more well-being there's more and more peace there's more and more

26
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,800
freedom as we walk on this path or practice in this

27
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,120
way so naturally there's more and more questions

28
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,159
too and so we can ask big questions sometimes even the fact that

29
00:02:53,159 --> 00:03:00,360
there's big questions is a a sign of Freedom too instead of just the minor ones

30
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,720
uh do the knives go into this drawer or the other drawer you know that's just a

31
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:15,120
minor one but what if we ask questions like what is it that opens the heart and

32
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,400
mind what opens my heart what opens my

33
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:30,680
mind recognizing that greater Freedom comes from like letting go kind of like this opening is this letting out

34
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:39,439
whatever's in there no longer really holding on to and for us to find for ourselves part

35
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:45,879
of this path is every single one of us will have our own flavor our own take is

36
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:52,680
not exactly the same for every person that's part of what Freedom

37
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,400
means each of us will show up wherever we are in our lives bringing whatever we

38
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,720
have with us and so we can ask what is it that opens

39
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:11,000
the heart and mind this is a worthwhile

40
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,759
question for each of us maybe it's obvious maybe it's not

41
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:25,080
obvious maybe we could ask the opposite what closes the heart what closes the

42
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:31,560
mind what is it that creates the conditions in which we kind of like close our heart Hearts maybe we feel

43
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:38,560
hurt maybe we feel threatened feel unsafe in some kind of

44
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:45,360
way or maybe we feel just have a feeling of uh we want

45
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:54,199
to make ourselves feel better so we're going to put somebody else down kind of make that we have the

46
00:04:54,199 --> 00:05:00,280
superiority that's a way that kind of closes our hearts and mind

47
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:11,560
another question we might ask is can we live from Love and

48
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:18,840
wisdom can we have love and wisdom be foundations be a support for our

49
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:26,160
life however we understand love and wisdom for each of us be a little bit

50
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,240
different and I'm sure if I were to ask you a few decades ago what does love

51
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:39,560
mean what does wisdom mean you probably would have a different answer than you have today so this is something that uh

52
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:45,680
like you know shifts as we mature as we have more life experiences and it's

53
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,960
really as we practice more too this whole idea of what is love and

54
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,000
wisdom but this question is can we live from Love and

55
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:05,479
wisdom can we have that animate our life can we have love and wisdom be ways

56
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:10,560
that are like a North star that helps Orient us and the way we respond to what

57
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:19,080
life is bringing us because so often we see around us all

58
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:26,240
the roots of fear or confusion or greed or hostility we see all

59
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,440
that and we also see the suffering that that brings the suffering for ourselves

60
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,240
the suffering for others it's that's just everywhere you just open up a

61
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,280
newspaper just look at your phone it's filled with that kind of stuff that's

62
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:47,360
what the media companies want you to really get anxious about so that you'll

63
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:54,639
do more clicking but maybe what about the roots

64
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:00,759
of love how deep are they how do we

65
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:08,639
understand that can we tap into them can we trust

66
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,759
them how do we know if we can trust them this roots of

67
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:22,120
Love whatever they are like for different as I keep on saying this but I

68
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:30,199
think all of us will have like a little bit different idea what are the roots of love and maybe it's not so clear

69
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:37,599
again maybe we can find it by thinking about the opposite well what's the roots of hatred the opposite of love and we

70
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:45,039
can think about okay hatred often comes from

71
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:52,479
Fear comes from feeling threatened so roots of Love is this

72
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:58,400
sense of settledness this and sense of um

73
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:07,199
softness maybe and then I'm up here talking about

74
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:13,440
you know questioning as part of freedom but you could even ask for yourself well what does freedom mean what does it mean

75
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:20,440
for you what is freedom mean for you I'll just say earlier in my life

76
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:26,919
Freedom certainly meant the the capacity to do is I damn well pleased that was

77
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:32,200
what Freedom was you know kind of like an Inc Ed like just do whatever I want

78
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:42,719
whenever I want and I kind of like organized my life around that you know trying to be able to do whatever I

79
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:49,640
want but now I would say you know Freedom means something a little bit different not a little bit different

80
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:58,120
very different now freedom is more this sense of not being pushed around by what life

81
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:04,240
brings me not feeling like like oh I have to avoid that and I have to avoid this person cuz I don't want to tell

82
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,800
them or I don't want them to tell me about this uh or I don't want to you

83
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,839
know look at that thing because it'll make me upset instead freedom is having

84
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:20,160
the capacity to okay if it hurts my feelings it hurts my feelings it's not

85
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,320
the end of the world if it's sad what I hear it's

86
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,440
sad it doesn't have to be a huge problem it doesn't have to be something that I

87
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,600
or other people have to go way out of their way to

88
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:43,079
avoid so freedom is this you know being able to stand up for what we believe in

89
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:48,880
or what we think is helpful for ourselves and for others taking everybody into

90
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:55,800
account and being willing to do that without having to always be

91
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:02,680
[Music] guarding what's coming guarding ourselves or protecting ourselves from

92
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:09,519
what may come as a response I'm not going to say that I'm completely immune

93
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,880
from you know what other people say and do I'm not but I am much more than I

94
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:21,800
used to be let's say that just this much more sense of steadiness and this sense of being able to feel grounded and

95
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:27,200
connected and standing upright like okay yeah I'm here and I'm not going to get

96
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,880
pushed around as much and I like this capacity to open my

97
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,519
heart to so many things that before would have made me feel uncomfortable and felt like oh I have to

98
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:44,360
avoid situations I've never been in there before uh it makes me uncomfortable oh that person's really

99
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,920
different than me no instead now like okay I think let's see what let's see

100
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:58,440
what it's like I can hold this and if it's painful I I can hold that too

101
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,320
so we might sometimes in this uh practice we have these questions um less

102
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,360
so in this particular lineage but uh it's um it's definitely in there and I

103
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,680
have had uh dma teachers give me this kind of like instruction like pointing

104
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:26,519
me this particular direction at a certain place in practice so there can be this question

105
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:32,120
of uh who am I and then when you first ask that there's

106
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:40,360
all the obvious stuff that happens well then you just ask again and again and again and again and again and

107
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,839
again and then it starts to be a little bit

108
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:52,480
slippery who am I or sometimes something like this or what is

109
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,000
this and again the I I'm saying again because I talked about this last week

110
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,160
the purpose of questioning is not so much that we absolutely find the

111
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:10,399
answers isn't like a quiz or an exam or something like that it's more for us to

112
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:18,079
just adopt a stance an attitude of openness and

113
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,800
listening as opposed to you know when you feel like you have all the answers it doesn't matter what anybody else says

114
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,680
you feel like you have the answers you're not going to listen to what anybody else says when you know the

115
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,800
truth but this idea of questioning so what is

116
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:42,120
this as a question is can be a part of a practice can be like dropped in usually

117
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,680
during uh when after the mind has uh settled some bit some people do it as

118
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:54,680
part of their daily life just throughout their day just dropping in this question what is

119
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:59,920
this and kind of like feeling their way into the answer

120
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:08,440
like leading with the heart what is this and then the having the heart answer instead of the mind if that make sense

121
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:16,639
it's a different way than if you were taking an exam nobody's going to be grading you

122
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,839
this it's just an

123
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:28,160
exploration so we kind when we find ourselves lost in this story that we're

124
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:34,560
telling about somebody else or about ourselves I'm a great person because XYZ

125
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:41,320
I'm a terrible person because of ABC that person's great or terrible because of lement

126
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:48,720
op we can if we remember we could ask who is it that's telling these stories

127
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,800
and there's a way kind of like who is it you kind of like looking behind like who's telling these

128
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:00,600
stories and see if it's you can find the Storyteller

129
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:07,240
so these questions can be a way this um in our practice as a this

130
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:14,000
inquiry into is there a this Gore self

131
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,959
this Essence that's at the center of everything making it happen and telling

132
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:26,920
the stories asking the questions is there and you can just

133
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:31,040
investigate it can be a really fruit

134
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:37,480
practice and as I mentioned last week this idea of

135
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,600
Investigation is the second factor of the seven factors of Awakening so it's

136
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:48,720
definitely part of this path it's not just some that you do on the

137
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,680
side it's definitely a part of this movement towards greater

138
00:14:55,079 --> 00:15:01,920
Awakening it's also an antidote to doubt if you feel like yourself hesitating or

139
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:08,440
vacillating like I'm not sure I don't know I don't know about this practice I don't know about this

140
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:15,880
teacher I don't know about these teachings what what who is this Buddha

141
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:22,040
person investigate ask

142
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,600
questions read dramaa books listen to Dharma talks ask teachers ask other

143
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,319
people who have a practice or ask people who don't have a

144
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:41,680
practice but also there's a way that this this the

145
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:47,839
activity of asking is maybe it's such an integral part of practice even if we

146
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:54,000
don't say it explicitly because this practice is asking us to adopt an

147
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,560
attitude of listening adopt an attitude or a stance

148
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:07,720
maybe of openness and receptivity and that's a big part of

149
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:14,319
what questioning is about is just being open to hearing something

150
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:23,440
new being open to being surprised open to learning something open to realize

151
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:30,639
Oh I thought it was that way but maybe it's not

152
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,000
I thought I was I was always sad I've been feeling

153
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,319
sad for months now I'm trying to meditate so that I'll feel better

154
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:48,199
perfectly legitimate way to or a reason to meditate but you might discover with

155
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:54,399
meditation maybe there's lots of moments that are perfectly neutral there's no

156
00:16:54,399 --> 00:17:00,040
sadness it's just neutral or maybe you even find that

157
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:07,959
there's little moments of happiness or Joy or senses of well-being or

158
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:13,880
contentment and then you start to realize oh yeah I'm sad a lot but

159
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:21,480
there's also these moments of happiness or Clarity or ease or whatever it might

160
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:27,520
be and then we slowly start to rewrite kind of like our narratives oh yeah

161
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:35,240
instead of I'm always sad can be like oh yeah sadness arises a lot maybe that's

162
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:43,039
very different than saying I'm always sad it's such a different feeling instead of like identifying and

163
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:48,559
saying this is sadness is something that's always uh present for me we can

164
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:55,120
say yep sadness is present sometimes sometimes it's perfectly

165
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,200
neutral and maybe even boring

166
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,400
and so when we sit to meditate it isn't so much that we're trying to make

167
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,799
something happen we're not trying to have some particular

168
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:20,679
experience we can't make those happen all of us I think have tried I certainly

169
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:26,679
tried I didn't quite understand meditation in the beginning and I thought like okay something you know

170
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:35,200
fantastic is supposed to happen and then I just was kind of like huffing and puffing and straining and I just made

171
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,880
myself really tight and tense and didn't like meditating

172
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:48,480
anymore so it's not so much that we're trying to make anything happen instead that we're trying to listen or to what's

173
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,640
happening here in this body and mind what's this

174
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:59,400
experience being open to it being receptive to it noticing it in the same

175
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:06,400
way that's like uh asking a question and so when we're meditating

176
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,720
we're have this maybe this receptivity as opposed to this idea that we're just

177
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:17,919
trying to confirm something that we already know and there can be a way when we meditate we just feel like we just

178
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:23,200
have to check the box okay I meditated today and there can be a subtle way in

179
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,440
which we are like okay I know it's like this at the beginning of the sit and

180
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:35,080
then maybe after 10 minutes the Mind settles down it's like this okay

181
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:40,200
done but instead we maybe this kind of like this attitude like well what is

182
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:46,480
this what is going on is this is a way forward with

183
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:55,240
practice a meditation practice and there is this way that

184
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,880
um you know all these practices and this teachings are offered with this uh

185
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,240
invitation to like see if this matches your own experience as opposed to saying

186
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:14,039
like Okay this is how it is and you have to believe it and and go off and believe it instead

187
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:21,039
there's a real invitation okay is this is this true for you does this make sense for

188
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:29,720
you and uh some of you may be familiar with this expression easo which uh translates as come and

189
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:36,360
see so it's not like a go and believe it's more like a come and see is it is

190
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:41,000
it this for you does this make sense for

191
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:52,039
you and so there was a it is a number of years ago when I had to

192
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:57,080
um log into an account for something had to do with a IMC and this account was

193
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:02,520
shared by a few people and uh when they we were all sharing

194
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:10,039
this account and when they uh gave me the password the password was eh Paso

195
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:17,279
and I thought oh yes this is like such a great uh way like not only this come and

196
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:22,320
see but it also showed how important this was for the person who set up this

197
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:29,279
account you like this this basic tenant of an invitation

198
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:36,240
to welcome what's uh what's arising and maybe bringing some curiosity to it

199
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:43,760
rather than this idea that we know it already and so in this way we might even

200
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:49,880
understand that to see for ourselves that is to come and

201
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:56,320
seeo is the Dara is the

202
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,840
Dharma there's this way we kind of think like okay the Dharma is out there there are some of these teachings they're

203
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:07,279
written down in this poly Canon and you know all this stuff that we can have

204
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:13,960
about it but the Dharma and maybe there's one way we could understand the Dharma that way is

205
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:20,880
the teachings of the Buddha but really the Dharma is only exists when human

206
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,039
beings are interacting with it or expressing

207
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:32,720
it if it's not some abstract thing that just uh exists independent out there as

208
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,039
much as it's something that when we are walking the

209
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:43,320
path that's the Dharma and this gets pointed to in the

210
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:51,080
suit does in fact when the um Dharma is described as visible Here and

211
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:56,360
Now immediate inviting to be seen for

212
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:03,559
oneself onward leading and to be personally

213
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:08,840
realized by the wise it's a definition of the Dharma

214
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,880
that we find Visible Here and Now immediate so immediate like something

215
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:19,760
that we can experience tangible I mean maybe it's tangible like

216
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:25,520
this or maybe it's an experience we have in our mind or heart but an inviting to

217
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:32,720
be seen for oneself and onward leading I love this this is

218
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:39,559
kind of like you know invites all of us will have a little bit different or maybe really different expression of it

219
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:47,000
or experience of it something that uh we each discover as

220
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:55,520
we kind like move along this path towards greater and greater Freedom so then we might ask okay Diana

221
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,640
if this uh questioning is an expression of Freedom you might say but I don't

222
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:08,000
feel very free or you might say I don't ask questions so we could ask what blocks

223
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:17,200
questions like what gets in the way of questioning and one is this inner critic

224
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:24,039
that can arise that it can really like show up and then when the inner critic is um

225
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:29,440
active and being believed it's asking questions but it's not questions that

226
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:36,039
are helpful instead there's this uh question is like am I getting this right there's

227
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:41,760
this real concern like this feeling like oh whatever I'm doing is wrong and am I

228
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:48,039
getting this right it's there's one way we could ask that question like I'm not sure if this

229
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:55,440
is um the way forward but there when it's kind of like being asked again and again underneath that is the sense of if

230
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:02,640
I'm doing it it must be wrong so this question am I doing this right or there might be this inner

231
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:09,679
critic might be saying something like well who am I to question like surely you know everybody

232
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:16,720
knows better than I do like I'm who am I to question I don't know enough or I

233
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:23,919
haven't practiced enough who am I to question and then that kind of like

234
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:30,720
implicit in that is the sense of comparing ourselves to others and have the sense like well maybe somebody else

235
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,760
has the right to question but I don't and that's just the inner

236
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:43,760
critic that's just to Inner critic this uh aspect of our experience that shows

237
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,919
up on occasion and likes to kind of like squash us or make us feel inadequate in

238
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:54,360
some kind of way we don't have to believe it we do give it Authority but

239
00:25:54,360 --> 00:26:01,960
we don't have to believe it and that is a whole practice in it self how to work with the inner critic but it does Black

240
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:07,200
Block our questioning it does kind of like get in

241
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:13,399
the way and make us feel like no I can't question can't question the teachings

242
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:19,320
can't question my experience I even can't question the questioner who is

243
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:26,399
this what is this there's another reason why like

244
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:34,200
there what kind what can get in the way of questioning what can block questioning is that in some ways our

245
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:40,159
culture or Society doesn't really support it in some ways in America we

246
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:45,520
like to think that okay we're fiercely independent and we are all about

247
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:52,480
freedom and we have this sense we have a real pioneering Spirit we're going to like go and discover new things that's

248
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,640
all true and there's a way in which there's

249
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:04,720
also we clearly get the message don't question the media often wants to have

250
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,960
this like okay let us tell you how it is it's like this this and

251
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:15,320
this I don't want to demonize the media but some of it is you know has that has

252
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:22,200
that sense of like okay you know we're just going to tell you what you need to know and you if you don't know what it

253
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,880
is if you if you have questions you don't need to know the answers to those questions just listen to us we'll tell

254
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:34,640
you and please pay more or there's leaders who don't want

255
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,840
us to question leaders of Institutions you know whatever institution you want

256
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:46,559
to think of especially you know the really large institutions there's often the leaders don't want us to question so

257
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:52,279
there's this way in which our society kind of like really promotes the sense

258
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:59,000
of passivity promotes this sense of kind of like let's just consume

259
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,279
information and not question it let's consume the stuff let it affect us let

260
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:10,840
it impact us and not question it which isn't

261
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:17,519
healthy all of us needs to you know bring some of our own

262
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:25,080
um sense of what's appropriate and our own sense of what

263
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:30,679
is right and wrong and these types of things I'm not saying that we can't

264
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:37,679
believe anything of course not some things we have to take on faith we have

265
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:44,240
if people that we trust or say this or something like that but there are some things that we

266
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:50,320
should question if something's like wait that doesn't make sense then maybe there's this uh piece

267
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:56,360
of the story that we don't have or if there's a sense of like well if somebody

268
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:02,279
says oh um the reason why you don't understand it is because this institution over there they don't want

269
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:07,720
you to understand well these people here I don't want you to understand they're

270
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:12,320
just blaming it on somebody else or something like

271
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:19,799
this and so another reason why maybe we don't um block our like what blocks our

272
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:25,399
questioning or what blocks our questions is we like to have

273
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:32,840
answers it feels comforting like okay I know the answer I understand

274
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:40,279
this this makes sense to me I don't have to worry about it I got

275
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:47,240
it there's a certain amount of comfort in that and it's 100% appropriate to do that with some things and for other

276
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:53,440
things to question and that's part of the art of practice and I would say that's the art of you know having a rich

277
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:59,799
Life Is Knowing okay which things to question and which things not to question

278
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:06,360
because the truth is I mean we don't know the future we don't I mean we know

279
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:14,039
the likelihood that certain things will happen but we don't know exactly the future that's going to

280
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:24,278
happen and so there's this story that uh in the suas about this person

281
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:32,720
Malia and uh he goes up to the Buddha and he says I'm I'm going to disrobe unless you answer my

282
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,919
questions and he um he said and and you unless you

283
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:44,399
answer my metaphysical questions including the questions of what happens after a person

284
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:50,080
dies and the budha said I never promised that I was going to answer all your

285
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:56,919
questions why are you threatening me that you're going to disrobe I didn't promise you that all your questions would be

286
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:03,600
answered and so the he the Buddha kind of says okay disrobe if you want you know I I'm not going to answer all your

287
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:09,159
questions and specifically he didn't answer some of Malia's metaphysical

288
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:16,919
questions including like what happens after a person dies and the budha said that uh he

289
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:22,440
didn't want to answer them because it wouldn't be beneficial it wouldn't uh

290
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:29,919
lead to peace or Insight or Awakening just to know what happens after a person dies

291
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:36,519
it's so way that like then that person would just kind of like be passively accepting information and there's no way

292
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:44,159
to know whether what the Buddha said would be true or not like what there's no way

293
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:50,960
to put an end to questioning because then what was happen if somebody's if the Buddha were to say

294
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:58,919
well this is precisely what happens after you die like well how does the Buddha

295
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:06,360
no well cuz that's different than what somebody else said over here so it doesn't put an end to the

296
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:13,039
questioning and so then uh the Buddha gave a simil to malapa

297
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:18,760
saying a person is uh injured by an arrow they get shot by an arrow and then

298
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:25,960
the uh other people see this and they go and call a doctor and the doctor comes and they're going to remove the arrow

299
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:31,360
from this person and then the person who is I imagine in

300
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:39,480
tremendous pain says no no no wait before you remove the arrow I'd like to know who

301
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:44,960
shot the arrow where do they live what is their

302
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:51,000
name and then and about the arrow what type of Arrow Head does it have is it

303
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,600
made out of rock or is it made out of stone or to ask what kind of feather is

304
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:02,279
on the Arrow is it from this this type of bird or that type of bird and the shaft of their arrow is it you know it

305
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:07,600
goes on and on all these ridiculous questions meanwhile he has an arrow sticking in him and he's bleeding and

306
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:15,278
he's in terrible pain and so the Buddha is pointing to

307
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:21,919
saying they we that if we are busy like asking these types of questions there's

308
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:28,159
no end to some of these metaphysical things and instead we're still suffer

309
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:34,880
suffering while we're kind of asking these questions that aren't going to lead to the ending of

310
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:42,399
suffering so can we put our questions to a way that's going to lead to mors freedom I mean to ask a question is

311
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:49,480
freedom but can the type of questions we ask lead to even greater and greater

312
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:58,360
Freedom so what are some questions that we can ask

313
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:06,799
what is it that's being clung to if we're experiencing discomfort

314
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:13,720
dissatisfaction suffering Duca whether it's really mild or

315
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:19,158
really is terrible we can ask what is it that's

316
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:25,320
being clung to what am I clinging to what's being held on

317
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:32,480
to and so this requires there's a distinction between like there's the pain of what life brings you then arrow

318
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:38,638
for example but then there's often what the Mind adds on top of it oh I have to

319
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:46,398
figure all these things out about the arrow or just wait until um I'm Healed again I

320
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:52,359
got to go and get revenge on this person or whatever it might

321
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:58,520
be all the story making that we do that perpetuates or and amplifies the

322
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:06,000
discomfort those stories are revolved around a certain amount of clinging clinging to ideas clinging to

323
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,000
views going into like what uh ourselves like how we should be treated or how we

324
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,480
should not be treated I'm not saying that these things are not important they

325
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:22,760
are but is there a way that we can notice how we're clinging to some things

326
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:29,119
that just bring more suffering that's a question we can ask ask ourselves what is it that's being

327
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:35,200
clung to and then we could ask where does this clinging come

328
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:41,760
from is there a belief that's underneath it this belief that in order to be safe

329
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:49,440
I have to cling on to an idea of myself or in order to feel more comfortable I

330
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:58,200
have to kind of it dogmatically hold on to certain beliefs and not be open to

331
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,000
maybe learning something new having new

332
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:08,880
ideas the questions we can ask ourselves are what are the conditions that support

333
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,319
the arising of more freedom what is it when do I feel more

334
00:36:14,319 --> 00:36:21,240
or less ease and peace and E and freedom and what are the conditions and where I

335
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:29,200
feel the most well-being and peace and ease and what are the conditions in which I feel the least

336
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:37,839
can I organize my life can I create conditions in my life so that I feel more and more peace and

337
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:44,599
ease this idea that conditions are so important we know that um of course it

338
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:50,000
only rains when there's rain clouds of course it doesn't rain when

339
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,560
there aren't rain clouds if we rain only arises when

340
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:04,280
there's the conditions for it suffering only arises when there's the conditions for

341
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:11,280
it so questions to ask ourselves are what are the conditions that support the arising of more

342
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:18,200
freedom that's kind of a clunky way of saying what just to be sensitive to

343
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:25,040
where is there more suffering less suffering more freedom less freedom and some of you might recognize

344
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:32,800
that part of this is the for Noble Truth this recog that what's being clung to is what leads to suffering the

345
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:38,599
opposite of Freedom so this idea of questioning as

346
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:43,880
an expression of freedom and questioning as a way to lead

347
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:49,200
to more freedom and as an integral part of our

348
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,920
path both as a stance as a attitude of being receptive and

349
00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:02,280
open and also of a way to kind of like um highlight when we're really tight and

350
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:10,760
constricted and not being receptive so questioning as as an also

351
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:17,200
as an alternative of just believing but instead for all of us to find for

352
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:23,720
ourselves find discover for ourselves where there's more suffering and where there's more

353
00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:33,078
freedom and I'll end there and open it up to see if there are any

354
00:38:53,319 --> 00:39:00,560
questions Diana so I'll I'll ask say something when you were towards the

355
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:08,680
beginning of your talk I was thinking about a phrase that I've heard people use from time to time about don't go

356
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:18,040
there and I realize that that's in some ways could be very skillful or very

357
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:23,319
unskillful so I just wanted to yes like this idea of like don't go don't go

358
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:30,160
there is like don't ask questions don't go there is that what you mean like yeah yeah yeah and in what ways would that be

359
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:37,440
really skillful to say don't go there well all of the questions that you're talking about that there are some

360
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:44,760
things that are just you know you're not going to get it's not going to get away from

361
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:51,119
suffering or it's just gonna wind you around the

362
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:57,640
axle I like that expression thank you Jim so like the questions of like well what kind of bird did the feather on

363
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:05,480
this Arrow come from like don't go there don't waste your time without those types of things yeah yeah thank you yeah

364
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:13,079
one of the things I was think I just got a text from one of my um College friends

365
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:19,520
yesterday and I was thinking about when we he and I were roommates one of the big arguments was like who is the best

366
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:25,280
rock [Applause] band who's better Superman or Batman or

367
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:32,359
you know these types of things yeah great great thank you

368
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:45,839
Jim thanks Diana I've been listening a lot repeatedly to a talk on courage and

369
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:53,599
you talked about how safety can lead to investigation or

370
00:40:53,599 --> 00:41:00,760
fear can prevent investigation and those always seem external to me

371
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:07,400
like I have to wait for fear to go away or safety to come so I really like focusing on Courage is it's empowering

372
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:14,640
and it's like I can investigate even in the presence of fear or without feeling safety yeah very nice very

373
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:22,040
nice yeah we could even like investigate well what is courage what does courage feel like what does Fear feel like and

374
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:27,440
that's a way that can that's a way of kind of like turning towards what's uh

375
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:35,240
we don't want to turn towards often fear yeah thank you thank you for kind of making that connection

376
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:48,200
there okay so thank you all and I wish you a wonderful rest of the evening

377
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,359
thank you
