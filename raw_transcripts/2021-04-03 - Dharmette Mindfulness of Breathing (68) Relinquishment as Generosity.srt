1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:07,919
so

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:14,799
we come in this series of talks to the

3
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,199
consider the final step of anapanasati

4
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,279
the 16th step of mindfulness of

5
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,600
breathing

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,640
and the way it's worded

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,199
in english the most common translation

8
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,039
into english

9
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,280
is something like

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,920
observing

11
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,960
relinquishment one trains

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,559
i will breathe in observing

13
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,440
relinquishment

14
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,000
one trains i will breathe out

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,199
this word relinquishment

16
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,400
that translates a pali word

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,400
patini saga

18
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,240
s s p-a-t-i-n-i-s-s-a gga

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,080
that has a double meaning

20
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,720
it means a kind of letting go

21
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,640
relinquishment

22
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,439
and it also means generosity to give

23
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,799
and in some contexts in the

24
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,280
teachings of the buddha it clearly means

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,640
being generous

26
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,720
and now just that's so nice this passage

27
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,360
i'll read it to you

28
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,840
and

29
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,399
so a noble disciple

30
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,560
someone who has come now towards the to

31
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,398
the end of this 16 steps

32
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,000
noble disciples recollect

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,080
consider their own generosity like this

34
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,080
it is truly my good fortune

35
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,160
and gain that in a world of people

36
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,280
obsessed with greed

37
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,720
i dwell freely generous

38
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,720
open-handed

39
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,239
delighting in giving devoted to charity

40
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,480
delighting and giving and sharing

41
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,680
and the expression delighting in giving

42
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,200
the word giving is the same word as this

43
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,840
final step in anapanasati of

44
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,720
relinquishment

45
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,720
so there is a

46
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,959
letting go a deep letting go that's

47
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,959
almost an act of

48
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,080
choice if

49
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,720
now if you review these last four steps

50
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,120
of anapanasati

51
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,800
is that as we settle in having gotten

52
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,480
concentrated and quiet and still

53
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,760
then we come to a stage where

54
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,560
it just feels the best just to not be

55
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,680
working meditation anymore

56
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,680
we don't have to work and we just settle

57
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,040
back and just observe

58
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,959
we're observing we're kind of like in

59
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,319
the process of life

60
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,760
the flow of life and we're just

61
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,920
observing the transiency and the

62
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,440
changing nature of

63
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,879
moment-to-moment experience

64
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,680
and now there's a fading away of

65
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,159
clinging and greed and wanting

66
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,159
and that fading away happens up to the

67
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,480
point where

68
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,239
the greed and the hatred that we have

69
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,760
seizes and stops and wow

70
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,000
to have a qualitatively high experience

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,840
of the stopping of these unhealthy

72
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,680
movements of the mind

73
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,319
and heart and wow this is good this is

74
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,480
right this is health this is freedom

75
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,640
and inner psychological freedom and

76
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,759
and then knowing that seeing that having

77
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,919
wisdom about that

78
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,040
then saying i'm i would like to be done

79
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,160
with this

80
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,560
i no longer want to invest in these

81
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,320
kinds of ways of being i don't

82
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,960
no longer believe in them i no longer

83
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,000
stand behind

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,680
being greedy or hateful or resentful or

85
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,560
complaining

86
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,000
or jealous or

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,360
or you know having any kind of annoyance

88
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,520
or hostility that i'm keep getting

89
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,880
living in cynicism and

90
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,040
um and uh and not we don't do it

91
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,040
punitively it's not like we feel bad

92
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,479
about ourselves

93
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,840
but now we know something much better

94
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,400
and so we're letting go of what is

95
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,800
unwholesome

96
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,440
and and if you look carefully read

97
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,680
carefully the teachings of the buddha he

98
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,039
when he talks about what we let go of

99
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,199
it doesn't talk about letting go of

100
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,479
things so much

101
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,360
hardly at all or if at all like we don't

102
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:21,919
let go

103
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,280
of our material wealth or

104
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,880
let go of our friendships our

105
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,600
relationships what we're letting go of

106
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,680
what we're relinquishing

107
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,000
our inner psychological states

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,880
things inside of us and they're clearly

109
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,080
the ones

110
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,720
that harm us what the buddha calls

111
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,000
unwholesome or unskillful

112
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,360
and he says that explicitly in one place

113
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,840
he says um

114
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,240
if one if when one

115
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,600
gives away something

116
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,800
unwholesome mental qualities grow and

117
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,400
wholesome mental qualities

118
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,759
waste away then i say one should not

119
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,639
give away

120
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,280
in this way and the word giving away

121
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,160
here

122
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,560
is that word relinquishment so uh

123
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,840
so they would give captures the idea

124
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,240
that it's an act of generosity

125
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,120
and so i'll read it a different way if

126
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,600
one

127
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,960
relinquishes anything

128
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,280
and then unwholesome mental qualities

129
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,400
grow and wholesome mental qualities

130
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,080
waste away then i say

131
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,639
one should not relinquish in this way

132
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,440
but if one gives away if one

133
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,120
relinquishes

134
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,160
something and unwholesome mental

135
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,880
qualities

136
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,840
waste away and wholesome mental

137
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,360
qualities grow

138
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,160
then i say one should give away one

139
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,599
should relinquish

140
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,000
in this way so this is not blind

141
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,840
relinquishment it's not the blind

142
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,759
letting go of something just but

143
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,199
we hear they're supposed to let go let

144
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,880
go of everything

145
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,919
it's really we're letting go of that

146
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,840
which

147
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,759
interferes with our betterment

148
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,840
interferes with the best qualities we

149
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,039
have

150
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,880
we're letting go so that the better

151
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,479
qualities of who we are

152
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,080
can come forth and we have a much

153
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,000
clearer sense of what those are

154
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,680
and what gets in the way well the

155
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,840
obstructions

156
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,960
when we get quiet and peaceful

157
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,280
now one of the most wonderful meditation

158
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,440
instructions that i received

159
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,720
many years ago from this wonderful

160
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,039
english beku monk named arjan amaro

161
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,400
and he said something like

162
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,440
set yourself at ease

163
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,520
and then notice what takes you away from

164
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,280
that

165
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,720
and that was the instruction no 16

166
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,440
stages

167
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,120
that's so complicated so just recognize

168
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,720
set yourself at ease and i think i

169
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,039
understood that to be whatever modicum

170
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,080
of ease that's

171
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,599
accessible just if it's the simplest

172
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:22,240
kind of just

173
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,199
softening and relaxing but then the

174
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,120
important part the wisdom part

175
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,879
is to notice what takes you away from

176
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,240
that

177
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,440
and then consider is it really worth it

178
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,800
is it really for your betterment to

179
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,560
lose whatever the ease you have

180
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,919
it's through that then through then

181
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,480
deepening the ease pushing the ease

182
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,720
deepening that ease deepening these

183
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,040
coming to more ease and more ease

184
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,200
we get better and better recognition

185
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,000
of the goodness that's here within us to

186
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,680
be better recognition of

187
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,399
when there's an unwholesome direction

188
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,160
and when there's a wholesome direction

189
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,760
that we're going

190
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,839
when it's for our betterment or for the

191
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,320
opposite

192
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,560
and so we come to hear the lasting last

193
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,240
stage of anapanasati

194
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,519
there is a real real deep relinquishment

195
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,480
now

196
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,760
where something we're really ready

197
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,040
to put something down

198
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,720
and and be done with something enough of

199
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,880
this already

200
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,200
and even though we can't necessarily

201
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,000
stop

202
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,080
certain mental habits that we have or

203
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,600
tendencies we have

204
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,320
it's a powerful movement to have made an

205
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,279
inner choice

206
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,000
inner turning and say i no longer stand

207
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
behind this

208
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,839
i no longer believe in this kind of

209
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,000
behavior

210
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,959
and we can do that without any aversion

211
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,080
hostility

212
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,880
feeling better about ourselves we can do

213
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,600
it with joy

214
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,399
delighting in this word relinquishment

215
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,079
delighting in it

216
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,079
that now i'm going to move in a good

217
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,839
direction just no i know there's a

218
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,519
better direction

219
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,040
and to know that deeply is one of the

220
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,040
great gifts of this practice

221
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,519
great gifts of life and uh and to be

222
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,000
inspiring

223
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,079
so rather than seeing our for inner

224
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,440
foibles and

225
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,079
inner you know old habits coming back

226
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:26,800
and feeling

227
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,079
depressed or upset by it there can be a

228
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,000
stance a recognition oh here

229
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,079
it is again and now i get to practice

230
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,160
this is what this practice i know what

231
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,000
practice is about now

232
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,240
the practice i know i'm going to there's

233
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,839
a direction amount of direction

234
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,120
on a movement on a journey to really i

235
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,720
know what freedom is i know

236
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,920
what this is not where it's at and now i

237
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,760
have an opportunity to practice with

238
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,440
this

239
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,800
and that is a fortunate thing anyone who

240
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,839
has the practice

241
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,640
has good fortune anyone who has a

242
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,680
practice

243
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,240
is involved in a path of great goodness

244
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,399
and benefit

245
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,480
and so to celebrate and delight in the

246
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,480
fact you ever practice

247
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,600
more than being upset by the fact that

248
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,399
one more time you got angry or irritated

249
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,360
or

250
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,560
greedy or something just keep

251
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,839
turning it over to appreciating it and

252
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,920
looking for the generosity and the

253
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,040
goodness and the delight

254
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,920
in the possibility of on being on a path

255
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,399
of

256
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,880
liberation or freedom of letting go

257
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,320
and so no matter where you are on these

258
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,399
stages of anapanasati these 16 stages

259
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,160
each step in the way is good for itself

260
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,079
is good enough in fact the ancient

261
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,440
commentaries

262
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,399
said that each step of the 16 can be a

263
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,639
complete step in itself they

264
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,959
they contain within each step contains

265
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,440
within itself

266
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,480
the path to all 16 or

267
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,959
so if you stayed at the first step of

268
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,160
just breathing in long

269
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,560
knowing you're breathing in long the

270
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,000
other 15 steps kind of will follow along

271
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,920
as you really settle in and just do that

272
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,200
one get concentrated doing that

273
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,720
but it doesn't matter just the fact that

274
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,800
you're whatever your stage you're at

275
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,560
that's the right place for you that's a

276
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,000
good place

277
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,760
and that's where your delight and

278
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,040
pleasure and

279
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,639
joy can be that uh you're so fortunate

280
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,800
you have a path you this is your step

281
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,079
now this is

282
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,519
your movement your ability to practice

283
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,279
and the further you go the more you'll

284
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,519
understand what's wholesome

285
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,000
the more you understand what's wholesome

286
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,480
the more with generosity the lighting

287
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,079
and generosity

288
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:00,240
you can give away give up

289
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,320
the unwholesome and i use these words

290
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:04,639
like

291
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,120
the give up in the kind of original

292
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,880
apparently meaning of the word

293
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,040
which is to offer something up on an

294
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,399
altar

295
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,880
or the original meaning of sacrifice to

296
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,680
make sacred

297
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,040
or the original word of surrender

298
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,720
then the latin i think maybe in the

299
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,800
french as well the roots of the word

300
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,000
is to also to to give

301
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,680
something give up

302
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,279
so um so that's his

303
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,399
uh we've come now to the end of these 16

304
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,440
steps and

305
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,360
this the discourse on anapanasati has

306
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,760
further things to say about this and

307
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,680
what is most interesting for me about

308
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,720
the next

309
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,600
kind of instructions of this uh six

310
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,600
after the 16 steps

311
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,760
is how um the fruit of the practice the

312
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,519
liberation of the practice

313
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,560
becomes more and more the

314
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,680
the basis for the practice and how

315
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,560
liberation becomes a basis for practice

316
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,360
is the topic for next week so

317
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,120
so thank you for all this

318
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,000
and i can take a little bit of time

319
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,639
for taking some questions if you'd like

320
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,399
and

321
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,399
anything really but if you'd like to ask

322
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,600
me 16 steps or anything about this

323
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,839
i will try to do my best to track the

324
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,959
questions if they come

325
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,839
and

326
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,000
any additional

327
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,240
advice on how anapanasati can be

328
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,519
practiced in a relaxed

329
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,120
open way without turning it into a

330
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,959
linear checklist

331
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,199
i'm i'm turning this as i sit

332
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,959
great yeah i think that every meditation

333
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,639
practice we do

334
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,959
all these funny habits of the mind will

335
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,160
come in and

336
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,480
kind of take over and sometimes the

337
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,399
practice starts becoming mechanical

338
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,040
sometimes maybe a linear checklist where

339
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,320
am i

340
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,279
and don't be discouraged by this but

341
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,839
learn to recognize it

342
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,040
and then figure out a way to not do it

343
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,240
and sometimes i've done some

344
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,320
similar things like and i've just kind

345
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,759
of backed off

346
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,279
and i just gone back to the very

347
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,040
beginning or um

348
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,680
just just come back and just not try to

349
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,320
do the practice of anapanasati and

350
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,600
just open my awareness and

351
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,800
then my kind of my

352
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,920
my my one of my kind of

353
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,360
great default for practicing

354
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,360
when you know it seems like nothing's

355
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,800
really working

356
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,440
is uh to tell myself the word here

357
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,120
h-e-r-e

358
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,759
and just say here and it's uh not a

359
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,600
command like to a dog

360
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,920
it's just the recognition i'm here and i

361
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,959
say the word

362
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,279
and then i open my attention to just

363
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,040
recognize what is here

364
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,800
and sometimes what i recognize is my

365
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,240
mind is out of control and

366
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,279
spinning around oh here this is what it

367
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,279
feels like to have a spinning mind

368
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,240
here this is what it's like to be upset

369
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:30,639
here

370
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,320
this is what's like to be agitated

371
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,240
and it's a gen there's a generosity in

372
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,440
that here

373
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,519
in that and that opening oh this is what

374
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,480
it's like

375
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,800
nothing has to be any different it's

376
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,519
just a

377
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,240
clear recognition of this and i'll do

378
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,440
that for a while

379
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,040
and then at some point things settle

380
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,480
down or

381
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,480
if i got a mechanical or a checklist

382
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,839
approach to practice

383
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,160
then i can kind of i've stopped doing it

384
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:05,839
and then i can start fresh again

385
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,839
okay

386
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,799
it's a lot of thank yous i appreciate

387
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,039
them it's very nice

388
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,279
and

389
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,559
is it to be expected that grief would

390
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,840
come with disenchantment

391
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,000
ah no it's not to be expected

392
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,400
but it's pretty common and so i think we

393
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,440
should just

394
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,200
um that sometimes when we do this

395
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,960
practice we realize

396
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,039
that even when we let go of things we

397
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,400
know are unhealthy

398
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,679
there can be a grief too for the going

399
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,120
away of something that's been our

400
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,919
companion for a long time or

401
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,919
or there's a grief around what we lost

402
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,080
because we were caught up so long in

403
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,320
some unhealthy way of being and we have

404
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,160
to grieve first before we can really

405
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,320
move on

406
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,320
um there was a psychologist who did a

407
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,840
lot of this practice

408
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,880
and uh his his take on all this is that

409
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,280
the path to liberation is one continuous

410
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,360
process of grieving

411
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,360
so it might have been true for him it

412
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,280
hasn't been true for me and but

413
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,679
but grief is definitely can be an

414
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,000
important part of this whole process and

415
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,880
it's not to be

416
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,440
pushed away or feel like it's

417
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,600
unfortunate to have grieving

418
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,280
and i did give a talk last sunday on

419
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,520
grief sunday morning talk here so

420
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,919
i talked about liberating grief that

421
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,200
might intrigue you if you didn't hear

422
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,760
the talk

423
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,240
to hear it

424
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:11,679
the folds and the unfolding yeah

425
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,600
what is the source of the excerpt you

426
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,919
read about generosity today

427
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,480
it's um

428
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,640
it's a it's a

429
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,000
now my own translation so it's all i

430
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,919
have here is a reference it's from the

431
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,960
numerical discourses of the buddha

432
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:39,840
chapter 6 suita number 25.

433
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,840
this

434
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,559
it's very nice to read all these little

435
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,120
comments and thank yous and

436
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,120
and uh it's really a wonderful thing to

437
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,840
share this

438
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,480
path and this practice together with all

439
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:21,840
of us here

440
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,720
grief arises in unexpected times yeah

441
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,960
for sure

442
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,039
i think some some i've heard teachers

443
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,799
say that

444
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,480
if you don't uh if you haven't had a

445
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,559
good cry

446
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,559
you're probably not really on the path

447
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,400
to liberation

448
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,000
at some point or other it does not all

449
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,559
the time but

450
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,400
can you please clarify again the

451
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,080
relationship between 16 steps of our

452
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,520
practice of the cushion

453
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,799
as well as while meditating yeah well

454
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,760
that's a good question

455
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,880
i generally don't think about too much

456
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,159
about the 16 steps

457
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,080
in daily life i do i spend a lot of time

458
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,840
because i spent you know much of my

459
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,080
adult life meditating on my breathing

460
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:18,880
and

461
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,200
and it's kind of been the kind of the

462
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,000
foundation of my meditation practice

463
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,600
that um it uh it spills over into daily

464
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,120
life where i'm

465
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,320
frequently kind of attentive to my

466
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,360
breathing or

467
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,360
include my breathing whatever i'm doing

468
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,679
and awareness of it and

469
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,480
and so it's been a great gift in my

470
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,520
daily life to

471
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,480
track and watch my breathing when my

472
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,320
breathing gets held or tight or

473
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,039
constricted

474
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,120
and how it shifts and changes and

475
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,240
sometimes

476
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,000
it's the first indication i have that

477
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,520
i've gotten caught or stuck

478
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,880
or reactive or hot and something

479
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,480
and so uh just being familiar with the

480
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,280
breathing and

481
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,520
connected to it and then being able to

482
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,400
come back and

483
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,240
and uh relax their breath and have an

484
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,080
ease full breath as i go through my

485
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,039
daily life has been beneficial in many

486
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,320
many ways

487
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,559
and whether i'm on any particular step

488
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,760
of anapanasati in daily life

489
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:27,039
i don't really think about so much

490
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:31,279
it's the 16-step open awareness

491
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,840
some people might experience open

492
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,080
awareness with the 16 steps

493
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,400
but i wouldn't want to identify the two

494
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,440
together

495
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,720
because um letting go

496
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,840
the deepest letting go we do is just a

497
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,760
phenomenal absence

498
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,280
and to give it any kind of

499
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,080
description that it is something even

500
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,880
something like open awareness

501
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,600
just little bit diminishes it or misses

502
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,559
the point a little bit

503
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,799
oh what is the poly word you said at the

504
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,240
beginning meaning

505
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,000
generosity so the the word there's uh

506
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,120
there's a three different poly words

507
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,799
that mean both

508
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,120
letting go or relinquishment translators

509
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,559
often translate all three of them as

510
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:23,840
relinquishment

511
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,840
but also mean generosity and

512
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,840
and the one for that that's uh this

513
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,919
sixteenth step of panasati

514
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,039
is patini saga

515
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,400
n p-a-t-i-n-i s s a g h g g

516
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,840
a and then there's chaga c

517
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,600
long a g a and then there's vo saga v

518
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,360
o s s a g g a and so it's a wonderful

519
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,080
thing you see

520
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,200
this that this is the close association

521
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,400
in poly with

522
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,640
letting go and generosity

523
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,000
okay so this is wonderful so i need to

524
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,120
stop

525
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,480
and uh thank you all and and

526
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,760
we'll continue this

527
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,559
exploration of anapanasati in context of

528
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,080
liberation

529
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,200
next week and i look forward to it and

530
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,640
and also i maybe i mentioned this but uh

531
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,679
i'm teaching two retreats coming up that

532
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:26,000
are

533
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,559
not part of imc it might be interesting

534
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:29,039
