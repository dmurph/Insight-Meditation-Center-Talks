00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,920
hello and thank you for being part of this 7

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:13,759
a.m. practice session with your participating with your interest in your

3
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,360
practice at

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:25,320
uh everyone's appreciated as being part of this wonderful effort

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,759
at exploring our life through the lens of mindfulness

6
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:37,620
and these 10 Reflections we're doing this these two weeks for me they

7
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,920
[Music] are founded on or based on our capacity

8
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:50,520
to be mindfully present here and now in our direct experience and in a sense the it's a

9
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:57,399
followup for the long series on introduction to mindfulness mindfulness

10
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:03,120
part two that we did this a.m. from the beginning of the year until just about I

11
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,720
guess April or so and

12
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:15,320
um and so with a foundation of mindful

13
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:22,799
attention Foundation of awareness there's a

14
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:30,520
softening of our clinging our resistance our

15
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:37,240
attachments are fixations there's a softening and lightening up and there's

16
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,320
a lightening a lightning lightning up

17
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,880
becoming lighter and in the lightness of

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,680
our presence and the softening of our

19
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,759
presence there is it's easier for the heart to respond

20
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:07,159
the heart to register and be responsive our hearts are designed our

21
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:13,319
emotional hearts are designed to be responsive and shift and

22
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:19,120
change with the circumstances around us this morning there was an article about

23
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:27,720
how anger prevents the dilation of I guess the arteries and veins of the

24
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:34,200
heart and it's a detrimental to the heart in the same way the softening the

25
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,560
relaxing of mindfulness uh probably helps with

26
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:46,120
dilation makes things easier so this softening of the

27
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:52,080
heart this responsibity of the heart gives rise

28
00:02:52,080 --> 00:03:01,040
to a greater sense of care or empathy or sense of being connected

29
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:08,480
to ourselves in a heartfelt way and to others and so from this mindfulness

30
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,400
practice there can be born four different forms of love maybe more than

31
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:22,599
that four different ways of caring and these are called

32
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:30,879
the in the tradition they're called sometimes the in English the Divine abodes there there's something quite

33
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:36,560
phenomenally valuable about a human being and so some English speakers like

34
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,720
to call them Divine it's a translation of the word

35
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:48,000
Brahma and um and these are uh

36
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:57,200
friendliness kindness Good Will as the first the second is

37
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:05,560
compassion or a certain kind of um empathic concern for the suffering

38
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:11,000
of others the third is uh often translated

39
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:19,759
as sympathetic Joy appreciative Joy a kind of sharing in the success and

40
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:26,120
happiness of others and the fifth is um profound

41
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:32,600
equin form of love called equinity quid imity love love which is

42
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:41,320
not easily rattled a love which is not easily um swinging to dismay or anger or

43
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:50,680
hopelessness or despair or or kind of fear rush to

44
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:57,520
action but has a wisdom the oversight the overview of the situation to stay

45
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:05,360
balanced and clear and and loving but not

46
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:15,720
reactive so to bring our mindfulness to open to

47
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:21,120
mindfulness to the softness or the lightness of

48
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,599
being and see if there can be one of these four

49
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,800
that can flow through the mindfulness with the

50
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,960
mindfulness so to assume a meditation

51
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:53,319
posture and if you're familiar with meditation it's meditated for a while

52
00:05:53,319 --> 00:06:00,479
then to close your eyes and maybe feel the homecoming

53
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,960
coming of the posture the familiarity of the

54
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:14,199
posture occasionally maybe you feel the goodness of being in this meditation

55
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,520
posture that assuming the posture has associations

56
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:29,080
has has uh its own Dynamic that begins bringing us into

57
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,400
contact with our body and

58
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,880
ourselves and if you haven't gently closing your

59
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,639
eyes and taking some gentle deeper

60
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:57,720

and then letting your breathing return to normal on the

65
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,560
exhale relaxing the muscles of the

66
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:54,159
face and as you relax notice on the

67
00:07:54,159 --> 00:08:01,240
inhale how it is to feel and sense those muscles of the face

68
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:27,400
on the exhale relaxing the shoulders softening in the

69
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:34,519

and then as we come to the end of this

126
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:21,039
sitting sometimes mindfulness leads us to a Simplicity of

127
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:28,320
being a simple almost contentment with just sitting and breathing

128
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:38,679
we not much else is needed we're not being driven by the future or the past

129
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:45,080
or responsibilities or desires aversions

130
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:52,000
regrets just simp we feel the value of a simple

131
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
being here alive present

132
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:07,799
that might not feel like anything

133
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:17,480
dramatic however maybe it can be

134
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:29,559
characterized maybe in a matter of degrees but it can be characterized by an absence of ill will

135
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,640
an absence of

136
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,398
hostility an absence

137
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:52,159
of objectifying others as the object of our desires of some kind expectations

138
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,159
demands judgments

139
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:07,518
the absence of reactivity tendency to judge or

140
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:14,760
criticize the Simplicity of being of simple

141
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:20,399
presence can be characterized by something phenomenally

142
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:27,960
important the absence of these difficult States harmful states of mind

143
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:42,720
that maybe have something in common with our human heartfelt capacity

144
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:48,559
for love for kindness

145
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:58,880
compassion joy in others and even in even minded men

146
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:06,960
an impartiality and may this Simplicity of

147
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,799
being this freedom of

148
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,519
mindfulness may it be a channel for all our good will for others our

149

[Music]

155
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,919
free thank [Music]

156
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:30,880
you for

157
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,080
so hello

158
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:25,519
and and welcome to this eighth uh discussion of the eighth

159
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:31,960
reflection and these are reflecting

160
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:38,080
on things that are invaluable for the development and

161
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:44,360
growth of our spiritual life or if you to prefer rather than the word spiritual

162
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:51,320
maybe our heart life the fullness of our

163
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:59,159
hearts and um so today's topic is kinship and it goes along with uh

164
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:05,000
yesterday's topic of community and um Community has a lot to

165
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,960
do with the relationships we have with people the feeling of belonging connection the feeling of friendliness

166
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:18,279
with people so it has a little bit more to do with u Dynamics and

167
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:24,960
relationships kinship as I understand it involves something deeper than our

168
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:31,320
relationships it's a way in which our hearts seeks others it's the way in which we feel

169
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:39,120
that we're family and um I was surprised when I was probably I

170
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:45,919
was 18 when um I went back to meet some of my aunts

171
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:54,320
and uncles I hadn't I'd grown up with them a little bit but it was the first time I was maybe close to being an

172
00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:02,960
adult and um and one of my aunts um made it clear in some way or other

173
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:08,000
that uh we were family that had a deeper Roots than

174
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,480
whether there was we were friends or we liked each other or there was just kind

175
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:19,679
of a raw basic acceptance of each other because we're a

176
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,720
family and um uh it may be a kinship you

177
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:29,919
know a family ship and and I was struck by that and

178
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:36,800
and uh reflected on that and that stayed with me uh in the probably the first 10

179
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:43,200
years of doing Buddhist practice as it slowly grew this sense that uh there

180
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:51,118
could be this kinship this family feeling for everyone that we're all kin we're all

181
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:57,960
family sometimes I Delight in the the thought that yes if we we can probably

182
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:06,560
all of us if we could trace our lineage our ancestral lineage backwards in time that uh we would all

183
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:12,520
converge someplace if nowhere else maybe um maybe a million years ago in the

184
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:20,800
plains of Africa and um and we would um we all

185
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:27,079
have a common Origins we all part of the same family and we know that this human race

186
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:35,839
of ours is phenomenally effective at creating division phenomenally effective at at uh

187
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:41,280
creating alienation and separation and and very strong boundaries between

188
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:49,400
inside and outside and those who belong and those who don't belong those who are part of my family my tribe my Village my

189
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:55,560
nation whatever it might be and we make it so strongly that the other sometimes

190
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:00,640
gets demonized sometimes gets treated is less than

191
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:12,720
human and um and uh the cost of that is a kind of um

192
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:19,040
separation from ourselves a kind of truncation a a limiting of ourselves

193
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:25,480
because if we see others uh as others radical others as

194
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:31,000
distinct from us as separate from us as being belonging to some other category

195
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,119
than us whether it's other family or tribe or Village or Nation or ethnicity

196
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:43,599
or race or whatever that um it limits our capacity to be whole limits our capacity to let

197
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:49,599
all our faculties be open and receptive and and take take in the humanity of

198
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:55,599
others and so these divisions we live in become divisions that we carry inside of

199
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:02,119
ourselves and part of the uh the the influence that mindfulness

200
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:11,400
has meditation has is uh beginning to uh soften and then dissolve these

201
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:17,520
divisions that we carry with inside ourselves these divisions that come with

202
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:23,200
ill will hatred judgment bias

203
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:28,280
Prejudice um selfishness um the kind of selfishness

204
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:34,119
which is collective selfish for my family selfish for my Village my

205
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:40,400
people and um those begin to dissolve and if they don't

206
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:45,640
dissolve uh there's a lot of there's there's maybe subconsciously or not

207
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:53,160
quite recognized a lot of pain there's unresolved work there's there's um uh

208
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:58,280
and sometimes this can be very dramatic sometimes they involved a deep

209
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:05,119
alienation from all people some people carry around with them a a Perpetual

210
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:13,319
anger hostility even um uh resentment towards all people

211
00:38:13,319 --> 00:38:20,319
anybody they encounter or huge categories of people uh sometimes it's towards certain

212
00:38:20,319 --> 00:38:28,560
genders sexual orientations ethnicities um uh races

213
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:35,960
um all kinds of ways in which it's carried within us and

214
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:44,319
um and uh and it can really break people it can really be a lifetime of being

215
00:38:44,319 --> 00:38:52,359
kind of a broken heart or be alienated from oneself even and so as we do mindfulness

216
00:38:52,359 --> 00:38:59,160
practice we start feeling the impact the cost the the hurt of living in a divided

217
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:05,720
world living in divisiveness and I've known people who have done this practice and at some

218
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:11,160
point after many years um were able to put down their resentment towards indivi

219
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:19,079
certain individuals after many years and uh saw through the

220
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:25,119
inherited uh bias Prejudice racism that they'd grown up

221
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:32,599
with and uh and I've known people who have changed dramatically from how they grew up

222
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:37,920
because they saw through how painful that was for themselves to carry this

223
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,160
divisiveness they have and so to heal this and part of

224
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:49,760
that movement of heal this is to discover what I call uh our Universal

225
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:55,319
kinship with everyone and I like the idea that we're discovering we're all

226
00:39:55,319 --> 00:40:01,319
family and even people that have we've never met before in some way we can meet

227
00:40:01,319 --> 00:40:08,079
them as if as if we're family uh it had a huge impact for me

228
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:14,000
many years ago the first time I met this Buddhist monk named Yanda he's dead now

229
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,800
but he was a a Burmese monk who was um first came to live in in the Bay Area

230
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:26,119
San Francisco in San Francisco to teach this basic mindfulness practice that I learned in

231
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:31,200
Burma so so uh before I went to Burma I'd heard about him I called him up on

232
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:38,440
the phone and asked him if I could come see him and just kind of prepare to go to Burma and he said yes please come and

233
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:45,680
I went to his house which was also his Temple then and um and what blew me away

234
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:53,480
what kind of was a a little bit life-changing for me I never met this person but when he opened the door I had

235
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:59,160
the very distinct feeling that he was his friendliness his warmth his

236
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:04,880
receptivity to me was as if he was meeting an a long lost friend he was

237
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:12,400
just so delighted and receptive and to have this feeling of someone I didn't know treating me with such a kinship

238
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:18,079
such a warmth such a POS opened a whole world to possibility for me of how not

239
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:25,079
so much that I could be the same way which it did but it um May me more

240
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:33,079
important um that it was possible to drop the divisiveness the separation the

241
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:38,760
US versus them the and for me it was a lot to do with fear fear of others fear

242
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:45,400
of opening up that it was possible not to live that way and so as I continue with my

243
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:50,880
mindfulness practice the mindfulness practice kind of folded in this

244
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:56,480
possibility that yes this fear that I carried for others fear of rejection

245
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:02,079
fear of failure fear all kinds of things didn't have to be there the sense of uh

246
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:07,280
separation from others and treating others with uh certain kind of kind of

247
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:13,000
uh well separation or just difference and keeping my

248
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,160
distance didn't have to be there and so something began softening and opening in

249
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:26,359
me and uh and over time uh the sense of kinship grew and grew and grew for me

250
00:42:26,359 --> 00:42:32,480
and I would say that that is a very important guiding principle for me or

251
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:39,640
feeling for me the sense of kinship with people and uh and I like to feel

252
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:45,040
it I Delight going to the supermarket to see if there's an opportunity with a

253
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:51,319
checkout clerk to just have a little bit more human contact to look them you know

254
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:58,040
at them look them in their eye to ask how they're doing or have some simple conversation where

255
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:03,880
feeling some contact that's deeper than just a casual hello and often for me

256
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:08,920
that happens in you know not that I'm staring at people but some kind of

257
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:15,319
recognition that happens in the eyes meet that sometimes happens to me when I

258
00:43:15,319 --> 00:43:22,520
see certain mammals in the eye something profound happens to

259
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:29,119
me uh for um excuse me for a moment

260
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:37,880
something profound happens to me in u the feeling of

261
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:43,800
kinship so what is your sense of kinship what is your sense of

262
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:52,040
nonkinship do you have a k sense of kinship that's bounded by a certain community that only for them do you have

263
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:58,520
that and if that's the case what gets in the way of having that sense of kinship

264
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:03,599
be wider than the community that for whom it's easy for you do you understand

265
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:09,400
you know what are the Dynamics in you that create division in our

266
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:14,640
society social divisions between you and the people who are not in that Circle of

267
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:21,599
kinship and what is it for you to have some sense of universal kinship allowing that there are

268
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:29,640
distinctions between how we love and care for and and are friendly with people who are different Circles of

269
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:35,160
community for us in our lives there are differences but what about a universal

270
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:44,880
kinship where we love we care for we respect we value um all people as kin in

271
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:51,319
such a way that we do not create live by the artificial barriers that we

272
00:44:51,319 --> 00:44:59,040
contribute to keep uh people out of our hearts away from our hearts

273
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:06,079
so I hope you appreciate that this might point to the how kinship might be a

274
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:12,680
universal human need and characteristic and how does it for you how does it work

275
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:20,680
for you and and so that's the reflection for these next 24 hours and um and maybe

276
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:28,960
you can see that there's a connection between your sense of kinship and your capacity to love

277
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,599
so thank you very much
