1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,839
so hello [Music] hello and welcome to your sangha it's

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:11,679
good to see you good to be with you to practice together

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:22,000
so for today's theme of practice i'd like to invite us to consider

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:31,359
meta loving-kindness friendliness in the form of appreciation

5
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,879
for ourselves

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:44,640
you know normally being human we go through our lives

7
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,879
and given our evolutionary

8
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:57,280
heritage we tend to focus on what is not going

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:04,320
well what is a problem what is negative especially about ourselves

10
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,680
um [Music] what is wrong with our body

11
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:16,560
you know if our body is not the right shape size if it's not functioning

12
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:24,320
the right way if it's not healthy or our habits of mind our behavior our likes

13
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:31,280
our dislikes we often focus on what isn't going well

14
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:38,000
you know we spend so much more time doing that than to actually stop and

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,079
appreciate wow this body this body this human body

16
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,479
this human body is serving me this this this person who is me

17
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:59,200
and um so the invitation and and there's of course there's the reasons for that

18
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,759
as i was mentioning are not necessarily great reasons but really convincing and

19
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,360
good reasons because as we have evolved

20
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:18,800
those ancestors who have passed on their genes they were the ones who were watching out

21
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,239
looking for dangers and what's wrong in the environment those are the ones who

22
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:31,200
survived those are the ones who survived and managed to pass down their genes

23
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,120
but the ones who focused on the positive and didn't

24
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,959
and and focused on maybe the berries and and what was positive in the environment and

25
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:49,360
not what was scary and challenging the the wooly mammoth etc they didn't live to pass down their

26
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:56,160
genes so those are the genes we have we have the ones from the anxious ones from the ones who focus on what's

27
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,519
not going well what's not going right what's scary what's dangerous what's

28
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,800
unpleasant in the environment so knowing that

29
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:13,599
to bring to bring balance to bring balance by cultivating appreciation for the good

30
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:21,760
because the more we appreciate the good the wholesome the what's what's good about us the more we

31
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:28,239
expand the more we expand our capacity for resilience

32
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:35,519
to take in the good and to also withstand what is challenging what is difficult the waves the

33
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:42,879
the um both the waves of life as well as the

34
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,560
tornadoes of life you know whatever met what other metaphor you like to use

35
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,319
um we can better withstand if we open up if we cultivate

36
00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:03,519
turning our minds to what is wholesome what is good to increase our

37
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,799
stability our resilience that's one way to think about it

38
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:17,199
but i want to bring in another perspective tonight and that is um

39
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,240
something that really touched me actually i was i think i've shared many times with you

40
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,600
here that um i have an interest

41
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,199
in many reports that people share people who have clinically died

42
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:43,600
and what's called near-death experiences and and there are books written on this and various research studies on this and

43
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:50,560
recently and again who knows who knows not to take it as a word of faith these are just personal

44
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,759
accounts and and yet they can serve as inspiration

45
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:01,360
they can serve as inspiration so as a way of inspiration not to

46
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:08,000
to set you know truth that it's one way or the other i was recently listening watching

47
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,800
actually on youtube i can share the pointer later and neil can send it to the google groups

48
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:22,960
it was a man who who had an experience like that he flatlined in in the er and one experience

49
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,000
they were sharing uh it's quite touching they said

50
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,520
but as they were you know from the corner of the er room as they're being operated on as

51
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,720
they looked down their body for the first time ever in

52
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,960
their life they felt appreciation for who they had been

53
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,560
for who this person was for the very first time they appreciated this person

54
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,680
who was them for the first time they appreciated

55
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,440
this body that had served them through their lives

56
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,720
and is so touching to have that perspective to take on for us to take on

57
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,120
that radical perspective of appreciation we don't have to have an

58
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,720
accident in order to take that perspective on for us to open us up

59
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:28,400
to this different way of seeing ourselves different way of seeing life our bodies not the habitual way

60
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:36,000
and also it is said that the closest way to have in in in the experience is

61
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,120
through meditation we can actually access so many of these insights through

62
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,639
actually taking them on playing them

63
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,720
on for size taking them on and just trying them on for size so

64
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:59,680
so this is the invitation for tonight too as if we were looking at ourselves

65
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:07,360
from a perspective from a third person perspective as if you're looking down at this body

66
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:13,840
like wow can we appreciate this person who is me

67
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:21,360
can we appreciate this body that has served us as well as it has possibly been able to

68
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,440
so i've talked plenty tonight that is the

69
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:35,599
frame for our practice together so so with that i'd like to invite us

70
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,599
to land in our bodies to arrive

71
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,919
arriving settling embracing

72
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:06,000
as if for the first as if for the last time greeting this body

73
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:16,319
not taking it for granted this impermanent body of ours

74
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:24,319
this gift that is ours and not ours we haven't

75
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,280
chosen it just a miracle

76
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,279

can our heart open to appreciation to this being

128
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:33,120
who whom we wear up to a moment ago

129
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:40,720
this imagined scenario

130
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:47,600
we are no longer we once were

131
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:53,520
we appreciate this person this being

132
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:03,760

for having lived this life for having gone through the labyrinth of this life as best they could

136
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:51,840
from this perspective can we appreciate this body just as it was

137
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:09,158
doing its best this mind this heart

138
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:57,278
can we love can we love non-judgmentally accepting

139
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,400
appreciating non-judgmentally wholeheartedly

140
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:21,919
given the chance to be this person who is me given the chance to be this person again

141
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:29,759
can we be kinder gentler more loving accepting

142
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,400
more at peace

143
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,840
with this person who is me

144
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:20,039
may i love and accept myself just as i am

145
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,320
may i hold myself with kindness

146
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,960
may i love and accept myself

147
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:43,080

care and acceptance

150
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:30,960
life is uncertain who knows what can happen at any moment

151
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:37,960
we may stop being this person who is us in this moment

152
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:46,158
can we love and appreciate this being just

153
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,279
as it is

154
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,840
understanding all the challenges

155
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,679
aspirations

156
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,000
and hold some intentions

157
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:21,360
the remaining minutes see what's needed would it be helpful to

158
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:27,519
revisit the perspective of seeing yourself

159
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:33,039
down below it's a firm corner of the room person

160
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:38,799
that you once wear does that bring up

161
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:46,279
appreciation love compassion

162
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:10,720
the person you have the chance to be to once be

163
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,638
and no longer can't be

164
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,598
or is it helpful to come back perhaps after this

165
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,560
experiment in thought

166
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:38,960
ah feel yourself here in this body

167
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,838

and your life

170
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:26,040
for the last moments of this practice

171
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:35,119
letting go or whatever arose or did not arise

172
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,838
it's all okay appreciating your wholesome intention

173
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:50,280
appreciating yourself your practice showing up

174
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:04,000
and relishing the goodness trusting the goodness of your practice

177

182
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:06,400
some of you at least this practice

183
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:15,119
proved emotional to take this perspective um or challenging it's all okay it's all

184
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:20,960
okay and would love to hear what came up for you

185
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:27,440
so much more i can say but i like to open the floor you can raise your hands

186
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:33,599
especially if you haven't shared in a while would love to hear from you

187
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:42,320
and um and you can also type in chat if you type to me individually i won't

188
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:47,680
read your name just your comment and if you type it to everyone i will

189
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,838
read both your name and the reflection

190
00:38:52,960 --> 00:39:00,480
don says you are on fire awesome thank you accepting myself is difficult

191
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:07,520
i really appreciate when you said that i did not choose myself yeah

192
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,880
thank you for that don yes we do not choose ourselves isn't that

193
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:19,760
interesting this life is such a mystery we take ourselves so personally

194
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:26,560
all the time and yet so much of who we are is not personal

195
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:32,720
isn't that wild and yet to take that perspective that it's not

196
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:38,800
personal it doesn't come easily right we need to sit practice in these

197
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:46,480
creative ways for to really it's not personal

198
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:52,720
and yet it seems so personal both fred please

199
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:59,599
i'm afraid what i'm going to ask is going to be just too personal to me but i'm going to ask

200
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:07,280
it anyway since i have the opportunity so for the last month i've had this

201
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:14,640
really vaccine tinnitus ringing in my ears after a fall

202
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:21,599
and it's very difficult to concentrate during meditation

203
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:27,440
it's very difficult to include the ringing in the experience

204
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:34,079
more difficult than you know a pain somewhere else and

205
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:40,480
i'm i'm also exhausted because i'm not sleeping and i wonder if you can just

206
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,759
if you have any advice to me about how i might be able to

207
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:51,359
um proceed yeah yeah thank you fred thanks for

208
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:57,440
bringing this up um and this is not the first time

209
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:03,520
of course that i hear of of something that that of of this condition of

210
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:08,079
tinnitus so um

211
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:16,720
and know of other people who have worked with it actually specifically with mindfulness as a way to work with it so

212
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:24,319
so here's the invitation i have for you fred and others who work with tinnitus or or or other

213
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:31,599
say pains in the body like this which seem distracting uh disruptive

214
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:38,720
i would invite you to to investigate with curiosity with openness

215
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:46,839
with interest if there is an attitude if there's an underlying attitude

216
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:54,960
of aversion towards this because it really is the aversion

217
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:02,880
that makes that that hooks it in place and makes it very difficult to work with at the time when

218
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:08,000
you see the aversion when you work through the layers of a version when it

219
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:15,200
can be held as just another sound just another ache just another thing

220
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:20,400
just that that's the moment that it will lose its power

221
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:26,720
so my intuition my invitation to to explore if there are

222
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:32,720
either gross levels or sudden level subtle levels of aversion and pushing it

223
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:41,520
away they're very gross levels there you go fred then that's it that's exactly it

224
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:48,079
so working with it gently and if the moment comes if the question

225
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:53,200
comes when the question when the question comes that can i be okay

226
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:58,480
can i be at peace if this never goes away if it's just

227
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:04,960
here and the answer comes back yes then that's the moment that you have

228
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:13,319
freedom it will not bother you anymore you may not even notice it after that

229
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:19,839
well that sounds wonderful but actually getting there sounds i i don't actually

230
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:25,359
perceive the course the course is

231
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:31,119
little by little can i be okay with this just as it is in this moment

232
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:37,040
the answer might come back no okay then can i be okay with not being okay

233
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:42,880
with this can i be okay with not liking this evolution yeah i i can accept that

234
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:48,880
i'm hating this right now so what just acceptance whatever you can accept

235
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,920
will accept that and little by little it will um

236
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:59,359
[Music] dissolve the the the or rather you'll go through

237
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:06,720
layers and layers of acceptance little by little so start where you are can you accept that you're hating it right now

238
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:12,640
oh yes good if you can accept that get relaxed into yeah i can accept that i don't hate

239
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:18,160
myself for hating it no i accept it if you're there great that's the place

240
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:24,400
to start see if you can relax into yep i don't like it

241
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,920
ah can i accept that start there see feel the ease in your

242
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:36,079
body and use that as a starting point to unwind

243
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:40,799
okay thank you you're so welcome fred

244
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,920
uh one more reflection from christine please

245
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:53,760
and this needs to be quicker before we go into rooms please christine oh

246
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:59,680
quicker i don't know about quicker okay then bring it on

247
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:06,480
yeah i this meditation was highly appropriate to something that i was thinking about

248
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,520
today which is that when i uh

249
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:19,119
really see how much i have suffered in my life for the

250
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:26,160
self-hatred that i've lived with um i feel so overwhelmed with regret and

251
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:34,400
grief that i just can hardly breathe i mean i just like that just hum how much i've lost

252
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:40,319
and i just and not appreciating myself and i

253
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:46,560
i just don't and it's so huge this regret i and i and i just don't and

254
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,839
i don't know what to do with it

255
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:58,880
yeah yeah thank you christine it's

256
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:03,920
to grieve what to do with it to grieve to grieve it's okay you don't have to

257
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:10,880
push it away to grieve to just grieve make space for it can you love yourself

258
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:17,520
and it grieve have to be one or the other

259
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:22,720
it's okay to grieve without kicking yourself

260
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:28,960
can you grieve and love yourself because what i'm hearing is that in the grief is a lot of kicking yourself

261
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:34,079
can you grieve and love yourself does that

262
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:41,640
does that make sense what i'm the shift i'm suggesting yeah say you're not

263
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:48,079
and if you want to say something again i see your lips moving but i do oh okay yeah

264
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:54,839
um can you hear me now yeah yeah i think the kicking myself

265
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:59,920
is um why why did i do that

266
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:05,040
how how come how how come i couldn't have done it differently there is no

267
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:12,000
point my dear in kicking yourself it's it's as you know is throwing perfectly good moments after

268
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,440
moments that are gone so see if you can grieve and love yourself

269
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,800
i think that's the shift so i'm going to leave that with you as a koan and you can come back

270
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:29,359
to it later if need be okay thank you so i'm going to create the room there's

271
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:34,720
one more reflection i'll leave that for i'll read it when we come back

272
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:39,839
but i'm going to create the room style so that you have some time to

273
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:46,240
check in share be with each other take care of yourself take care of each

274
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:52,559
other here we go welcome back everyone the rooms are

275
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:58,480
closed we just have about one quick minute any reflections you like to share

276
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:06,000
relating to the practice tonight what came up for you any quick ones

277
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,880
especially from the group

278
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:28,160
thank you oh yeah thank you

279
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:34,480
yeah i loved it uh i uh certainly on a trip of appreciation down

280
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:43,599
my whole family tree really down into deep into the roots of my ancestors and um

281
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:53,200
and and perhaps because i went to like uh susie's uh talk this morning about the

282
00:48:53,200 --> 00:49:00,640
the four elements it reminded me that my ancestral tree goes back beyond

283
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:09,599
my my immediate blood ancestors found the whole course of of evolution back to

284
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:16,720
through all of the animal species that preceded the emergence of my species up

285
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:23,200
out of the the evolutionary process and before the evolution even

286
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:28,880
the big bang that created all the matter that allowed uh

287
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:33,920
evolution to even come into existence and before the big bang

288
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:39,200
the whatever forces that were that made that big bang possible

289
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:46,240
whatever they were i don't know this is great thank you hugh i love it so not only did this bring up

290
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:52,000
appreciation for yourself but so many ancestors and causes and conditions this

291
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:58,640
this wave of appreciation thank you it's beautiful thank you it's a wonderful note

292
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:04,240
um yeah of appreciation it can can be endless right we start somewhere it's

293
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:09,760
like a thread it's like a cloth right you keep pulling and pulling the whole cloth is related

294
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:16,880
um as um uh gosh i'm blanking on who said this but in order the there's a physicist who

295
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:22,000
said uh in order to make an apple pie first you need to make the whole universe so

296
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:28,319
in order to make hue first you need to make the whole universe big bang and everything so

297
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:33,599
uh i see our note bill uh interesting idea i'll think about that

298
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:39,280
that's a good one and one more reflection that i mentioned earlier was

299
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:44,640
from someone who said that spontaneously came up for them looking in the mirror and realizing oh there's a

300
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:52,640
sense of love and kindness for themselves that they usually share for others and not for themselves so a great reminder to be

301
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:59,359
aware of this more often so dear ones thank you so much for showing up and your practice may all

302
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:05,240
beings be well may all beings be happy including ourselves

303
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:11,559
thank you
