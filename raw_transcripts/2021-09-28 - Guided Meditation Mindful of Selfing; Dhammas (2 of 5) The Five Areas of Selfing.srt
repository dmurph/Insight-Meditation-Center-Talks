00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,080
hello everyone and welcome

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,720
and um this week for the

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,840
these these meditation sessions i'm offering you a little exercise that

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,240
you can include as part of your meditation that corresponds to the later teaching

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,760
uh the fourth foundation of mindfulness and

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,120
so there's five of five of them five exercises there so giving a little taste

7
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,399
of it perhaps for each day and um

8
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,199
and so yesterday and the idea was to notice desires operating

9
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:56,960
whenever you were distracted by thoughts today

10
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,079
whenever you get distracted and whenever you get

11
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:10,000
concerned with something uh even if it's happening in the present moment that you somehow

12
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:16,560
interrupt the flow of your ongoing contact with

13
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,560
the present moment as it unfolds as it develops now if you start having thinking about

14
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,080
or commentary about what's happening in all these regards distracted thoughts

15
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,640
commentary being stuck on certain emotions perhaps

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,600
you know the basic mindfulness practice is to have clear recognition of that clear

17
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:48,399
mindfulness hold that in awareness without making it a problem without

18
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:54,479
being critical of it if anything to be kind and just be aware clearly aware that

19
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,799
it's there and then once you've recognized it well enough if it's no longer compelling or strong

20
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:09,319
you can come back and continue with your breathing today's exercise is that uh

21
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:15,120
has to do with the idea that one of the primary

22
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,520
catalysts for losing our connection to the present moment

23
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:29,599
his concern with me myself and mine what we call sometimes selfing

24
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:36,959
we take things and define the define ourselves by them or define them as my thing or and um

25
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:43,920
and even something as simple as saying my pain is different than saying the pain

26
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:51,760
and there's a little act of selfing a little bit of identification with the pain seemingly innocent word my to it

27
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,760
the thoughts you have chances are that you're one of the characters of it or it somehow concerns you

28
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,879
and so they recognize the self-concern that's there and so the word you could use if you'd

29
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:10,000
like is selfing there's selfing and to please do that without any

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,519
condemnation or criticism or disappointment it's an all too human phenomena that

31
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:21,120
human minds will identify make self construct selves

32
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:28,159
appropriate things for themselves assume that things are mine all these kinds of things that we do and

33
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:34,720
sometimes it's kind of innocent but it also is the foundation for all kinds of uh

34
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:41,519
ways in which we end up suffering end up challenged

35
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:48,000
in this life so it's a helpful thing to see to recognize it when it happens so when you say if you do the word

36
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,599
selfing or i or my or me or something it's a little little uh

37
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:02,239
no to recognize that it's happening i do so kindly do so caringly like you care for

38
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:11,200
yourself or an alternative to that is to be slightly amused there it is again wow

39
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,400
and and it might be very interesting for you to kind of recognize

40
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,800
all the ways and the many ways and the frequency in which um the things that distract you from the breath from the

41
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,919
present moment are somehow related to self me myself and mine

42
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:36,880
and if this doesn't make so much sense for you you're welcome just ignore it but uh it might be interesting exercise

43
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,639
so assuming a meditation posture

44
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:49,680
and lowering your gaze to have relaxed eyes

45
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,600
not really focusing on anything in particular soft soft eyes

46
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,520
and gently closing your eyes

47
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,840
and then taking a few long slow deep breaths

48
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,520
as if you have all the time in the world to leisurely breathe deeply and

49
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:20,759
appreciate each breath each inhaled each exhale

50
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,198
and letting your breathing return to normal

51
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,440
and noticing the rhythm of the body's

52
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,680
breathing in and breathing out

53
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,840
and wherever in your body you most clearly experience that rhythm

54
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,919
let your attention let yourself familiarize yourself with those

55
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,880
sensations that experience

56
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:25,759
and then to as you exhale to relax maybe relax the muscles of the

57
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,759
face

58
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,240
relax the shoulders

59
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,280
relax the belly

60
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,080
relax your butt and your legs

61
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,000
so they settle into your sitting place

62
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:35,039
and then settling into the body's experience of breathing again with a simple rhythm of breathing

63
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,720
and the idea is to be as simple as possible

64
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:55,879
not using the experience of breathing to reinforce ideas of self

65
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:06,800
just a simple experience of the rhythm of breathing in and out

66
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:13,840
a rhythm you share with all breathing creatures

67
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:23,120
that's been going on for millions of years breathing in and breathing out

68
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:32,080
and will continue long after you're gone and now you're participating in this

69
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:40,279
shared common experience of breathing in and breathing out

70
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,800
center yourself when you're breathing and if you get distracted or caught up

71
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:57,600
in something notice what how that might be related to

72
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,200
self-concern self-referencing

73
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:11,920
and then kindly gently recognize it as selfing

74
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,920
and then begin again with your breathing

75
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:06,000
if you recognize selfing see if you can recognize it with a light

76
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:14,480
touch not making it a big deal and in doing so perhaps experience

77
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:22,880
a teeny bit of freedom from the ongoing selfing

78
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:30,960
just through recognizing it and stepping back holding it lightly and

79
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,320
then beginning again with your breathing

80
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
so

81
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,480
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

82
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,840
perhaps to recognize that

83
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,520
the human all to human

84
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:17,480
concern with self with oneself

85
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,880
is quite common normal in many ways

86
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:32,880
but also it's the seat it's the source for a tremendous amount of confusion and

87
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,240
desires and aversions and pain

88
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:45,799
hurt and suffering for many people so the self is a

89
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,559
is a complicated difficult topic

90
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:58,559
sometimes with self-criticism sometimes with kind of selfish

91
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:06,240
self-assertion which leads to frustration and difficulties

92
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:13,840
to recognize the tremendous amount of suffering that there exists in this world because of

93
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:19,200
how people are caught up in conceit and

94
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:26,799
identification and to end this sitting

95
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:31,919
appreciating the challenges that this brings to people

96
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:37,760
and to maybe allow yourself to feel care and

97
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:45,120
compassion for the challenges and difficulties that people have and

98
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:52,240
and to wish them well to wish all of us

99
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,279
success in finding a way through

100
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:04,320
beyond our the suffering based on self and selfing conceit

101
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:13,200
may all beings be happy

102
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:23,120
without needing to reinforce or build up the self

103
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:29,278
may all beings be safe

104
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:37,039
without needing to defend protect or let get hurt

105
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:44,960
the concepts ideas they have of who they are may all beings

106
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:50,840
be peaceful free of self-preoccupation

107
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:59,840
and may all beings be free free of the stickiness the traps

108
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,559
that are set with the self-concern self-preoccupation

109
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:12,399
and may we support all beings to be free from the suffering of

110
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:19,039
self-selfing by overcoming some of our own attachment

111
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:26,080
to this area may all beings be happy

112
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,320
and free

113
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:42,069
[Music]

114
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:58,559
so today i continue the discussion about the fourth foundation of mindfulness

115
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:06,159
and there are five different areas to attend to in this in this foundation

116
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:11,760
yesterday i talked about the the hindrances the five hindrances today

117
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,880
will be the what's called the five aggregates tomorrow the

118
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:23,600
six cent stores then the seven factors of awakening and then the four noble truths

119
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:30,399
so all these wonderful lists and um there's a progression through them and

120
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:37,440
the progression from yesterday is that the hindrances are we think of them as kind of the

121
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:43,120
what keeps us distracted in the world of desires and aversions

122
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:48,320
in our relationship to pleasure and pain and

123
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:54,080
things of the world the alternative word for essential pleasure the first one that pierce

124
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:59,840
nesutas is another same list but with the word instead of sensual pleasures is

125
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:06,720
avariciousness so wanting to acquire especially things of other people or acquire things

126
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:12,799
and so it has a lot to do with our relationship to things and desires and pleasures and

127
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:19,600
kind of you think of it a little bit that you know kind of what the self can get what the self cannot get what the self wants and

128
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:25,120
doesn't want when that kind of desire settles down in quiets

129
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:32,399
then we're more present for ourselves we then at some point encounter the next layer

130
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:39,120
of attachment list layer of this of preoccupation that interferes with the deeper settling

131
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:45,840
into peace and that has to do around me myself and mine self-concern

132
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:51,919
identification where we take different parts of our psychophysical

133
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:57,120
being and we hold on to that or we assume or

134
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:03,200
conceive of that as being this is this is mine this is

135
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:11,280
me and this is my true self and so um something as simple as um

136
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,800
as seemingly innocent as saying you know this is my hand

137
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:22,079
now i appropriate it as being mine and in some sense it is

138
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:28,158
but when i say my my hand and then it's associated with me

139
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:34,480
and maybe maybe i think my hand is the best hand in the world or i'm the worst kind of hand in the world

140
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:40,560
and so here i am holding it up in front of us your all of you and if i'm attached to

141
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:46,638
this is my hand then i could be either completely proud of showing it off or

142
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:54,480
completely miserable that you're seeing this thing that's a mind and so the idea of my hand is can be

143
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,560
innocent but it can come along with a lot of baggage that that baggage is called selfing

144
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:05,680
um or it could be that um

145
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:11,680
uh the um you know that rather than uh

146
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,720
it's me the hand is me and so if someone brushes against it in

147
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:23,839
a hard way they're they're kind of offending me because the hand is me and so we're

148
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:29,680
taking what's innocent enough like and assuming that this represents me as

149
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:35,280
a person or i take my hand as being my true self

150
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,320
that's the essence of who i am handness and and so

151
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:47,119
and i'm ready to argue with anyone or i'm ready to insist that this is my handness it'll protect my hand at all cost i don't want

152
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:54,480
it to die or get old and because that's essentially who i am so maybe that's a silly a silly example

153
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:00,160
but i'm hoping that you can uh apply this to yourself

154
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:07,119
that there's this action of selfing and extreme forms it takes the

155
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:13,599
world the word the the form of conceit

156
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,960
very strong attachment to self it has lots to do with identification

157
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:25,119
that cons not identifying who we are if we're you know some simple

158
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:31,200
way a man a woman neither man or woman trans

159
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:36,320
gender nor non-conforming all kinds of other options but if um

160
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:43,040
if we get attack there's a way of kind of leaning into it too much holding onto it

161
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:50,079
and and clinging and holding tight in such a way that as the veigars of life encounter us

162
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:57,680
that uh it either challenges that deep attachment or reinforces it and so there's selfing going on

163
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:03,119
so in the buddha's teaching then the idea is to be sensitive to

164
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:09,119
the contraction or the stickiness or the

165
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:16,320
resistance or the pushingness the neediness that seems to be related to this idea of self

166
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:22,640
and it can be experienced very simply and sometimes as a kind of contraction a tightness

167
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:28,560
inner pressure it can be experienced as a wanting as a not wanting

168
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:35,599
it can experiences ideas that we get we swirl around in

169
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:41,599
and a lot of these selfing does in fact have to do with ideas and concepts we live in

170
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:46,880
sometimes so deep that we don't even see we're doing them

171
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,000
you know for example if you know you come to a place where

172
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,040
there's chairs and and there's lots of chairs to sit in and lots of empty chairs

173
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:02,079
and uh maybe you're waiting at the doctor's office or something

174
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:07,839
and then you have to go to the bathroom so you've been sitting in one chair for a long wait to see the doctor and then

175
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:14,960
you have to go to the bathroom and you go to the bathroom you come back and lo and behold someone's sitting in the same chair that you're sitting in

176
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:20,880
and the initial reaction and how could they be sitting in my chair and

177
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:27,440
and there's identification with the chair and me that might arouse anger that the person sitting in it well there's lots of other

178
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:34,480
cheers around and so this can happen in all kinds of small ways throughout the day

179
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:40,240
and so um so to begin being sensitive this movement of selfing that's possible

180
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:47,760
we're no longer uh you know caught up in in the more coarser

181
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:54,320
surface desires of wanting and not wanting and the confusion that comes from that the hindrances

182
00:38:54,320 --> 00:39:01,440
and um and they're very interesting what the buddha wants us to do is to recognize in our

183
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:08,160
simplest forms of experience the five different ways five different kind of foundations for

184
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:14,640
what he thinks is called constructing a self sometimes it's the body the form

185
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:22,240
sometimes it's based on our feelings sometimes it's based on our ideas of things our concepts

186
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:28,480
it's called perceptions in english the third aggregate and sometimes has to do with the stories we make up the

187
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:33,839
impulses the intentions the motivations the the opinions we have the fourth

188
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:39,119
aggregate and the fifth one is consciousness the idea that we can be

189
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:47,119
aware that we can know some people very strongly associate that with a feeling almost of emphasis i am

190
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:53,920
and of course that's who i am so these are different areas that people sometimes

191
00:39:53,920 --> 00:40:01,440
focus on in the construction of identity in the construction of self in the preoccupation with self

192
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,800
and you might spend do it as an exercise and spend it maybe today

193
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:12,240
maybe you know if a period of time on each one each of these five aggregates

194
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:17,680
and see you know how much self-concern is there around your body and what you

195
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:23,520
look like and bodily pleasure and displeasure and

196
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:30,400
how much uh preoccupation and selfing is connected to how you feel your feelings

197
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:36,400
and um you know you're feeling happy or sad all kinds of ways

198
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:42,400
and how much of preoccupation and selfing self-concerned about my opinions

199
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:48,160
my history my story my biography my plans

200
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:55,359
my desires and the whole kind of inner world of of um

201
00:40:55,359 --> 00:41:02,960
you know the world that we construct with our mind and then consciousness

202
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:09,200
these are the five aggregates so this is where the buddha wants us to look but he wants us to look and see this for a

203
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:15,039
particular reason not to not to negotiate not to

204
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:20,800
abandon it not to let go of it even not to make a problem out of it but to see

205
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:28,800
it clearly and to see it this way to be quiet enough to see that each of these five areas

206
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:34,560
um in them when we don't we don't we don't we don't cling to them too much or don't

207
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:40,960
overlay our ideas on it too much or preoccupation can be experienced as something which is

208
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:47,280
flowing something that's arising and passing something that appears and disappears

209
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:52,400
something that's very inconstant changing flexing moving

210
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:59,839
and it's kind of like a river of our life that our being is a river of changing sensations experiences thoughts

211
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:07,119
emotions and the idea is to relax into that river and um and float or

212
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:13,359
be massaged by it or settled in and the attachment to self and selfing is like

213
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:19,440
you know taking some a bucket of that water out and sometimes freezing it and saving it

214
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:24,640
for the future but it's no longer the river and

215
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:30,720
so uh so the idea is not so much to you know attack or feel upset about the selfing

216
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:36,079
that goes on but rather to look more deeply and see

217
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:43,920
that underneath the self-concern can we notice how it takes us out of the flow of life

218
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:51,200
the movement of the present moment if the present moment is a river notice how it takes us out by through

219
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:57,599
retrospective thinking through fantasy through being caught up in this

220
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:03,040
conversations in our head and and

221
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:09,280
the um and such things so the five areas

222
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:14,960
is the body feelings the basic simple concepts ideas that we

223
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:20,720
live by the fourth one is the stories we live by the more complicated constructions

224
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:26,480
mental constructions about our lives and motivations and the fifth is consciousness

225
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,760
and you don't necessarily have to remember them all but you might

226
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:37,119
become sensitive to how much

227
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:44,160
selfing goes on i think for many people a primary subject of main character much

228
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:49,440
of their thinking and what fuels their thinking is the self as me myself and mine

229
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:55,280
we're kind of either center stage or somehow important in the thoughts the concerns we have and just watching the

230
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:02,240
thought stream and recognizing how much self is in there and selfing and ideas of self is a

231
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:08,560
fascinating study and and but to do this as this mindfulness

232
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:15,680
exercise is to try to see it as um as selfing but see it as a

233
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:20,839
as a as a reification a solidification of the

234
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:27,520
ongoing river of of life that we live in and in doing so start experiencing some

235
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:34,079
freedom some independence from those attachment to self

236
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:39,920
so um thank you and uh i realized this week is

237
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:44,960
a bit of a you know whirlwind tour of these five different areas for the fourth foundation

238
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:51,200
and um but maybe you know hopefully it's useful to have a general sense those of you who don't know of this

239
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:58,640
this very important part of mindfulness practice and maybe some other time we can go in some more depth with each of them

240
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:03,160
so thank you all very much
