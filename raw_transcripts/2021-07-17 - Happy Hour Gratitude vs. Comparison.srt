4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:31,840
but it is private only my image and my name uh gets um

5
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,760
shows on zoom and everybody else's does not because uh and i only see some of you on a tiny

6
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,920
strip on top but you can put yourself each other on gallery view if you wanted to see each other it doesn't

7
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,680
have to be just the the big image of me but just to explain that for the first timers

8
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,120
that on youtube only i show up not you just in terms of privacy

9
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:04,640
so you know this anyway so so for the theme for today's uh

10
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:12,080
practice um i wanted to again this is a big topic but just to

11
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:18,320
take a little bite out of it tonight and a little bite out of the topic of

12
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,560
comparison comparison the comparing mind comparing ourselves

13
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,880
and comparing can come up so easily so easily especially in this

14
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,759
world with um social media you know you might be on social media to

15
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,280
share something or or news and then soon you'll be seeing

16
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,520
other people's vacations and this and that and it's like oh oh the sense of comparison comes up and

17
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,960
wanting and or or other success or good fortune etc

18
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,040
so comparison not just on on social media but there's so many ways comparison come up and

19
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:08,640
again this is a big topic but we'll take a little bite of it tonight

20
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,879
and one thing i want to invite and so many ways to work with the comparing mind what we call in

21
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,840
buddhism the comparing mind it just it just compares it just compares compares compares

22
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:27,360
um one quote i like to share and i don't know who said this um is

23
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:34,480
um i think it's just attributed to anonymous is don't compare your insides

24
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,400
to somebody's outsides don't compare compare your insides to another person's

25
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,160
outside so you only see an image externally of of what is happening whereas you're

26
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:53,440
comparing your ones here you know the comp you know we're all human we're all human

27
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,840
so with that in mind one of the antidotes again there are many many ways

28
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:07,760
both through meta practices hard practices as well as wisdom practices because really

29
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:14,720
this comparison is an aspect of what's called a mana

30
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:21,680
conceit and that's a big topic that we can talk about in the wisdom tradition but for now

31
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:28,400
the one way the invitation is to work with this and and actually beautiful practice when

32
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,159
comparison comes up is to turn actually to turn to the goodness

33
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:40,159
to the goodness in our heart in our lives in our own cultivation because when

34
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:46,319
comparison comes up the mind narrows it becomes really really tight

35
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:54,560
and it only concentrates on what it does not have on what it idealizes what it wants and

36
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,080
it does not have instead of seeing all the goodness that

37
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:06,080
is already available and without actually really seeing the perspective of interconnection

38
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:12,080
and and all the causes and conditions of our lives other people's lives etc

39
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,919
etc so it becomes it has a single vision

40
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:24,639
which is very tight and it's not even accurate so through bringing up gratitude we

41
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,880
actually expand that vision we expand that vision and then our heart in fact can become

42
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,320
available to wish the other person well and may you be well may you

43
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:43,040
shine in your goodness may you be happy on your vacation and your success and you give to the world as i give to

44
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,160
the right may we all play our parts in this world we all have

45
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,360
a different part to play but that expansion of vision can become

46
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:59,440
possible through the practice of gratitude one of the avenues okay i've spoken

47
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,520
enough this is the framing let's begin

48
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:13,600

and as i hear the sirens and so probably can you

126
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,760
to integrate it with our practice

127
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:52,480
challenges accidents can happen to anyone at any time none of us are immune

128
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,840
to wish well for the being

129
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,880
or isn't that ambulance

130
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:11,600
ambulances and that in this moment

131
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:18,880
for this moment could be impermanent as everything else but we have the good

132
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,440
fortune

133
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:33,840
to be sitting and practicing not in distress

134
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:47,279
such good fortune we take normalcy for granted often

135
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,080
only when

136
00:24:54,159 --> 00:25:01,520
we get bad news or when the difficulty only then we appreciate

137
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:10,880
what we considered the boring normal when we considered on what was lacking

138
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:19,200
what isn't good enough instead of all the goodness

139
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:30,399
all the bounty of this moment of our life

140
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,840
turning our mind intentionally

141
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:54,480
not to what's lacking if we focus on that the list can be infinite

142
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:02,640
but to what is here what is good this list too is infinite

143
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,600
is infinite

144
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:14,080
choosing to celebrate

145
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:25,840
the bounty the incredible blessings

146
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:39,840
that have carried us to this moment

147
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:07,840
breathing letting yourself be breathed

148
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,480
heart full with all the goodness

149
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:35,840
breathing hearing touching feeling

150
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:59,840
fully well knowing

151
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:09,520
that money fame success etc etc

152
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,840
do not bring lasting happiness

153
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:32,799
aspiring to goodness we aspire

154
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:38,398
for excess may we aspire for goodness

155
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,840
for kindness

156
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:50,000

00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:13,120
each light unique not even stepping into the arena of

171
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,840
comparison

172
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:29,840
celebrating each light

173
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:43,840
lighting up the world

174
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:08,879
and as we bring this practice period to a close to sit

175
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,480
sharing the goodness of our practice

176
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:26,800
our goodness with all beings everywhere letting our light shine

177
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:40,320
trusting there is goodness may all beings be happy may all beings be free

178
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:49,839

199
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:33,760
there you go what i realized again and like to be

200
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,800
reminded of is how the ordinary things of every day

201
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:44,320
get glossed over by me and i don't feel grateful for them but it was nice

202
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:49,680
to be reminded again that you know simple things like running water and

203
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:56,960
you know um food and roof over my head and you know those things that are so

204
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,960
important to my happiness and well-being that you know i sometimes take for granted

205
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:10,240
yeah thank you janie thank you so much for your reflection i appreciate you brought in running

206
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:16,400
water i heard this uh perspectives on kqed the other day i don't know if you heard this also

207
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:23,760
someone who's talking about if you go camping and backpacking and you pump the water yourself from the

208
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:32,000
stream through a pump and every ounce of water is so precious and and if you accidentally knock over

209
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,160
a camping container that you've just pumped oh you have to do it all over again and use the water that you've

210
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:44,320
cooked with to clean with etc etc and then you come home and you turn on the faucet and it's like

211
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:49,520
oh a miracle a miracle so just so i've been

212
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:55,440
appreciating the miracle of opening my faucet every day ever since i i heard this it's just so much we take

213
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:04,000
for granted so much we take for granted yeah thank you genie for your reflection

214
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:11,760
other reflections please other and jerry says i agree thanks genie you

215
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:20,079
do not know what you have often until it is gone yes yeah exactly and i'll say one thing one

216
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:27,359
version of this meditation i sometimes do is to imagine that something you have like

217
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:34,880
your leg is you know for example is you you've been in an accident um but this meditation was already

218
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:42,960
pretty full so maybe i'll try that next week but yes so co please

219
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:49,760
yes um it's uh not only do we take things usually for

220
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,880
granted but um uh when we when we

221
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:02,880
stay informed about what's going on in other parts of the world like indonesia having all their

222
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:08,880
hospitals overrun with cloven patients and or you drive on the freeway into

223
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:15,599
berkeley and you see all the homeless encampments etc

224
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:24,160
it's all the more valuable that we don't take for granted anything that

225
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:31,760
that we have we who are fortunate enough to have a roof over our heads and um um

226
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:38,720
so it's a very powerful thing to not take things for granted yeah yeah absolutely yeah thank you co

227
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:45,280
and especially one thing i always wanted to add to this practice is that when we do this

228
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:52,640
practice of gratitude is and we fill our hearts with goodness

229
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:58,480
it is so that we actually not that we just turn away from all the

230
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,920
challenges in the world and say oh okay i have it all well and nobody else is but it actually

231
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,440
allows us and we know this but i also i do want to bring it into the space

232
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:16,880
that it it brings a more generosity into our hearts brings more generosity for us to serve

233
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:23,280
to be available to share with others so as part of this practice of course we

234
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:30,880
know this already but wanted to bring this to the to the room thank you ko thank you so much

235
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:39,040
yeah in the other quick reflections please before we go into our

236
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,240
small group practice

237
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:52,240
one reflection comes in hearing the sirens the sound of the fan in my house

238
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:57,359
rising and falling coming and going yeah

239
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,800
yeah so how about we save some time on the other side of

240
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:13,760
the small groups for more reflections and we turn now to practicing in small

241
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:19,200
groups in community so in this time we turn

242
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:26,560
to small groups of size three or four and we start with 15 seconds of meta

243
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:34,160
silent meta for one another for the small group that you find yourself in and

244
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:39,680
then [Music] sharing as much or as little as you like

245
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:47,760
with your sangha with this small group about your practice as you wish and it's just

246
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:54,240
six minutes it's very short and then we come back and we'll have a little bit of time for reflections

247
00:42:54,240 --> 00:43:00,319
so it's such a precious time to to connect with other practitioners so

248
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:08,400
here we go and the rooms are open enjoy hello everyone welcome back welcome back

249

250
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:22,720
so we have a few minutes for any reflections that have come up from

251
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:29,040
practicing in small groups i see a lot of smiles i see a lot of smiles that weren't here before

252
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:35,359
