1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,240
hello and welcome it's uh delightful to see the

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:15,880
names in the chat and recognize many of them and many of you so

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,480
hello and

4
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:30,840
um so Monday I said samade is simplicity

5
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,760
yesterday I said samadi is subtleness

6
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:45,320
settling and today I'd like to say that samadi is steadiness being steady with awareness

7
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:55,160
with the attention being steady not only in the present moment but being steady uh

8
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:03,119
in uh resting attention at a center

9
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:09,040
point so the settling Point may be the

10
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:19,000
Gathering point the the point within where the awareness can

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,479
feel um committed it can feel welcomed we're place within where

12
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:33,720
it's possible for the awareness to become absorbed or Be steady in the

13
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,000
Simplicity of the experience we're having and

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,119
um and so there's a variety of these centering

15
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,719
points Where We Gather ourselves and I think of them this centering points as

16
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:56,399
uh there might be more than one at any given one time even but I think of them

17
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,799
as um uh the center as like the center of a trampoline where if we sit at the

18
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:11,120
middle of a trampoline it's it um it bows it's it settles down bends down to

19
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,519
hold our weight and if we have uh as I used to have with my little kids a trampoline in

20
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:22,840
the backyard then all the little balls that they had in the trampoline would

21
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:29,360
all roll towards that Center and uh we didn't have to gather the balls they would if we sat stood in

22
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,480
the middle they would just roll down there so if we can find that uh we have

23
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:42,519
a place and the steadiness of staying on that place in for attention becomes that

24
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:47,640
kind of centering place where all the different desperate parts of who who we

25
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,800
are can begin to gather there together one of the things that's

26
00:02:52,800 --> 00:03:00,480
helpful for developing somebody through being steady is if we're steady for example

27
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,879
and what I'm teaching is steady with breathing the rhythm of breathing in and

28
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:11,440
breathing out as it's experienced in the body and in particular in the

29
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,159
Torso and even more so in the area around the

30
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,519
belly uh the movements of the belly as we breathe but it could be the whole uh

31
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:31,319
torso the kind of expansive uh movements of the whole torso as we breathe in and the Gathering

32
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:37,519
Together the collecting coming back settling back on the exhale it's a variety of things that

33
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:43,319
there's the kind of the that center point where we're resting so that

34
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:48,799
everything can kind of roll towards it that as we're there

35
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:56,760
steady uh don't set up a war or a really strong conflict any conflict with a

36
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:03,159
thinking mind certainly there are of meditation is to learn how not to be caught in the

37
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:09,439
world of thought taking you away from the present but also you don't have to

38
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,959
think that you're supposed to push them away either there is an art to holding

39
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:20,600
steady on what you're being mindful of what you're focusing on and then letting

40
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:26,639
your thoughts recede to the background and if they can be in the background they can be

41
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:35,680
there kind of you can kind of know you're thinking but you don't have to be involved in it it's like

42
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,400
for maybe it's says you're having a nice

43
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,759
conversation maybe it's like you're having a nice conversations with a friend in a restaurant and uh there's

44
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,120
other people talking around you but uh you're not you know they're talking but

45
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,400
you're not listening to them you're staying focused on on your friend

46
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:08,639
so in this way you know that you're thinking but you're not focused on it you're focused on your friend the

47
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:17,400
breathing to feel it listen sense Be There Be steady be a steady friend to be

48
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:25,000
really present on breathing so to assume a meditation

49
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:30,199
posture and

50
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:37,720
sometimes I think of the posture of meditation that ones

51
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:43,199
that one that kind of frees up or opens up the front of the

52
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:49,639
Torso so it's easier to breathe the chest is not collapsed we're not

53
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:57,360
collapsed in such a way that the belly is kind of um crunched

54
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:07,000
up but rather there a feeling of being open in the and now kind of like an open

55
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:15,720
chest maybe the belly is open and expensive so that as you relax the

56
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,639
belly soften the belly the belly hangs

57
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:26,520
forward it's not pulled in

58
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:39,960
and maybe feeling the belly the soft belly as you breathe in

59
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:45,599
deeply feel the gentle expansion

60
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:51,360
pressure pushing outwards or downwards that happens in your belly as

61
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:58,639
you breathe in and how after a while with the in

62
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,520
breath Maybe

63
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:11,000
that expansion and pressure in the belly helps lift

64
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:16,759
up the rib cage and helps expand the

65
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:21,319
Torso around the ribs

66
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,159
and then discovering what it how you exhale how

67
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:50,720
the body exhales a long exhale is it first from the chest that

68
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:57,759
the contracts or the belly or both together

69
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:12,319
on the exhale relaxing and softening the whole

70
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,440
body and letting the breathing return to normal

71
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,760
and with a normal exhale

72
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,000
soften the body

73
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:30,800
and then to settle in and a simple

74
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:38,680
way to the experience of breathing maybe to a place within which

75
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,440
is the centering place the Gathering

76
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:53,079
Place maybe at the end of the exhale where something shifts and the

77
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:56,880
the inhale begins

78
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:29,000
and with if if you're with a friend who somehow is challenged by something and

79
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,480
needs support but the only support they need is just to know you're

80
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,519
there and you put your hand on the top of their back just keep your hand there

81
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:49,920
so they know they're being accompanied your hand stays there

82
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:56,839
steady in the same way the hand of awareness is placed

83
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:03,120
gently against the back of

84
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,639
breathing so it's not a frontal piercing of attention to the

85
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:16,240
breath a strain but coming from

86
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:22,120
behind and coming up and being there to feel and sense in a gentle

87
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:28,399
way to let the breathing know you're there for it

88
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,600
and then keeping the hand of

89
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:46,680
awareness with the exhale so you're accompanying the

90
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:54,079
exhale through the whole length of the exhale however short or long it might

91
00:11:54,079 --> 00:12:01,639
be from the beginning to the end you don't lose lose

92
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,720
contact experimenting with a steadiness through

93
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:23,639
the whole length of the inhale

94
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:47,320
and then accompanying the exhale not pushing it

95
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:57,199
or needing demanding anything from it but keeping the hand of

96
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:03,760
attention there is in touch with a whole exhale from beginning

97
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,040
to end

98
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:45,680
and then both the inhale and the

99
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:54,000
exhale a steady attention to the whole

100
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:02,079
inhale followed by a steadiness with a whole exhale for

101
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:40,839
staying close to the Simplicity of awareness of breathing not making it a big deal or

102
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:55,199
project a Simplicity of attention that stays steady

103
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,040
intimate with the full experience of breathing

104
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,759
in breathing

105
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:23,440
out from time to time letting there be a settling of the whole body into the

106
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,440
breathing

107
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,759
and see if you can not be interested in your thinking you don't have to listen to it

108
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:57,440
or attend to it let it reive to the background is not important for these

109
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,920
moments of meditation

110
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:14,160
and instead to

111
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:22,600
trust being with breathing

112
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:29,000
trusting a steady attention

113
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,560
that stays with the whole length of the

114
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,319
inhale and the whole length of the

115
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:53,920
exhale over and over again

116
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:08,918
and if it's helpful you might be counting the

117
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,519
breath to keep you

118
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
there

119
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

120
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,760
e for

121
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:35,880
he and the more fully you

122
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,080
can fill awareness with

123
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,880
breathing the less room there is for

124
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
thinking

125
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

126
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
for

127
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
for

128
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

129
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

130
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
for

131
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,480
e for

132
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:11,200
and if there's any way it feels as if you're holding yourself back from the

133
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:19,120
breathing relax that holding so it might feel more like

134
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:26,080
you're entering into the experience of the body

135
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
breathing

136
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
for

137
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

138
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
for

139
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,278
for for

140
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:18,679
and then as we come to the end of this

141
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:28,880
sitting to whatever degree you can appreciate

142
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,360
a steadiness of attention here with the

143
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:39,000
breathing with yourself with the

144
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,880
body with being aware

145
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:53,559
itself even if it's a challenge is there some way that you can

146
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:59,240
appreciate a continuity of awareness

147
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:14,799
the kind of continuity of awareness you would offer to a

148
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:21,080
friend if you're listening to them to their challenge that they're

149
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:29,880
describing and need to talk about a continuity of being present

150
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:35,159
so they know that you care through how you

151
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:43,880
listen and may it be that the way that we learn to attend and be present for

152
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:52,159
ourselves in meditation may it support us in our

153
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:59,120
ability to listen well to others

154
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:07,760
to attend to others so we can understand them better know them

155
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:16,480
better may it be that this practice that we do supports us in our ability

156
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:25,679
to be attuned be considerate be respectful of other

157
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:33,399
people so they feel that our respect through how we are aware of

158
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:40,880
them how we listen and may it be that how we listen

159
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:47,120
to the suffering World his

160
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:56,200
medicine to any feeling that people have that they're alone

161
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:03,360
unattended uncared for po may we live in such a

162
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:10,320
way that we contribute to all beings being cared

163
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:15,240
for being respected and listened

164
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:22,278
to may all beings be

165
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:28,080
happy may all beings be safe

166
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:34,600
may all beings be peaceful may all

167
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,960
beings be

168
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:46,600
free and may our ability to be present for

169
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:52,240
others contribute to their well-being and

170
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,240
freedom

[Music]

172
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:17,399
thank

173
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:30,919
you e

174
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:21,519
so hello and welcome to this series on samadi

175
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:28,480
and Monday I talked about some Sadi as simplicity

176
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:36,559
yesterday as somebody as settling subtleness and today as steadiness a

177
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:42,840
steady attention to the present moment a steady attention to the experience we're

178
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:49,960
having that we're really settling on and um and this idea of steady

179
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:55,679
attention is uh closely connected to the idea of

180
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:02,399
um of a continu it of attention continuity in the present

181
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:09,000
moment and um and uh the idea is to uh

182
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:16,240
hang out with the breath so we get absorbed so we get more engaged in it

183
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:24,279
and some people find this hard to do because they expect that somehow they'll find in the breathing something

184
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:30,679
wonderful like there's a key there or some pleasure there or some something profound there to be found if they keep

185
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:37,080
looking at the breathing the breathing is a solution and

186
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:42,519
um the um and uh the real kind of

187
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:48,200
um um uh warmth and beauty and Delight

188
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:55,559
of samadi is not F found in the object that we pay attention to but in the

189
00:33:55,559 --> 00:34:02,519
subjective experience of being intimate or connected or steadied absorbed in the

190
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:07,600
experience we're having so we don't want to look for the solution in the

191
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:13,200
experience of breathing but uh there something happens in the interactivity

192
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,878
the interaction between us and breathing us and the object of

193
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:24,280
concentration uh in the the way in which we attend to it the steadiness the

194
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:29,560
subtleness the the simplicity and the continuity of

195
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:36,599
attention that um that is uh more continuous than the

196
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:44,560
continuity of being lost in thought and um so to kind of stay and

197
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:50,079
rest there so uh for one of the things that

198
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:55,520
can support this uh steadiness and continuity of

199
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:03,079
attention is the is the wise use of our

200
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:08,960
imagination sometimes if we if we have the ability to imagine in a nice way in

201
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:16,040
our own way uh that somehow that some form of imagination that brings us um

202
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:23,599
connected and inspired and kind of riding along with the with the breathing it can be easier to have the continuity

203
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:30,720
so I'll offer you some examples and uh the idea is that U you find and um if

204
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:38,119
you want to do this you find an example that works for you so uh uh something I

205
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:45,320
did in my early years of practice was imagining that uh my INB breaths and out

206
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:54,400
breaths were like the slow gentle um uh movements of the W wings of

207
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:01,160
a large bird breathing in and out with was the way the wings going up and down

208
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:06,680
and sometimes with the exhale if was it all extended it was like I was gliding

209
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:13,760
along in the wind and then I would lift it up again and let them go down and

210
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:19,400
there was something about this for me this imagery of being in the high high

211
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:26,880
sky and gently kind of the breathing being intimately connected to you know

212
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:33,760
associated with the wings flapping that um got me kind of really engaged the

213
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:40,800
continuity staying right there with it um another thing that I've done is

214
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:46,880
sometimes I've imagin and I've told this many story many times before but that um

215
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:54,400
it's a little bit I used to when I was a little kid I I loved going on a push scooter and uh and the way that a push

216
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,640
scooter would work is that I would you know with one foot kick the ground to

217
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:05,200
push the scooter forward and then I'd ride the momentum until momentum started

218
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:13,000
to slow and then now gently push again ride push and so with for The Med

219
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:21,240
meditation and breathing the inhale was like the push and the exhale was riding the

220
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:28,160
momentum uh and it just felt so good to ride that momentum to the end of the exhale and then I would would gently

221
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:34,400
push with the inhale and that imagery doing it that way kind of harnessed my

222
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:41,040
imagination to help me be present rather than the imagination taking me off to

223
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:46,839
some other lands and time and things that were going going on uh just like

224
00:37:46,839 --> 00:37:54,480
the counting is taking thinking and using it for the purpose of being present so there can be the wise use of

225
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:00,040
imagination that brings you into the present more rather than taking you

226
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:08,160
away so the the the example I used in the medit this last meditation of

227
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:13,200
putting your gentle safe hand on the on someone's back or feeling someone there

228
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:18,319
for you holding you um maybe you're walking in an unsteady way in a place

229
00:38:18,319 --> 00:38:23,720
that it's a little dangerous and someone's just there letting you know they're there to catch you you know if

230
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:29,640
you fall they they'll they'll take care of you and or something like that so if

231
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:36,880
that you know that might be nice like just right there it's related to an imagination I

232
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:42,760
used also many years ago when I was in college I took a massage class and the

233
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:49,520
teacher taught us to um um to when you're massaging someone never uh have

234
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:56,040
your hand uh always have one hand that's always connected to the other the person you're massaging so there's no

235
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:02,960
interruption to that and there's no surprise of being touched again if you get some massage oil to you know

236
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:08,520
to to use more of it for the massage and so

237
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:14,599
um and so you always have that contact so I found that a a nice imagery

238
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:19,800
sometimes of being with a breath in meditation never lose contact stay there

239
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:27,119
but for some people that's not the right image some people the bird flying is not the right image um another image I've

240
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:34,400
used because I've been doing this for 50 years so I've had a series of them uh another one that I've enjoyed sometimes

241
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,960
is thinking of the exhale is writing a slide and I'm just kind of writing going

242
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:45,720
down like a little kid going on the slide woo you know just writing the slide and that kind of just kept me

243
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:51,960
right there and it kind of made it kind of fun and and kind of you know like a being on a

244
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:57,960
slide so you might have your own imagery that might work for you and uh

245
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:03,000
I know some people have the image of breathing as being a big wheel and that

246
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,240
they just the sense of this wheel turning um helps them stay with the like

247
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:14,440
almost like the inhale is and exhale are the Turning of the wheel and

248
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:19,800
um and uh just that simple one keeps them connected and

249
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:24,960
involved um some people the imagination is not what's going to help them stay

250
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:32,160
steady and continuous with the breathing um and there might be some uh some

251
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:40,160
something interesting about the sensations of breathing or more more usefully something um Pleasant about it

252
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:47,839
some pleasure that's be found there and I've used the for example I find that I find generally exhale to me more

253
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:56,400
pleasant than the inhale sometimes it's been the opposite but uh to be sure to be there for the

254
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:02,280
whatever Pleasant or pleasure satisfactory Sensations are there if in

255
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:09,920
the cycle of breath just and then ride it feel it sense it and uh some people

256
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:16,720
uh find that they can get absorbed in breathing because they begin really tuning into wherever there's some sense

257
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:21,880
of pleasantness pleasure in breathing I've known some people who've adjusted

258
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:28,760
their breathing just a little bit um just so it can be a little bit more pleasant um more enjoyable sometimes

259
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:36,319
breathing a little bit slightly bigger breaths sometimes uh relaxing and uh the

260
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:41,800
the belly and softening somewhere in the body so some part of the cycle of breath is

261
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:48,760
pleasant and um and so rather than imagination to help be present it's the

262
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:56,400
uh the ability to tune into something that's Pleasant with the breathing and riding that pleasure allowing oneself to

263
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:02,440
feel the pleasure you're taking it in and um and all

264
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:08,040
along uh this idea of steadiness and continuity of attention with breathing

265
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:14,760
uh uh should be done without any strain without any expectation without

266
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:20,079
measuring how well we're doing so that of course we're going to wander off of

267
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:27,720
course the continuity is going to not be continuous and um and so uh

268
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:33,760
find a way to meditate so that the the loss of touch with the breathing the

269
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:39,160
loss of staying connected and steady is folded in as part of a healthy

270
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:44,800
meditation it's not a problem it's it's not an but rather just of course your

271
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:51,240
mind's going to do that and then find a relaxed way to begin again to come back

272
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:57,359
again to come back again and here also I used the imagination

273
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:04,920
uh and I I don't I don't think I it at first it was um a choice or something I thought about

274
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:10,920
it just something uh that uh an image that arose as I was doing the practice

275
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:17,839
and that was that I learned to become at some point in this practice I learned to have a friendly attitude to towards my

276
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:23,920
friend my to my friend to my breathing to my thinking I didn't set it up as a

277
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:31,240
tension or as a problem but then if I found myself uh wandering off in thought

278
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:38,520
I wouldn't tense up I wouldn't be critical I wouldn't see it as a problem but the image I had was that

279
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:45,440
there was a horse that had escaped the Corral and um and so the way to bring it

280
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:52,920
back was to ride another horse and ride right kind of ride up right next to it

281
00:43:52,920 --> 00:44:00,960
so being being companions riding together and there go along with the horse that escaped for a little while

282
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:06,319
and then take a Big Arc around

283
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:12,000
180° so that uh to uh to come back to the Corral come back to where we're

284
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:18,599
supposed to be and um and so I that that imagery came up as I would notice I was

285
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:24,800
thinking and I would kind of go along with a little bit I wasn't going to immediately tense up or do something

286
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:31,280
about it just know I was thinking be accompany thinking a little bit and then

287
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:40,359
gently uh kind of has this idea okay come back let's go back let's make a big circle not a jerk back not uh you know

288
00:44:40,359 --> 00:44:47,200
uh just a you turn around 180 degrees and just jerk back but just gentle long

289
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:52,359
curve and how long would that take maybe it took two or three seconds to do that

290
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:57,880
process and then when I came back to breathing that way um

291
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:03,040
uh it was I was much more settled than I was

292
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:08,160
before went you know when beginning of wondering off in thought and it was okay

293
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:14,200
here I am and then okay let's have continuity Let's Be steady here let's be

294
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:21,359
committed in a loving way or absorbed in just the Simplicity of this

295
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:28,119
simple settled and um and steady

296
00:45:28,119 --> 00:45:33,760
here so I hope these ideas give you something to find for yourself that

297
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:42,000
supports you with this steadiness continuity of attention and then I thought that um uh

298
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:49,640
an announcement to make is that uh this Friday uh we would have a uh community
