1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,080
so good evening everyone

2
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:19,919
sorry to speak into the silence some of you are already sitting

3
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:28,800
speak into the silence to so we can all return to the silence

4
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,040
there's something very profound about that sometimes in meditation we're not

5
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,200
going into meditation or going to some state but we're returning

6
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,399
we're returning to a place that maybe is when we're

7
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:55,120
most at home in this world or most at home in ourselves or most settled

8
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,160
so welcome and uh i'll just say a couple of words or

9
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,640
mostly sit in silence and that is that

10
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,200
when you're sitting here and your mind starts its usual noise

11
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:25,720
don't struggle with that but see if you can hear or feel or perceive

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,520
the sweet stillness or silence that includes the noise includes the

13
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:41,360
sounds in other words reorient your attention from whatever you're thinking

14
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,880
to what you know what you're aware of

15
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:53,360
that doesn't require thoughts what is your experience

16
00:01:53,360 --> 00:02:00,240
like when you don't use words to answer the question

17
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:07,479
who are you when you don't use thoughts to answer the question

18
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,720
what is it that's beyond or around or in the middle of thoughts

19
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,000
of thinking when you don't use thoughts to answer the question

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,040
when something else answers and as you sit and meditate maybe you can meditate without something else

21
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:33,519
that's some other awareness that is aware that knows

22
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,840
that doesn't really require thinking

23
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,800
so assuming a meditation posture

24
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,959
and sometimes after i sit down i begin with the posture of my eyes

25
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:04,000
glancing down towards the floor at a 45 degree angle and while the eyes are still open

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,480
to have the eyes become soft

27
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,599
not looking at anything in particular

28
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,159
and then gently closing the eyelids

29
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:52,480
and gently quietly relax with the exhale

30
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,120
soften the shoulders

31
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,200
soften the belly

32
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,240
and perhaps you can soften the muscles of your face

33
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,840
and relaxing the thinking muscle

34
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:57,639
and then settling in settling in to your breathing

35
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:06,080
and settling in can mean that you relax your mind

36
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:13,600
the relaxed mind settles in to

37
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,759
the body

38
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,680
and gently seeing if you can have your attention

39
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,800
if you can steady your attention on your breathing

40
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,520
on the body breathing

41
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,880
and then hang in there with your breathing

42
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:16,960
steady whenever you wander off

43
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,840
steady yourself again on your breathing

44
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,240
one breath at a time

45
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,160
and as we come to the end of the sitting

46
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:58,560
i feel quite touched to be in a room of people meditating with their masks on

47
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:06,480
touched because i feel it's a way that you are caring for me

48
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:12,800
you are caring for each other and that it allows me to care for you in

49
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:19,440
some clear way and may it be that

50
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:25,839
this happens often that we can do two things at once

51
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:33,839
you can do whatever you're doing and you can do anything well you're also caring for others

52
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:39,079
and being cared for cared by others

53
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,480
may it be that this practice that we do

54
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:54,640
supports or develops our ability to be inspired

55
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:03,280
to care not as a duty or obligation

56
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:10,800
but it's something that is like medicine to our own hearts

57
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:23,280
and from our care you have well wishing for others

58
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:28,559
may all beings be happy

59
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:37,440
may all beings be safe

60
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,200
may all beings be peaceful

61
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:49,800
and may all beings be free

62
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:56,550
[Music]

63
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:52,800
well welcome it's nice to see you all again some of you again some of you for the

64
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,560
first time in a year and a half and uh it's wonderful

65
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:04,319
to be meditating here with you and thank you for coming as you were coming and as i

66
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:10,640
we started here i felt quite happy and kind of feeling of contentment to be sitting together

67
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,960
i hope it was nice for you to be here and

68
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,960
so thank you

69
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:31,839
as i went through my day today i thought of a story

70
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:38,720
that i kind of reflect on every year

71
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:45,359
and usually in september because it's a sign to the people we trained we have a training program for it to be

72
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:52,079
an introduction to buddhist chaplaincy so people who are going to offer spiritual care

73
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:59,520
and it's the first uh we give these dharma stories to them and uh they're usually quite short

74
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:06,079
but the assignment is to write about it reflect on it and kind of use a story as a basis upon

75
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:14,960
which to reflect on oneself and and one's own relationship to people and its own experiences that we've had

76
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,760
and now but i was thinking about that today

77
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:26,720
partly i was thinking about it because i think one of the things that evoked it was that yesterday we just finished

78
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:33,119
teaching our first in-person retreat since the pandemic started at the retreat center our retreat center in

79
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:39,680
santa cruz is a week-long retreat and it was quite wonderful and we had

80
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:46,800
you know a coveted protocol for it so everyone was vaccinated everyone had a psr test before

81
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:53,520
it started everyone had an antigen test when they arrived everyone wore a mask

82
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:59,520
and then during the first two days and then after two days we had the second antigen test

83
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:05,200
and if everyone was negative then we would we took off the masks so

84
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:11,119
most people chose to take off the masks when they

85
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:16,960
could some people chose to keep it on and when i sat down the first time to teach

86
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:23,119
a room full of about 40 about 30 people we had people spread out

87
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:28,720
i just didn't feel right to teach with a mask on because there were people sitting relatively

88
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:34,240
close by and just seemed like the

89
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:40,480
projectiles from the voice that we're supposed to have you know spreads out across the room

90
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:45,520
and so i thought well given the covet times i think i don't think i want to

91
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:51,280
teach with the mask on i went with mask off so i put it on to teach like i'm

92
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:56,480
teaching now and then today i read that

93
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:01,599
santa cruz county is now requiring us to have masks the whole time we're there for the next retweet it starts next

94
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:07,119
sunday we'll be masked the whole the whole week and i just feel like it's a way of

95
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:13,280
caring for each other and uh and we're not just caring for each other

96
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:19,040
we're caring for the people that we will encounter when we leave and

97
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:24,800
count to people they'll they'll encounter and you know the way that this invisible force we have this invisible

98
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:31,040
force that's spreading across the lands right this virus and uh so i just felt like

99
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:36,960
of course i'd wear a mask and it kind of feels it's kind of a nice feeling to maybe

100
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:44,319
because of this care so the story is that we gave the first month of this

101
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:52,800
chaplaincy training is an ancient story from the early times of the buddhism time of the buddha

102
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:58,240
and there was a monk in the monastery who had gotten quite sick and had

103
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:05,839
dysentery and uh one day he was found

104
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:11,760
in in his bed or on the floor somewhere just uh

105
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,880
kind of laying in his own poop playing in his own

106
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:23,359
excrement because he was too sick to take care of himself and probably had diarrhea and different

107
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:30,079
things and and so someone

108
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:36,319
told the buddha the buddha went to see him and the buddha asked him you know why

109
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:41,359
why aren't the other monks taking care of you

110
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:48,559
and he's the sikh monk said oh because i'm useless to them i'm useless

111
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:55,200
and so the buddha went to had a head with another monk they went got water

112
00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:00,400
and towels whatever they needed and they cleaned up the monk took care of him and

113
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:05,839
nursed him for a while and then the buddha called all the monks in the monastery together for an

114
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:12,880
assembly and he said very simply he said now that your monastics you kind

115
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:19,520
of left the the worldly life you have no mother or father to take

116
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:26,559
care of you now you have each other to care for it now you have each other to care to care

117
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:33,440
for each other and uh oh first yeah before you said that he said i hear this this we met

118
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:38,559
this yeah i just want to see this monk who was sick and laying in his own excrement

119
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:43,760
and why didn't you guys take care of him and the monk said oh because he's

120
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:50,319
useless to us and so then he gave them a little talk he said you know you have no mother

121
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:56,079
father there's no one you know if no one's to care for you except for you to care for each other

122
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:02,480
and then he said in an ancient indian kind of world view a very powerful statement

123
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:09,520
he said those who would care for me should care for the sick

124
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:14,640
and why it's a powerful statement is that in ancient india in some degree

125
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:21,520
today in india the guru is considered to be uh you know such

126
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:29,119
carries so much merit so much power so much charisma so much spiritual stature that people you know

127
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:34,400
kind of sometimes uh stumble over each other in order to serve the guru you can

128
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:41,839
get a lot of it's very very meritorious thing to do and it's very beneficial to offer that care to the guru and

129
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:47,839
and um and here the buddha was saying those who would like those who would care for me

130
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:53,920
care for the sick he was equating the caring for the sick for you know the caring for the guru for

131
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:59,599
the great teacher and that was a quite that's quite a powerful statement about care the value

132
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:05,200
of care and caring for others and uh

133
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:10,319
and uh and the other sad story about you know the monk felt he was useless

134
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:15,359
how many people you know have been in some unfortunate circumstance and

135
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:22,000
felt like they would they didn't really count they weren't really worthy or somehow they didn't belong or

136
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,040
or you know that they weren't worthy of anybody's care or attention and kind of went off and

137
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:32,240
by themselves and how many have treated others that way

138
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:37,520
i mean our society is made up if you want you to do a kind of a national survey

139
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:44,000
and there are lots of people who are ignoring others and not caring for certain people

140
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:49,680
not taking their suffering into account and causing suffering to other not just

141
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:54,720
simply not caring but and

142
00:50:54,720 --> 00:51:00,559
and this call to care for others is such a fantastic thing

143
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:05,839
if we understand kind of the essence of it that to care

144
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:11,200
is good for our own hearts to care i feel like it's such a fortunate thing

145
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:17,119
to be able to care for people being connected to people and

146
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:25,520
and i remember how surprised i was when i first discovered this this new feeling that i had never had before

147
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:31,200
i was i was on a group hike kind of in the

148
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:37,520
day hike in the in kind of the wilderness area that it was kind of hard to uh

149
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:43,040
they're going it was hard we had to climb over some very large boulders and little teeny little cliffs and

150
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:48,559
you know it was you know for someone who was not in good shape or was elderly or something

151
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:55,119
it was quite hard to uh you know it was a little hard he needed help so i noticed this one a woman who needed

152
00:51:55,119 --> 00:52:00,640
help so i just stayed behind made sure i was never you know that was on the back near where she was

153
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:05,760
and whenever it seemed like she needed help i was right there to kind of give her a hand or something

154
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:12,400
it seemed like a simple thing to do but i started feeling uh not good not good about myself it wasn't like i felt

155
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:17,599
proud or anything there's this kind of tingling warm feeling that her heart has

156
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:23,280
happening in my heart and it was like i just couldn't wait to do it again for her

157
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:29,359
to help her because of this it was like it was like i don't know i was going to say candy but i don't know if that's

158
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:35,280
the right thing to say but it just felt so sweet and so pleasant so enjoyable to feel this

159
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:40,960
tingling warm feeling every time i had a chance to to care for her and help her it was a very

160
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:49,200
simple thing to do just help her over these boulders and i felt that many times since

161
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:56,240
and so rather than caring for others being a burden or a drag

162
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:03,200
it's it's something it's like it's opening to something inside of us that kind of maybe makes us sing or gives us

163
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:08,319
a good feeling so these masks that we wear

164
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:13,520
you know i read also today that they're expecting

165
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:20,480
that the covet surge is going to happen this winter for a variety of reasons partly because of thanksgiving and partly because of christmas and kind of

166
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:26,880
a repeat what happened last year and which was pretty bad last winter in spite of the fact many people are

167
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:32,800
vaccinated now and and so again i thought about that story and this idea of caring for others

168
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:39,280
and what if we will go through thanksgiving as if we had it was up to us to care for

169
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:45,920
the whole nation because who knows the pathways but with this this invisible force

170
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:51,520
travels right buddhists have been relying on thinking about invisible

171
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:58,480
forces for a long time the invisible force of good will invisible force of kindness the good

172
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:04,640
visible force of generosity that spreads out and comes back and turns

173
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:10,240
travels around and has you know amazing effect on the world

174
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:17,200
and now we have a society that's all concerned about this invisible to the eye this force of this virus

175
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:22,559
and uh you know it's people who don't know that they have it you know

176
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:29,359
are bringing it to people who shouldn't have it because they're easily compromised and get sick

177
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:38,559
so to to to care as if ever to care as if everyone counts

178
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:45,359
to care for everyone everyone is important everyone matters

179
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:51,680
and these masks i feel is a symbol of kind of caring for everyone

180
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:57,520
and we don't know we'll never know these invisible pathways by which our

181
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:03,520
life affects other people you know it could be that someone has

182
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:09,599
asymptomatic with coped and they

183
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:15,040
i don't know they don't wear a mask and go into a

184
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:21,040
store and lean over someone who's pulling out something from the shelf and somehow

185
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:28,160
they're that spreads to the next person and they never know it spread to the next person

186
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:35,558
and that person spread it to the next person and next person was someone who

187
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:44,160
got sick maybe even died so these invisible ways in which we

188
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:50,079
affect each other now and and to care about that

189
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:56,160
but caribou not because it's a limitation not because we are

190
00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:03,599
uh limiting ourselves but the opposite it's like kind of an unlimited life

191
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:08,880
to live a life where we don't try to protect ourselves i don't know protect ourselves but we

192
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:17,359
don't try to live with a conceit it's all about me and what i want my preferences

193
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:24,240
but rather kind of in certain a very healthy way be able to put aside

194
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:31,440
excessive self-preoccupation which is kind of stressful anyway

195
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:38,079
and instead allow the chance for this movement of the heart this movement of

196
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:44,799
care love kindness compassion friendliness for others

197
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:51,680
so i i know i'm i'm inspired by this idea i feel like it's been part of the fruit of my buddhist practice

198
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:57,599
i can i've watched it kind of slowly grow over decades you know this movement of

199
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:04,160
of uh just feeling pretty natural and of course i think this way

200
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:09,280
so for me the idea of wearing a mask getting vaccinated in such things just

201
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:15,440
seems like it's just a natural expression not for caring for myself but caring for everyone else

202
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:21,760
and i feel kind of fortunate i mean it's terrible this virus and it's terrible that so many people are sick and dying

203
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:26,799
but i feel given that's the case i kind of feel that i'm in a fortunate

204
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:33,520
position that i'm able to have the ability to to do simple things

205
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:39,680
that express his care and so that's you know and i said at the

206
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:44,880
beginning when i came here and saw all of you with your masks on it kind of made me happy

207
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:50,960
that kind of made me wow is it so pretty pretty nice that uh other people are doing this it is the

208
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:57,920
requirement to wear it when you come here so so didn't maybe make too much out of it but but um

209
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:04,640
but anyway it made me kind of happy and content

210
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:11,200
so no one's useless no one is unworthy of our attention our

211
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:17,920
care and and what would happen if we lived in a world where we cared for everyone

212
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:23,280
and even the people we don't know and and

213
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:31,680
if that was the orientation we had i think we'd probably all be happier

214
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:41,760
so those are my words for today and uh we have you know time if any of you would like to ask any questions or

215
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:48,559
make your comments or anything you'd like to say it's your it's your turn now that we're finally in

216
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:51,559
person

217
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:53,839
are there any other teaching stories that come to mind um relevant to the covet situation

218
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:57,400
the covey situation

219
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:06,319
well it's probably not this is this one's also been in my mind today i don't think because of covet but uh we can

220
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:11,599
probably make a nice connection that we that's one two these wonderful thing about stories you can kind of interpret

221
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:18,079
them so maybe maybe we can make a connection there's a story of um i've told this

222
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:24,720
plenty of times but i like it a lot of uh

223
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:31,440
in in india they have these uh ugly little troll like

224
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:38,559
beings called yakshas and so there was one of these

225
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:44,160
ugly little troll like yaksha tree spirit kind of thing that

226
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:51,040
made his way up into the heavenly realms to where the great god of the highest heaven brahma

227
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:56,559
the palace was and went into the palace one day when the great brahma wasn't there and

228
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:02,000
and hubbled along and hopped up onto the brahma's chair that chairman is thrown

229
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:08,720
and no one sits on brahma's throne with brahma so the other gods in the court

230
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:15,359
got you know kind of upset and so you have to get down from there and the more upset and more angry they

231
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:21,359
got at the yaksa the bigger and bigger and more beautiful and radiant the yaksha became

232
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:26,720
and so after a while they got frustrated didn't know what to do anymore they couldn't get him off and he was getting

233
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:34,160
big and strong so they went and found brahma and said brahma

234
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:41,520
this thing is happening back at the palace and on your throne and uh oh it's okay i know what to do

235
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:47,280
so he went back to his palace and stood in front of his throne and stood firm sir the front of the yaksha

236
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:52,400
and bowed to the yorkshire very deeply and said very kindly and friendly you know

237
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:58,640
i'm happy to see you and i hope you're comfortable up there and things are good for you and

238
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:04,799
you and your family and and as he did that they actually got smaller and smaller and smaller and

239
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:12,640
smaller until at some point poof the yaksa disappeared and then brahma went on his throne

240
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:18,839
and he said and explained you know this was an anger eating

241
01:02:18,839 --> 01:02:24,799
yaksa the more angry you get the more food he has the bigger he grows

242
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:31,920
so if you want to kind of deal with him what you do is you're friendly and then he shrinks and he disappears

243
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:37,599
so it's kind of sad story that he has to disappear but but um so

244
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:46,760
can you relate that to the covidien yeah i think so can you explain

245
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,480
there's a lot to be angry about but it doesn't feel good

246
01:02:53,200 --> 01:03:00,400
and uh and what does it feed uh feeds itself anger feeds anger it

247
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:06,799
makes me better at noticing things to get angry about but then

248
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:12,480
getting past the preoccupation with the stuff that i have the right to be angry about

249
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:19,440
getting past that feels so much better great and the anger gets nothing done

250
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:25,359
anyway so if you're angry and your anger is making yourself anger angry angrier

251
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:31,039
what if i got angry at you also would that would that help you grow even

252
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:36,880
more no oh no it wouldn't help anger grow oh it would help my anger grow yeah yeah

253
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:43,039
yeah yeah i'm not my boot in nature so we could all help and really kind of

254
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:48,079
stir it up and really get it going here yeah

255
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:55,039
well sometimes i think there's you know this is one of the trends in our society is people are feeding each other's anger

256
01:03:55,039 --> 01:04:01,280
and this anger yaksha is growing and then some of it's related to this kova right there's a tremendous amount

257
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:09,119
of anger and hostility and that is related to this and i don't i think it's feeding the wrong thing

258
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:13,838
including the people who are angry at the people who are angry

259
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:22,440
so that was my attempt to tell anybody anybody else had another interpretation of the story

260
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:37,400
anything else any would like to bring up

261
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:46,559
well this expands a little bit on your story about the masks um

262
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:53,119
yesterday i had thanksgiving dinner with my goddaughter and her family and um

263
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:58,160
it was a very caring gathering we've been doing this now for

264
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:03,200
about 30 years and none of us had masks

265
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:09,640
i mean we were all vaccinated and things like that so

266
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:18,000
so it felt safe and

267
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:28,079
i i really did feel cared for you know i and i felt like i could care for others

268
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:35,200
um my goddaughter has a three-year-old daughter so i'm a grand godfather as well

269
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:42,160
um yeah so i think there's

270
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:49,200
there's a lot of ways that we can show care for each other and

271
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:54,559
i just wanted to offer that and you know kind of in the spirit of thanksgiving

272
01:05:54,559 --> 01:06:03,160
beautiful wonderful yeah there's there is an infinite number of ways we can care for each other

273
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:28,319
mostly what i want to share is the tremendous appreciation i have for

274
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:34,480
the opportunity to sit in community and

275
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:44,720
as i was going through the day-to-day driving i

276
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:50,960
had this feeling of of gratitude and this sense of

277
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:57,119
driving and the sense of sliding through the air

278
01:06:57,119 --> 01:07:04,480
and that feeling was so common in the past before

279
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:10,480
covering before i would come and have plenty of practice

280
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:15,920
and i was re-recognizing myself

281
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:21,599
as i was having this sense of of gratitude

282
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:28,440
in um and felt the appreciation for

283
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:36,000
re-encountering the practice appreciation for re-encountering the practice yeah nice

284
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,880
nice because i lost so much of it during this time

285
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:47,960
and thank you for coming today so we can be together yes

286
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:03,200
and your name is uh i'm ji young um

287
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:08,400
it's nice to be here in person um

288
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:14,720
i just wanted to add what came to my mind when i was listening to this

289
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:21,040
i think to me that uh the tree spirit it's uh it's actually war

290
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:28,000
it kind of works around fear and i guess like if there's a more uh element that i

291
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:34,000
can go crazy about like being afraid and like

292
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:40,318
whatever choices that i make out of fear

293
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:45,359
sometimes it can look like

294
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:51,679
i i'm i might it can be a same choice that i can make out of care too

295
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:59,600
but i wouldn't feel the same and i guess listening to you it's um

296
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:06,798
it's nice to see the possibility of that putting in care

297
01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:12,080
nice yeah so if i understand you interpret you so it's possible to wear a

298
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:18,719
mask out of fear yeah and it's possible to wear a mask out of care it's the same behavior

299
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:25,838
but you might as well get the credits for the for the care

300
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:31,600
this is you know it's kind of free you're doing the same thing and uh

301
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:38,480
and uh and the credit you get is in the heart when your your heart knows it feels very different if it's upper is

302
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:44,799
that is that to the point yeah and also that's kind of uh

303
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:50,238
my ongoing inspiration i guess um

304
01:09:50,239 --> 01:09:55,920
is this meditation practice i i guess i i'm still in a phase of kind of taking

305
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:01,360
care of my uh kind of uh it's just just fear is everywhere

306
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:08,320
and i just cannot get rid of it but i guess i'm kind of uh this is good

307
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:14,159
way of exercising that the more i try to push away that it's

308
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:19,760
gonna actually become bigger and like a more like like the tree spirit yeah absolutely yeah so

309
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:25,840
i think probably underneath the yaksha he was so angry the anger eating he was probably afraid

310
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:32,560
and so the friendliness was creating safety and let something relax yeah so the meditation is definitely a

311
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:40,640
way to meet our fear in a different way than than being afraid of it or angry at it

312
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:49,360
great thank you thank you um so uh i i uh this is actually my my

313
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:55,760
third time um coming to imc in person now so i came last monday and then i came yesterday and

314
01:10:55,760 --> 01:11:02,400
today and um you know i've been such a long time and um it's just i'm just having so i'm so

315
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:07,920
happy and uh when i heard that there was a you just they were saying there was an in-person retreat irc that also just

316
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:12,960
made me so happy like um and uh

317
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:18,719
and you know and yeah the the wearing mask part it actually doesn't doesn't bother me it's it's it's okay and and i

318
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:27,040
i love the way that you kind of made it feel even easier and and even more wholesome to to do that um

319
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:32,880
and i'm also just kind of noticing the impact so like yesterday and today i could just kind of feel myself sitting

320
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:39,679
and it was almost like you know there's just like being in the room and being other people meditating it's just like almost like it's like

321
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:45,280
it's like uh you know polishing or something like or you know shaking

322
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:51,440
things up more than it would otherwise and um and today like when i was i was driving and i noticed like a really

323
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:58,080
unpleasant emotion a very unpleasant feeling coming and all the thoughts kind of swirling

324
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:03,600
around trying to like you know i don't like this feeling i don't want to feel this feeling

325
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:08,960
you know this means that you know why why again and why now and i realized

326
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:14,960
it was a feeling that you know i notice it a lot in meditation retreat and and you know by really

327
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:20,480
paying attention to it and caring for it and really having a lot of continuous mindfulness it does kind of heal

328
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:26,080
there's healing um you know but then in the day-to-day life i think it's coming a lot and and the

329
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:33,440
way i react is by just kind of trying to avoid it or not think about it or distract myself or something like that but i'm just already feeling

330
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:40,640
that you know just coming to this this uh um imc just three times or it was it was um is already like

331
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:48,000
oh wow you know reminding me of this possibility of you know mindfulness in everyday life so i'm just so happy fantastic what a great
