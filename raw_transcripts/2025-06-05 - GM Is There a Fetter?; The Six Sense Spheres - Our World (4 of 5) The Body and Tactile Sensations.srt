1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:06,359
so welcome and good day good morning or afternoon or

2
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:12,759
evening wherever you are and

3
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:19,720
uh i welcome you to this fourth day of a brief exploration of the six sense

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:26,560
spheres the avenues for our experience of everything that happens in our in our

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:33,840
lives and i'm hoping that looking at each of them in turn this week um will kind of

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,879
emphasize how important it is to be aware of our mind's relationship to each

7
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:48,399
of the physical senses and to investigate that relationship as part of our path it's really useful are we tied

8
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:56,320
you know to the experiences of seeing hearing tasting smelling sensing in ways

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:05,680
that limit us you know in ways that keep us uh stuck keep us bound is this six sense the the mind is

10
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,439
it relating to the physical um sense contact in a in a wholesome helpful way

11
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:17,759
or is it reactive is it grasping is it pushing away it's in the relationship of

12
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,880
the mind to what happens that goals arise in our you know in our

13
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,560
lives in our minds in our practice in our relationship to the world and when

14
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:36,320
that relationship is free of greed and aversion and delusion then uh that's

15
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,200
where freedom is found so it's

16
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:48,079
essential and today the focus is going to be on the sense of uh touch you know

17
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:55,680
that is what we call the the tactile sense you know the way the the whole body and all its individual parts sense

18
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,680
touch from the most subtle uh sense of air you know moving against

19
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,560
the skin to the strongest sensations of pleasure and pain so

20
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:14,200
sensation on the surface of the body and also sensation generated from within the

21
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:20,319
body and you know we often just use this shorthand sensation for this uh this

22
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:29,239
kind of sensing although all the all the senses uh experience some kind of a sensation

23
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:35,920
literally but um i think the fact that we use the word sensation for uh for the

24
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,120
tactile sense maybe points to how much space it kind of it takes up in in the

25
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,920
world of the senses

26
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,080
and i have the sense meaning something different by sense here you know i have

27
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,840
the view kind of that the sensations of the body and the activities um of the

28
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,560
mind are probably also the area of physical experience where we're most

29
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:11,319
likely to attach a sense of self i think it's um it's probably easier to

30
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:18,280
recognize seeing hearing taste smell as processes that go on kind of

31
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,519
automatically to see the ways that the mind takes possession of them in a way

32
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:31,760
and then to kind of parse it out to separate the appearances from the recognition the nama from the rupa in

33
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,040
those other four physical senses maybe it's just my own perception but it

34
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:43,120
seems like the mind is more likely to take the tactile sensations in the body

35
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,480
uh personally you know they belong to me they're my sensations we don't usually

36
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:55,280
speak about my sights or my sounds or tastes or smells but but what we see and

37
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,319
what we see and we and here we don't we don't think of as defining us in some

38
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:08,000
way but uh the relationship between the body and the sensations that occur in it and

39
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,439
to it they're kind of harder to uh to separate i think it's really easy to

40
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:20,400
conflate a pain in our in our back with a uh with a sense of self you know i am

41
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,520
a person with back pain i'm a person whose back hurts i'm it's me it's about

42
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:32,160
me and if that's the case you know it makes sense to uh to really make a lot of

43
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:38,560
effort uh significant effort to to recognize the distinction between what's

44
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:45,759
happening in the physical body the actual sensations and uh and the and the and

45
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,840
the body that's that it arises in noticing the sensations knowing it's the

46
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,360
body that's feeling the sensations and uh and then maybe we can see the

47
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:04,720
feathers the knots the attachments that arise and dependence on the two including that

48
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,639
sense of possession and identification with both the pains and the pleasures of

49
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:17,919
the body sensations arise in the body

50
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:25,400
they are not the body itself and the body is not

51
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,520
me so in our meditation today you know i'll just i'll invite you to um attend

52
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:38,560
to sensations in the body as they arise you know noticing how they appear and

53
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:45,120
after a while they disappear um in meditation with our with our eyes closed

54
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,880
and our focused inward we can tune in to bodily sensations more closely than when

55
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:57,680
we're kind of in the midst of you know daily interaction with with other people

56
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,960
this river of experience you know the flow of experience that is our lives it

57
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:09,280
can become quite simple a flow of sensation and uh often accompanied by

58
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:17,880
mental activity of course so let's uh let's begin the

59
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,960
meditation by as always uh taking a a

60
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:29,919
comfortable meditation posture with that balance of uh

61
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,600
alertness uprightness and uh and ease no

62
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,600
straining

63
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:50,319
awake and at ease it's ready to receive what arises

64
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:57,479
in the body and in the mind ready to be present

65
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:17,639
just feeling into uh what it's like to be sitting or lying down right

66
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:24,199
now the sense of the shape that the body is taking how the limbs are

67
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:31,280
arrayed in space kind of a global sense of what it

68
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:39,360
feels like to be just in the in the posture that you're in right

69
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:46,880
now the contact with the whatever your whatever your body is resting on whether

70
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:54,759
it's a chair or a couch or a bed or floor cushion

71
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,560
you're probably in a familiar posture you know maybe the same posture you take

72
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,080
every every time you meditate

73
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:19,199
just kind of settling into that and being aware of how it feels what the

74
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:25,319
sensations are what the kind of overall the sort of gestalt the overall feeling

75
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:31,240
of what is it like to be in this posture

76
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:48,720
and as usual if there's tension somewhere in the

77
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,560
body might take a few deep breaths and just let the inb breath move into

78
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:04,480
the area of of tightness or tension and and let the outreath just calm the

79
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,399
body just let the tension flow out with the

80
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,880
with the

81
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:24,200
breath just a few breaths like that

82
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:54,160
finding some ease in the body you know just being here in a very very simple

83
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,160
way

84
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:36,680
and spending a little bit of time with the the sensations of breathing

85
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:47,320
just invite you to follow the sensations from where the cool air enters the

86
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:57,360
nostrils right down through the soft pallet the back of the throat down the

87
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:03,519
windpipe into the lungs you know inflating the lungs expanding them

88
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:10,720
pushing the rib cage out a little bit as the breath goes all the way down

89
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,880
to the bottom of the lungs and the belly

90
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:21,279
expands feeling that and then the sensations of the

91
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:29,120
breath as it leaves the body noticing how the belly contracts and the

92
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:35,959
chest falls and that sense of warmth as the air that's been warmed by the

93
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:42,480
body comes up the windpipe and back out the the

94
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:56,120
nostrils it's a cycle it happens so many times every

95
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:02,760
day and there are sensations all along the pathway

96
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,480
and then now i just invite you to open your awareness to receive all the other

97
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:14,199
sensations that are arising in the body as as we sit here

98
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:24,320
maybe sensations on the outside of the body coolness of the skin or warmth

99
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:32,720
depending on what the temperature of the air is sense of clothing touching the skin

100
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,279
in different places maybe tingling or

101
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:45,920
pulsation in your hands or other areas your arms your face your

102
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:54,279
lips maybe there's discomfort somewhere

103
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:03,800
maybe there's pleasant sensation arising just due to

104
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,519
the to being in

105
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:24,399
meditation sensations are arising in the body all the time and and we can we can

106
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,800
know them they can be known receptively very

107
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,040
simply very

108
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:42,360
simply and of course there can be mental activity

109
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:49,639
accompanying the sensations maybe there's just a simple

110
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:56,320
knowing this is tingling this is warmth this isn't aching this is the breath

111
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:03,600
this is an itch just simple or maybe there is some

112
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:12,040
kind of hook a feather wanting the breath to be more

113
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:20,040
even pushing away an ache wanting me to be

114
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:28,240
quiet wanting something to happen some deepening some somebody to to

115
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:36,920
develop just notice how the mind

116
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,160
relates the

117
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:59,880
sensations does it try to make them my sensations

118
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,880
sensations that say something about

119
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:11,600
me just notice and and see if you can just let that

120
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:17,240
go just let it go

121
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,960
whatever is arising in the body and whatever the mental

122
00:20:52,960 --> 00:21:00,360
relationship is to it just just know it for now just as simply as

123
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:08,120
possible if there's a hook just know it

124
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:16,039
don't need to try to let go of it just know it these

125
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:22,320
simple sensing what's

126
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:27,440
arising sensations mental

127
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,360
activity knowing them directly

128
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:19,799
so now take any ease and

129
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:27,120
uh sense of peace and calm um that has uh developed has that you've cultivated

130
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:33,279
during this this period of meditation and

131
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,039
uh offer it

132
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:46,120
outward to others all the others who are

133
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:52,640
joining the sit today and all all

134
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:58,398
the others who aren't everywhere throughout the

135
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:10,760
world with a wish that all beings

136
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:19,399
everywhere have the the strength and balance to uh to meet their lives

137
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:23,279

138
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:36,760
hey that they be safe that they be

141
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:09,210
[Music]

142
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,679
so welcome again and

143
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:18,320
uh this week we're looking at um all the ways that our relationship to uh six

144
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:24,000
sense spheres our world can um either get in

145
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,080
the way of the deep clear seeing that's needed for

146
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:35,600
insight or can actually support the cultivation of that deep clear seeing

147
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:41,039
and today i'm going to talk about the fifth uh sense in this list the the body

148
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:48,720
itself and the tactile sense the sense of touch the body you know there's so many

149
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:55,039
complex processes that are going on constantly all the time the body is a

150
00:32:55,039 --> 00:33:02,480
kind a vast field of uh uh of sensations arising all the time and we can have an

151
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:10,399
itch in an arm and a pain in the knee and a delightful tingly sensation in our chest

152
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:16,559
all at the same time sensations can be vague they can be precise they can be

153
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:23,960
easy to locate or they can feel kind of diffuse hard to pin down

154
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,480
there are the subtle sensations of uh breathing that we spend a lot of time uh

155
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,760
many of us do anyways attending to in our practice and then the many grosser

156
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:41,080
sensations of movement that we feel as we move through the

157
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:49,120
world as we act and all the ways that we receive uh

158
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,559
tactile sensations give rise to slightly different sensations in different areas

159
00:33:54,559 --> 00:34:02,799
and they're all accompanied by some kind of mental activity recognizing defining approving

160
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:11,919
enjoying resenting ignoring wanting more of wishing would stop etc etc it goes on

161
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:17,240
and the instruction in the texts is to notice is there a fetter

162
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:22,398
here is there something in the relationship between the sensation and

163
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:29,280
the sensing that is pulling us toward more craving and clinging or in the

164
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:37,440
opposite direction toward more wholesome states so the fedters uh it's not a

165
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,960
feder if it's pulling us in the opposite direction it's just a mind an activity

166
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:48,560
of mind that's that's not fettering us not tying us down so the feeds that

167
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:54,280
arise are uh they're just as varied and numerous as the as the possible kinds of

168
00:34:54,280 --> 00:35:00,560
sensations there's so many flavors of uh you know of aversion ill will uh greed

169
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:09,040
desire there's so many so many flavors and um and there is that sense

170
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:16,240
of taking possession of a of a self you know um and so which you know which

171
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:21,920
kinds of sensations do we uh do we experience that that are most likely to

172
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:27,680
lead that kind of lead to that kind of attachment to uh taking a self and i

173
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:34,480
think pain is definitely one physical pain especially if it's um if it's a

174
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,599
kind of uh constant chronic um we can question

175
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:46,160
the sense you know my pain my pain that can arise when we feel uh pain

176
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:54,320
especially ongoing pain what if it is just instead just pain just pain just

177
00:35:54,320 --> 00:36:02,280
pain simply what's arising in the same way as the touch of our clothing you

178
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:09,520
know the touch of wind on our skin there's no meaning attached to it no no

179
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:15,520
taking possession of it you know mbsr mindfulness-based stress

180
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:21,680
reduction was really initially invented for just this kind of uh situation to

181
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:27,200
learn a new relationship to physical pain and when we're able to sense

182
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:34,119
different uh different sensations whether they're painful or pleasurable without reactivity without creating

183
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:40,320
stories about what they mean about making them mine you know we can find

184
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:46,079
more balance with them we can be present with them without adding uh any kind of

185
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:51,560
unnecessary stress without giving rise to

186
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:56,800
dooka and of course at the opposite end of this the sensation spectrum there is

187
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,920
uh uh pleasure you know um maybe the

188
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:09,680
kind of pleasure that comes from the exhilaration of of physical exercise or the the texture of a food we really like

189
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:16,640
the touch of someone we love sexual pleasure no strong pleasure is also an

190
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:22,720
area where the mind likes to uh create meaning and to take possession where the

191
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:29,599
attachment to the pleasure as as mine there's something that defines me that

192
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:35,920
can show up really easily in that uh in that kind of situation

193
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:41,520
craving for pleasure is one of the most powerful fetterss that uh that arise in

194
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:48,200
us i think it's um you know can pleasure just be pleasure something

195
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:54,960
enjoyed recognized as transient you know coming due to conditions passing away

196
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:02,160
when conditions change even the desire for simple comfort can be a fetter you know it can

197
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:08,400
keep our choices narrow confined making us

198
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:15,839
overcautious it's good to explore is to inquire and there are of course you know

199
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:23,440
sensations of either both difficult and uh and pleasurable that kind of um ask

200
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:30,240
us to act especially on the difficult side you know sensations that tell us that we're too close to a fire or a hot

201
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:37,280
stove the example that's often used or that our nose is in danger of freezing you know if we're somewhere that it's

202
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:44,240
really cold we act to protect the body's integrity the sensations that are su uh

203
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:50,200
symptomatic of some kind of uh illness um health change

204
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:56,640
uh or a an uh uh some kind of an injury

205
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:04,480
we need to use our minds to discern you know is this something that needs further exploration or um is it just a

206
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,920
passing experience but we can also relate to uh these kinds

207
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:17,200
of sensations in unskillful ways of course you know even if there is something that needs to we need to take

208
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:24,680
action about we can catastrophize we can move into paralysis unrealistic fear

209
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:31,000
denial all those things are fedters you know they add mental stress to what is

210
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,720
already difficult painful

211
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:44,960
and the craving for bodily pleasure of course is something that human beings have been driven by for as long as we've

212
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:51,560
existed you know there's a biological imperative behind some of our sense desires related to the

213
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:57,520
body and we can know we do know that the mental states that arise in dependence

214
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:03,760
uh on desire for bodily pleasure um uh they can really get us into

215
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:09,560
trouble they can cloud our vision i think every human being who

216
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:16,480
is older than 20 has been a teenager just by definition dragged

217
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:25,599
around uh often by sense desires related to the body and many uh many people have

218
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:33,440
experienced the dooka of addiction you know craving physical craving for pleasure so strong that uh that we seem

219
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:42,640
powerless in its presence often based on the on that on that physical craving

220
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:48,960
some particular sensations that we want to have arise as well as cravings for tastes and

221
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,640
aromas which i spoke of yesterday and the the buddha gave

222
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:02,440
teachings that can help us get more clarity when we're in the grip of some desire that has arisen along with bodily

223
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:08,720
sensation or with the desire for some particular bodily sensation to arise he

224
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:15,079
described his own practice um uh with the six sense

225
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:23,040
bases when he experienced um uh pleasure as a result of any sense contact seeing

226
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:28,640
hearing feeling whatever sense contact it was he investigated it in terms of

227
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:35,040
its gratification danger and escape maybe you've heard this teaching

228
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:40,319
before the gratification of course can be the the pleasantness of the sensation

229
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:46,040
itself or it can be the mental activity that that arises in dependence on the

230
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:53,920
sensations and then the danger is what the pleasure can lead to clinging to this pleasure clinging to

231
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,960
something that is impermanent that cannot provide lasting satisfaction

232
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:04,960
knowing that okay this is the danger of this this is not going to last craving

233
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:13,119
to bring it back again when it goes that's a feder and the escape comes with letting

234
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:18,640
go of the attachment to the pleasure the buddha stated that he had to be really

235
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:24,800
clear about the gratification and the danger in order to have the escape

236
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:30,640
that's it's really important to keep that in mind it takes time to get clear

237
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:37,280
about what is it we actually are you know feeling gratification in in this uh

238
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:44,079
situation and what's the danger it takes time but when we use our discernment to

239
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:51,440
see what it is that hooks us in the realm of the senses then we are gaining wisdom we're moving in the direction of

240
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:57,040
the escape so i'm going to share a story

241
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:05,119
about myself here um as a teenager i began smoking cigarettes and my parents both smoked um

242
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:10,160
i'm not blaming them but the fact that they did was a condition for curiosity

243
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:15,440
in me for the desire to experiment it was kind of a familiar thing and it

244
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:21,119
wasn't too long after i started before i was addicted to uh to smoking and i

245
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:26,319
smoked for about 10 years quitting a couple times during that period but

246
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:32,400
always pulled back by the desire to feel a particular kind of pleasure in the

247
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:38,319
back of my throat as i inhaled the smoke i can still remember that sense that the

248
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:43,680
feeling of that pleasure and then i saw this little paperback book i i can't

249
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:49,119
remember the title but it was about giving up bad habits in general

250
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:56,160
and the technique that it described was right in line with the buddhist teachings about the gratification the

251
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:02,960
danger and the escape and of course i didn't know that at the time the idea was to make a list of all the things

252
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:09,599
that you didn't like about your bad habit the danger and i made a very long

253
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:14,640
list about things of things that i didn't like about smoking and the

254
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:19,920
instruction was to read that every day every time you were tempted to uh engage

255
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:25,280
in the bad habit and i did that i noticed that if i just hung with

256
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:30,640
the desire for a cigarette without giving into it it would pass that was a

257
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:36,240
a revelation the craving was impermanent you know not that i defined it in that

258
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:42,560
way then of course as time went on the sense of danger grew in me and the

259
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:48,480
desire gradually ebbed i never smoked again after going through that practice

260
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:57,040
except in my dreams sometimes and i would wake up feeling guilty but i had made a final escape from the craving to

261
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:03,200
uh to smoke and i think that technique can be a really useful way of working

262
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:09,040
with uh with strong desires that we know are obstructing our ease getting in the

263
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:16,720
way of seeing clearly listing all the ways the desire doesn't serve us all the dangers that

264
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:22,800
are in uh that are in the uh in the habit all the ways that it disturbs our

265
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:29,119
peace and gives rise to dooka when the obstacles in our minds and

266
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:35,520
hearts to moving in a in a a healthy direction are strong then we need to

267
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:41,599
remind ourselves you know often again and again of the danger before we're

268
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:48,079
really going to believe it really take it on but when it's very clear i really

269
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:53,520
believe escape will come and first we have to know the

270
00:45:53,520 --> 00:46:00,280
gratification so you know in our

271
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:05,760
uh in our practice of meditation um as samadei develops there can be really

272
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:11,839
beautiful delightful sensations in the body filling the entire body and they're

273
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:17,880
a really beautiful part of the path a lovely part wholesome arising due to the practice

274
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:23,119
itself and we can enjoy those we can encourage their continuation their

275
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:28,800
onward leading but if we begin to cling to them that clinging it becomes a

276
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:34,160
fetter it is a fetter as meditation deepens further you

277
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:41,440
know as samadei really deepens the equinimity that arises isn't characterized by pleasant bodily feeling

278
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:49,359
it's sublimely peaceful but the bodily experience is neutral so clinging to the

279
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:57,040
pleasure of samadei can actually create a kind of a road block obstructing our progress towards the the deep uh

280
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:02,200
equinimity that leads to to insight

281
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:09,119
so these five physical senses are ways that we perceive uh the world and the

282
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:14,599
the final sense the mind and act and its activity is where the conceiving

283
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:20,640
happening happens and that's the that's the biggie and uh remember in any moment

284
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:27,520
there are only two things happening there is what is happening and there's how we relate to what's happening and

285
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:34,960
the activities of the mind are how we relate to what's happening so uh that will be our topic

286
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:42,119
for tomorrow um the place where the fedters really get going

287
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:48,560
so i hope you have a lovely day and i look forward to seeing you tomorrow

288
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:52,119
thank you for your attention
