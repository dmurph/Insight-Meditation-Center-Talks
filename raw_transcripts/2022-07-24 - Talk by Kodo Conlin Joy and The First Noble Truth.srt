1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,120
and good morning

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,920
all yeah how's the sound yeah

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,720
great so we'll start with a sitting is it a little

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,359
high thanks good thank you yeah we'll start with a sitting

5
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:35,079
let's um welcome ourselves to the

6
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:47,000
seat beginning with reconnecting our bodies

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,520
to the Earth this companion of ours

8
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,079
that's always with us

9
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,040
so first inviting the attention to the

10
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,280
point of contact with the

11
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,000
Earth sits bones low

12
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,920
body finding your stable base for

13
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:16,319
and upon that stable base little bit by little bit allowing

14
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,920
the spine to grow long and

15
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:29,040
Tall all the way up through the crown the back top of the

16
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,840
head

17
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,920
as the spine grows long you may find your body adjusting

18
00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:04,519
itself you may want to roll your shoulders back and let go of any of the tensions in the upper body

19
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:50,439
and the invitation and for this half [Music] hour is to let the

20
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:56,959
upright steady alert yet relaxed

21
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,439
body guide the attention

22
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:17,439
bringing our attention to this breathing

23
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720
body

24
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,639
for

25
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,680
for for

26
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,960
and as we settle into contact with this breathing

27
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:16,039
body you may notice you may notice tensions or

28
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:19,960
contractions build up over a few

29
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:29,919
minutes and with an easy deep breath full inhale and exhale

30
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,919
just letting those

31
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,919
go and renewing the

32
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
posture

33
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,520
for for

34
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
for

35
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
for

36
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
for

37
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
for

38
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
for

39
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
for

40
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
for

41
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
for

42
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
for

43
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
for

44
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,120
for for

45
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:16,120
to accompany this breathing

46
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:21,199
body with our simple straightforward

47
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:29,000
attention in its textures and temperatures

48
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:42,000
and when the inner Worlds the images

49
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,680
fantasies have the

50
00:14:52,920 --> 00:15:01,040
attention the moment of recognition oh fantasy

51
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:10,399
and then gently releasing the thought the idea like a

52
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,839
helium balloon letting it float away into the

53
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
sky

54
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920

for for

71
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:55,398
to accompany this breathing body

72
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:07,520
releasing any of the tensions the

73
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:12,679
Holdings that build up or

74
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,440
accumulate easing

75
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:30,120
into a simple settled awareness

76
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,240
Here and

77
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
Now

78
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
for

79
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
for

80
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159

for

84
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,039
for

85
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,039
for

86
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,960
for

87
00:30:56,919 --> 00:30:59,919
for

88
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:29,919
for

89
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,880
for for

90
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,398
and in our last minutes of this

91
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,880
sitting the invitation is to

92
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:05,600
release relax any

93
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:13,080
effort in the meditation relaxing the

94
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:20,799
body relaxing the mind to sense

95
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:29,398
into in your experience now if there's any any hint

96
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:41,720
of the wholesome qualities of settl or ease or collectedness that have

97
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,320
Arisen just a minute to appreciate

98
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,720
those and if there's no hint of that in the experience

99
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:05,240
is continuing to accompany the breathing

100
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,720
body for

101
00:34:52,719 --> 00:35:07,770
[Music]

102
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:17,680
so again welcome so nice to be with you and my name is

103
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:26,079
cotto it's such a pleasure such a pleasure to be here I I have um a lot of appreciation and respect for

104
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:31,800
the the practice at the IMC and IRC communities here and in Scotts

105
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:37,320
Valley I feel a very very strong connection to this place so uh it feels

106
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:42,839
wonderful to manifest that here with you um and a pleasure to sit together I

107
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:48,880
mean to spend a Sunday morning sitting in meditation sharing in the Dharma talking about the

108
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:54,599
Dharma in this bit of relative Stillness which I'm not sure for you but

109
00:35:54,599 --> 00:36:00,839
stands in some real contrast to how the attention can be during the week sometimes I feel like a caffeinated

110
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:07,319
bumblebee moving around from flower to flower it feels quite nice to just

111
00:36:07,319 --> 00:36:15,560
simplify and settle the attention on the on the body and the breathing so the theme for today is joy

112
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:22,040
and the first Noble Truth and the perspective that I want to

113
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:29,880
I want to discuss this morning is that there's a way of looking there's a way of understanding this path of

114
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:34,960
practice of course emphasizes this first Noble Truth of Dua which I'll unpack a

115
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:41,680
bit but step by step there's also joy happiness pleasure in different forms

116
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:48,640
all the way all the way along so of course of course many paths

117
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:53,880
in Buddhist practice and many of them emphasize this teaching of dukka the

118
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:59,160
first Noble Truth dukka suffering unsatisfactoriness

119
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:05,800
now why why is that emphasized so much and just what is

120
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:12,359
that let's start with the why and then we'll talk about the what so to illustrate this I'd like you

121
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:19,119
to imagine um let's say you have a little bit of an injury let's say you've twisted an ankle and it doesn't seem to

122
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:25,079
be getting better maybe you have a sprain you have decided to consult a

123
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:30,839
doctor so you make an appointment you make your way there uh you make your way

124
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:37,960
to the second floor uh you wait a little while and then it's time for you to see the

125
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:44,920
physician as you as you make your way to the examination room usually they're empty but you see the doctor is already

126
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:50,160
in there and you think huh okay you take your

127
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,800
seat and before the doctor can turn around before they can ask your name

128
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:01,880
before they can see your ankle before they can feel look talk to you ask any questions for the sake of this example

129
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:07,000
they have no information they write a prescription and they hand it to you and send you to

130
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:14,200
the pharmacy how effective can we imagine that remedy

131
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:19,640
might be compared to one where there was an examination and such maybe not so

132
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:24,960
maybe not so effective so it seems pretty natural as

133
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:32,400
a principle that to have an effective remedy we have to understand understand the ailment and that the more fully we

134
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:38,078
understand the ailment like deeply really the

135
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:44,800
better so it's just like this so similar in our Dharma practice and this this is

136
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:50,079
one reason that the teaching of dukka this teaching of suffering is emphasized so

137
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:57,079
much it's the ailment that we study it's the the condition that

138
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:03,079
Buddhist practice mindfulness practice aims to

139
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:10,359
address emphasizing this point the Buddha is often quoted as saying in the past monks and also now I teach

140
00:39:10,359 --> 00:39:16,880
suffering and the cessation of suffering in the ancient text one way

141
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,599
that the final goal of the practice is described is as the full understanding

142
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:29,359
of dukka the full understanding of suffering that then in turn liberates

143
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:35,240
so this gives us a sense this gives us a sense of why this is focused on so much the

144
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:42,079
liberating potential of understanding Dua and the metaphor to be healed to be

145
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:47,440
freed of the ailment through full

146
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:54,440
understanding and how about the what just what do we mean duka ancient

147
00:39:54,440 --> 00:40:00,160
word apparently canotes a wheel that's a little off kilter clun clunk duka duka

148
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:05,640
clun clun and in brief the teaching points to

149
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:12,400
this entire spectrum of experiences uh of suffering and stress

150
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:19,880
everything from these maybe we can relate to some of these like the the the fiery grip of ill will the stress of

151
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:28,440
that or something as profound as the grief of the loss of a loved one

152
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:34,880
all the way to something quite mild the stress of mild physical discomfort that comes along with having

153
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:42,119
a human body and then the very subtle stresses involved in the simple acts of

154
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:47,160
perception and knowing very

155
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:54,160
subtle and then back out to the most profound things we all share like the stresses of Aging illness and death at

156
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:59,599
some point in our life I say those three quickly but I as I say them I notice I

157
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:06,200
kind of want to slow down and appreciate that it's something that we all

158
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:12,400
share so this entire Spectrum from the gross to the subtle to the profound of

159
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:20,040
suffering and stress in brief that's what we mean by

160
00:41:20,359 --> 00:41:29,240
dukka and for this talk what I really want to emphasize is that with with a working definition like this

161
00:41:29,319 --> 00:41:35,119
our understanding of Dua deepens and grows wise as we practice

162
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:40,920
with it as we practice the recognition of stress in our lives and its

163
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:46,319
conditions and its release not just wise mentally but our

164
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:51,640
heart grows wise so where do we begin with the

165
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:58,000
practice of duka first Noble Truth

166
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,839
first important principle I want to bring in for the practice of dukka is that we don't address suffering in the

167
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:10,000
abstract duka doesn't doesn't address a suffering in the abstract but in

168
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:17,720
fact it's presented to address specific stress this specific stress for specific

169
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,000
people that's

170
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:29,119
us and just as the skilled doctor doesn't address the concept of the twist ankle they actually get in there and

171
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:35,800
relate to your own body your own ailment in this sense the teachings of

172
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:43,720
dukka point to point our attention to our own direct experience our own direct

173
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:52,520
experience and I think that welcomes us to pause at any time and say oh how is this for me now what's here

174
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:59,040
now is there is there any any level of suffering and stress here how is it and

175
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:06,319
just as we were doing in the meditation feeling in what are the textures here what's the temperature the particulars

176
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:12,200
how is this manifesting in my body my heart and impulses and in my

177
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:19,640
mind and this way of looking at dukka

178
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:26,359
uh very closely related to our practice of mindfulness our sitting practice our

179
00:43:26,359 --> 00:43:31,520
practice of awareness what is it I can know and understand

180
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:38,400
directly through my experience so it applies whether we're

181
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:45,480
seated applies whether we're walking whether we're talking whether we're working this careful attention this

182
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:52,800
mindfulness and this skill of discernment what's going on here begins to reveal more and

183
00:43:52,800 --> 00:44:00,160
more layers and subtleties of duka and this uh this growth of understanding

184
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:06,400
is the trajectory of our practice so in my own experience and

185
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:13,359
also talking to other people there there are certain things that begin to reveal themselves as we practice mindfulness as

186
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:18,558
we practice mindfulness of dukka mindfulness of

187
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:25,760
stress and one is it won't take long before we before we encounter these sorts of stresses that

188
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,880
we all share that I paused to appreciate a moment

189
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:37,119
ago we all go through the the sufferings and stresses of birth presumably though

190
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:44,839
I I don't know how many of us remember um those of Aging when my my

191
00:44:44,839 --> 00:44:51,839
body stops working the way that I relied on it for

192
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:57,640
illness and eventually thankful to our

193
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:03,839
very sophisticated Minds able to know that someday we will

194
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:10,920
pass so simply our practice of mindfulness with dukka again it

195
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:17,680
reveals uh it reveals these sort of universal experiences in their particular

196
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:24,160
manifestations and all of their Dynamics and all of their shapes and

197
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:29,480
structures and again this in itself is the path and there might be something in there

198
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:35,720
there might be something in there where uh we have these we have these experiences of duka and mindfulness

199
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:42,680
meets them and maybe there's just a touch of relief maybe there's just a touch of a

200
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:48,760
touch of ease that comes in through a practice of awareness maybe something in the heart

201
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:55,760
begins to grow easeful and still and wise this can start to hint at the

202
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,920
relationship between Joy

203
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:10,839
Anda another thing that might begin to reveal itself in uh in practice of mindfulness

204
00:46:10,839 --> 00:46:17,640
of suffering and stress is the pars this practice of how is it now how

205
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:24,119
is it manifesting now how is it shifting changing great example is while we're

206
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:29,640
meditating physical pain physical pain I don't know about for you

207
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:37,160
for me it often arises as a a single uh monolithic signal it's like a big

208
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:46,480
no in the mind no thank you but you know mindfulness practice

209
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:53,359
getting a little closer both to that big no thank you and into the actual

210
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:59,440
Sensations this phrase is really coming up for me this morning text and

211
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:06,119
temperatures how hot is it is it moving is it pulsing is it sharp is it

212
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:11,280
soft mindfulness of stresses begins to reveal these

213
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:17,599
particulars it's true in the in the in the world of physical sensation it's also true in our emotional

214
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:24,920
life when anger arises as a big no thank you advanced

215
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:33,119
practice what's the constellation there the constellation of Sensations thoughts and impulses that I call

216
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:41,559
anger so again practice of mindfulness begins to

217
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:48,920
reveal through discernment the actual situation and because Dua is Shifting

218
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:55,760
and changing and it's not just one thing actually that's one of the most

219
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:03,760
hopeful hopeful points of the practice because these experiences rely on conditions the conditions can also

220
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:10,400
fall away so as our discernment

221
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:19,119
deepens another thing that begins to reveal itself is the importance of clear discernment of the experience

222
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:26,119
itself and our relationship to that experience the experience itself and our

223
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:32,839
relationship to the experience and how a how a skillful or unskillful relationship to experience

224
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:38,480
can either compound the stress or maybe the word

225
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:45,119
undermine undermine to illustrate this I want to tell a little

226
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:53,079
story it's a story about two phone calls um when I was uh when I was

227
00:48:53,079 --> 00:48:59,400
younger when I was younger uh first phone call I received and I learned about the

228
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:05,079
passing of my grandmother I remember hearing the

229
00:49:05,079 --> 00:49:10,480
sound I remember the shock and I

230
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:16,720
remember the the following days kind of actually just being numb because it was so much for me it was so much I couldn't

231
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:26,000
feel much and the grief took a really long time second phone call some years later

232
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,400
I received on the very last day of a Meditation Retreat I'd been sitting doing

233
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:37,200
mindfulness of the Body for 10 days and I got this important

234
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:45,079
message Cotto there's a phone call for you phone same ear almost the same sound

235
00:49:45,079 --> 00:49:52,160
cot your grandmother has passed away other grandmother had passed owing to the state of the mind

236
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:57,920
and my relationship to experience at the time what happened this time

237
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:03,920
heard the sound go in I felt the body register the body really registered the

238
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:09,640
experience and it was it was amazing it it was like a uh bubbles from top to

239
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:15,520
bottom it just and within a couple of minutes the

240
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:23,040
the sensations had actually passed I hadn't um I hadn't suppressed or pushed away the experience it fully

241
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:28,680
registered and it was entirely clean such

242
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:34,520
that uh after after my body processed in that way I was able to completely be

243
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:42,520
there for the person on the other end of the phone two very very similar stimuli very

244
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:49,599
similar news over the telephone wildly different experiences in terms of compounding the

245
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:56,440
suffering or not and I want to take care here it was through no fault of my first version of

246
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:01,240
me that the suffering was compounded those were the conditions of the

247
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:07,319
moment but just to say there's the experience relationship to that

248
00:51:07,319 --> 00:51:13,920
experience and how it can either compound or not compound suffering one of the things that starts

249
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:20,520
to reveal itself is the practice of mindfulness and discernment grows in US

250
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:40,079
so this development of mindfulness and discernment in relationship to

251
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:46,000
suffering on this path toward full understanding of suffering and stress

252
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:52,319
this full understanding of duka it happens gradually of course of course just like the other other ways we grow

253
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:59,240
in our lives right um but I often find myself coming back to this quote from the Buddha

254
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:05,040
describing this saying that just as the great ocean has a gradual shelf a

255
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:11,720
gradual slope a gradual inclination with a sudden drop off only

256
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:17,160
after a long stretch in the same way this dhma and

257
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:22,280
vinia this practice this way of life has a gradual training gradual performance a

258
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:28,400
gradual practice and I find that encouraging because a practice that's

259
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:35,319
that's uh that so emphasizes mindfulness of suffering and stress um especially on the mental level

260
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:41,040
it can hurt can really hurt so it's encouraging me to know to me to know

261
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:46,839
mindfulness and and discernment they develop gradually gradually gradually

262
00:52:46,839 --> 00:52:50,480
even if it doesn't feel so good as we're

263
00:52:55,079 --> 00:53:00,440
going and of course course there is good news one of the next things that we

264
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:05,520
begin to discern in uh mindfulness and discernment

265
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:12,880
practice is how duka and jooy happiness well-being they

266
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:19,520
accompany each other all the way along the path all the way along and I find this

267
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:28,480
so interesting um that's that uh if I zoom out if I

268
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:33,839
take any particular experience if I view it wide enough both elements are there

269
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:40,319
that's fascinating to me and and isn't it more complex and aren't there instances in our lives

270
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:45,839
where of course there are the joys and the pleasures and of course there are the sufferings and the stresses and how

271
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:51,520
they mingle I think this is this is a very rich area for

272
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:57,720
practice I think of maybe something many or all of us remember remember do you remember the

273
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:03,200
pleasant anticipation of the ending of shelter in place like oh I'm going to

274
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:09,400
see people I see Hands going [Laughter] up and I don't know about you but that

275
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:16,160
was followed by a real awkwardness and over stimulation it was

276
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:22,240
so easy to be over stimulated the joy and the stress right there

277
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:28,240
together or in terms of work um I can imagine a sort of the

278
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:33,319
joyful direction of working toward a project or a promotion or something

279
00:54:33,319 --> 00:54:39,119
coupled with the stresses of overwork or even Leisure a day at the

280
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:44,599
beach and then there's the sunburn these are just some everyday

281
00:54:44,599 --> 00:54:52,400
examples at a sort of Broad View that incorporate both and then of course we see we see

282
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:58,640
this close relationship between dukka and joy in the

283
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:04,680
teachings I think even of the first and second Noble Truths Dua and its arising duka and

284
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:09,880
its cause sometimes real emphasis on the

285
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:16,960
difficulty the stress and then the third and fourth Noble Truths there's cessation the path to the

286
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:23,440
ending of cessation the relief of release the joy happiness wellbeing represented by the third and the fourth

287
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:30,200
noal truths and I really appreciate how how close

288
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:38,119
they are how close they are what the relationship is I think this is well represented by a a Zen

289
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:47,839
phrase in front of the Cliff of dead trees flowers and plants are always in

290
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:01,319
spring so to look further into the teachings I think we can see that that

291
00:56:01,319 --> 00:56:08,160
Dua and some form of skillful happiness whether it be Joy or gladness or well-being or happiness is associated

292
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:13,240
with the entire path in terms of the three trainings the

293
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:20,400
trainings in CA the precepts virtue the training in concentration Sami

294
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:26,720
collectedness and the training in wisdom Liberation and letting go

295
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:32,799
in terms of the training in CeeLo one of the great pleasures of the ethical

296
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:39,280
training is called the Bliss of blamelessness the Bliss of blamelessness

297
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:44,680
where the the mind that's free of remorse knowing that it has not harmed a

298
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:51,319
being knowing that it has not harmed a being such joy and settledness in the

299
00:56:51,319 --> 00:56:57,160
mind and it has a very close relationship to understanding how we

300
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:03,559
create Dua for ourselves and others through our actions very close relationship that

301
00:57:03,559 --> 00:57:09,200
actually encour encourages our restraint and gives way to this sort of

302
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:13,960
pleasure and then of course in terms of the training and

303
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:22,480
somadi this very deep settled joy and well-being that comes from a unified

304
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:28,480
mind very closely related to developing the discernment of the stresses and the mental

305
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:35,240
activities that actually get in the way of the Mind unifying the real discernment full

306
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:42,559
understanding and then the training of wisdom Joy is a factor for

307
00:57:43,319 --> 00:57:48,599
awakening uh of these seven factors that when they're fully mature issue in a

308
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:53,160
full understanding of dukka and Awakening

309
00:57:57,079 --> 00:58:03,319
another teacher put this puts it this way there's no scarcity on the path of beautiful

310
00:58:03,319 --> 00:58:09,720
scenery the flowers know how to laugh and the birds know how to

311
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:18,000
sing another interesting interesting twist here is that the same practice of

312
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:26,280
mindfulness and discernment that we we apply to dukka also applies to our Pleasures our Joys and happiness

313
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:33,079
very generally very roughly speaking we might begin to see that there are ways of relating to our

314
00:58:33,079 --> 00:58:38,359
Pleasures that bind and Fetter and there are ways of relating to Pleasures that

315
00:58:38,359 --> 00:58:45,359
free and liberate and again here it's the relationship it's the

316
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:51,400
relationship to the pleasures of course there are there's

317
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:58,280
this teaching of the five chords of sensual pleasure that are are said to Fetter or

318
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:03,799
bind and uh venerable saruta one of these Chief Disciples of the Buddha in

319
00:59:03,799 --> 00:59:11,319
the in the time of the early s when explaining this someone had a really good question for venerable saruta and

320
00:59:11,319 --> 00:59:16,920
said these experiences we get tied up with these five chords of sensual

321
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:24,200
pleasure the eye and sights ear and sounds nose and smells tongue and tastes the body and tactile

322
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:30,200
Sensations venerable saruta is it the eye that is the issue here or is it the

323
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:35,720
thing is it the sight is it the ear or is it the sound

324
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:42,520
nose or the smell tongue or The Taste venerable saruta give me a clue I want to I want

325
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:50,240
to learn how to be free and he said oh in fact it's neither it's not the eye it's

326
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:55,599
not the sights it's not the ears it's not the Sounds in fact he says it's the craving

327
00:59:55,599 --> 01:00:02,599
and cing linging that arises there that fets this is really good

328
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:08,480
news really good news sometimes I don't know if this ever arises for you but

329
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:15,599
sometimes practitioner will get the notion that oh I'm not supposed to see hear taste or touch

330
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:21,200
anything venerable saruta is saying no it's okay for you to be a human and live

331
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:27,119
a human life to have these sense experiences and the thing to see the

332
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:32,680
thing to become intimate with is there a relationship of craving and

333
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:39,119
clinging relative to the these senses if so binding

334
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:45,760
fettering and these of course stand in contrast to these um maybe what I'll call liberating Pleasures or liberating

335
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:52,440
forms of happiness that we we talked about a minute ago this Bliss of blamelessness doesn't tend toward

336
01:00:52,440 --> 01:01:00,359
generating craving and clinging the mind is in a wholesome State doesn't tend to develop that

337
01:01:00,359 --> 01:01:07,359
relationship same with the pleasures of a collected mind and the happiness of Letting Go

338
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:13,280
moving in the opposite direction so a simple question a simple

339
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:18,760
heuristic as you're going going uh going through your practice of mindfulness and

340
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:24,559
discernment relative to Joys just as relative to Dua relative to

341
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:30,400
suffering and stress what is it here that's Arisen what is

342
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:37,799
this experience and what's my relationship to it is there clinging here or is there

343
01:01:37,799 --> 01:01:45,240
Freedom you can let that let that be information be

344
01:01:45,799 --> 01:01:53,279
information I find a lot of inspiration when I ask myself oh just how far can this go how far does this go which is a

345
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:59,039
little dance step to me thinking about really practitioners and their

346
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:05,440
qualities um there's this book written by Douglas Abrams called The Book of

347
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:10,880
joy you hav't seene lovely cover Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the Dalai

348
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:16,279
Lama smiling I think somewhere maybe on the back cover they're dancing they're

349
01:02:16,279 --> 01:02:22,400
dancing together just fabulous and the one thing that really

350
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:29,039
stuck out to me about uh Douglas Abrams comments about being a part of these

351
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:35,359
conversations was how much the Dal Lama and the Archbishop laugh they

352
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:40,640
laugh someone like the Dalai Lama who has known such

353
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:46,119
profound difficulty and the

354
01:02:46,119 --> 01:02:52,160
Archbishop and still This Joy this laughter I find that so

355
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:58,000
encouraging I hear the same thing about um Suzuki roshi Who was the zen teacher that founded the Zen Center if you ever

356
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,680
read transcripts of Suzuki Roshi's talks he'll get like halfway through a sentence and he'll

357
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:09,079
laugh oh just love it there's a levity there's a levity along with this

358
01:03:09,079 --> 01:03:14,480
intimacy with suffering and stress there are these beautiful joyful heart

359
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:20,319
qualities and these folks that have dedicated their lives to to to practice

360
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:23,799
in their own way

361
01:03:26,359 --> 01:03:34,039
so just as duka is conditioned so too is Joy so too is

362
01:03:34,039 --> 01:03:39,200
joy and this opens a doorway for us this opens a possibility in our practice that

363
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:46,760
that um we can through our observation and discernment uh start to recognize or

364
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:52,559
deepen our recognition how did this come to be not always an intellectual exercise

365
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:58,920
though that reflective exercise is helpful but even on our even on our meditation cushion just abiding there

366
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:04,440
with the body and the breathing as suffering and stress

367
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:11,119
arises and passes away as Joy arises and joy passes

368
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:17,880
away and through keeping a a contact as continuous as we can even if the mind

369
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:25,279
doesn't recognize oh this is how Dua was constructed this is how Joy was constructed the heart knows something

370
01:04:25,279 --> 01:04:31,640
the heart has watched it happen I um one of my teachers really

371
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:37,880
likes to remind me that something maybe even more than three qus of communication happens

372
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:43,760
non-verbally through the body I haven't seen this anywhere but I

373
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:49,079
like to apply that principle to mindfulness practice maybe three4 of what we learn

374
01:04:49,079 --> 01:04:54,240
isn't through intellectual understanding but something even if we don't hear it

375
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:57,839
think it something is is

376
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:07,359
recognized one more encouragement and then maybe a

377
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:11,680
story and that encouragement

378
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:20,920
is something about something about holding joy and Dua joy and

379
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:27,119
stress close to one another recognizing that they can be aspects of one EXP

380
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:34,480
experience what this opens up for me is that it it's not necessarily like there's an onoff switch oh it's just

381
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:40,359
going to be 100% dukka oh it's just going to be 100% Joy but in

382
01:05:40,359 --> 01:05:46,880
fact in fact there can be this mixture and actually I can influence this

383
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:51,920
process there can be these little moments of wholesome qualities little

384
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:59,400
moments of mindfulness tiny moments of discernment tiny moments of recognizing oh this is

385
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:05,279
this is wellbeing just a moment and just like in the DAP drop by drop the jar

386
01:06:05,279 --> 01:06:10,319
gets filled the jar gets

387
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:15,960
filled developing our full understanding of dukka and just filling

388
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:21,920
our bodies and hearts hopefully over time in this direction so we'll be dancing like the Dal Lama and the

389
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:29,440
Archbishop so a story to

390
01:06:33,319 --> 01:06:36,960
close this is from the

391
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:44,920
udana in the time of the time of the Buddha there's a monk venerable

392
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:51,520
badia a former King who became a monk and he's been practicing the Dharma as

393
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:58,000
he does going on alms round and then he'll finish his alms round and do his love this phrase his day's abiding his

394
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:05,359
day's meditation at the root of a tree and the um the other monks

395
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:15,078
nearby overhear the venerable Bia in his meditation exclaiming what Bliss what

396
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:23,799
Bliss and the monks think in their compassionate hearts and their wish for well-being uh-oh the former King is

397
01:07:23,799 --> 01:07:29,839
thinking about the joys of kingship I think he might be about to run away

398
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:35,799
from the training we had better go tell the Buddha such compassionate ones good

399
01:07:35,799 --> 01:07:41,680
friends in the Dharma so they report this to the Buddha

400
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:46,838
and the Buddha invites Bia to visit and says

401
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:53,440
this oh the other way venerable Bia goes to the blessed one to the Buddha as he's

402
01:07:53,440 --> 01:08:01,559
sitting there the Buddha doesn't assume anything I love this too he says is it true

403
01:08:01,559 --> 01:08:09,440
Bia that on going to the Wilderness to the root of a tree do dot dot you repeatedly exclaim what Bliss what

404
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:15,839
Bliss yes pante yes doesn't assume anything the Buddha

405
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:21,480
what compelling reason do you have in mind like why why why are you doing that

406
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:29,640
when you go to the Wilderness when you go into meditation why is it that you repeatedly exclaim what Bliss what

407
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:35,560
Bliss and the venerable Bia gives his answer and he says

408
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:42,838
before before when I was a king maintaining the Bliss of

409
01:08:42,839 --> 01:08:50,600
kingship every every luxury he said I had guards

410
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:56,758
posted inside the Royal apartment outside the Royal apartment

411
01:08:56,759 --> 01:09:06,880
inside the city outside the city just layers of guards and he says I dwell in fear

412
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:11,838
agitated distrustful and

413
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:19,120
afraid but now when I go to the Wilderness when I go and do my days abiding my days

414
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:25,880
meditation I dwell without fear I dwell without fear unagitated

415
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:31,960
confident unafraid unconcerned

416
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:38,199
unruffled living on the gifts of others with my mind like a wild deer

417
01:09:38,199 --> 01:09:44,480
which sounds very pleasant

418
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:48,560
so joy in the first Noble

419
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:56,120
Truth in Sun our path

420
01:09:56,120 --> 01:10:02,360
our practice of mindfulness and discernment of comprehending fully

421
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:10,440
suffering and stress practicing with that I'll say it will not be without its

422
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:16,040
Joys and our path of joy and well-being it will not be

423
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:23,960
without its stresses so may it be at those

424
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:29,600
times of joy joy and in those times of stress and those times when it's very

425
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:34,679
clearly a mix May these practices of mindfulness

426
01:10:34,679 --> 01:10:40,360
and discernment support this onward leading

427
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:48,400
path toward a full understanding of dukka and complete freedom for ourselves

428
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:52,760
and for all beings without exception

429
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:06,080
wonderful so we have um we have just a few minutes if if there are any

430
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:09,480
questions does that seem like that will

431
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:24,400
work it's on it's on okay hello thank you for your talk and

432
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:29,960
the meditation um my question comes in I I love this

433
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:35,239
sense of the suffering and the joy being present at the same time I feel that's

434
01:11:35,239 --> 01:11:41,760
true in my experience and resonates very well this

435
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:50,280
um the opening or the release that allows you maybe to shift towards

436
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:56,520
feeling Joy more fully and a little bit less compounding of the suffer

437
01:11:56,520 --> 01:12:02,600
suffering I guess the the the question becomes you know how how do you remember

438
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:08,120
oh how do you remember that oh this knee is caught right now oh let me release

439
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:14,840
that knee or oh there's somewhere else that I'm unaware of that I'm holding even as

440
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:20,639
I speak this question and feel mostly released but a little bit of energy that

441
01:12:20,639 --> 01:12:25,679
I'm the center of the attention of the question sure sure thank you for the

442
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:35,000
question I imagine this resonates for many of us um it's mysterious isn't it

443
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:40,960
remembering we can ask a similar question when we're when we're practicing meditation and say the the

444
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:47,320
Mind moves into a distraction oh feel free thank

445
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:54,560
you how is it that all of a sudden there's a moment of recognition it's not like we we didn't

446
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:59,760
do that we didn't put it there we didn't put the recognition

447
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:07,520
there there's uh for me I think there's there's comfort and

448
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:14,960
confidence in knowing that we can trust Our intention for the

449
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:23,520
practice as I said as I said that principle of of maybe 75% I'm making that number up of communication being

450
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:29,080
non-verbal I think we can can trust our trust our sense that we have invested

451
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:36,239
something in the practice and the body and the mind know and that intention will manifest in

452
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:44,280
the moment of of stress and you'll see oh there it is and this begins to mature or or

453
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:50,239
deepens uh through repeated practice as a this this phrase I kept

454
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:57,080
using of the heart growing Wise It's almost like it's almost like

455
01:13:57,080 --> 01:14:05,360
the system or the heart begins to recognize sooner that it's in a it's in a a bind

456
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:10,960
or a stress or a tension or something sometimes begins to recognize

457
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:16,639
sooner and then as we through trial and error skillfulness skillfulness in

458
01:14:16,639 --> 01:14:24,000
releasing grows so for me the question uh is um

459
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:30,600
how to keep supporting that intention and then it will work on

460
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:41,080
us how to how to support that intention yeah um I I think it's

461
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:48,159
um all sorts of ways we do this all sorts of ways consistency in the

462
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:53,760
practice good Dharma friends good reminders a sticky

463
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:59,280
note um I get personally I get a lot of support from the practice being

464
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:04,639
regular so if it if it shows up in my day at a certain time it's like all of

465
01:15:04,639 --> 01:15:10,840
the forces of the mind and heart coales and we we're doing this we're doing this practice and something about doing it at

466
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:16,159
the same time of day um builds it into the system and that really helps the

467
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:21,639
intention and then of course there are explicit ways that that you can do this you can you can write about your

468
01:15:21,639 --> 01:15:30,360
intention um friends of mine who practice at the beginning of a sit and at the end of a Sit will give one

469
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:35,520
sentence of their intention for practice just to remind themselves and let that

470
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:42,360
let that guide those are some ideas yeah thank you

471
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:48,440
sure maybe time for one more great hold it like a

472
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:54,520
rockar so you were talking about anger kind of like being say um like saying No

473
01:15:54,520 --> 01:16:01,120
thank you to mindfulness right like that was and so a question is

474
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:06,800
like when um when you have that feeling of anger it's often hard to control

475
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:13,800
yourself oh yeah like um be because like you're just just really upset it's hard

476
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:20,040
it's really hard tool in that moment so like how are you able to be able to

477
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:25,960
control that and just bring it back to okay um and just kind kind of lower it

478
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:31,679
to okay I'm upset but like the level where you're all where you can use

479
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:36,880
mindfulness in order to just recognize that Dua and the joy that comes along

480
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:43,719
with it wow fabulous thank you for the question um what's what's your name Aviv

481
01:16:43,719 --> 01:16:51,320
Aviv Cotto nice to meet you um two things come to my mind yeah

482
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:57,920
well one three things one is like this upwelling of appreciation for the question that that is a that is a

483
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:04,120
difficult thing to to develop that skill maybe we'll

484
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:12,120
call it impulse control where the compulsion the compulsion from anger is so intense or can be so intense and it

485
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:20,080
almost comes along with like this promise of yumminess almost oh if I act this out this is going to feel really

486
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:26,040
good there's something there's something that balances that and that is actually

487
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:33,679
recognizing after the impulse has made its way out say I've acted on acted on anger the balance to the Yum is actually

488
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:39,440
recognizing how how it hurts how it hurts someone else and how it hurts you

489
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:45,800
and paying attention to that is very very skillful training of the mind and heart because you have you have more

490
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:51,360
data and like I said the heart starts to grow wise oh if I if I take this yummy

491
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:59,360
feeling step by expressing my anger oh look I've actually I've actually hurt someone and I can feel how that's

492
01:17:59,719 --> 01:18:07,840
hurt that's one that's one approach and then there are sort of practical things that uh that we can do to support to

493
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:13,679
support impulse control one thing is just like over time practicing it but

494
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:21,280
I'm certain uh whatever you can do and maybe you have some ideas about this whatever you can do to slow down the

495
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:26,880
momentum if you if the if the impulse is there uh if the anger is coming up and

496
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:35,679
really wants to express itself in some kind of way that that may harm someone what can I do to slow down the

497
01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:43,639
process classically one of the approaches is to to um feel the anger in the body feel

498
01:18:43,639 --> 01:18:49,639
its heat and sort of let it sort of Let It radiate out when you're doing that you're not

499
01:18:49,639 --> 01:18:55,120
harming anyone you're not suppressing it or pushing it away or saying oh I'm not angry

500
01:18:55,120 --> 01:19:03,639
but you're also not causing causing harm something that I like to do when I get when I uh when I feel that impulse I

501
01:19:03,639 --> 01:19:09,000
take my oh this is a gill phrase I take my anger for a

502
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:15,040
walk I let the body move because often this be the the last thing that I say

503
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:20,080
the body gets charged with it and and the charge is

504
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:27,960
reinforced by all the sort of chemical changes that happen through anger and it needs a way to move through the system

505
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:33,400
so I take my anger for a walk do a little stretching do a

506
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:40,080
Sprint uh or occasionally I'll go into my room and I'll uh I'll grunt I'm not

507
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:47,239
I'm not I'm not grunting at anyone but I'll make like a and that seems to really help so

508
01:19:47,239 --> 01:19:52,880
basically try to just like feel that ink the heat without really doing anything

509
01:19:52,880 --> 01:20:01,760
and just let it slowly um radiate out until um in until your until um the

510
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:08,600
anger is out enough that you can that you can just then that you're that now

511
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:14,360
like you have have done enough impulse control that allows you to um be able to

512
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:20,400
like recognize the upsetness well said and as you reflected it back I realize

513
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:25,719
there's one more point and I know we're a minute over but it feels important to say

514
01:20:25,719 --> 01:20:31,880
anger you can one way to relate to it it's really good information this can mean that something

515
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:38,360
important has just happened or like something's happening that actually I'm uh my body is signaling that I or

516
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:46,840
someone else is in danger and the information that you receive once um once you have sort of

517
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:52,000
processed anger in the way we're talking about so far then you can take a wiser

518
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:58,800
mind that's not under the influence of that emotion as much and actually

519
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:04,880
discern is there is there harm here is there something is there something I should do about this that I can do

520
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:11,679
skillfully that uh won't harm another won't harm me and can keep us all

521
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:19,520
safe how's that sound to VI yeah that makes sense thank you very

522
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:25,199
much great we've come to the end of our time again my appreciation

523
01:21:25,199 --> 01:21:32,360

524
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:37,440
you enjoy your Sunday we'll see each other again soon
