1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,319
so good morning everyone good day

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:16,280
welcome and um

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:23,519
today's analogy for mindfulness of thinking

4
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:29,760
is to imagine that you are

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,960
you have a colleague you work full day five days a week

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,000
and you have a colleague that you work here that you work very closely to

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,480
close closely with constantly actually in communication about the job and what's going on

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:53,120
but the thing about uh working together you only work together on the phone

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,520
and because it's so constant you have a headset on and i earbuds or something and so

10
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,559
you're constantly talking and you've never met your peer your colleague

11
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,840
and know anything really about them but except for their voice and talking

12
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,680
about work and sometimes you get distracted and talks about politics or talks about

13
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,600
sports or the weather and sometimes it's hard to get back to work

14
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,119
but all you have is the person's uh you know the phone communication

15
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:33,759
and after many years of this there's finally an occasion where you can meet in person

16
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:41,439
and you're stunned to meet the person the person is so different than what i've ever imagined

17
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:47,920
different different body type different

18
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,680
all kinds of differences that different kind of clothes they wear different kinds of mannerisms different

19
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,439
kind of gestures different kinds of ways in which they look with their eyes

20
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:06,799
different emotions that seem to come through and you start you realize that listening to the person on the phone

21
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,800
you only had kind of like one dimension of the person and that when you were in person it's

22
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,760
multiple dimensions and and now you have a feeling for the person's emotional states and

23
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:26,959
and concerns of the day in the moment and how all the little subtleties and ways in which you're responding and reacting

24
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:32,800
and you're aware of the person's body and and maybe the body has some kind of

25
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:39,519
challenge to it that that makes you particularly sensitive and careful with a person

26
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,280
who knows all kinds of things so i think you get the idea that um

27
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,560
some of us relate to our thinking uh that way

28
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,879
that we just relate to the thoughts the content the ideas the stories

29
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,959
the plans and we're involved in the content of thinking and um

30
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,480
and and in mindfulness meditation you're finally getting to meet

31
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,879
the thinker uh the person who you're communicating with and talking with and all that of

32
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:21,280
course it's you but um you start becoming aware that this process of thinking

33
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,480
is not isolated it's intimately connected to

34
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,319
the fullness of who you are you're it's connected to your body all the

35
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:38,080
little micro tensions and movements of your body in response to thinking

36
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:44,840
the energy energies and temperatures in your body shift it's also related to your emotional

37
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,720
life and in fact emotions sometimes are the underlying

38
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,560
fuel for the thinking we do it's related to

39
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,760
all kinds of different aspects of what who we are our history and everything

40
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:08,959
and so to sit in mindfulness and respect your thinking is to open up your eyes

41
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:16,000
and away from the content of what you're thinking to the process of thinking

42
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:24,160
to the mat to all the different processes within you that are engaged and involved as you're thinking

43
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,479
then you can respect the full range of what's going on with um

44
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,840
with thoughts so to not get

45
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:41,759
and in fact they often say that it's often said it's a little bit not 100 true but

46
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:49,759
that content is not important for the process of mindfulness but being present for the process

47
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,040
and almost like you can ignore the content and sometimes when i meditate i imagine

48
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,240
that um my thinking speaking a foreign language i don't know

49
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,759
and uh and then i try to just like i would listen to someone speaking a foreign language i tune into so many

50
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:12,800
different aspects of what's happening as they speak because i can't understand the words the tone of

51
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,840
voice the speed in which they speak the energy by which they speak what they're doing

52
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:24,720
with their body the emotional kind of kind of background or tone which they're

53
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:32,320
talking so the same thing with ourselves to settle back

54
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:39,440
open up and respect thinking as a large holistic process

55
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:46,240
throughout our body so assuming a meditation posture

56
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,840
and gently closing your eyes

57
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:04,000
and if you do this opening up your eyes to the process of thinking now

58
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:12,960
rather than what you're thinking how it's like for you to think what do you notice

59
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,960
is there any physical manifestation

60
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,800
expression manifestation of your thinking

61
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,800
is there any tension in your body

62
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,880
is there any emotions moods

63
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,319
that are part and parcel of thinking

64
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,960
if you open to the process of thinking

65
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,680
i mean holistically what is the space within which you are

66
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:26,240
thinking is there mental space or space of awareness

67
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,919
or is it claustrophobic

68
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,840
how much energy goes into thinking

69
00:07:53,520 --> 00:08:00,400
so then having done that now take a few long slow deep breaths

70
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,319
relaxing as you exhale

71
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,000
relaxing down to your core

72
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,360
then letting your breathing return to normal

73
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:42,320
but continue now on the exhale to relax your body

74
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,000
whatever softening you can do in the face

75
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,640
letting the muscles of the face fall away from the bone

76
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,959
relaxing the shoulders

77
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,640
and perhaps calming the belly

78
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,040
letting it be calm and relaxed in your belly

79
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,880
and now again notice your thinking

80
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:21,839
has anything shifted in how you think are you calmer

81
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:28,920
quieter in your thinking or not

82
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,920
and opening up wider to the process of thinking

83
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:46,399
physicality of thinking as simple as where in your body is a

84
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,720
location for thinking for you if at all

85
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,240
any tension

86
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,959
and as you exhale relaxing

87
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,200
the physicality of thinking

88
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:27,240
noticing the mood or the emotion connected to your thoughts

89
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,880
might be a very subtle pleasant mood or emotion

90
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:41,160
or it might be something that's maybe not so pleasant

91
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,880
whatever it is it's okay for now just notice it

92
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,519
relaxing around your mood your emotion

93
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,920
a softening

94
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:24,399
and what's the energy with your thinking is it an insistent

95
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:32,440
fast strong or is it weak quiet soft

96
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:47,040
and perhaps you can gently calm your thinking

97
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:53,839
the energy of it let it settle

98
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:15,920
and then allow yourself to more fully receive the experience of breathing

99
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,560
breathing in receptively

100
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,600
receiving the inhale

101
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,399
as you exhale allowing the exhale

102
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:46,800
and if quiet gentle thoughts are in the background just

103
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:54,079
you don't need to be concerned with them keeping the breathing in the foreground

104
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,320
but if thoughts predominate open up

105
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,120
your attention to the process of thinking

106
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:12,800
the holistic experience of thinking in your body

107
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,040
your emotions

108
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,680
stepping away from your in the interest in the content

109
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,320
to see the hole

110
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,799
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

111
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,960
see if you can adjust your thinking

112
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:36,880
so that you can think kindly compassionately caringly

113
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:43,200
with a voice or with an attitude that's gentle

114
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:51,559
peaceful confident

115
00:26:53,440 --> 00:27:02,639
and unassertive and to gently think thoughts of goodwill

116
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,720
well-being for others well-wishing

117
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:21,799
may the people in your life be well happy and safe

118
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:31,799
may the people in your communities be happy and well and safe

119
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:44,240
may those people you encounter today who don't know

120
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:50,480
may you be ready to think of them with goodwill

121
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,520
may they be happy

122
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,880
well and safe

123
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:09,200
and to spread out to the whole world gentle

124
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:16,320
thoughts of how wonderful would be no matter how unrealistic

125
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:22,559
it's not unrealistic to wish welfare and others

126
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:31,240
may all beings be well and happy and safe

127
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:42,399
may it be may all beings be happy

128
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:51,200
may all beings be safe may all beings be peaceful

129
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,679
may all beings be free

130
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,679
and almost as if it's second nature that easy and natural

131
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,919
may we contribute to that possibility

132
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:38,320
so here we are at the third talk

133
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:44,320
for mindfulness of thinking the day that uh

134
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:50,960
focus on respecting thinking i like to think that uh

135
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,919
in dharma practice we're learning to respect everything

136
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:01,919
i remember the surprise i had when i was sitting in the meditation hall

137
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:09,039
for a retreat next to a japanese and monk and at the end of the retreat uh

138
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:15,760
people came into the meditation hall to retrieve a little cup that he'd used during the retreat

139
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:22,559
for drinking tea we all had little cups and before he handed out handed away the

140
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:29,039
the teacup he bowed deeply to the cup and and i kind of wondered why i wouldn't

141
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:34,399
bow to a cup but um they kind of opened my eyes to a whole

142
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:40,640
different way of living living living with respect for all things

143
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:46,640
but to do so wisely so thinking it doesn't need to be an enemy for us

144
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:53,120
and we can respect it respect it deeply sometimes i think that thinking

145
00:31:53,120 --> 00:32:00,159
is um you know what we usually think of as thinking it may be the thoughts that the

146
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:07,279
words the inner voice that we speak or the images if we see more in images

147
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:13,120
that pass through our mind that they're kind of the tip of the iceberg

148
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:20,559
and we're mostly kind of involved with the tip of the iceberg but uh there's much more to it or maybe

149
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:27,360
there's a metaphor which is not so icy cold maybe um

150
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:34,640
it's um you know going to going to a city park

151
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,679
and at the entrance way there's a little lawn and you spend all your time just on the lawn

152
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:46,880
and it's just a little part of what this park is all about and the natural preserve perhaps and someday

153
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,480
you go into it and you discover there's so much more to it so

154
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:58,640
the um thinking you know there's there's a surface the content the content of the

155
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:04,480
thought and it isn't necessarily we're respecting the content of the thought i

156
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:10,799
think some content of thinking is a little bit nonsense and sometimes worse maybe it's very

157
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:18,399
unfortunate to certain some content but there's no need to berate oneself or feel bad about oneself for what the

158
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:25,039
content is unless we act on it and then if it's nonsense or if it's

159
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:31,519
actually harmful it's very unfortunate but what we learned to do the way we learn

160
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,039
to excuse me for a moment

161
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:44,159
the way we learn to respect thinking

162
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:51,200
is to not be so involved in the content not be glued to it

163
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:58,159
not invest so much important in the content especially for purposes of meditation

164
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:04,960
but rather bring mindfulness to the holistic experience of

165
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:10,720
of uh thinking and so the art of learning

166
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:17,200
all the component parts of thinking and this is a part of mindfulness in general that

167
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:22,638
to begin seeing things or to think in terms of components

168
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:29,040
composites that things come together from causes and conditions different things exist together in

169
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:35,760
relationship to each other and when we start seeing that we stop kind of reifying or

170
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:41,679
getting too focused or fixated on one particular part of the whole

171
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:47,040
so we're thinking there is one of the most really important areas of thinking if

172
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:53,280
it's really obsessive thinking you're really caught in the grip of thinking strong thinking

173
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:59,119
is there's chances are high that there's an emotion which is fueling it

174
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:05,520
or with out of which it's coming so planning more often than not arises out of some

175
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:12,240
kind of apprehension anxiety remembering something can come from a

176
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:17,920
variety of things it can come from happiness and delight it also come from a desire to

177
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:24,880
to relive it maybe because we're lonely now and we want to kind of remember

178
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:31,119
they can come from anger and resentment that you know review the offense over and over again as a way of

179
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:37,680
somehow making the past better

180
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:43,680
and you know making the past better is kind of a hopeless case

181
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:50,160
past won't change so much but we can shift how we think about it we can shift how we relate to it

182
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:55,599
and so if we're caught in the grip of resentment and that's what's fueling the thinking

183
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:01,839
then we want to bring respectful attention to that resentment is respectful attention to the anxiety

184
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:08,320
whatever it might be the loneliness that might be fueling it the discomfort

185
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,440
that we might feel that kind of music discomfort which is kind of like producing the tension of

186
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:19,440
thinking so each thing to be respected

187
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:25,040
means to take give it a second look to feel it to be present for it

188
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:32,400
and i sometimes think of thinking the content of thought as um like a messenger that's saying

189
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,599
nurse i see it as a signpost sometimes it's uh that this uh the sign is

190
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:42,640
pointing in a direction what's written on the sign is not that important what's important is the

191
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:51,440
direction the sign is pointing and so thinking is pointing back to the emotions out of which it arises

192
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,880
as we feel the emotions and get to know them do mindfulness of emotions as we talked about last week

193
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:03,680
then it might be a time to respect that deeply it might be a time to

194
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:10,720
feel it physically feel the physical manifestation of the emotion and that's also a place where you start

195
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:16,880
noticing the tension in the body that's related to thinking

196
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,920
because the more tension there is in the body the more obsessive the thinking will

197
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:27,599
become usually there's a way in which tension in the body

198
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:34,960
is creates a kind of a mental tension

199
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:42,320
that presses out thinking or or makes thinking more desperate or more important or more insistent

200
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,839
and there's a kind of reciprocal relationship between how much we're invested in the content

201
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:53,920
of the thought and the tension in the body and how much tension we have in the body

202
00:37:53,920 --> 00:38:01,040
and how much we are caught up in our thoughts and it's a chicken and egg thing it's hard to know which one comes first

203
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:06,480
but as we get quieter and quieter in meditation sometimes we can see some of that

204
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,839
we can see a tension arise in the body and lo and behold certain kind of thoughts arise

205
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:18,480
or we feel certain thoughts arise and we notice a tension that follows in the body

206
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:24,480
so all this kind of opening up to be more holistic has a number of wonderful functions

207
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:30,240
one is we learn to wear to place our attention mindful attention and

208
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,599
so it's it's onward leading it's productive it helps us become free

209
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:41,520
and sometimes putting the attention into the content of the thought just encourages to think more and more

210
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:47,280
but to put the attention on the emotion underlying it begins to allow the emotions to settle

211
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:53,200
or to open up or to be processed it also means we're not feeding

212
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:58,400
our thinking with our interest with our involvement with them

213
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,920
and thinking generally will start to dissipate if we're not directly interested in them

214
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:09,680
and involved in them uh if we just kind of let them go um

215
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:15,280
there's this wonderful teaching and some of you know this better than me i'll never never remember

216
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:21,760
that the number but there's this idea that emotions never last more than some like 90

217
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,880
seconds unless we're feeding them and fueling them and

218
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,240
so it's relatively short it's kind of surprisingly short the researchers have found and i have no

219
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:38,640
idea whether that's true or not but i certainly know there are times when if i bring my attention to my emotions and

220
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:44,000
really be present for it it seems to kind of relax pretty quickly

221
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,359
but thinking is even faster that uh if we no longer fueling the

222
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:56,880
thoughts they they last a millisecond it's very short and so the perpetua perpetuation of

223
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,079
thinking has a lot to do with how we're feeding it and involved in it and engaged in it

224
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:08,160
and this idea of respecting thoughts is to open up more widely to feel

225
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:14,240
the wider ecology of thinking that's going on the emotional the energetic

226
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:20,319
the physical the motivational sometimes it really helps to notice what motivation is

227
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:26,240
behind the thoughts uh if we might be planning a lot maybe the motivation is to make ourselves safe

228
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:31,359
when we show up at some event and to recognize oh that's the motivation

229
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:37,040
um then and feel that maybe that needs our attention it's like a signpost pointing

230
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:43,119
back and then oh i'm anxious let me feel my anxiety let me practice

231
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:50,720
with that and breathe with that and as we do this mindfulness and respect it begins

232
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:56,800
opening up the space in the mind or the space in the heart so there's more space more room

233
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:02,079
to hold all things to hold our emotions hold our thoughts

234
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:07,280
without being glued to them or trapped in them

235
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:12,560
and this idea so it's a wonderful idea this idea that we're making space

236
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:18,640
rather than getting rid of things rather than fixing something we make more and more room in space

237
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:24,000
and then lots of things don't have to be a problem uh when there's lots of space for them

238
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:30,720
and when we're claustrophobic then it's like we're troubled by it and pushed around by it

239
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:38,480
so this idea of respecting things both is valuable for what we're paying attention to but also it's a

240
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,680
it's a means by by just kind of stepping away and

241
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:50,319
opening up and holding things with a wide open a mind wide open heart

242
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:56,640
and uh and not being troubled by what the content is and finding our home

243
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:04,880
in the kind of a spacious open relaxed uh um field of awareness field of

244
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:12,480
kindness field of respect field of freedom that uh that holds all things

245
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,599
and this is a really wonderful thing to open up to this wide

246
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:23,599
kind of scope of attention that where there's freedom

247
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:28,640
to be found without changing anything and

248
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:35,599
and it's a power it's kind of a superpower to do that and um it's uh changes kind of as a game

249
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:42,160
changer in many ways for our life so um

250
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,839
may you respect your thoughts no matter how difficult they are or painful they

251
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:53,599
are maybe they're messengers pointing to something deeper inside of you they're

252
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:59,359
the tip of the iceberg that you really what you want to tip of the

253
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:05,440
you know whatever that uh you really want to start dipping down into the

254
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:10,880
fullness of who you are and really seeing there it's a way of respecting yourself

255
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:16,400
to really take time to get to know all of who you are not just the voice that's thinking in

256
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:23,040
the head so um thank you all very much and

257
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:27,480
we'll continue this process tomorrow
