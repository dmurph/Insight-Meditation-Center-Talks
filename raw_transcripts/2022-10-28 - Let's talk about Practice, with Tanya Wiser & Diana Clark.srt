1
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:26,720
how's the volume can you hear me okay through the speaker okay

2
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:52,439
you did yeah so um they say they can hear me okay

3
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:57,780
volume it's loud enough it doesn't sound very uh no it doesn't I

4
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:04,020
don't really hear it um there we go is that better okay

5
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:10,880
yep okay let's see how's Diana sound

6
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:18,120
how does this and it's yeah

7
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:25,379
how does it oh this is a definitely louder maybe it's a little bit too loud thinking that

8
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:34,400
because then I will try to speak really quietly and then that doesn't work so well yeah I think it's still

9
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,980
yeah can we make turn it down just a little bit there we go there that I think that's a little bit better I guess

10
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:47,400
I have to talk non-stop so you can figure it out I think this is it has it for you guys is it too loud

11
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,739
okay I don't know if anybody's on the other side of that camera are we getting any

12
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:57,860
comments okay

13
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:06,420
are there meditation centers down in Mountain View in Saratoga

14
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:14,220
there's one in Mountain View yeah the Shyla Catherines is at a church I'm

15
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:20,700
not sure the name of the church but and I think she also has something in Saratoga she is like on Thursdays in

16
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:28,920
Saratoga on Tuesdays in Mountain View or something like that I think so there used to be a different

17
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,500
person different oh yeah oh I don't know

18
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:40,319
actually I don't know yeah we're like friendly neighbors but

19
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,000
we're not like the same organization

20
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:52,819
did you used to come on Mondays or Thursdays okay

21
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,120
and there's one in San Jose I know that's further south

22
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,720
you know I'm sorry I can't tell you but like I've been there but uh forget

23
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,739
Jelani is the teacher and I think if you go to our website

24
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:24,240
I think there's a link on our website to her songa or her contact information

25
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,460
yeah Shyla Catherine you can Google that name

26
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:36,120
that's the Mountain View teacher okay and possibly Saratoga it used to be in Circa together I don't

27
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,880
know if it still is and then forget Jelani

28
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,060
I think she pronounced it Jalene jalane okay

29
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:59,400
there's a lot of meditation in the Bay Area there's a lot so whatever you're interested in you can find I think

30
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,180
pretty much

31
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:23,840
okay so somebody else arrived so this is a good sign if there are more students than teachers

32
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:32,419
but it's okay if there's not also all it takes is one student that's right

33
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:46,220
hi Anne Rose a small night glad you're here

34
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:22,039
hi come on in

35
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:42,300
we'll start with a guided meditation so I'm just going to wait a few more minutes and just see if a couple more

36
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:48,479
people show up or just let us relax and and also if there's any other questions

37
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,699
or comments people want to share you know is a great time anything that your

38
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:59,060
practice coming up in your practice or anything else

39
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:04,699
I think I'm gonna get a soft food to sit on great

40
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,979
remind me your name Iris

41
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,500
okay and then well

42
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:33,020
John John and Rose I'm Tanya Weiser

43
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:40,020
you have like the best uh family name wiser I just love this name this is so

44
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:45,180
great wiser and this is the Diana Clark

45
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:50,840
but we could say that maybe both of our names wiser like you know being wise

46
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:57,780
clerk is derived from clergy so kind of you know a teacher or leader or

47
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:06,060
something like this so spiritual yeah so both of us have a we were meant to do this I don't know we

48
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:13,639
just made this up but I like it John

49
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:20,180
and well Iris and Rose

50
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,900
and Richard and Richard

51
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:33,479
so um tonight the focus will be on concentration practice just

52
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:42,380
um sort of what is concentration meditation how do you do it some of the real simple Basics nothing complicated

53
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:49,519
um and so you know we'll like I said we'll start with a guided meditation

54
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:56,519
and um I think I'll just say first of all maybe let me ask when I say

55
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:02,399
concentration practice what comes up for you what are your associations and if

56
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:09,120
you don't mind and Rose you could get the mic and help out with the mic just make sure you speak into the mic this

57
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:16,740
will help me help you hearing a little bit about your associations and relationship to this

58
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:22,680
idea so you have any thoughts to share on Rose yourself

59
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:29,640
okay I would say for me for concentration as I've been doing this practice has been like noting my

60
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:36,959
thoughts and then just knowing and not getting lost in them too much as I'm

61
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:46,380
as I often do so like oh I'm noticing feelings of frustration or anger or

62
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:52,500
uh just sadness or whatever and and just just being with those feelings

63
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:58,620
while I'm sitting and also on the breath and and also not getting mad when I'm

64
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:03,779
when I get lost in thought and I can go back to whatever anchor it is so I think

65
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:12,120
concentration for me is a host of things but uh I know if I'm doing too much then I'm

66
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,160
then that's also a problem that I have because I'm straining and

67
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:23,040
and that's I don't like that feeling yeah thank you Amber Rose thank you do

68
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:30,120
you have anything John that you would like to say about your thoughts and associations with concentration practice

69
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,500
nothing particularly okay

70
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,580
ah good idea

71
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:51,300
uh for me it's just something that I'm focused to do or just purposely focusing myself to do

72
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:57,120
something okay great and Iris any thoughts from you um maybe you have this idea of what

73
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:03,060
concentration practice is and it kind of brings me anxiety because

74
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:09,779
I guess I normally practice open awareness and even doing that it's so it's hard for me to kind of even just

75
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:17,339
focus on my breath consistently so the idea of concentration practice where maybe I associate it with longer periods

76
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:24,540
of focusing on the breath um that seems really hard okay yeah yeah

77
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:30,600
if I can't share a little story about this that um there was a time I was on a

78
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:36,540
long retreat and so I was gone for a couple of months and I came back and I

79
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:41,940
had to take care of something at the bank and the bank person wanted to know like

80
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:47,100
why didn't I take care of this earlier I'm like well I was out of town and you know I don't didn't have access to email

81
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:53,640
and all this kind of stuff and then they were perplexed you might imagine these days it's not so common to

82
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:59,279
be completely unplugged and um so I said well I was on a Meditation Retreat and

83
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:06,660
this person said ah really did you do like astral projection were you like in different places at the same time and so

84
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:12,959
I thought oh this might be what a lot of people think about when they think of concentration or doing a lot of

85
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:18,120
meditation it's all about I don't know superpowers or something like this so I

86
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:25,220
just wanted to share that story that's great and so is that the kind of concentration practice we're going to teach here tonight

87
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:31,680
well actually I'm teaching it right now because actually my physical body's in another location and I'm like a

88
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:40,160
translocator I thought you were in a you know reference yourself on YouTube no not that

89
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,660
nope sorry yeah so

90
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:52,019
um I I had this idea for guiding you that it's a good maybe a little

91
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:58,019
different than normal um because I want to kind of just explore a little bit

92
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:05,600
what our relationship is to concentration and different ways we might connect with it

93
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:11,760
um and before I I start I'll sort of say there's two what they call there's two

94
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:18,540
different forms of concentration practiced and one of them is kind of a

95
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:24,240
kind of a you have your breath you're aware of your breath and then oh a thought comes up so you know you're

96
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:31,139
thinking and then there's a sensation and you're aware of a sensation so you go from the breath to a thought to a

97
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:37,500
sensation in in succession right but you're aware of each thing so it's I've

98
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,600
heard this described as serial monogamy

99
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:48,120
so we have intimacy with one object at a time

100
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,639
but it's serial relationships right so that might be uh the more of the open

101
00:13:53,639 --> 00:14:01,320
awareness kind of um concentration where we're it's just this this close connection to each thing as it comes up

102
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:06,720
and the other kind of concentration is where you might have an intimate uh

103
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,820
ongoing connection to one object like the breath

104
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:17,399
um so they're both they're both ways that

105
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:23,760
we can become concentrated actually and they can both lead to very deep states

106
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:29,820
of connection and seeing into our experience and settling in the mind and

107
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:36,360
calming so whatever way it goes for you

108
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,639
great and um

109
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:47,300
part of part of what concentration isn't is struggling

110
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,920
so as much as you can let go of the idea that you need to try and make something

111
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:58,500
happen and you need to be in conflict with and struggling to make it happen or

112
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:04,860
upset about what's happening as much as you can just forget all that the better

113
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:13,500
so with that as the introduction let's consciously find a posture

114
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,480
that we would like to meditate in

115
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:27,420
so remembering this idea of kind of a there's an uprightness if not

116
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:34,980
at least in the body to some extent also in the mind an uprightness an interest

117
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:43,040
a commitment to showing up for our own experience for witnessing

118
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,420
experiencing our present moment experience so just

119
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:54,899
you know how would we be attending if we believed that what we

120
00:15:54,899 --> 00:16:01,380
were doing was really important that what we're doing right now is

121
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:07,579
important so just sort of okay yeah this matters

122
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,899
and then taking the moment to rock your posture a little bit lean forward and

123
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:20,160
back and you know a little bit it sort of helps you find that centered space you know if

124
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:25,740
we move a little to the right a little to the left oh yeah here we go right in

125
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:30,899
the middle and same with forward and back because

126
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:38,279
we can be a little too far forward or leaning slumping a little too far back so just rocking a little bit here and

127
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:42,139
finding that like uprightness

128
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:50,820
and you'll all have your eyes here closed which is supportive for

129
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:56,100
concentration practice you know but if you need to open your eyes

130
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:01,380
it's okay to have a very soft gaze just just a bit of in front of you

131
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:07,459
resting the eyes not really looking but just resting the eyes

132
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:13,020
okay so feeling this sort of arriving in

133
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:18,780
this posture in this uprightness

134
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:28,620
like all you need to do right now is to feel sense feel into

135
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,960
your present moment experience

136
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:41,299
being curious about what this body feels like in this moment

137
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:47,120
what this breath is like

138
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:54,120
maybe take a few longer slower breaths

139
00:17:54,120 --> 00:18:01,980
with that exhale you can invite a sense of letting go of the day's stress

140
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,720
of any over efforting

141
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:12,250
[Applause]

142
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:22,860
oh Richard did you put push record I did not should I push

143
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:28,799
okay so just that deep breath in followed by

144
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,700
the exhale

145
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:52,460
and this idea of resting our Awareness on this experience we're having

146
00:18:54,059 --> 00:19:01,500
sort of letting the awareness of what's Happening kind of follow and be with

147
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:08,240
whatever is most clear in your experience

148
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:17,700
to me this feels a little bit like one of the things I love to do

149
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:27,360
which is in a warm ocean on a beautiful day is to float on a raft

150
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:33,600
like one of those air mattresses where the water is warm enough but cool

151
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:39,120
enough where you can just let your body

152
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:46,559
rest on the raft and just float there

153
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:53,760
being supported by the ocean feeling the

154
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:01,679
subtle movement in the water usually in that situation small waves

155
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,440
maybe receiving the sounds of the water

156
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:16,140
in a way where resting our body on the ocean letting

157
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:22,220
our body just follow the flow of the water

158
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:29,100
in the same way we can let our awareness rest on our experience here the breath or the

159
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:36,240
sensations in the body there's a certain surrender or letting

160
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,919
go into the experience

161
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:50,000
like letting the experience be what it is we can't really control the ocean right

162
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:57,440
we live our give ourselves to the intimacy of that experience

163
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:19,039
so if we're working with an anchor in our practice like the breath

164
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,780
it can be this feeling of just feeling that

165
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:31,340
resting on the exhale resting on the inhale

166
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:37,100
breath after breath

167
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:46,519
and it also can be resting on a sound we're hearing

168
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:54,960
sort of like oh yeah that that truck you could hear the car and then the sound Fades away and you

169
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,000
can kind of rest into that space too

170
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:16,200
so again this idea that we don't need to struggle if we get caught and thinking

171
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:23,760
at some point when we realize what's happening we're already back we're resting again right

172
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:31,020
there oh right here into whatever you can

173
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:35,059
sense in your present experience

174
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:50,520
sometimes if we have Minds that are active for

175
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:57,960
some reason at the moment there's two things we might try

176
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:04,200
for having a hard time settling resting on that raft

177
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:12,780
one is that three-breath Journey just following intimately an inhale

178
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:18,539
followed by the exhale three breaths in a row just that's it a

179
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:25,220
small short little period of being very connected

180
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:30,919
and then we can just do another three breath Journey after that

181
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:50,520
after taking one of these three breath Journeys you might just notice

182
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:58,200
what that felt like what's the impact of just just that one little intimate

183
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,940
connection to three breaths

184
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:46,159
and if it's a one breath Journey instead of three no problem

185
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:54,200
every moment matters it all counts

186
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:40,200
you know that feeling you have when you're really relaxed

187
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:48,779
and you can hear people talking or maybe the phone and you just don't really care

188
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:54,840
it's a you're just so content resting

189
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:00,000
relaxing that things can be going on around you

190
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:07,460
and you can hear them and they come and go and you just it's okay you can wait

191
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:18,799
imagine having that feeling right now

192
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:25,460
that being with your experience however it is right now

193
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:31,460
it's just good enough content enough

194
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,460
giving into it resting in it

195
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:48,600
so whatever those thoughts that come up in your mind or plans or remembering

196
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:55,380
it's like oh yeah okay hmm yeah breath

197
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:18,500
hmm breathing in and breathing out

198
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:29,720
and with whatever else you're aware of it can just be going on together

199
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:10,380
is it possible to just have the breathing be in the Forefront and the other things

200
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:16,860
happening in the background or to have the breath just breathe in and

201
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:22,519
through the sounds or the sensations or the thoughts

202
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:07,460
practicing in this way doesn't mean we're suppressing or rejecting anything

203
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:16,039
instead we're just simply prioritizing being aware

204
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,539
being with

205
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,640
foreign

206
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:12,860
to ask yourself now what can I notice that's different between the inhale and the exhale

207
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:18,200
do they feel the same different

208
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:28,158
does the breath feel the same on the way in in the nose as it does on the way out

209
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:42,019
just getting a little closer

210
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,000
a little more connected

211
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:00,500
noticing the temperature of the breath

212
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,700
is it smooth or rough

213
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:26,059
sometimes with each exhale I can just feel a little more letting go again

214
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:32,960
eat deep in my back my shoulders

215
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:41,840
the end of that exhale there can be this little feeling of Letting Go dropping

216
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,899
maybe the breath gets a little slower

217
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:26,360
maybe there's a pause between the exhale and the inhale

218
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:35,960
and maybe not just being close

219
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,120
resting on

220
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:47,240
whatever you're aware of

221
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,060
the moment I'm going to ring the bell

222
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:31,619
but I want to invite you to stay in your meditation for a moment

223
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:37,339
let the sound of the Bell be part of what you're aware of

224
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:43,500
see if you can just hold your awareness until the sound is

225
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:49,060
fully gone while staying in your meditation posture

foreign

230
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:18,060
minute Diana will talk a little bit about concentration

231
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:24,000
is it okay if we ask if there are any comments and Reflections about your

232
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:32,240
experience with this meditation what did you notice how was it for you

233
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:45,599
thank you Ann Rose please oh well I was uncomfortable in the city

234
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:50,760
you know I try you know when I'm ambitious I try to sit and on the floor

235
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:56,520
because normally I wanted him sitting on the in a chair um and then I was like oh I'm

236
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:02,400
concentrating on trying to get too comfortable and then my leg was falling asleep and then I'm like oh this is not

237
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:08,579
what I wanted I'm like wait just get up and move and I did and it was cool I

238
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:16,320
just was I really liked the sensation of focusing on what the breath felt like going in

239
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:22,619
and I never thought of it like that because sometimes when I'm focusing on the breath I'm like okay I'm breathing

240
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:28,980
in I'm breathing out but what does that feel like I I like that it was nice

241
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:32,359
thank you thank you

242
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:43,980
I thought I was doing a good job concentrating and then all of a sudden I

243
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:49,560
just faded out and I found myself leading over one way or another and I

244
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:55,500
thought well that's not so good and I write myself up and said oh can we stay

245
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:02,900
in a balanced focused position and they say I know I'm leaning over to Psy again as a

246
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:17,040
it's a little difficult for me to do two things at the same time I think so my

247
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:26,040
mom just tries to go to a place where it quiet and then it's hard for me to start

248
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:31,800
counting breathing or I'm not familiar with that in fact I don't even know why we have to do it three times rather than

249
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:39,180
two or one so I was just struggling with that because I was pretty comfortable

250
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:44,579
um where my mind was but then I had difficulties in following you know what

251
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:52,079
you were saying something about breathing which at some point I just stopped listening I guess with a lot of

252
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:58,680
respect yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but that worked for me because I'm not really familiar with that three times or

253
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:05,579
two times so great thank you foreign I think earlier in the meditation you

254
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:12,720
said something about imagining like a lazy Sunday where you don't have to like do anything or you don't care that was

255
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:20,160
really helpful because I think I realized that with thinking I naturally kind of try to resist or judge or change

256
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:25,200
it so that was really helpful and then I think I noticed that as my

257
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:31,079
thoughts kind of went away weirdly enough I get I guess it's like I have a

258
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:37,020
lot of thinking energy and when you remove the thoughts the energy just kind of comes out which is a very interesting

259
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:44,720
experience so yeah thank you thank you

260
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:54,359
maybe I'll just add the uh Tanya when you said like floating on a raft I

261
00:42:54,359 --> 00:43:01,319
haven't heard that before that was fantastic also I was like I just felt really great like this relaxed floating

262
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:04,819
it was very nice so thank you

263
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:17,040
so is concentration practice not really what we kind of normally associate

264
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:25,560
concentration with okay it's more like a concept I'll talk about oh okay in a little bit uh yeah yeah I'm

265
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:32,160
going to talk about this Okay so I think it was very helpful Tanya that

266
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:38,640
you asked us well what what associations do we have with this word concentration in Iris you had said well I kind of it

267
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:44,040
was a little bit like stressed or I don't remember exactly what word you said but for me in my ear my shoulders

268
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:50,579
go up towards my ears like oh I'm supposed to focus so because of that I'd like to suggest

269
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:55,980
that we use another word just because concentration it has this baggage that

270
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:05,040
goes along with it we have this big Association of whether it's supposed to be so the poly word is samadhi and I

271
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:11,940
like this samadhi has this kind of like this relaxed

272
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:19,800
feeling about it and it turns out that that is really important in fact integral to

273
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:26,819
concentration we might say so samadhi if I were to Define it I would say it's

274
00:44:26,819 --> 00:44:33,720
probably not what we often think about this word concentration but instead it's like the mind and the body feeling

275
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:40,140
unified kind of like feeling collected feeling in harmony

276
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:45,420
and with a sense of well-being so the sense of well-being is integral

277
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:51,599
as well as one way we might think about samadhi is like non-distraction so just

278
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:57,540
kind of like collect this sense of collectedness but we often think of it as something

279
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:04,200
that the mind is doing that the mind is you know right on the object

280
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:09,900
and it's very common that we use the breath as subjects we don't have to but that's very common

281
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:15,420
so but but I want to highlight that not only is well-being really important but

282
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:21,359
the body is really important to for this uh for kind of like this collectedness

283
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:27,420
this Wellness and then I maybe I'll also mention that

284
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:33,420
so often it's we have this idea okay I need to be concentrated or I am

285
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:40,380
concentrated or I'm not concentrated but I think it's much more helpful to think of it as a spectrum

286
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:45,660
like sometimes we're really really distracted just can't keep things

287
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:51,599
straight at all and sometimes there's this sense of settledness and in this

288
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:56,700
tradition there can be an extreme sense of settledness it can go really far on

289
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:01,859
the Spectrum so instead of having this idea I've concentrated or I'm not

290
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:09,060
concentrated because sometimes when we have this idea I'm not concentrated then there's like and I should be right is

291
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:15,720
this little beating ourselves up or or then I have to try harder and then we kind of get tight and strain and strive

292
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:21,359
and that's not the direction to strain and strive or beat ourselves up

293
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:28,619
does not help absolutely it doesn't help in fact it goes the opposite direction it's a form of Destruction

294
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:35,220
so it's really helpful because this is how it actually is it's just a spectrum

295
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:40,560
so just to notice am I moving towards more settledness and well-being or am I

296
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:46,079
moving away settleness and well-being I think that's a really helpful way to

297
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:53,300
consider this as opposed to this binary yes no am I this way or not

298
00:46:53,819 --> 00:47:01,079
so how maybe I'll add one more thing about

299
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:08,880
um concentration or samadhi here is it's not only about collectedness and

300
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:15,480
well-being and I'm using this word well-being purposely to be very vague

301
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:21,780
because we find it we find our way into that in different ways

302
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:27,359
for some people it's just a kind of a quiet sense of contentment

303
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:34,560
drinking hot chocolate for me when I was a kid that was like something that I loved you know so that kind of a feeling

304
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:39,660
and for some other people it's really

305
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:46,800
a big giant like Wahoo it's my birthday you know that kind of a Feeling

306
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:52,680
so just well-being wherever uh however you experience that

307
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:59,940
so not only is it well-being than this collectedness but the third element is

308
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:08,400
that when this happens the mind is able to see things a little bit more subtle than we can see in our regular way in

309
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:15,359
which we're practicing we can start to see things that aren't so obvious when

310
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:21,060
we're in our regular I sometimes called like Street Consciousness when we're

311
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:27,619
just going down the street type of thing and one way to think about it is if

312
00:48:27,619 --> 00:48:34,380
mindfulness is like awareness and we can think of awareness as like a

313
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:39,780
flashlight or maybe even a telescope

314
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:47,000
that looks at something it brings attention to something and highlights it so that we can see it

315
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:52,560
and samadhi is we can think of it as like the tel uh

316
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:58,920
tripod that's underneath it so then this beam whether it's a telescope or

317
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:04,740
flashlight is then steady steady on whatever it is it's seen and

318
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:10,020
because it's steady it can see things that otherwise you can't see for example

319
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:18,119
if it's a telescope right you can't see things so well on a telescope if it's jittery so this allows it to Be steady

320
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:25,680
so an obvious question is well what is the difference between mindfulness and the samadhi thing like how is the

321
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:31,040
meditation different what what what's the relationship between them

322
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:36,780
well one way is that mindfulness which I kind of like we know we have this object

323
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:43,800
which is very often the breath pay attention to the breath the mind wanders the mind wanders it's planning it's

324
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:49,680
dreaming it's doing whatever it is and then it comes back to the breath the mind wanders and it comes back to the

325
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:57,359
breath with mindfulness practice we're holding everything in kind regard so if

326
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:05,099
there's a an uncomfortable bodily body sensation we could just put the flashlight of

327
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:11,280
awareness mindfulness onto that uncomfortable body sensation hold that with kind regard

328
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:18,839
until it's no longer compelling and then come back to the breath with concentration practice

329
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:25,920
we have this object the breath we just stay with the breath stay with the breath one breath Two Bros three breaths

330
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:33,300
ten bazillion breaths however many and then we have a kind disregard for

331
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:38,520
the other things we just stay with the breath and it's

332
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:45,300
not that we're shoving things away it's not that we're insisting that they be different but we just kind of like this

333
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:52,680
kind disregard maybe it's like okay I hear that sound but I'm just gonna let

334
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:59,520
it go I'm not gonna get tangled up with it and get mad at it or anything I'm just gonna oh there's a sound but I just

335
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:05,819
stay with the breath stay with the breath so that's one way we might understand

336
00:51:05,819 --> 00:51:11,940
the difference between mindfulness and concentration whereas mindfulness might have the breath and then the sound and

337
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:18,440
then bodily sensation and then come back to the breath with a concentration smartest breath

338
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:25,579
breath breath breath that's we're kind of putting

339
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:33,839
but he's asking like why the breath and why

340
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:39,359
not something else focus on maybe a positive image a positive

341
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:45,059
sensation and something else you know why the breath well what point yeah yeah

342
00:51:45,059 --> 00:51:52,079
this is a good question like why the breath so it doesn't have to be the breath we this is

343
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:59,040
the most common for some people this doesn't work maybe they have you know

344
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:04,260
trauma they or they have asthma or something like this and just to think about the breath is really uncomfortable

345
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:11,460
but there's a few things that's helpful about the breath one is that uh you can

346
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:17,040
tune into the sensations to the experience of it

347
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:23,280
because I was mentioning earlier how the body is involved so it's not just mental

348
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:30,800
even though we use this word mindfulness it feels like a misnomer it's really like body fullness or so so

349
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:36,000
the breath is something that the body is doing and because the breath has this

350
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:43,260
movement it's a little bit easier to pay attention to because it's harder to pay attention to

351
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:50,640
something that's static if something is a little bit moving then the mind is a little bit more interested in it for

352
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:57,540
example Tanya and her guide meditation could have said pay attention to the beginning

353
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:02,760
middle and end of an exhale and that's a way of kind of like getting

354
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:08,520
a little bit more intimate with the experience or what's what does it feel

355
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:13,920
like to have the gap between an inhale and an exhale so these are ways in which

356
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:19,859
the mind can you know kind of like tune in and maybe like touch the experience

357
00:53:19,859 --> 00:53:26,339
more um closely but join us well why not a

358
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:34,380
positive image or something just um like we absolutely you could do like a

359
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:39,720
candle flickering or um some people do loving kindness practice we're not going

360
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:45,059
to talk about that so much today which is about phrases and like sending

361
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:52,800
will wishing to other people and to ourselves so it definitely can be that but I would say for concentration can be

362
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:58,260
like the candle flame or loving kindness phrases or

363
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:04,800
um all kinds of things are probably yeah visualizations and all these types

364
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:11,700
of things mindfulness practice is more just about the bodily experience the

365
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:17,960
actual what's happening and

366
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:24,540
I don't I don't have experience doing mindfulness with uh like uh imagining

367
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:29,819
something the problem is that we're trying to stay in the present

368
00:54:29,819 --> 00:54:36,599
moment and the body is in the present moment like of course it is where else could it be

369
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:42,960
but the mind not so often is it in the present moment it's always planning or

370
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:49,500
remembering or fantasizing or rehashing a conversation

371
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:55,859
or you know something like this so to our life is actually happening in

372
00:54:55,859 --> 00:55:02,579
the present moment and this practice is that really helps support our life so to be in the present moment is kind of like

373
00:55:02,579 --> 00:55:08,220
mindfulness so one way to think about

374
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:14,460
this is that um concentration

375
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:20,099
naturally arises if we do a lot of mindfulness if we just start doing

376
00:55:20,099 --> 00:55:26,040
mindfulness and we do it a lot concentration naturally arises what does

377
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:33,359
that mean to do it a lot well there's two ways we can think about that one is for longer durations that

378
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:39,420
when we sit then we just sit for longer durations and of course right we just

379
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:47,119
start to get settled eventually it happens provided you don't have like body bodily pain because that's

380
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:52,319
distracting and you often won't get settled or provided that the environment

381
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:59,400
supports you that if the neighbor's dog and gets joined the whole

382
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:06,180
chorus of something else or you know it provided the environment supports you and your body supports you just sitting

383
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:13,920
longer settledness and well-being just start to happen so it goes towards concentration

384
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:19,079
so that's one way to be like sit more you'll have some concentration

385
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:24,300
a second way is just to be regular with practice you know to meditate every day

386
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:30,059
meditate daily even if it's just for five minutes you

387
00:56:30,059 --> 00:56:37,319
know meditate longer you'll have a more concentration more samadhi

388
00:56:37,319 --> 00:56:43,200
but this kind of regularity of practice is really helpful really can make a

389
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:50,099
difference so that's the second way you could do it longer and then the third way you can do

390
00:56:50,099 --> 00:56:56,160
more mindfulness is to do a day-long retreat or a week-long retreat or

391
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:02,880
something like this so that is to meditate for very for a number of hours in one day

392
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:11,460
and of course because the body cannot do that cannot just sit still for so long then you do sitting meditation and when

393
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:17,099
we do it here at IMC we do this on Wednesday mornings it's um

394
00:57:17,099 --> 00:57:22,740
City meditation and then walking meditation so you can move the body

395
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:30,000
and maybe bring the energy up or bring the energy down and then go do sitting meditation again and then on Retreats

396
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:36,599
you can do like then walking and then sitting so sit walk sit walk so this alternation just to help take care of

397
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:43,619
the body otherwise it's too hard to just sit for that long but you can do walking meditation in a

398
00:57:43,619 --> 00:57:50,940
way that really can support this collectiveness and this sense of well-being and the sense of Harmony or

399
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:57,000
unification that can happen so does it have to be in the seated posture

400
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:02,880
for some people they do lying down but then the you know meditation practice

401
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:09,780
soon turns into sleeping practice which is fine right because I mean makes

402
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:16,020
perfect sense this is what our minds and bodies are used to you get horizontal you close your eyes you go to sleep

403
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:21,300
right those are the only times in your life that you're horizontal with your eyes closed usually so it's definitely

404
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:28,339
uh something that has to be practiced to be able to do mindfulness laying down

405
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:35,099
so what are some other things to like think about if

406
00:58:35,099 --> 00:58:41,940
we want to have this sense of unification and well-being there's a number of ways that we can do

407
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:48,359
to really support this and it encourages that um

408
00:58:48,359 --> 00:58:55,859
things that we're doing off the cushion off the cushion when we're not meditating do you have an impact on the

409
00:58:55,859 --> 00:59:02,579
mind of course right there's only one mind so the same thing that is maybe

410
00:59:02,579 --> 00:59:08,040
watching Tick Tock videos where I don't know how long they are but they're short

411
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:14,220
right and so one after the other after the other after the other in the mind's like stimulated like okay so doing a lot

412
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:19,700
of that you know the mind of course is going to have a hard time settling down

413
00:59:19,859 --> 00:59:25,460
or maybe there's a way in which there's a

414
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:34,020
part of like this kind disregard that I talked about so we're with our anchor I

415
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:40,260
could use this word anchor so I'm suggesting it's the breath but as John pointed out it can be other things

416
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:46,020
doesn't have to be the breath we can use this word anchor that

417
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:54,480
um while we're with the anchor we could have this kind disregard for other whatever else is happening but

418
00:59:54,480 --> 01:00:00,240
that this kind disregard requires a little bit of like this letting go of like okay I'm not going to get tangled

419
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:06,839
up with that sound I like to use the neighbor's dog barking because that's if that's part of my life

420
01:00:06,839 --> 01:00:12,119
experiences I have a neighbor whose dog barks on occasion that's

421
01:00:12,119 --> 01:00:18,359
so there's one way in which we could just sit there and be fuming right it's like I can't believe it why don't they

422
01:00:18,359 --> 01:00:25,619
let the dog out this poor dog and and then they always do this and you know maybe the dog needs some blah blah right

423
01:00:25,619 --> 01:00:31,079
we can just really get tangled up with the what I say tangled up I mean like lost in thoughts

424
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:37,680
but there's a way in which um we can let go

425
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:43,859
of his stories we have about it like yep we could follow that thought train and

426
01:00:43,859 --> 01:00:51,900
think for 20 minutes about how the dog should be otherwise or we cannot

427
01:00:51,900 --> 01:01:00,180
just kind of let go like oh I'm lost in thought okay I'm just going to let go of that so this idea of letting go is not so

428
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:06,059
easy initially might be something that we need to kind of like cultivate and practice

429
01:01:06,059 --> 01:01:12,420
so this is something that we can do when we're not in the meditation posture it's just practice

430
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:17,460
letting go and so what does that mean

431
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:22,799
it means there's a number of different ways of letting go of insisting that we

432
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:29,460
have to be right you know letting somebody else like they may be saying something and we don't agree maybe we

433
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:36,900
don't correct them or maybe we don't insist that they have to know what we're doing right we do this in a in the

434
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:42,960
settings that are appropriate or maybe we let go of wanting to have

435
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:49,619
our preferences if the for example you and your partner want to do something and your partner wants to do something

436
01:01:49,619 --> 01:01:56,579
different maybe just kind of let go of your preference at that time so just these things that we do in our

437
01:01:56,579 --> 01:02:03,000
daily life really help settle the mind and the Heart instead of always trying

438
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:10,260
to get one more thing so this practice is not about acquiring

439
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:17,040
it turns out by letting go all these beautiful things naturally

440
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:22,500
arise we do not have to go chase after them we do not have to make them happen

441
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:27,660
but they're just happening with this Letting Go including this samadhi this

442
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:34,079
concentration letting go of the things that are that are distractions or insisting that things

443
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:40,380
are different so that was a it's kind of a little bit about samadhi

444
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:45,780
we have time maybe just for a few questions but I kind of threw some a lot

445
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:51,920
of information out that way are there some questions or comments

446
01:02:57,180 --> 01:03:03,480
um does this mean you don't explicitly practice concentration or like

447
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:09,720
if you naturally do a lot of mindfulness meditation eventually as you're doing a

448
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:16,440
meditation you reach concentration is that kind of how it works or do you like explicitly do like concentration

449
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:22,680
practices yeah yeah thank you Iris this is great um both sometimes you can say specifically I'm going to do

450
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:27,839
concentration practice okay and that would mean uh you know just like staying

451
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:35,099
with the anchor and I would say you talked about you do like open awareness practice and you can definitely have concentration with open awareness it's

452
01:03:35,099 --> 01:03:41,640
uh takes a little bit longer sometimes I practice this way it takes a little bit longer to settle but the subtleness

453
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:48,920
tends to have a little bit more stability when the when the Mind settles if you're doing open awareness practice

454
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:56,700
so yeah and sometimes it is true right if you just do a lot of mindfulness it'll just start happening at a

455
01:03:56,700 --> 01:04:02,240
concentration okay thanks okay

456
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:09,540
just quickly so you start with mindful concentration and eventually that will

457
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:15,140
take you to the I guess

458
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:21,340
mindful meditation and then that takes you to cons

459
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:26,579
[Music] Ole the concentration

460
01:04:26,579 --> 01:04:33,780
yeah you know what I mean yeah yeah so that that's one way and that's a very common way but you can

461
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:42,359
intentionally do some concentration also and that is to just really stay with the

462
01:04:42,359 --> 01:04:50,960
anchor stay with the anchors stay with the anchor and have this sense of collectedness and well-being so this

463
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:57,780
allowing the sense of well-being to arise while staying with the anchor with the

464
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:03,059
anchor with the anchor or it's a lot of letting go I have to say

465
01:05:03,059 --> 01:05:09,020
too I don't know Tony do you have something that you'd like to add here

466
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:18,980
um

467
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:30,799
I think I'd like I to me I really resonate with that idea of letting go

468
01:05:31,020 --> 01:05:39,000
um and I kind of kind of mentioned it in the meditation sort of that feeling of being so relaxed

469
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:44,400
that it's sort of like it doesn't matter anymore what's happening around you

470
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:50,819
you just don't have you don't care enough you don't you know you said the kind disregard which was a really fun

471
01:05:50,819 --> 01:05:56,520
way of naming it another way is so it's like it's almost

472
01:05:56,520 --> 01:06:02,280
like also this idea of letting go there is a phase in which it is a very

473
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:07,920
active process where we have to try and help ourselves

474
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:13,740
let go of something no let go of the ice cream or you know no let go of worrying

475
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:18,960
about later but the more we let go

476
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:25,260
the less it's actually the more automatic it becomes the more

477
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:31,380
it becomes like instead of having to let go of something it's more like I don't

478
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:38,099
want to pick up anything yeah it's just like it's okay it doesn't

479
01:06:38,099 --> 01:06:43,680
matter you know it's like just sort of like it's just too much work to pick up

480
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:49,319
something else it's it's you're too relaxed to want to get up

481
01:06:49,319 --> 01:06:54,960
you know um so I think that it changes

482
01:06:54,960 --> 01:07:02,099
and I think there's in the beginning there is this you know anytime we start to sit there's more of this Active

483
01:07:02,099 --> 01:07:09,420
Energy to helping ourselves stay with a breath helping ourselves let go of the thinking

484
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:16,920
to come back to hold the posture but after a while it's like

485
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:22,200
um things like the in a snow globe right if you shake it up all the little

486
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:27,299
snowflakes are swirling around and and you set it down

487
01:07:27,299 --> 01:07:33,059
and slowly the snowflakes come to the rest come to rest at the

488
01:07:33,059 --> 01:07:38,460
bottom of the snow globe right and there's almost a similar process that

489
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:45,359
starts to happen for us that things just start to come I like

490
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:50,579
the word resting to a place of resting we're just sort of intimate with

491
01:07:50,579 --> 01:07:56,400
whatever settled intimate resting and then

492
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:02,760
what will happen is like picking up the snow globe you know we move the

493
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:08,760
snowflakes get stirred around and maybe it's a thought or a pain that comes up

494
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:17,100
and it does the same thing it stirs the mind again and you know sometimes that might be a

495
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:22,258
lot but sometimes it might just be oh and then it's uh it just comes back to

496
01:08:22,259 --> 01:08:24,738
rest again

497
01:08:28,759 --> 01:08:35,219
and I'd say you don't have to worry about concentration at all you don't have to

498
01:08:35,219 --> 01:08:41,219
you can just do mindfulness just and there's some people maybe I'll just

499
01:08:41,219 --> 01:08:47,520
add this list some people have a propensity for concentration and some people have propensity more for

500
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:52,920
mindfulness just different minds are different so not this isn't necessarily

501
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:59,460
that's something everybody has to do or everybody wants to do or something like this it's just a recognition of

502
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:04,818
something that will happen if you do a lot of mindfulness practice

503
01:09:08,819 --> 01:09:17,778
there's something one other word that I've used that I like which is there's uh intimacy

504
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:24,238
a sense of connection intimacy with with your experience and that

505
01:09:24,239 --> 01:09:29,758
um and that happens in mindfulness too when there isn't um

506
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:36,719
there there isn't contention with what's happening and there also isn't

507
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:43,859
engagement with what's happening right entanglement with it there can just be a like walking with

508
01:09:43,859 --> 01:09:49,679
your good friend and there's this sense of connection and intimacy between you

509
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:56,520
um and I think that there's a way in which that our our mindfulness can

510
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:02,100
grow in this intimacy when there's this lack of contention

511
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:07,620
and this lack of engagement but but not meaning

512
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:14,699
disconnected makes sense

513
01:10:14,699 --> 01:10:17,840
yeah okay

514
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:27,060
yeah Iris um if you kind of have a hard time

515
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:33,480
letting go is that where kind of like the mindfulness developing that relation

516
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:40,260
first will kind of help you let go easier or how do you kind of help let go

517
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:43,219
easier

518
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:53,040
this is a great question and you know and we're us we're saying oh just let go no problem

519
01:10:53,040 --> 01:11:00,300
definitely this is like a skill I I would say it's right something that people definitely have to develop

520
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:08,159
so there are a few things and one is uh maybe like in our daily life to

521
01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:16,080
recognize when there are moments of contentment and so we tend to be dismissive of when

522
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:23,100
everything's okay we rather just don't even ignore them we kind of but there might be times when you're sitting in

523
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:30,120
your car and like everything's fine you're just it's fine or you uh just finished a meal

524
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:36,060
everything's fine you know these scents of everything's fine so this cultivating

525
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:41,520
a sense of contentment allows the mind and the body and the

526
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:47,100
heart to recognize oh there it's um

527
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:54,840
it's there is possible to have this sense of okayness without always looking

528
01:11:54,840 --> 01:12:00,060
for the next thing so sometimes we just have to reassure

529
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:06,480
this mind and heart that yeah there are these times during the day when things are okay

530
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:13,140
and again this is not necessarily easy because you know our habit is to notice oh that's a problem I have to fix it oh

531
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:19,440
that's a problem I have to fix that and we get rewarded for fixing problems and you know in our professional life our

532
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:25,199
family life this is what we do so this is kind of a radical thing that we're

533
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:30,300
suggesting here so I offered one thing do you do you want to offer something for

534
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:35,420
yeah I like I like the idea of let be

535
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:40,860
another approach to letting go is oh just letting it be

536
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:46,860
I don't have to do anything about this I don't have to change it I could just let

537
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:54,239
it be and everything is gonna the itch is gonna go away you know the irritating

538
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:59,640
sound is gonna happen and then not happen and

539
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:05,340
then happen again and sort of a again it's a non-contention a

540
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:11,040
little bit to me not having that sort of just willingness

541
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:17,159
to let things be the way they are in you know in meditation

542
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:23,340
um is a letting go and it's easier than this idea to me

543
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:29,760
letting go has a very active feeling to it which there are times we need we

544
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:35,640
might need to kind of make a decision that might be another way to put it

545
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:44,239
I need to make a decision to stop arguing with this

546
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:52,199
and then we decide that and then we have to remind ourselves and remind ourselves and then slowly as we keep remembering

547
01:13:52,199 --> 01:13:58,980
that we're not going to argue with this anymore we it just Fades because we're not

548
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:04,739
engaging it anymore it fades away and that's that's kind of one way that

549
01:14:04,739 --> 01:14:12,420
we let go so letting go sometimes very active but

550
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:19,040
also can just be a very allowing letting be

551
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:27,540
thank you both ideas are very pretty new to me great seemed very helpful okay

552
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:36,179
great your questions were awesome for me the idea of letting go is to

553
01:14:36,179 --> 01:14:43,100
actually end up winning so um I Let Go

554
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:50,040
because even though in my mind I'm losing because well you know the person who

555
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:56,280
wants to upset me you know it's it's gonna think that upset me

556
01:14:56,280 --> 01:15:01,560
because I'm not reacting to that in my mind is I'm winning because

557
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:07,920
I can continue doing something different yeah so yeah absolutely I guess there is

558
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:13,920
not a lot of altruism I'm seeing things in that from from that perspective but

559
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:22,800
it works for me because I'm willing to lose because I'm actually winning yeah so that simplifies the you know yeah and

560
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:27,840
other things which is really there's so much wisdom in that to me that's when I

561
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:34,320
think about the first Noble Truth right which is that they're suffering it to me this is the way I would talk about what

562
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:41,159
you're saying which is I'm going to suffer if I keep fighting with this person I don't want to suffer

563
01:15:41,159 --> 01:15:46,679
so I don't care let them let them win because I don't want to keep suffering

564
01:15:46,679 --> 01:15:53,100
in that way and so I win that way I win because I'm not going to add to my

565
01:15:53,100 --> 01:16:00,140
suffering they can think whatever they want

566
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:08,280
that's right that's right that's right I agree

567
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:15,420
and maybe if this is okay I'll say some other things that are supportive for letting go or for concentration and that

568
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:21,420
is just simplicity mm-hmm and in all the different ways that it

569
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:28,020
can show up in our lives just not being too busy not being in a place

570
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:33,300
that's too cluttered not you know just Simplicity of course that just helps

571
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:38,520
things to settle right when there's a certain about a simplicity

572
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:46,679
and I talked about also kind of like somebody having this sense of well-being but just some kindness right just in our

573
01:16:46,679 --> 01:16:52,500
daily life just practicing kindness towards ourselves and towards other people that feels good of course it does

574
01:16:52,500 --> 01:17:00,060
so these are some of the things that can help support meditation practice in general and maybe a samadhi practice in

575
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:03,020
particular so

576
01:17:11,659 --> 01:17:17,219
can you use the mic for the recording thank you so much oh I'm sorry

577
01:17:17,219 --> 01:17:22,320
um I think a meditation is sort of like a mental uh massage

578
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:30,360
you know if I've uh if I'm physically uh tired after exercise

579
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:36,780
I could get a massage and basically the masseur will unknot all my muscles

580
01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:43,679
you know and boy that's that's really relaxing and I and I noticed that when when I had meditate I had the same kind

581
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:50,940
of feeling it feels like your mind is just tangled up with worries planning and all this other

582
01:17:50,940 --> 01:17:58,560
stuff uh and meditation just simply taking those Tangos away just like the tangles

583
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:05,060
in your muscle and then and it's very relaxing

584
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:11,280
yeah relaxing and this uh word Tangles a great word and this is a word that shows

585
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:17,880
up a lot is like to untangle the tangle this uh kind of like the Buddhist literature has this expression to

586
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:20,960
untangle the tangle

587
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:32,520
I think um one other thing that might be worth talking about is

588
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:38,100
um just to maybe invite you to think about moments in your life

589
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:44,159
right it doesn't have to be formal meditation where you could you felt that sense of

590
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:51,780
contentment ease the untangling the the the resting just whatever you

591
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:57,000
were doing you you know with the Buddha it was under a memory of being under an

592
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:04,080
apple tree as a child while his father was working in the field it inspired him to practice and

593
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:09,719
brought him to Liberation remembering that experience of sitting on a summer

594
01:19:09,719 --> 01:19:16,380
day under an apple tree watching his father working in the field relaxing

595
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:23,640
that it was very pleasant you know collected feeling of well-being at ease

596
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:29,219
contented for me that memory is of times on boats

597
01:19:29,219 --> 01:19:36,719
and floats in the water with the water with the sun with the warmth with the sound of Chess

598
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:45,600
I could spend hours laying on the bench in my father's boat or floating on a raft in the lake

599
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:53,640
just I was so content and comfortable and um so I wondered if you have

600
01:19:53,640 --> 01:20:01,620
memories experiences that you could describe and and that can help you connect with that

601
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:06,140
feeling if you'd be willing to share

602
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:15,960
go for it in Rose well to keep in mind with Simplicity as

603
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:21,900
Diana put um like washing the dishes and the song starts playing and then I'm

604
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:28,320
like not that I want to wash the dishes but then it's you know just if I'm gonna wash the

605
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:35,340
dishes I should wash the dishes like take nocton would say and and it's just like even if I'm feeling

606
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:41,460
really bad about something like I have been recently I just this feels nice or

607
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:47,820
this is a nice I'm like it doesn't you don't have to go on a spa day yeah to to

608
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:54,780
feel contentment it's it doesn't have to be so big it could just be so

609
01:20:54,780 --> 01:21:00,739
something like that beautiful beautiful thank you

610
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:09,560
do you have an experience virus

611
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:17,040
um I guess I like the idea of Simplicity yeah um and I think your med your

612
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:23,400
instructions really remind me of like Sunday afternoons when I don't really have anything on an agenda

613
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:28,159
that just feels really nice yeah great

614
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:36,840
I have great memories of um I like cooking I mean I have learned how to

615
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:43,860
cook you know especially since from South America so I usually get together with friends family and just you know

616
01:21:43,860 --> 01:21:50,159
spend time cooking and enjoying life so those are moments that yes and you know

617
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:56,340
connect me with I guess the positive parts of

618
01:21:56,340 --> 01:22:01,860
everything beautiful yeah so with cooking you know you have

619
01:22:01,860 --> 01:22:09,060
to pay attention to how you're holding the knife and the vegetables and the pressure there's so much mindfulness

620
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:16,920
happening you know and the smells and the colors to look in and that's very present

621
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:23,880
moment right very present moment not having to head off and do a bunch of things on your Sunday you know you just

622
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:29,400
there's this resting in the experience of the dishwashing you know that's

623
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:35,280
there's something really where Intimate we're connected or you know sort of in

624
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:41,820
open to being with this moment in this way that

625
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:48,440
is so nice so nourishing brings the well-being

626
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:57,500
yeah maybe I'll share something too is that um my mom and I used to

627
01:22:57,500 --> 01:23:02,760
make like greeting cards together and it was just something very sweet we would

628
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:09,540
just be sitting at the kitchen table you know cutting or I don't know stamping doing all this kind of stuff but it was

629
01:23:09,540 --> 01:23:17,100
just very nice like we had this little project that together we were doing and it was very sweet so this idea of kind

630
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:23,640
of doing some activity that requires attention but it's enjoyable and nothing

631
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:27,260
else needs to happen yeah

632
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:38,520
so are there any other comments or

633
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:45,060
questions any other Curiosities and Richard maybe you could check and see if there's anything on YouTube a question

634
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:52,400
or a comment welcome to happy happy to hear from anybody on YouTube and

635
01:23:52,739 --> 01:23:59,400
I hope the idea here is to invite you to not get tangled up

636
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:05,219
with the idea of concentration the tangling up around it won't lead to

637
01:24:05,219 --> 01:24:10,440
the opposite of concentration or samadhi

638
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:21,080
and maybe I'll just share that for me it was a turning point in my practice when I realized oh well-being is a key here

639
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:28,020
somehow I felt like strive and I just had to really strain and huff and puff

640
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:34,980
and it turns out that the certain amount of um for me I wasn't feeling well actually

641
01:24:34,980 --> 01:24:40,080
and during a retreat and so I was lying down in my room and meditating

642
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:45,900
I was just having a little bit of knee issue so I just had to give my knees some rest and it was something about

643
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:52,800
just being horizontal that was just a little bit more a little bit less efforting a little bit

644
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:58,199
more comfortable at that time and it allowed like oh some concentration to

645
01:24:58,199 --> 01:25:04,679
happen and like oh this is what they've been talking about oh I see so

646
01:25:04,679 --> 01:25:09,960
maybe I'll say this that some of these deep concentration States

647
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:16,980
when they arise it will be a surprise it will always be a surprise because if

648
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:24,960
you're really really really striving and straight and you're not going to get there so it just arises as a surprise just at

649
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:31,140
that so you don't have to be trying super super hard but at the same time we have been talking about letting go and

650
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:36,960
contentment and simplicity and kindness and well-being it is a skill

651
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:44,280
in terms of it is something that we kind of have to train the mind and the body to do to you know keep on coming back

652
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:50,760
don't follow the distraction just keep on coming back to the anchor for the breath or whatever the anchor is

653
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:57,179
that you're using and we've learned lots of skills in our lives we learned to tie our shoes most

654
01:25:57,179 --> 01:26:02,340
likely drive a car or ride a bike or right we've learned lots of things so

655
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:07,219
this is just one more thing that we can learn

656
01:26:12,659 --> 01:26:17,760
yeah yeah Cyrus

657
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:29,040
thank you have there been times where you've kind of like lost a bit of motivation or like interest in practice

658
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:34,260
and like uh if you're like motivation kind of Ebbs and flows and you've

659
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:40,739
reached a point where you're like uh not really feeling that motivated um has that happened to you and like how

660
01:26:40,739 --> 01:26:47,780
do you work with that great question Iris great question

661
01:26:48,239 --> 01:26:55,040
do you want to go first or no you unless you want me to yes yes

662
01:26:55,040 --> 01:27:01,320
right we're only human right of course this happens and I've gone through phases like this is crazy I don't know

663
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:07,699
what I'm doing I'm never gonna do this again like and then you know then I do

664
01:27:07,860 --> 01:27:13,940
so what helps uh having friends who

665
01:27:13,940 --> 01:27:18,960
meditate and sometimes I'm using this word friends really lightly in terms

666
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:25,920
maybe it could just be Associates or colleagues or so it makes a huge difference to be with a group

667
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:33,960
so whether it's online or in person so that takes a little bit of effort right to log on or to go to a place but that

668
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:39,620
can really make a big difference to as a support

669
01:27:39,659 --> 01:27:46,500
um and there's often sometimes maybe I'll offer this and maybe some other people have some ideas too the second

670
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:53,400
thing is it can be helpful to check in with or reconnect with why we started

671
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:59,100
meditation in the beginning and like oh I was having these

672
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:08,340
difficulties or I wanted to do something and it might be that what was initially motivating us as uh as lessons of some

673
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:14,639
of the difficulties or something like this or but it's not uncommon

674
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:19,860
for why we're like maybe to start because we're having

675
01:28:19,860 --> 01:28:28,440
some degree of suffering in our lives and I'm using this word suffering to go just like stress all the way to

676
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:33,960
you know this just receiving a very scary diagnosis and you have limited

677
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:41,280
time to live you know the whole range from just mildly stressful and irritated to you're going to die unexpectedly and

678
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:48,600
you know it but um it could be that when we became practice then it's not uncommon that we

679
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:56,580
catch a glimpse of something and it points to maybe we're not even sure what

680
01:28:56,580 --> 01:29:03,440
it points to but it touches the heart or touches the mind in some way like

681
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:10,260
whoa what was that and it kind of like I feel like we want

682
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:16,739
I want to touch it again or understand that better or something like that so that's not uncommon

683
01:29:16,739 --> 01:29:23,400
so just maybe if that has happened to kind of like connect to that like what

684
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:28,739
whatever that was even if you don't know what it was that kind of something but

685
01:29:28,739 --> 01:29:35,280
you know maybe you have some things on the hour you know I was thinking um I was

686
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:43,440
thinking about that feeling of you know not being very motivated and how when I think about any time that I

687
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:50,400
still got myself to sit down even if it was for five minutes I I don't think it ever made me feel

688
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:56,580
worse and I can pretty confidently say I always felt better

689
01:29:56,580 --> 01:30:03,300
and and so um maybe it's getting disenchanted with the

690
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:08,760
discontent or the the doubt and being sort of like well okay but I'm

691
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:14,820
gonna I mean literally for me for a long time it was really only five minutes

692
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:20,940
but I kept that five I kept sitting for that five minutes if that's all I could do that's all I could do but that five

693
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:27,540
minutes for there was about a year where it was a lot of five minutes it's

694
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:33,420
but boy did that that year of five minutes sits leave an impression on me

695
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:38,960
really impacted me so

696
01:30:41,699 --> 01:30:48,960
I think um maybe even if you took two minutes when your mind says why am I doing this

697
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:57,600
and saying well let me sit for two minutes and see why am I doing this and discover Anew each time

698
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:02,420
um because that two minutes will make a difference

699
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:14,639
any other maybe one one more comment or question or we can just move to

700
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:19,679
dedication of Merit at this point but I guess I'll just say I really

701
01:31:19,679 --> 01:31:25,340
appreciate the questions the reflections the engagements

702
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:42,239
uh well I have to I'm very grateful for IMC and for Tanya and you Diana the

703
01:31:42,239 --> 01:31:47,699
Monday sittings and these Thursdays have been have been revolutionary from my mind

704
01:31:47,699 --> 01:31:54,000
that's been kind of in its own Battlefield and so

705
01:31:54,000 --> 01:32:02,820
um the yesterday in terms of concentration and the surprise element I realized I I came to see it be to to

706
01:32:02,820 --> 01:32:09,719
meditate because of my anxious and you know overthinking and all those things

707
01:32:09,719 --> 01:32:14,760
and just stuck very stuck and

708
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:21,659
Then I then I came to this conclusion when I was on the phone with my sister like oh wait I notice what I'm doing

709
01:32:21,659 --> 01:32:27,840
when I'm feeling really anxious and it's just either with my speech or what I'm

710
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:34,440
saying and whether I'm gossiping too much and I'm like and I never would have I never would have been aware of that

711
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:41,219
had I just taken the time to just be still and it was really surprising and

712
01:32:41,219 --> 01:32:47,820
that was that was last night and I'm like oh my goodness and even if I received bad news

713
01:32:47,820 --> 01:32:54,960
and I wanna hold on to that forever I don't have to and if I'm like striving

714
01:32:54,960 --> 01:33:00,540
to change it or fix it and that's usually it usually doesn't work for me

715
01:33:00,540 --> 01:33:06,659
um doing something differently and it was just so I'm just very very

716
01:33:06,659 --> 01:33:13,620
grateful truly so much I there's I have a long way to go but yeah a five or a

717
01:33:13,620 --> 01:33:21,780
ten minute sit in the morning and in the evening for me has been I I can't imagine not doing it anymore

718
01:33:21,780 --> 01:33:28,980
because it's to not take that time for myself so that I could be better for others or at least

719
01:33:28,980 --> 01:33:36,138
more mindful in what I do is just I I thank you

720
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:43,800
and thank you for highlighting that we don't just practice for ourselves we practice for others

721
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:49,920
this is how the world becomes a better place right it's when people are more tuned into what's happening with them

722
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:56,340
and sensitive to what's happening with others and beautiful

723
01:33:56,340 --> 01:34:03,300
segue to dedication of Merit so we don't just practice for ourselves

724
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:10,739
we practice for really ideally the benefit of all beings without exception

725
01:34:10,739 --> 01:34:17,219
and so one of the things I've been doing on Thursday nights is to help us you

726
01:34:17,219 --> 01:34:25,560
know all beings is a concept an idea sometimes we have certain beings in mind

727
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:30,659
that we know are suffering or could use the benefit of our practice and

728
01:34:30,659 --> 01:34:38,460
so I want to invite anyone to share anyone you want to name to be part of

729
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:45,300
this dedication of Merit any group any person any being any animals whatever

730
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:50,820
whatever um you want us to bring to mind

731
01:34:50,820 --> 01:34:57,960
so is there anything you would like to specify

732
01:34:57,960 --> 01:35:04,380
I guess from my perspective I just wish all of you everybody here everybody here

733
01:35:04,380 --> 01:35:11,100
lots of happiness and I'm very happy that I'm here to talk beautiful

734
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:14,600

thank you for being being willing to use the microphone even though it stresses you out because it's amazing people do

737
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:41,880
listen to these talks and we hear about it now I remember when

740
01:35:55,800 --> 01:36:00,900
mic but it is speaking of for the benefit of all beings

741
01:36:00,900 --> 01:36:06,780
it really it's amazing what happens and you hear people talking

742
01:36:06,780 --> 01:36:12,120
about what they heard and it's really a gift

743
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:17,639

744
01:36:17,639 --> 01:36:25,739
shared may it be a benefit to each other to all of our others in our lives and to

745
01:36:25,739 --> 01:36:30,320
