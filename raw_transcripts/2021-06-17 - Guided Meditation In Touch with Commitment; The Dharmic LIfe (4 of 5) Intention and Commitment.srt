1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:07,359
so hello to everyone and i'm happy for all of you who are here

2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:15,200
today and participating it's um a wonderful feeling of a

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,560
network or of a wonderful

4
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,960
network of connections between people within similar interests doing

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,558
something quite wholesome and something that i believe is very beneficial for

6
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:43,760
our world so thank you and because this meditation practice

7
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:50,399
is so beneficial beneficial for oneself beneficial for one's communities

8
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:58,640
beneficial for the world that is why i teach it and i'm quite

9
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:06,239
confident in its tremendous value and uh just uh

10
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:13,680
and because of that it's a great value it is set down to meditate it's useful to sit down with a sense of

11
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,280
commitment commitment is a big word there are people who

12
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,920
it said that their commitment shy i like the word

13
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,280
commitment because from latin it met the word uh mit part of the

14
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:38,400
mat of the latin means the same root as the word mitten it has to do with hand and with the hand

15
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:45,200
kind of what we can touch and um something like that and at least whether

16
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:52,960
it's quite accurate or not the point being that commitment with what we touch commitment with what we're in touch with

17
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:59,840
and to be in touch with oneself and then what's the commitment what's the way in which we touch

18
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,399
our experience right here once we take it in and really recognize and know what's

19
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,000
happening here for us in an in touch way then can we offer something to

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,720
that can we offer a commitment a dedication

21
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,280
and a word that i love that's connected to this is the word devotion

22
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:32,160
not that it's devoted to something outside of our experience but being

23
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,640
devoted committed to our experience and to have a commitment to meet it to

24
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:45,599
be with it in a wholesome way and and it said that mindfulness is

25
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,440
always wholesome and mindfulness is that attention

26
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:58,080
that we bring to our experience the way we touch our experience that is absent of any greed or hatred or

27
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:05,599
delusion and all the kind of associated states that are unwholesome and

28
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:11,280
this amazing thing that we can kind of find our way from the unwholesome to the wholesome

29
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,040
and it's actually can be theoretically so simple that it's just to be mindful we don't

30
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:23,280
have to drum up kindness or to drum up generosity or love just to see

31
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:30,159
clearly this is here and to have a commitment to that to be present to be aware to this moment

32
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:36,640
stay in touch with our experience and commitment

33
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:44,159
has shares with one quality at least one quality

34
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:51,280
that greed has both greed and commitment involve holding on to something

35
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,439
and however in terms of commitment in doing practice it's to be committed to

36
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:04,000
something wholesome something which leads to our benefit leads to freedom

37
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,200
whereas greed leads to bondage the commitment to the practice leads to

38
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,560
freedom but it's worth holding on to not and we have to hold on to it

39
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:23,120
wholesomely we have to hold on to it in a way that leads to freedom not further getting entangled and caught

40
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:30,240
so i take a word of commitment to be in touch with the purpose of why

41
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:38,240
we're sitting to be in touch with the purpose the tremendous value of staying present staying here staying

42
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,759
with our experience and um so for this sitting today

43
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:50,560
maybe you can see if you can be supported in the practice with a sense of

44
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:58,400
commitment or dedication devotion sense of purpose that you hold on to

45
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,720
gently lovingly or caringly um not tightly but you hold on stay

46
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:11,600
here and maybe that's even the mantra i'm gonna stay here stay in touch stay in touch

47
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:20,159
and um and uh but don't do it so tight that uh

48
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,400
you know that you're bringing tension to yourself but don't hold it so loosely that you

49
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,479
drift away too easily stay present stay committed

50
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:38,560
so assuming a

51
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:47,120
posture of commitment a posture of purpose

52
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:55,919
a posture that he expresses now here i am my whole being will be dedicated to

53
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:07,360
this period of staying in touch

54
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,719
and closing your eyes

55
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:21,840
and taking a few long slow deep breaths

56
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:33,120
and on the long exhale see if you can slowly

57
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,160
settle in not to be so not so much to be relaxed here and

58
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,759
settled here but settled into a sense of yes

59
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:52,160
this is what i'm going to do i'm going to be here staying in touch with my direct

60
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,880
experience

61
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,840
in touch with my embodied experience

62
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,560
in touch with a sense of purpose and commitment

63
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:19,919
to the simplicity of the body breathing to be awake and present

64
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,160
and then letting your

65
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,840
breathing return to normal

66
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:41,039
and as you relax different parts of your body maybe what you do is you're relaxing

67
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:47,280
into a sense of purpose or a sense of commitment

68
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,638
to being here to practice to stay present

69
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,199
maybe beginning by relaxing the muscles of the face

70
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:10,319
many of the micro muscles that tighten up in the face can represent other intentions other

71
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:16,639
purposes that we're trying to do and over the course of the day

72
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,400
but to relax the face

73
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,319
on the exhale to soften relax the shoulders

74
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:41,839
so more of you can settle down into a commitment here now

75
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,040
and more of and then relaxing the belly

76
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:57,279
softening the belly and maybe even settling your way to further down your torso

77
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:05,279
as a grounding to this commitment to be here and

78
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,839
present

79
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,440
and then to also relax the brain

80
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,839
soften the thinking mind

81
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:37,839
and relax any way that the sense of commitment may have tension in it or pressure in it

82
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:49,120
a dedication to keeping the commitment relaxed and easy

83
00:09:49,600 --> 00:10:05,839
but still committed staying in touch with the practice

84
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:25,600
having a commitment to being present staying with your breathing

85
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:32,320
but to have a commitment where there's you don't have to be successful

86
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:39,519
you don't have to be managed to stay present or stay on the breathing

87
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,240
that's just a maybe a burden to have a need and requirement

88
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:52,000
for the commitment but rather to do your best and whenever

89
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,480
you wander off to remember the commitment so you come back right away

90
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:05,600
stay and relax into your present moment

91
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:12,959
experience with a commitment with a dedication

92
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,839
moment by moment

93
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:09,438
gently holding on to the present moment holding on to

94
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:17,360
staying in touch holding on to mindfulness

95
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,678
in such a way that it keeps opening you

96
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:33,840
to awareness that is free of attachment

97
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,840
um

98
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,960
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

99
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:59,520
i evoke the idea of the practice of dedication

100
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:09,279
some people will take dedication to a little higher level of making it a vow

101
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:16,640
but dedication to practice to live for the benefit and welfare of

102
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:24,480
the whole world and for others and not as a duty not as an obligation

103
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:35,840
not as something heavy burdened to carry but rather because it seems to express

104
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:48,080
a natural feeling intention desire that arises out of the heart

105
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:53,200
sometimes when practice gets very peaceful and settled

106
00:27:54,559 --> 00:28:02,399
where there is very little anxiety or attachments

107
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:10,480
it can feel very natural to respond to the suffering of the world

108
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:18,159
as natural as if your pillow at night is a little uncomfortable under your head

109
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:24,320
half asleep you might bunch up the pillow in a different way

110
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:31,600
that kind of ordinariness and simplicity

111
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:37,919
the heart's dedication to care for the world can arise

112
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:46,399
and the end of the sitting it can be expressed

113
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:52,880
in words or in thoughts so that it moves through us it's

114
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:59,279
expressed and not just a feeling

115
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:05,919
may it be that this practice that we have done this morning

116
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:15,600
may it somehow see insane and unseen ways in intentional and unintentional ways

117
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:22,480
may it spread from us out into the world contributing to the greater welfare and

118
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,840
happiness and freedom of all beings

119
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:36,158
so that those who are unhappy may we contribute to their happiness

120
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:45,120
those who don't feel safe that we contribute to greater safety

121
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:55,200
to those who don't know peace they can taste and experience more peace

122
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,799
and those who are not free those who are oppressed

123
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,919
subjugated limited in bondage

124
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,799
that it brings them freedom

125
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:19,279
may we contribute this practice of ours contribute to the welfare and happiness

126
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:37,840
of all beings everywhere may all beings be free

127
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:41,890
[Music]

128
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:56,080
so before i start this talk

129
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:04,159
i want to mention that tomorrow morning i thought we could have a zoom meeting after our

130
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:12,720
7am sit and talk we haven't done that for a long time and i've certainly missed doing it and um

131
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:19,120
and maybe doing it for 45 minutes i have other things tomorrow to go to but

132
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:28,080
so i will post the zoom link on the imc calendar for our for tomorrow i'll also post it

133
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:35,679
in the what's new section of imc's website and also i'll post it here on the chat

134
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:43,760
and and there'll be a password to get in

135
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:49,000
and that password will be meta so paulie word for loving kindness

136
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,720
m-e-t-t-a so um so i'll i'll explain to that again

137
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,760
tomorrow how that all works but we'll just go over to zoom

138
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:06,720
and we can we can do a little bit of a q a if you want to have any questions about this week's topics or anything and maybe

139
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:13,760
a little short period for uh breakout groups you could meet each other a little bit and

140
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,480
it'll be kind of short and sweet with 45 minutes or so

141
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,760
um

142
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:32,159
so so the topic this week is living a

143
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:38,480
dharmic life with the emphasis that

144
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:45,600
there are these things we can bring into our daily life that will enhance or our sense of

145
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:53,440
practice dedication in our daily life that brings us the benefits of a full-time

146
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,799
religious life you know that uh being in a monastery being in a

147
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:04,080
retreat center the difference in uh being in a monastery being a monastic

148
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:11,919
or being in a retreat center living there is not it's more of a matter of degree

149
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:17,360
that when a person is living a monastic life they get all these reminders to practice all these

150
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:22,480
associations and and schedules and things that kind of puts them back in

151
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,679
thinking about the practice or remembering to do it

152
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:33,600
and people who are not living a monastic life or living in a crete center or it's harder to remember and sometimes

153
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,880
it's there's a lot of family responsibilities or work responsibilities that

154
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:46,320
pull us into their orbit so strongly that we don't think about practice or don't think about mindfulness being present or

155
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:52,799
the values of the dharma but the difference is not a matter of

156
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:58,799
all or nothing it's a matter of degree and i think overall for most

157
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:03,600
people who practice in monasteries for example

158
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:10,560
they're not necessarily stellar monastics and that they're you know every waking moment they're doing the practice they're

159
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:16,398
doing all kinds of things and some of them are maybe not even as dedicated to the practice as some

160
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:21,599
people i know who are lay people living in the world so it's a matter of degree

161
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:29,040
and and so all of you if you're living kind of an ordinary lay life or something like that

162
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:35,839
that it's possible to increase the degree to which you're dedicated to get a lot of the benefits of more of

163
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:43,520
a full time or more of a dedicated dharma life and if you like to do that that's what the teaching this weeks are about so

164
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:49,760
so the monday it was about being embodied being present mindfulness to the bodies

165
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:55,679
just practicing that through the day is tremendously beneficial and letting the body be your temple your

166
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:02,160
monastery the mindfulness of speech was second day

167
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:07,359
and um and to care for your speech and notice why you're going to say what

168
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:12,960
you're doing and the tone of voice in which you say it and and there's a whole world

169
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:21,119
of our inner life that gets revealed by if we really pay attention to our speaking and and so you know rather than

170
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:26,880
listening to the abbot to the monastery give a dharma talk listen to yourself speak and maybe it's

171
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,920
not a dharma talk but maybe then you start becoming conscious of what you are doing

172
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:40,160
that it starts moving naturally you'd want it to be more dharmic if you're really listening to yourself

173
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:46,079
and then there was the dedication to being harmless

174
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:52,720
that the singular kind of essential essence of the whole buddhadharma living a life

175
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:58,079
which is harmless to self and others and then today the topic

176
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:05,359
is commitment or living with a sense of purpose and really being dedicated to that sense

177
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:11,119
of purpose sometimes when mindfulness is taught we emphasize that side of mindfulness that

178
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:16,640
has to do with not wanting not reacting just being

179
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:24,160
in experience and just coming back to being still being and and and that's

180
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:31,040
you know all well and good but we have different layers of our psyche of our mind different

181
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:38,079
areas of how we engage in the world and so for example when we sit down to

182
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:45,040
meditate we might be really dedicated just being present just being and not trying to do so much perhaps and just

183
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:51,119
let go of the doing mind and just being in and feeling still and quiet and peaceful and

184
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:57,440
uh it can be so nourishing to do that but there was something that brought us to the meditation cushion

185
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:04,400
there was a dedication there was a commitment there was a sense of purpose that brought us there

186
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,839
to do that practice so at one point in life you know before we meditate

187
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:15,839
getting to meditations there's a sense of purpose and then we can put away that purpose just to sit and

188
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:21,440
meditate so i'm trying to say that in different areas of life it's appropriate to look at these

189
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:28,960
different qualities and the quality i'm encouraging today is to look at your intentions

190
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:35,760
and and why do you do things what's really the intention the sense of

191
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:41,200
purpose underneath it and not the surface purpose or surface intention but what's really

192
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:47,119
really the heart's intention in doing whatever we're doing what's the inner life's real

193
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:54,880
deeper deeper intentions and sense of purpose and what we're trying to do and just to look

194
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,000
at that to be mindful of that is a whole valuable practice in itself

195
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:06,240
to take it to a step further is to spend some time reflecting on your deepest intention what's your heart's

196
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:14,079
deepest wish if all things could be um you know provided for you if genie came

197
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:19,280
along and said you can i can i'll provide you with anything at all

198
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,800
and what would you what's your heart's deepest wish

199
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:30,320
not what your desires are or your ego is but what if you really get quiet and listen

200
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:37,599
what does your heart most want what's the deepest intention i think this is so valuable that i sometimes

201
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:44,960
encourage people to [Music] that it's more important to spend time every day reflecting on your deepest

202
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:50,160
intention than it is to meditate every day and clearly i value

203
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:57,680
meditation a lot so for me to say that's even more important as your reflect on your deepest intention it

204
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:04,960
says something about how important i think this is and and and do it over time not just do

205
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,640
it one day and to decide what it is but keep coming back and looking at it and looking at it every day

206
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:16,160
because it morphs and changes and you see different angles of it or you see layers and go deeper and deeper over

207
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:21,280
time if you find that you answer the question what is your deepest intention

208
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:26,560
with a negative statement my deepest intention is not to be afraid

209
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:32,560
that's fine but you might want to see that if that negative thing was accomplished

210
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:38,400
what then would be your deepest intention if you could feel safe then what would be available for

211
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,839
you and um and so then and then

212
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:51,760
with this reflection a reflection of a purposeful life an intentional life uh what are you living for um and not so

213
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:58,960
much from the ideas of shoulds and shouldn'ts and and but really what's the heart's wish

214
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,640
what's the heart's deepest intention and i i emphasize the heart because it's

215
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:11,920
it's a kind of a metaphor for what's some inner depth where it seems to arise out of us

216
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:17,599
in the most natural way we can imagine it's like not an effort for it to come but it really feels like it's integral to

217
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,640
who we are in some deep intimate way

218
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:29,680
and then there's a a commitment to that and um a living a committed life is

219
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:36,560
something if you have a if you have something that's wholesome and valuable that's your purpose or your intention

220
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:43,359
then uh it's a wholesome thing and a valuable thing to have a commitment to it and um

221
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:50,720
there are so many things wise things a person can do in one's life and some per some people they just have

222
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:56,880
too many choices just tremendous amounts like going into a supermarket these days and all these choices

223
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:02,560
that to make whereas in the old days you went to a little market and there wasn't so many brands and

224
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:08,640
choices you kind of just were took what was there and um so for some people in the modern

225
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:15,440
world there's so many uh choices and ideas what we should be doing and people

226
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:21,520
can get just so busy doing it all the different things that are called on to do

227
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:27,040
a wise life is one that is able to

228
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:34,000
let go of even wholesome things to do good things to do so that we could

229
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,319
really focus on a few things really well sometimes if we do a lot of different

230
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:46,160
things we don't go very deep in any of them and some things are really so valuable and so useful

231
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:53,520
to give ourselves over to in a fuller deeper way and really see it all the way through um

232
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:59,599
to the other side all the way through to the depth of it or the heart of it and this dharma life if that's what

233
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:06,079
you're interested in doing it's a topic of this week the dharmic life if this interests you if this is what

234
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:11,280
you would like to do there's no obligation to do it but if this

235
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,960
it's it's worth really spending time on your sense of purpose with it your intentions with it

236
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:23,119
and and also your sense of commitment and maybe there's a way of being more

237
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:29,119
committed so that you are this is what you're doing you have clarity and its purpose

238
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:35,119
and and um and you may be put aside just some of the things you do which

239
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:42,800
don't really fit that purpose that dilute your possibility of engagement and

240
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:49,520
involvement and really let it grow and develop if you are watching more movies on the

241
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:56,800
computer every day by a factor of you know twice three four times longer

242
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:02,480
than you ever meditate you know that says something about what you're committed to what's important for

243
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:08,319
you and maybe it's okay maybe there's a higher purpose that comes from watching tv or

244
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:14,720
tv programs but but uh what um

245
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:20,480
you know what what do you want your life most to be about by the time you get to be old or gonna

246
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,599
die do you want to look back and list all the tv programs and movies you've seen

247
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:32,160
it's ah that was a life well spent or do you look back at your practice life your dharmic life and

248
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:37,280
realize how much you've changed and grown and say oh that was a life well spent

249
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:45,680
or your life of supporting other people so a committed life and

250
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:52,079
and having a commitment there is a plenty of times in buddhism buddhist history buddhism and buddhist traditions

251
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,880
where the sense of commitment even takes a form of a vow

252
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:03,680
and it's almost that which goes on when we take refuge as to hold on to the refuge we have deep

253
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:11,359
faith and commitment conviction and we hold on in a wholesome way we dedicate

254
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:17,040
ourselves we limit ourselves to some degree this is what i want to do

255
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:23,119
so as you go through your daily life maybe your daily life doesn't change any

256
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:28,720
but the sense of commitment is is to bring practice to everything you do

257
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:33,839
and um and bring it into the embodiment with speech with all these things

258
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:40,000
but whatever you're doing you're going to do it in a committed way committed to the practice as you do it

259
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:46,640
as if that's more important than what you're doing so at work

260
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:54,480
practicing as you work is more important than getting a raise for example or or

261
00:44:54,480 --> 00:45:02,839
you know all kinds of things so intention commitment dedication

262
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:09,599
devotion can be one of the great supports and nourishments and for a

263
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:15,680
dharmic life and you might want to consider at least for the next 24 hours

264
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:23,200
what is it that you are committed to and what are they if you really reflect deeply what intentions do you want to

265
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:28,560
have for your life and when you look back over your life at the end of it what would you like to

266
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:35,599
look back and see how you live that life and um

267
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:42,960
and does that reflection give you something to be committed to in a devoted and relaxed way

268
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:50,000
but still committed so thank you very much and

269
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:57,280
we'll continue one more time tomorrow from this topic
