1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,600
so

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,920
the mindfulness of mind or

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,080
breathing in experiencing the mind

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,440
breathing out experiencing the mind

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,359
and i'm in you know what the exactly

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,600
cheat mind is

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,560
i'm sorry arguing that we can't really

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,119
know

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,160
what the buddha had in mind

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,039
but i wanted to read you part of the

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,480
definition

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,120
in the polytech society dictionary so

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:33,840
them

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,000
more or less a standard poly english

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,200
dictionary

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,840
it was written over a hundred years ago

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,640
now

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,640
but it's still excellent resource for

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,239
understanding this

20
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,800
and and they have a wonderful little

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,039
entry for cheetah the word that we're

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,239
mostly translating as mind

23
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,360
it says the meaning of chitta is best

24
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,399
understood when explaining it

25
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,760
by expressions familiar to us as

26
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,600
for example with all my heart

27
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,360
and soul i have no heart

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,799
to do it blessed are the pure

29
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,320
in heart singleness of heart

30
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,960
all of which emphasize the emotional and

31
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,920
cognitive

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,360
connotative side more

33
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,680
than it's the mental and rational side

34
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,960
it may therefore be rendered mood

35
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,360
disposition state of mind

36
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,280
so some people prefer to translate this

37
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,479
word cheetah

38
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,520
as heart or as heart mind

39
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,560
it kind of touches into the emotional

40
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,079
side of all this more than

41
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,920
the word mind might even feel a little

42
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,000
bit this

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,040
emotional this you know and not so

44
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,360
connected to our emotional life

45
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,479
and uh and also when some people like me

46
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,640
treat mind and awareness almost as

47
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,399
synonymous sometimes as we get into

48
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,000
deeper meditation

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,720
that also might kind of lend itself to

50
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,679
the idea that

51
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,280
we're kind of being removed a little bit

52
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,520
from the embodied emotional life that we

53
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,800
have

54
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,640
and uh which may be a little unfortunate

55
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,640
maybe this whatever chitta is whatever

56
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,920
the mind is

57
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,800
uh whatever awareness is maybe it's a

58
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,560
rich world that includes our

59
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,800
emotionality to some you know to

60
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,599
important ways

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,560
and so uh in the step eight

62
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,360
seven and 8 of mindfulness of breathing

63
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,599
it's looking at the mental activities

64
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,280
recognizing the mental activities in the

65
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,640
mind and

66
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,879
then relaxing those mental activities

67
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,040
and there or tranquilizing or calming

68
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,760
them

69
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,080
which is that movement or opening having

70
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,040
the mind

71
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,959
become open not contracted

72
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,640
and as i said earlier the mind that's

73
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,159
preoccupied

74
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,040
gets in my mind gets hijacked attention

75
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,640
gets hijacked

76
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,040
by um our desires by our aversions by

77
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,760
our

78
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,040
doubts by our restlessness our anxiety

79
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,440
and um and it's almost like that the

80
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,440
times are like a black hole

81
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,080
that uh attention falls into and it

82
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,519
doesn't really come out there isn't like

83
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,920
we step back and get the bigger picture

84
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,120
we get swept away and our preoccupations

85
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,760
our thoughts our fantasies the stories

86
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,000
um our resentments all these kinds of

87
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,200
inner world of what goes on

88
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,640
and and uh and these are all mental

89
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,440
activities that hijack awareness

90
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,440
and there are other mental activities

91
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,519
that enable awareness or

92
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,319
open the mind that doesn't hijack but

93
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,319
rather enhances

94
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,519
the quality of the mind so

95
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,400
the buddha made the distinction between

96
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,840
mental factors that do

97
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,480
the closing the mind those that open is

98
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,000
the distinction between what's called

99
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,200
the five five hindrances and the seven

100
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,879
factors of awakening

101
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,680
the five hindrances are um strong

102
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,799
sensual desire

103
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,319
lust craving um aversion

104
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,040
ill will hostility when it's strong

105
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,720
sloth intorper lethargy resistance

106
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,360
and and then agitation restlessness

107
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,040
anxiety regrets kind of agitated states

108
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,120
of preoccupation

109
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,560
and then confusion uncertainty doubt

110
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,199
that can really we get lost in a rabbit

111
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,080
hole of doubt and confusion

112
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,000
and um and these can have very strong

113
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,680
gravitational pulls and

114
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,680
we you know we get pulled into them they

115
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,880
can come sometimes with a lot of

116
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,720
authority like this is really important

117
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,960
i have to be involved in this

118
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,720
and but the consequence is that

119
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,800
attention gets hijacked

120
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,800
and for the buddha when attention gets

121
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,320
hijacked like this

122
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,960
he calls that a loss of wisdom a

123
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,160
blindness

124
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,280
an obstruction to the mind a covering

125
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,960
over of the mind

126
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,720
a makes the mind fragile and brittle

127
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,400
and uh hard and and

128
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,800
whereas the other that opens seven

129
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,479
factors of awakening

130
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,840
those are awareness mindfulness itself

131
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,400
a clarity of mind that's sometimes

132
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,199
called investigation

133
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,039
a effort joy

134
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,160
tranquility samadhi

135
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,840
concentration and equanimity

136
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,320
and all those can work together as a

137
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,479
whole and each of those can operate

138
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,120
uh singularly to really kind of open the

139
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,759
mind up

140
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,520
and open the inner quality of the inner

141
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,440
life and this is where

142
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,319
the emotional side uh really comes to

143
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,600
play i mean some of the most

144
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,520
one of the most sublime beautiful

145
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,759
emotions that's hard for the

146
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,120
people who haven't experienced it to

147
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,960
appreciate is the quality of equanimity

148
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,000
um it's a you know it's uh just

149
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,520
it's it's a beautiful kind of feeling

150
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,919
uh tranquilities has a kind of almost an

151
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,600
emotional quality to it it's really

152
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,440
strong and embodied and

153
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,800
broad and has a warmth and

154
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,720
clarity to it stillness and peacefulness

155
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,759
joy of course seems emotional

156
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,400
samadhi is an integration of bringing

157
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,240
together of all aspects of our life

158
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,800
including the emotional

159
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,840
so um but the the um

160
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,960
the the the what what these seven

161
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,960
factors awakening are

162
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,720
they are characteristics or supports

163
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,440
for awareness itself for mindfulness

164
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,720
itself

165
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,120
and so the more they operate together

166
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,319
with awareness

167
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,319
they tend to open awareness strengthen

168
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,440
awareness

169
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,960
they create vision they support wisdom

170
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,919
they remove obstructions they remove the

171
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:06,960
coverings that

172
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,280
keeps us from seeing things clearly and

173
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,160
they make the mind

174
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,000
malleable soft workable

175
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,160
ready to do the work receptive maybe

176
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,759
to do do work and so here we're talking

177
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,080
about

178
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,120
mental activities kind of

179
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,000
that represent this divide between

180
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,360
becoming more closed

181
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,720
or more open and

182
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,520
and it's possible to cultivate each of

183
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,440
the seven factors awakening by itself

184
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,759
to be attuned to them and learn to

185
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,759
recognize them and support them

186
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,400
and it's also they they tend to grow in

187
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,759
the wake

188
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,800
of uh really emphasizing

189
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,080
mindfulness attention here but being

190
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,280
attentive

191
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,599
that the mindfulness whatever way we

192
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:58,879
practice it

193
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,520
in and of itself is not a closing

194
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,720
activity

195
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,360
that it hasn't uh there isn't some other

196
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,120
factors that come along with mindfulness

197
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,960
like striving or

198
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,199
or expectation or

199
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,639
pushing or contracting around the

200
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,759
mindfulness

201
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,599
that begins moving it in the direction

202
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,240
of the hindrances closing down

203
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,520
so this ability to track the mind state

204
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,280
allows us to be to protect the

205
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,560
mindfulness from

206
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,000
being hijacked that way and so we can

207
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,360
turn the mindfulness

208
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,440
now it's getting closed more as i try

209
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,000
hard and maybe i can find a way to be

210
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,640
more open

211
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,518
more relaxed and this simple movement

212
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,640
from

213
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,279
being more close to being more open but

214
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,200
yesterday i used the

215
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,720
for gail fransdel the technical terms

216
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,560
ouch and ah what involves more stress

217
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,680
or more suffering more discomfort

218
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,240
and what goes in the opposite direction

219
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,200
to be able to see

220
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,720
that simple divide is one of the primary

221
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,720
characteristics of the second factor of

222
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,000
awakening

223
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,480
as i said usually called investigation

224
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,360
but

225
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,320
is really a clarity of mind that sees

226
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,880
this

227
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,600
veil and sees this distinction between

228
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,440
the ouch and the ah

229
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,040
being closed and being open

230
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,040
becoming blind or lost in our

231
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,240
preoccupations

232
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,480
and opening up and having vision and and

233
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,680
clarity what's happening

234
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,279
so this is one of the great advantages

235
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,399
of beginning to tune into the mind state

236
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,519
and i as i said in the meditation it's

237
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,480
fascinating i

238
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,320
kind of said it's fascinating because

239
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,839
they're very valuable and even healing

240
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,320
because just being attentive to that

241
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,839
simple movement

242
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,399
can free us from having to get caught up

243
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:52,959
in

244
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,440
the details of what's happening uh

245
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,360
whether it's right or wrong or am i good

246
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,959
and bad person because of what i'm doing

247
00:09:58,959 --> 00:09:59,600
this way

248
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,120
and you can have the worst thought that

249
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,000
any

250
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,680
preoccupation that anybody has ever

251
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,399
happened in the history of humanity

252
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,440
and in this mind state thing it doesn't

253
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,880
really matter that it's the worst

254
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,399
thought anybody's ever had

255
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,079
it just matters that you recognize that

256
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,720
you closed down you got tight

257
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,320
and that there's an opportunity then

258
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,560
just to allow yourself to open

259
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,480
and not and just let it go let it kind

260
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,680
of recede

261
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,320
and move towards the openness of mind

262
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,920
and so that simple movement that's the

263
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,279
direction to go

264
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,040
can make the practice some ways much

265
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,560
simpler

266
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,079
and very forgiving

267
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,640
so the mind state and

268
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,800
so that's

269
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,519
what we're doing today and um

270
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,120
and we will continue tomorrow and then

271
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,160
starting on monday the idea is to go

272
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,880
through these seven factors awakening

273
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,120
and hopefully as we kind of linger in

274
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,800
this area of the mind state

275
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,680
it's such an important one and and then

276
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,120
we'll

277
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,040
go on from there and

278
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,320
so thank you very much and

279
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,839
i look forward to our time together

280
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,600
tomorrow
