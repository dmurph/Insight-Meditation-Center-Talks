42
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:56,479
alive whatever has happened before whatever is happening in this moment Letting Go

43
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:02,560
releasing Just Landing with the simplicity what the

44
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,759
Simplicity of this body breathing this miracle of this body

45
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,880
breathing letting go of thoughts plans stories me me

46
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:19,039
me what I got done what I didn't get done what they said what I said let go

47
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:28,120
let go let go oh dear mind dear heart it's endless it's endless but we can put it down and take

48
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:35,800
refuge so let's put it down together and take

49
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:54,560
refuge a moment of deep rest can only really

50
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:00,639
rest deeply rest when we put down

51
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:11,240
all the rigamarole of the stories in poly the word is papancha

52
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,599
papancha just proliferation of the Mind

53
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:22,599
proliferation putting it down putting it all down deep

54
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:31,280
rested and if you notice the mind has picked it up again put it down again gently lovingly

55
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:37,720
sweetheart there's no profit there's no benefit in picking it up right

56
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:44,080
now like a dog that keeps picking up a dry bone just keeps picking it up it's

57
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:52,720
so used to but it's Hollow the bone has no benefit no

58
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,319
nourishment put the dry bone down Dear

59
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:07,080
Heart deep rest an expression of care love

60
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,680
metap for

61
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,520
ourselves and for

62
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:26,240
others and helpful to connect with the breath in the body because when we put

63
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:35,840
the thoughts down it's helpful to have something something else to engage the mind the heart with the

64
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,639
idea is not to have a blank mind that's very hard that's not what this practice

65
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:48,680
is about but to connect with the breath with the Body Sensations the mind will become calm on

66
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:55,440
its own put it down put it down put it down

67
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:02,479

68
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,959
relaxing the body relaxing the mind the heart

69
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:08,680
connecting with the breath the relaxed body and put it down whatever Rises just put it down this is

70
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:15,720
a very simple practice release put it down gently lovingly

71
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,600
caringly can always pick it up later not

72
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
now

73
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
e

74
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320

75
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240

e e

77
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:31,040
and let yourself notice the subtle Delight

78
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:40,320
of putting it down the lightness that comes from releasing putting things down

79
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:47,920
the heart feels lighter notice maybe even a smile shows up on

80
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,199
your face

81
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:12,279
and always pick it up later we're just practicing training our mind to be able

82
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:19,560
to put things down not be slave a slave to thoughts and

83
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,160
ruminations but have more agency putting it down releasing Within

84
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,360
a

85
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
smile

86
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040

e e

90
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:56,279
and as you put down the ruminations thoughts plans maybe drop

91
00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:00,839
in into your heart into your body

92
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:13,480
a word like yes

93
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:20,558
yes a sense of openness to life to whatever is here right now

94
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:27,199
yes or maybe the word that you want to drop in not into your head but into your

95
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:33,360
heart is thank you thank you or just

96
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:40,640
thanks or gratitude see what is a word that feels like a wholesome seed to

97
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:48,200
plant in your heart in this moment when you've put everything else

98
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:54,240
down the busyness of the mind or maybe just

99
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,559
silence peace maybe the word is peace or EAS

102
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
silent

103
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720

104
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720

114
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:24,159
down put it down put it down empty empty empty yourself of thoughts and maybe

115
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:30,360
plant a word like peace as you breathe in and breathe

116
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320

as we turn to bring this sit to a close let go one last

122
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:51,600
time and rest let go and rest

123
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:08,279
or picking it up again later and trusting that we're planting

124
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:14,440
seeds of wholesomeness training our minds and hearts for the sake of ourselves and

125
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:22,480
others and learning how to let go release put down is a necessary

126
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,760
precursor to meta kindness for ourselves we need to make space

127
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:34,919
need to make space not just a precursor but this equivalent to kindness for

128
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:40,840
ourselves being kind putting down what's not

129
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:46,679
helpful at a given time the training some mind

130
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:54,640
training and trusting that our practice in ways we don't quite

131
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:01,519
understand supports not just ourselves but others all beings

132
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:09,559

00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:35,480
engagements you know papancha the proliferation down did you notice a sense of

170
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:40,760
lightness um did you plant a word would did that bring more lightness or not

171

and keep the order of going round and round please um and if at any time um

176
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:17,679
challenges arise perhaps in groups if you can practice with kindness and compassion for yourself and and the

177
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:25,919
other people in the group so so let's go uh let the uh order be

care welcome back everyone welcome back and um yeah we have a few minutes for

181
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:53,878
Reflections about your practice how the practice went perhaps how the groups

182
00:34:53,879 --> 00:35:01,920
went um and um yeah and how was your practice of of

183
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,520
showing up with kindness and compassion for one another and for yourselves

184
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:14,599
that's really what we're practicing here with one another with patience kindness

185
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:22,359
compassion Ser ni your hand is up thank you for allowing me to

186
00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:28,800
unmute I'm unmuted okay good then I'll lower my hand lower the

187
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:35,599
hand yeah you know I want some remedy for

188
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:43,680
papancha I think the papancha is a major is a major

189
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:49,880
hindrance and I don't I know in my own life

190
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:56,839
um you know uh and I don't think it helps much oh this papano does not help

191
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:02,079
much you know like like you have a thought about something or you need to do something and there's all this

192
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:09,119
thinking that goes on about it you know um I really would like to have more

193
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:14,599
freedom from papancha it would really make my life a lot less

194
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:21,400
painful and stressful yeah yeah thank you seren I

195
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:29,000
appreciate appreciate you clearly saying you know what what a relief it it would

196
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:37,240
be to have less Pancha because we know we have this proliferation and sometimes we feel like a prisoner um in the

197
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:43,599
prisoner of our own mind like a enough already please please can I just have some rest like sometimes it can feel

198
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:50,240
like that so so how do we go about it um and I also really appreciate this

199
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:59,119
this wholesome desire that you expressed I really would like to have more tools more more ways to have freedom from this

200
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:06,480
so it it is a training right it's a training like anything else it's a

201
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:12,720
training and um as the Buddha has said whatever you frequently Ponder and

202
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,880
reflect upon becomes to the inclination of your mind and in the western way you

203
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:24,480
know scientific way we talk about neuroplasticity you know if we keep thinking and ruminating about things

204
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:30,720
that becomes the pattern that becomes so so it it really is a mind training it

205
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:36,839
really comes back to a mind training and and the word Sati or

206
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:42,119
mindfulness the translation of it one translation is to remember so we just to

207
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:47,520
to keep remembering to keep remembering we find ourselves in the midst of the

208
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:52,800
papancha and to kindly remember okay sweetie it's all right let's put it down

209
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:59,359
let's put let's come back to the body let's come back to the mind and it does weak can it does the beauty of it is

210
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:05,599
that it works the beauty is that it does work uh both in the short term and in

211
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:13,599
the long term we're not um completely um um what's the word I'm

212
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:21,960
looking for um yeah we it's not like we're resourceless in in in in the face

213
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:28,760
of it that it's really a pattern are the patterns of our minds in in small moments big moments we just have to keep

214
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:36,040
doing it over and over and over and over again in in small and big ways it's like

215
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:42,240
the feather weight that's the other thing I would say it's really important to apply a feather weight because if we

216
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:48,880
try to hammer like stop a buncha then it becomes a a fight with ourselves but

217
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:56,160
just ever so gently that's where meta comes in it was this gentleness of okay let's come back this is not helpful this

218
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:03,280
is not helpful do you really want to be thinking about this right now sweetie no it's not helpful so keep keep coming

219
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:09,760
back keep coming back and I promise you it works that's it that's the word I was looking for helpless thank you Megan

220
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:15,599
thanks for helping me out we're not helpless that's it we're not helpless um

221
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:21,040
and it works it does work otherwise we wouldn't be practicing this it works

222
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:28,160
Serena so I really appreciate your wholesome desire so hold on to that wholesome desire because that intention

223
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:35,440
really will keep you practicing in this way and and it works it does work I can

224
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:41,280
tell you that that it's worked for me I for many many students practitioners it

225
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:49,359
works over time it does work it does work so thank you so much for bringing that up thank

226
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:56,839
you Mari Christine I see your head hi Nikki I just wanted to ask you

227
00:39:56,839 --> 00:40:04,880
sp punch of the same as monkey mind um not exactly there's slight

228
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:14,119
differences so um so the idea of monkey mind is the nature of Mind tends to jump

229
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:20,280
from one topic to another so monkey mind refers to the nature of mind that but

230
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:25,960
papancha is the word for proliferation itself so it's not the nature of mind

231
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:34,400
but it's the word for proliferation so so maybe the better way to relate to them is monkey mind likes to get lost in

232
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:41,720
the forest of proliferation how is that yeah thanks Mary

233
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:48,960
Christie I love that word when I learned papancha years and years ago

234
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,160
um as I said I just love the the sound of a panja it seemed like there would be

235
00:40:54,160 --> 00:41:00,040
times when my mind was proliferating panja this thought and that thought and this and that's like

236
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:07,400
whoa uh it's it's a near cousin of overwhelm but not necessarily always so

237
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:15,000
papancha any other Reflections practice reports reports

238
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,319
from the field maybe I'll ask you did um when I was guiding you and inviting you

239
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:26,319
to put down to put down it uh and and then to turn after a few minutes I

240
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:33,839
invited you to T into perhaps a lightness was there lightness or Delight like yeah this ah this feels nice it

241
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:40,680
feels a little lighter did anybody experience that yeah I see some people waving I see Richard waving Richard do

242
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:46,839
you want to unmute is that and I see p Petro also waving I have two different

243
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:54,800
screens yes there yeah yeah and hanova says yes to so

244
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:01,680
raise your Zoom hand because it's really hard for me uh for to anyway oh there's Petra okay here we

245
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:08,680
go as to unmute yeah thank you Nikki I noticed

246
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:15,599
how wasn't a practice of subtracting that's how I felt you know you're just subtracting from your experience in some

247
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:21,240
degrees like no don't go there put it down and and the more the more you did

248
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:28,359
it I need I really no it's like wow it's already fairly quiet here and pleasant

249
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:34,920
uh so in a sense you don't have to create the pleasantness or the quiet it was just like um a practice of

250
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:41,599
subtraction you just subtract the prancha and the quiet is already there so that's uh that was my that was my

251
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:48,839
experience definitely there that's great I love that thank I love how you described the Petro as as a practice of

252
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:54,079
subtraction When You Subtract all the papon put it like ah it's quite quite

253
00:42:54,079 --> 00:43:02,000
sweet here this is quite sweet it's Pleasant it's peace you don't even have to perhaps plant the um you know the

254
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:08,440
words that I suggested like peace or yes or thank you it's like yeah this is pretty good here I can hang out here and

255
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:16,040
and and also what I highlight is what's really important in this practice is putting things down with gentleness with

256
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:21,559
kindness you don't want to throw things down with hatred or frustration like

257
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:30,400
stop like it's like oh sweetheart I don't it's okay I'm just gonna put you that is the key if you throw them and I

258
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:35,440
know you didn't raise this P but I'm just using this as a teaching moment because I really want to emphasize this

259
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:41,280
that putting things down with gentleness and Care is where this ease comes up like yeah this is pretty sweet this

260
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:48,319
feels pretty sweet so thank you appreciate your reflection

261
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:55,960
clear thank you Nikki I don't know if this is is useful or not I use a

262
00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:03,319
technique that's different than the one you're describing I don't put things down I was trained at a Zeno many years

263
00:44:03,319 --> 00:44:08,839
ago to start by picking an object or an

264
00:44:08,839 --> 00:44:14,040
idea that I want to focus on you know say a

265
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:21,839
rose and I picture the rose and then of course my mind W wanders off into Poncha

266
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:27,119
but my assignment is to go back to the roads and I just keep going back and

267
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:33,559
little by slowly my mind stays there and everything there's no no no action going

268
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:38,960
on anymore yeah yeah yeah to yeah so so Claire there are lots of different

269
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:46,599
practices lots of different practices in Buddhism lots of them and this putting down to release is one of them oh yeah

270
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:52,760
and going back to the object is another one so so um and I appreciate the practice you're doing but and I want to

271
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:59,760
keep tonight with this practice the practice of putting down a subtraction thank you

272
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:05,960
okay great and let's see oh yes and adelus is to be honest I felt the

273
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:14,520
imprint of what I just put down perhaps those underlying feelings needed some care um yes thank you for raising that

274
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:22,079
Adelia um if if there are strong emotions and it's not just just papancha

275
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:29,160
just thoughts like the usual but but there's some emotion that needs care yes and putting them down may

276
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:35,400
not be the appropriate thing to do so caring for them is the appropriate thing to do it's so I appreciate the the

277
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:41,040
wisdom that you raised there absolutely great was there another hand

278
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:46,440
that I think I saw are we complete Richard you keep waving your hand but I

279
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:52,839
don't see you [Music]

280
00:45:52,839 --> 00:45:58,319
um let's see Megan okay I'm going to oh there's I

281
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:05,119
see Megan sorry I there you are Megan okay hi dicki thank you so much for this

282
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:10,200
practice um I I think possibly you answered the question with adilia

283
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:15,559
because um when I put everything down um

284
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:21,400
I felt incredible anger

285
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:27,480
um and that felt

286
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:34,119
true it didn't feel like rumination it felt true and and I also just not really

287
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:39,960
sure how to take care of anger but maybe that's a question for another time yeah

288
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:47,079
I appreciate that wonderful so very um wonderful that uh you you bring this

289
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:53,359
forth because this is this is what can happen when when we put other things down perhaps then the clarity of oh yeah

290
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:59,800
this needs care oh there's anger or there's sadness or there's something else here that needs care and that

291
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:06,880
becomes clear which is which is great so and then working with anger uh very

292
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:13,079
briefly um allow the energy of it to move through not to be stuck with the

293
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:20,680
story and the thought but with um but but let yourself turn towards the energy

294
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:29,599
let it let it move through let it move Let It Be experienced not necessarily acted out on upon but let it let it move

295
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:36,720
through yes sweetheart and then bring compassion to it different ways to work with it but here in this container

296
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:44,760
working with it with confessional sweetheart this is painful this is hard because anger is like picking up

297
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:51,760
hot a hot coal to throw at someone who gets hurt hurt first you do it's like oh

298
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:57,359
sweetie this is painful this is hard so caring for the emotion and then later

299
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:03,040
allowing um the wise action to arise but really taking care of the emotion yeah

300
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:09,359
thank you and Richard I do see you you you showed up on my pan pain which is very

301
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:15,520
small okay I'm going to ask you to unmute yourself there okay I just want to

302
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:24,240
mention is that I I found myself thinking of a of putting of Letting Go

303
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:32,440
would would trigger defense that I was worried that I could be putting myself in danger if I drops things I I didn't

304
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:39,119
expect that reaction to your uh directions but that's that was very

305
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:44,760
surprising for me that I considered it as putting myself in physical danger if

306
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:52,480
I just dropped all my defenses oh interesting yeah yeah that um that's

307
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:57,680
very interesting and also I appreciate that Richard you said it was surprising to you

308
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:03,680
that you didn't expect that and and you know and also I want to point out to you

309
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:08,880
that you know putting down thoughts or papancha is not

310
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:14,200
exactly the same as putting down defenses so the mind already took a leap

311
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:20,079
to put down Def fenses and then felt uh Jarred so that's very interesting that's

312
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:25,400
very H to have compassion with curiosity oh sweetheart what's happening here

313
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:30,920
what's happening here so I invite you to have more curiosity about that leap that

314
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:36,200
your mind and heart took from putting down thoughts to putting down defenses

315
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:43,520
and then feeling feeling the rejection of no there's something there that needs care um so that's what I invite you to

316
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:50,640
sit with and and practice with curiosity where was was there a time when you felt

317
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:58,319
unsafe um and and this suggestion is is is putting

318
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:03,839
is catapulting the mind to that area whereas it's just about putting down

319
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:10,559
thoughts not about putting down defenses right you see the difference you hear the difference right sure does that make

320
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:15,760
sense to have some curiosity about this for yourself I it's definitely a very

321
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:20,839
intriguing kind of thing that came up yeah yeah I mean because these because I

322
00:50:20,839 --> 00:50:25,960
consider myself as a person who's not that defensive and more open yet there

323
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:32,520
must be some level down there of there are limits to my openness right oh my

324
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:39,280
goodness this is so great Richard I so appreciate your curiosity and openness in this like w this is interesting this
